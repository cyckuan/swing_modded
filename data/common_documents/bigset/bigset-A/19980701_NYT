   HONGKONG-ANNIVERSARY (Hong Kong) _ His hometown is marking the
first anniversary of its return to China on July 1, but Loon
Wai-ting is in no mood to celebrate. Loon has spent the year
without a job. Of course, Britain's exit from Hong Kong has had
little to do with the economic downturn of its former colony, but
Loon speaks for many Hong Kong people, who are being ravaged by
rising unemployment, a 20 percent drop in the stock market, and a
40 percent decline in the property market. By Mark Landler.

   FRENCH-GENDER (Paris) _ You say ``Madame le ministre,'' I say
``Madame la ministre,'' the French government decreed on Monday.
Let's call the whole thing off, the Academie Francaise thundered on
Tuesday. The French Academy, a male bastion founded by Cardinal
Richelieu in 1635, is positively beside itself about proposals like
making ``ministre,'' which is a masculine noun, feminine when the
minister in question is a woman. By Craig R. Whitney.

McVeigh never confided any plans to his family, he could not hide
his feelings, so much so that his father and sister suspected right
after the 1995 blast that he had been responsible. But the McVeigh

distinguish themselves from a lengthening list of competitors by

and made in Havana by 80- and 90-year-olds singing a gentle,

   SPAIN-PHILIP-III (San Lorenzo de el Escorial, Spain) _ King
Philip II not only lost the Invincible Armada in 1588 while trying
to invade England, but he also sunk in most history books as the
epitome of cruelty and intolerance associated with imperial Spain.
But now, on the 400th anniversary of his death, the government has
organized three major art exhibitions to portray a different side
of Philip, as a renaissance connoisseur of art and literature, a

family man.

coastline. They would have to abandon their magnificent fruits and
vegetables, superb cheeses and foie gras, prize-winning olive oil,
succulent lamb and pristine oysters. They would have to leave the
low-key atmosphere that attracts fascinating (some would say
eccentric) characters. And, of course, they would have to give up
bragging rights on those Sonoma pinot noirs and chardonnays, wines
they would put up against Napa's any day. By Marian Burros.

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ To this day, the winnowing process from his
own youth still gnaws at him: how he was able to make it, while so
many equally intelligent peers who grew up in less nurturing
environments could not.
</P>
<P>
   That memory informed the educational model that made James Comer
one of the most celebrated school innovators of his time: his
approach begins and ends with the notion that, rather than
intelligence and will, the experiences children have growing up,
good and bad, determine who wins and loses in school and life.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this should be James Comer's moment, with
education near the top of the national agenda and a White House
passionately committed to his view of it. He is a hero to many
education advocates, not the least of them Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who introduced him at a recent tribute and symposium at the Yale
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   They were there to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his School
Development Program, a nonprofit project of the Child Study Center
at the Yale Medical School that advises schools on the use of his
theories.
</P>
<P>
   But at 63, Comer (pronounced KOH-mer) finds himself not so much
a symbol of how education has changed as a marker of where the
fault lines are drawn. He is one of the most consistent critics of
the ascendant countermodels for school reform: tougher standards,
high-stakes tests and experiments with privatization or vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   For all the success of his approach, which is used in more than
450 schools in 17 states and several foreign countries, Comer is at
least as aware of the winds blowing away from him as the ones
wafting in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, my voice has been heard, and I have had some
influence,'' he said, reflecting on his career at his office at the
Yale Medical School, where he is associate dean and a professor of
child psychiatry. ``But in the one area that's most critical, the
role of child development, people are still not paying attention.
Our moment is going to come, but right now most of the attention
seems to be on things like charters and vouchers that don't do
anything for the vast majority of children.''
</P>
<P>
   Few educators have looked so hard and long at how children's
lives relate to educational achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it was a major field of study, Dr. Comer recognized
that learning in school, before school and after school is tied to
a child's level of development,'' Mrs. Clinton said in her
introductory remarks. ``Before charter schools or magnet schools
became household words, Dr. Comer was busy designing schools in
which parents were involved in everything from curricular
development to social activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Comer's education model centers on the idea that many children,
minority-group children in particular, struggle in school because
their level of social, intellectual and cultural development is far
behind that of more affluent students.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, he says, have to focus on the developmental needs of
children, or even the best teachers and most sophisticated
curriculum will not be effective. That means bringing counselors,
psychologists, parents and others into the learning process _
rather than just depending on teachers _ and tailoring lessons to a
child's background.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Isadore Wexler Community School in inner-city
New Haven, one school Comer works with, Shelia Brantley
incorporates child development into her third-grade reading
curriculum. Thus, the program is not just about reading. It might
include a trip to the supermarket so students who have never seen
an avocado can learn what the word means, a lesson suburban
children might not need.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions are predicated on the children's learning to
communicate complex thoughts and ideas they might not be exposed to
at home. And the whole teaching and learning experience is based on
social skills _ listening, sharing information, expressing clear
points of view _ that transcend the individual lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The schools Comer works with are organized around three
principles: problem solving rather than blaming; consensus
decision-making, and collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it sounds uncontroversial. But Comer's program begins
with the unfashionable idea that in a country of growing
disparities between the haves and have nots, education has to begin
by addressing the disparate needs and backgrounds of children so
they can learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my friends in education still begin by talking curriculum
and instruction,'' he said. ``All those things are important, but
where's the kid? What's the kid like? What's going on with the kid?
All of American education has left the development of the child out
of it. We may pay it lip service, but for a whole number of
reasons, the needs of the kid get ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   His perspective in many ways goes against the ingrained American
belief that each individual can determine his or her own destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest problem with education is we see learning as a
function of intelligence and will,'' he said. ``If you have the
intelligence and will, you will learn. If you don't, you won't.
Well, it's not that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics, particularly advocates of vouchers, charter schools
and tougher standards and tests, Comer's agenda, while well
meaning, is not systematic enough to create real change in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a soft kind of model that's very Clintonesque,'' said
Chester Finn, a prominent education analyst and a senior fellow at
the Hudson Institute. ``It says things a lot of educators find
appealing, but I'm not persuaded that it can be counted on to
produce improved student achievement. It doesn't change the power.
It doesn't change the control of resources.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't change the ground rules. It doesn't change who's in
charge. It doesn't change what we mean by a public school, and it
doesn't have the combination of uniform standards, tests and
consequences I believe you need for real change.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that there were approaches other than Comer's richly
empathetic model to help inner-city students. He cited the ideas of
Thaddeus Lott, a Houston principal recently profiled in Policy
Review magazine who uses ability grouping, intensive drill, rote
learning and other traditional teaching methods to extraordinary
result at his Wesley Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Comer is singularly unimpressed by most of the ideas advocated
by Finn and others. Unlike some educators, who see charter schools
as a way to develop distinctive, innovative schools, he sees them
as little different from voucher proposals that he thinks would
skim off the best students, leaving most to fester in schools that
have been largely written off.
</P>
<P>
   Comer likes to cite his life story as a microcosm of his view of
education. His mother grew up poor in Mississippi, with little
formal schooling but a passionate belief in the importance of
education. His father, a steel mill laborer, grew up in rural
Alabama with a sixth-grade education. Their five children went on
to earn 13 bachelor's and graduate degrees between them.
</P>
<P>
   Comer grew up in East Chicago, Ind., in an integrated
neighborhood with integrated schools. He may have been poorer than
some of his white classmates, but his parents were able to
inculcate the values, attitudes and discipline that he believes
allowed him to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   It taught him two lessons. The first was that education was the
key to success and was open to everyone. The second was that
influences on children mean more for their chances of success than
does innate intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Comer received his undergraduate degree from Indiana University
and his medical degree from Howard University. But his work with
poor communities soon convinced him he could have the most impact
by working with schools.
</P>
<P>
   Like proponents of most reform models, he can provide research
showing dramatically improved results, like the McLeansville Middle
School in Guilford County, N.C., where the percentage of eighth
graders reading at a competent level rose from 65 to 85 between
1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But he says that of the schools he has worked with, only about a
third had dramatic results, a third showed some modest improvement
and a third were little changed.
</P>
<P>
   But all in all, he says, those are pretty good results.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play baseball those results will put you in the Hall of
Fame, and this game's tougher than baseball,'' he said. ``You're
working against the very undesirable condition of the society:
racism, economic adversity, social marginalization, the effects on
parents and teachers of dealing with kids who people believe have
no future. That's what schools serving low-income and minority kids
are always up against. You bat .333 against that, and you feel
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Comer has handed off much of the daily operation of the program
to others, like the executive director, Edward T. Joyner. But he is
not slowing down. He continues to expand his activities.
</P>
<P>
   He now works with districts as well as individual schools. He
has joined Project Atlas, a new effort in which a consortium of
theorists advises schools on a range of issues. The consultants are
Comer; Theodore Sizer, the retired head of the Coalition for
Essential Schools; Howard Gardner, the Harvard education theorist,
and Janet Whitlaw of the Education Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   Schools can tap parts of all four theorists' approaches. These
include Comer's ideas on how to draw diverse influences into a
school's daily life; Gardner's on tests and student assessments;
Sizer's on approaches to learning and curriculum, and Ms. Whitlaw's
on teacher preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Comer began his work with the idea that education reform was a
long, slow struggle. Nothing in his career has led him to think
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentality of the moment is to look for the quick fix,'' he
said. ``But if we try to gloss over the depth, severity and
difficulty of the problems, we will never address the depth,
severity and difficulty of the problems.''

UNITED WAY OF TRI-STATE SEES FUND-RAISING SURGE AFTER 6-YEAR SLIDE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  (nk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reversing years of declining support, United Way of
Tri-State will report Tuesday that it raised $103 million in the
last year, up 4.5 percent over the previous year after adjusting
for inflation, the first real increase this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The growth is the first since United Way of America was rocked
by a scandal six years ago that sent its president to prison for
stealing charity funds and the local United Ways saw their support
drop.
</P>
<P>
   Donations have also suffered from downsizing at major
corporations, slow wage growth and less interest in giving to
health and human services agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the increase, contributions by the 137 large companies
and their workers in the New York metropolitan region that give
through Tri-State is still 15 percent below the 1991-92 figure,
when pledges totaled $121.4 million, adjusted for inflation as are
all figures reported here.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in pledges should translate into small increases in
allocations in the next 12 months to many of the health and human
services agencies that depend on United Way for support.
</P>
<P>
   Typically about 6 percent of pledges are not fulfilled, often
because people switch jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Tri-State is the largest of the 1,300 United Ways, but is little
known because it does not directly allocate money to agencies.
Instead, Tri-State divides the money it raises among 30 local
United Ways in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with 41.5
percent of the money going to United Way of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Wendt, chairman of the 1997-98 Tri-State campaign, noted
that the 4.5 percent increase in pledges is significantly higher
than the 3 percent average increase reported so far by 11 other
large United Ways across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt said he would like to see an increase in giving by the
high-income residents of New York City, including those employed on
Wall Street, where bonus checks are booming but giving through the
United Way is modest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wendt pointed to one investment bank that was generous, Merrill
Lynch, ``which had more $10,000 givers than any other company in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendt, the chief executive of GE Capital, a financial subsidiary
of General Electric Corporation based in Stamford, Conn., set a
goal for his company and its employees of $1.35 million, 20 percent
above the previous year. Pledges exceeded the goal at $1.43
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Tri-State results, and the preliminary figures from the New
York City campaign, indicate that the federated fund-raising
organization is doing much better at winning support here than in
the nation's second- and third-largest metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, United Way Inc. in Los Angeles reported
pledges of $59 million, up a half of 1 percent over last fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Giving to the United Way serving Los Angeles County is still 46
percent below its peak seven years ago, when pledges totaled $108.8
million, and has been essentially flat since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Donors may have been turned off this year by a radio advertising
campaign that chided Los Angeles residents for spending money on
breast implants and caffe lattes, but not on gifts to United Way.
</P>
<P>
   In Ventura County, a booming area northwest of Los Angeles,
allocations to 59 member agencies had to be slashed 30 percent in
May because United Way of Ventura County's deficit had grown to
$1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts came on top of a 7.5 percent cut the previous
September.
</P>
<P>
   In the third-largest city, the Chicago United Way/Crusade of
Mercy raised $95.1 million, up 3 percent from the previous year,
but still 22 percent below its $121.8 million peak six years ago.

TAXI FLEETS FIGHT NEW RULES, BUT FIND INFLUENCE EBBING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER DREW and ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As City Councilman Noach Dear geared up last fall to
run for Congress, a group of taxi executives wrote a letter to its
members urging them to contribute generously to ``our good
friend,'' saying that without Dear's help, ``our taxi industry
might not exist today as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Dear held a fund-raising dinner two weeks ago, many
taxi and livery owners stayed away, fuming that the Brooklyn
Democrat had all but abandoned them in their time of need.
</P>
<P>
   As the owners of yellow cabs and car services fight to reverse
tough new safety standards imposed by the Giuliani administration,
they have found that the political might they built with generous
campaign contributions and powerful lobbyists has waned.
</P>
<P>
   With taxi accidents having increased by 40 percent since 1990,
taxi safety has attracted a rare amount of public attention, making
it more risky for politicians such as Dear, chairman of the City
Council Transportation Committee, to defend the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's best hope now lies in court, where it is
challenging the regulations, which include sharply higher insurance
requirements and more severe penalties for bad drivers. A state
judge has indicated that he might nullify the rules as early as
this week because, he said, the Taxi and Limousine Commission
violated state open-meeting laws when it approved the rules in May.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry's declining influence could be temporary _
the result of public attention to recent accidents and electoral
politics _ it is hurting taxi owners' ability to respond to Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani. Since Giuliani proposed the new regulations in
April, Dear has declined even to hold a hearing for the owners to
air their complaints, much less help them combat the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the industry is disappointed in the City Council in
general,'' said Neil Greenbaum, a medallion broker who helped form
the New York City Committee for Taxi Safety, a top industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Dear, whose committee oversees the taxi industry, has been its
most visible champion. An analysis of campaign finance records
shows that he has banked $170,000 in donations over the last five
years from taxi and livery interests, including tens of thousands
of dollars that came in just as he took steps to help the industry.
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who is running for
governor, and his political organizations have gathered more than
$55,000 over the same period from people affiliated with taxi
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But both Dear and Vallone are caught up in their own political
races at a time when cabbies are not especially popular. Dear is
also seeking the mayor's endorsement in the hotly contested race to
succeed Rep. Charles Schumer _ who is seeking the Democratic
nomination for the U.S. Senate _ and taxi executives complain that
Dear will not do anything to jeopardize that support.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum and his family have contributed $18,000 to Dear's
races since 1993, and his group sent out the fund-raising appeal
for Dear last fall. But, Greenbaum said last week, ``I don't know
if we can count on him as much as before.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear said he tried to mediate between the mayor and the industry
to ``help save havoc'' when taxi drivers were holding
demonstrations last month, but he was forced to back off by some of
the most vehement driver groups.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the campaign donations, he said, ``My support for
the industry or against the industry is not based on who supports
me or who doesn't support me.'' He added, ``I am no one's stooge,''
and said that he supports some, but not all, of the new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel F. Del Valle, a former Taxi and Limousine Commission
chairman who is now a lawyer for a coalition of car-service owners,
said he believed that ``the problem that the industry really has
goes beyond politics and is partly just public relations'' on
safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have an image problem they've been ignoring,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Del Valle also said that some taxi executives were incensed that
Giuliani, who got $50,000 from the industry in his re-election
campaign last year, would go after them so hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these guys are really Republicans who supported
Giuliani,'' Del Valle said. ``They gave him their support because
he was for law and order and he'd make the `bums' on welfare go to
work. So they are in a state of shock that he is coming after them.
They've found that their vision of who the bums are _ and
Giuliani's _ didn't quite jibe.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear, 44, is widely known as one of the Council's most
aggressive fund-raisers, and also was a top national fund-raiser
for President Clinton's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   City records show that Dear has often accepted donations from
businesses that his committee regulates, including bus companies
and tow-truck operators. Taxi and livery interests have been
particularly generous, donating $90,000 to his City Council
campaigns since mid-1993 and about $80,000 of the $1.2 million he
has raised for his current House race.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the donations, Dear said there have been a number of
times when his actions upset parts of the taxi industry. He noted
that he endorsed Giuliani's sale of 400 new medallions, approved in
1996, and fought for more taxi inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also stood up for taxi owners. For instance, when the
taxi commission passed a rule in 1996 requiring medallion owners to
buy new cars every four years at most, Greenbaum's group appealed
to Dear. He responded quickly, introducing a bill to prohibit the
commission from disqualifying a taxi based on its age or prior use.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, records show, Greenbaum and other taxi
executives contributed more than $15,000 to Dear, who said his goal
was simply to ``help the small car owners, the mom-and-pop guys''
who could not afford new cars.
</P>
<P>
   The commission eventually agreed to let independently owned cabs
stay on the road for five years instead of four and made other
concessions that saved the owners an estimated $20 million. ``He
made it livable,'' Greenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum and Andrew Murstein, Alvin Murstein's son, were among
the sponsors of a June 17 fund-raising dinner. Giuliani was the
featured speaker, and industry executives said they had to scramble
to find fewer than a dozen taxi owners who were willing to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say their contributions are not bringing results,''
Andrew Murstein said. ``It just shows that money helps you buy
access, not results.''

BLUE JAYS DEFEAT METS, 6-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ There is no good time to have a bad outing. But in
Rick Reed's case, this was a particularly bad time.
</P>
<P>
   Reed's manager, Bobby Valentine, made a special plea on Tuesday
during a pair of telephone conversations with Manager Jim Leyland
of the Florida Marlins on behalf of two New York Mets pitchers
Valentine badly wants Leyland to name to his National League staff
for next week's All-Star Game: Reed and John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately _ for Reed, for his manager and for the Mets _
Reed had one of his worst outings of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander's strength is his precision. But on Tuesday
night, he kept getting his pitches up. In four innings against the
Blue Jays at Skydome, Reed allowed nine hits and six runs,
including a career-high four home runs, all with two out.
Meanwhile, Toronto's right-hander Roger Clemens struck out 11 Mets
and limited them to 6 hits over 141 pitches as the Blue Jays won,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Valentine _ who also made a strong case for
his closer, Franco _ had tried to assure Leyland that Reed could
pitch an inning next Tuesday in Denver, even though he is scheduled
to start in Atlanta on Sunday, the final day before the All-Star
Game break.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed (9-5), so reliable for the Mets this year, was barely
able to make it through four innings on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could find a hole, you'd want to crawl in it,'' Reed
said. ``But there aren't any holes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Except the ones Reed dug for himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was staked to a 1-0 lead in the second inning on John
Olerud's second triple of the season and Bernard Gilkey's
run-scoring groundout. The two triples matched a season high for
the 29-year-old first baseman, who was making his first appearance
here since spending the first eight seasons of his career with the
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud was not in the original lineup, but was inserted after
Matt Franco fouled a pitch off the fourth toe on his right foot
during batting practice and took himself out of the lineup. X-rays
showed the toe was broken, and Franco could be placed on the
disabled list Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' run in the second was all they got off Clemens (9-6)
until Brian McRae drilled his fourth home run in eight games, with
one aboard in the seventh. That made it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Reed was long gone. He had surrendered just 6 home
runs in 109 innings this season before Darrin Fletcher drilled a
408-foot, two-run shot in the second to give Toronto a 2-1 lead.
Then Jose Canseco (the 375th of his career) and Carlos Delgado hit
back-to-back blasts in the third, and Alex Gonzalez unloaded with a
runner on in the fourth to give Clemens a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Not since April 9, Reed's second start of the season, had he
allowed so many runs or pitched fewer than six innings in a start.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of winning his 10th game and enriching his All-Star
credentials, Reed saw his 2.31 earned run average rise to 2.71.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched like an All-Star for me,'' Valentine said. ``He
had a bad night. He just had one of those nights. He threw a couple
of curveballs, and they ended up in the seats.''

SUDDENLY SAMMY

   By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO - The greatest month ever has come to an end, and just
like that, Sammy Sosa has joined the ghostbusters. Another
candidate, another face for the microscope, another slugger
enlisted to chase down Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   No. 33 disappeared Tuesday night, deep into the Wrigley Field
bleachers, halting a minor drought and rekindling the imagination.
Maybe it won't be Paul Bunyan in St. Louis or Junior launching
bombs up in that user-friendly garage in Seattle. Maybe history
will belong to the smiling Cub who pounds his chest and blows
kisses to the fans, a kid who didn't pick up a bat until he was 14
and now looks like Roberto Clemente on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa smiles. Already, he is getting a little squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only guy who can break the mark is Mark McGwire,'' Sosa
said. ``He's the man. I'm just another kid trying to play good.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Sosa sat at his locker, unwrapping gifts,
fully aware that no other man has ever posted a freak streak like
this. He is finishing up an unprecedented barrage, a month where
he's turned 20 baseballs into souvenirs. And as he peers at his
latest Player of the Week bounty _ the second Bulova watch he's
received in 14 days _ he is getting a whiff of the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the air can get pretty thin when you're flying after
legends. McGwire has become edgy over the circus tent of batting
practice. Ken Griffey Jr. won't partake in the All Star Game's
longball contest, fearing it will throw his swing out of whack. And
as Sosa keeps up an improbable pace, he is staring at his watch,
hoping he can suspend time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't try to compare me to anyone,'' Sosa pleaded. ``If I
start listening to all that stuff, it might take me out of my plan.
We've got three more months. I've got to keep going strong.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Sosa is seduced by the attention, tantalized by the
challenge. And there is little doubt he can make a strong push if
the pressure doesn't smother him first.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sosa homered 40 times in 124 games. The following
spring training, he hit bombs with such regularity that he was
asked about the prospect of 60 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty?'' Sosa answered. ``Why not 70?''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's breakthrough season, it seems, was simply delayed. Last
year, the Cubs roared to an 0-14 start, and Sosa was exposed in a
lineup with little protection. He was distracted by contract
negotiations, which finally resulted in a four-year, $42.5 million
extension. And while he finished respectably, the season was a
wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time up,'' Sosa said. ``I was trying to hit two home runs
with one swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sosa has reached the halfway point in staggering fashion.
Aside from McGwire, no other National Leaguer has reached 30 home
runs by July 1. Since May 25, he has hit 10 home runs in a
nine-game span . . . twice.
</P>
<P>
   With another hot streak, Sosa could easily produce 29 home runs
in his final 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   But for a kid who once worked for $4 a day selling orange juice,
cleaning shoes and washing cars in the Dominican Republic, the
spotlight is getting a little warm.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he told a Nike representative he didn't like his new
batting gloves, requesting the old model he wore out during his
torrid streak. The Nike rep smiled, unwilling to tell Sosa the old
model has been out of date for a year. He was so desperate to keep
the flame burning that he's been experimenting with different bats,
the latest belonging to pitcher Mark Clark.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed with his latest missile, and clearly, Sosa's
streaky nature could work for him as much as it does against him.
He has 35 more games at Wrigley Field, nine more against
Diamondbacks pitching and a four-game set on tap in Colorado. Harry
Caray is in heaven, the Cubs are overdue for some good karma and
Sosa has the tools to make it interesting in September.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Sosa is ready for some elite company. A few months ago,
the president of the Dominican Republic asked Sosa if he could talk
Michael Jordan into a little visit. Armed with a video of his
homeland, Sosa approached Jordan, and the global icon actually
seems interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got everything ready, and I've got hope that he's going
to do it,'' Sosa said. ``I'll play golf if he wants. But I'm not
any good. I practiced once and hit everything foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his day job, where for one magical month, everything has
been straight and long and out of reach. And with some luck, maybe
he'll be the man of history, a man who won't need Jordan to boost
the native morale. &QL;

SATURN, GM RULE ROOST IN J.D. POWER STUDY OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Having seemingly mastered the low-pressure sale,
dealers for General Motors' Saturn unit once again topped J.D.
Power and Associates' annual customer sales satisfaction survey.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, GM dominated the 1998 survey, with six of the company's
brands registering above average. Ford also placed well, with four
of its brands making the top 20.
</P>
<P>
   The J.D. Power survey questioned new-car buyers on things such
as whether they felt pressured to buy a car while at a dealership,
whether the price negotiation was straightforward, and if the
dealer kept all the promises made in the negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn's top placement notwithstanding, what the 1998 survey
revealed is that for the best sales experience, customers should be
prepared to spend a lot of money. From No. 2 Cadillac through No.
10 Infiniti, customers ranked the luxury sedan makers tops in
closing the deal with a minimum of stress.
</P>
<P>
   Filling out the top 10 were Lexus, Land Rover, Volvo, BMW,
Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz and Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   While much of a customer's satisfaction in years past stemmed
from whether the car he or she bought was problem-free on delivery,
``expectations are changing,'' said Loretta Seymour, director of
sales satisfaction at J.D. Power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today buyers expect that the car is going to be in good
condition,'' she said. ``What's important to making customers
delighted with a dealer are consistency in the process and that the
(transaction is) hassle-free.''
</P>
<P>
   As in years past, discrepancies emerged on the list, with
separate brands sold by the same manufacturer ranked at opposite
ends of the spectrum. Just as the otherwise low-ranking Toyota
found its luxury Lexus line well-placed at No. 3, GM's GMC brand
fell to below average in customer sales satisfaction. Similarly,
despite Infiniti's success, Nissan dealers overall ranked below
average.
</P>
<P>
   The big loser in this year's ranking was Chrysler, whose Dodge,
Jeep and Plymouth brand dealers all ranked low. The Chrysler brand
itself, however, came in at No. 15, up from a below-average ranking
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there's a good reason for that'' discrepancy
between brands, said Chrysler spokesman Jeff Leestma.
</P>
<P>
   He said the overall trend in the auto industry is for improved
sales satisfaction, so that while Chrysler dealers have over the
years improved the job they're doing, the bar continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``These surveys show relatively how you rank vs. your
competitors,'' Leestma said. Chrysler's internal quality-control
measures focus on the ``total ownership experience'' it delivers
customers, independent of what the competition is up to, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler, Toyota and Nissan all said they have recently
instituted companywide changes in how dealers are trained, with an
eye toward improving customer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't solely the fault of dealers,'' Leestma said. ``As
companies, we need to give dealers the tools they need to serve the
customer. We all agree we can improve.''

GM WORKERS EXPECTED A MUCH BETTER VACATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 12th graf for updating on strike vote)  (nk) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ The way Ryan Garland sees it, the two strikes
here that have shut down the General Motors Corp. and put his
father out of work are a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Before tensions erupted and 9,200 workers walked off their jobs,
the 10-year-old boy mostly fantasized about spending uninterrupted
days with his father, Dean. But now they are inseparable, their
twin smiles so bright that the two often seem out of place among
the throngs of more serious-looking strikers picketing outside the
sprawling stamping factory where the walkout began on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything together,'' Ryan said while holding a
picket sign and counting down the minutes before he and his dad
head to a local park. Their days are filled with water-skiing, boat
rides and intense father-son basketball games. ``We didn't have a
lot before. My dad was always working or sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his son, Garland talks quietly about his days with Ryan,
low enough to avoid stares from other strikers. After all, this was
supposed to have been the first week of a paid company-wide
two-week shutdown, a time that most GM workers set aside for family
outings and vacations. Now, only the company's salaried workers
will be paid for the time off.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes have already idled virtually all of GM's hourly
employees _ 162,700 as of Tuesday. Twenty-six of the automaker's 29
North American assembly factories are closed. GM said on Tuesday
that the strikes would cost the company $1.18 billion after taxes
in the second quarter. Most of that resulted from a loss of $890
million at GM's North American operations, the company said.
Delphi, GM's large auto parts subsidiary, lost $290 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad saying this, but I'm enjoying myself. It's like a
vacation,'' Garland, 45, said. ``I owe my son this time. We could
stay off the rest of the year and it still wouldn't be enough to
make up for what I've given GM and that plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland is married to a corporate lawyer and is not yet worried
about family finances, but many strikers say they are having
trouble making ends meet on the weekly strike pay provided by the
United Automobile Workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``On $150 a week with four kids to feed, your priorities get
focused real quickly,'' said June Cone, 40, a groundskeeper at the
second GM plant on strike in Flint.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than traveling to amusement parks as she had planned, Ms.
Cone, a single mother, said her family was spending the two-week
shutdown scouring their neighborhood for odd jobs. Her children
have found work mowing lawns, and she has helped a couple of
neighbors paint their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be careful how far I drive because I really can't
afford to waste money on gas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A few bits of good news have emerged this week. GM backed off
its plan to cancel health care benefits for those workers idled by
the strikes. And the top national negotiators for GM and the UAW
have resumed talks for the first time since picket signs went up.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that has washed away workers' anger, or their fears
that the strikes will stretch into late summer and be followed
later this year by yet another crippling dispute at two parts
plants in Dayton, Ohio. Workers there, who staged a 17-day strike
in 1996, voted on Tuesday night to give union leaders the authority
to call a walkout. The next step would be a five-day notice to GM
before any strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would get this big or this bad,'' Robert
Harbin, 59, said. By now, he had planned to be in a rickety canoe,
floating on a river in northern Michigan. Instead, Harbin sat in a
lawn chair on the side of a dusty road, waving a picket sign and
talking about what might have been if not for the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time I've put in this year, it's hard to think that I
probably won't have a vacation,'' Harbin said, flipping the pages
of a recent issue of Backpacker magazine. Thirty-seven years of
working with loud press machines have left him not only dependent
on two hearing aids, but a big fan of quiet outdoor vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers are required to staff the picket line for only two
hours once a week, but Harbin said he did not feel comfortable
straying home the rest of the time because he was not sure how long
his ``strike savings'' would have to last. And even if he could
afford a trip, Harbin said, it would probably not alleviate the
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on strike, your whole mind is on strike. You can't
just put it away and go play,'' he said. ``It'll end one day, but
nobody is going to win. We're all losing things we can't get
back.''

SAMPRAS WOULD EMBRACE MORE COLORFUL GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ It's either the end of the world or the
dawning of a new day in tennis, take your choice. Pete Sampras has
put out the call for Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't really Pete's idea. Pete's idea is to play
emotion-free tennis, check a few racket strings, then move
unnoticed through the crowd. If every other player acted the same
way, he wouldn't mind at all.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras can be sensitive to the growing criticism of men's
tennis. He really doesn't give a damn, to be honest, but if the
subject comes up in a press conference, he'll dive in. He had just
beaten Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 on Wimbledon's
Court 1 Tuesday when he was asked about the marketing of tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tour could do a lot better job,'' he said. ``Nike
has really marketed Andre (Agassi) and myself over the years, but
it's nothing like the NBA or some of the other major sports. It's
sad but true: The game needs a little controversy. It needs a
little bit of a Dennis Rodman kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, for one thing, there's only one Dennis Rodman ``kind of
guy.'' There's not much middle ground between Jan Siemerink and an
orange-haired guy wearing eye makeup. But this is a huge
breakthrough: An active player addressing the abject boredom of
today's game. The No. 1 player in the world, for heaven's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game was successful,'' said Sampras, ``you had four
of the guys in the top five playing themselves in the semis and
finals of all the Slams. They were all different personalities.
</P>
<P>
   And they all hated each other.''
</P>
<P>
   So we need a little more hatred?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, ``a hatred, or whatever you want to call it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a vague reference Sampras made to the tennis boom of
the late '70s and early '80s. He was definitely talking about Jimmy
Connors and John McEnroe; filling out the list of four, you'd guess
Bjorn Borg and Ivan Lendl, or perhaps Guillermo Vilas. Strictly
speaking, they didn't all hate each other. But there was a
palpable, contagious tension in the air _ the kind you don't get
from Davide Sanguinetti-Francisco Clavet or Richard Krajicek-Wayne
Ferreira, two of Tuesday's matches with quarterfinal spots at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   There is an interesting progression at work here. First, a few
writers and TV broadcasters popped off about the men's game. They
were ridiculed as outsiders who didn't really love the sport. But
then some key figures weighed in. ``Spectators love emotion,'' said
Boris Becker, ``but most of the players now are like machines. They
show nothing. They have forgotten that it's not just a tennis court
they are playing on. It's a stage as well.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ilie Nastase, ``As the game progressed out of the
wooden-racket era, the power game ruined the entertainment. And the
game was a lot more human when I was playing. These guys today put
no passion into it. For me it is the difference between the cinema
and the theater. Give me the drama of the theater any time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody's not a character,'' said McEnroe, ``you can't
expect him to become one. But the game certainly could use a few
more characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Say one thing for Sampras: He's been so good in his pursuit of
history-making tennis, he has worn down the opposition. He's amused
by the journalists who once called him boring, and now praise him
to the skies, because ``I pretty much haven't changed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In subtle but significant ways, Sampras has helped improve his
image. Fans have seen him clowning around on the practice court,
doing impressions of other players. He has jumped into ESPN's
clever series of star-athlete advertisements. As opposed to truly
boring guys like Lendl and Michael Chang, he'll joke around and
crack wry smiles during interviews.
</P>
<P>
   His classy, no-nonsense style also happens to work in some
quarters. ``My idols growing up were Rod Laver, Arthur Ashe and Roy
Emerson,'' says the top-flight broadcaster Mary Carillo. ``I don't
remember them being laugh riots. It didn't hurt the game. Bjorn
Borg wasn't exactly ready for the Copacabana. But everyone seems to
think that Borg leaving the game was one of the great tragedies of
our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   For American tennis fans, it really comes down to this: Tennis
isn't that cool any more _ not to the point where kids can't wait
to find a racket _ and the world-class power has shifted to other
countries. There are no up-and-coming American prodigies in the
men's game, either. So we take the game as we find it. As it stands
this morning, the Wimbledon field has a dashing Brit (Tim Henman),
a leaping Czech (Petr Korda), two unknowns (Sanguinetti, Siemerink)
and three can't-spell-it guys with really big serves (Krajicek,
Mark Philippoussis, Goran Ivanisevic).
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way, Wimbledon needs Pete Sampras. And so does
the sport of tennis. He and Rodman just might make a nutty doubles
team.

TKACHUK EXTENSION TALKS STALL  
 GAP BETWEEN COYOTES, STAR REMAINS VERY WIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes efforts to reach a contract extension with
captain Keith Tkachuk have apparently hit a stone wall as talks
halted on Tuesday, according to Tkachuk's Boston-based agent, Bob
Murray.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments, the team obtained veteran center Mike
Sullivan from the expansion Nashville Predators for a seventh-round
draft pick in next year's NHL Entry Draft and also informed veteran
defenseman Michel Petit that it won't pick up the option year of
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith said Tuesday that he met
with Murray two or three times during last weekend's Entry Draft in
Buffalo, and the parties aren't close to an agreement on a
five-year contract extension. Tkachuk has two years left on his
5-year, $17.2 million contract, which calls for him to earn $2.8
million and $3 million in the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk is seeking $8 million per season, a salary on a par with
the new contracts signed by Paul Kariya, Joe Sakic and Eric
Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   A source said the Coyotes' offer was between $5 million and $6
million per season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met in Buffalo several times and we have a significant
gap,'' said Smith, refusing to discuss financial terms. ``We've
talked a number of times and have been unable to come close to an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say negotiations have ended. We made a good offer,
and Keith and his agent rejected it. So we've taken it off the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has said several times that the team has three options
with Tkachuk: make him honor the final two years of his contract;
reach a contract extension; or trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the team now is intensifying up efforts to trade
Tkachuk, Smith emphatically answered, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray also refused to discuss numbers, saying only that there
is a substantial gap and that Smith told him Tuesday that talks
have ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've run into a road block,'' Murray said. ``We're very
disappointed in the route the team is taking by calling off
negotiations at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel Bobby is not living up to his word when he promised in
good faith to get the extension done before next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith refuted Murray's contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of our offer was extremely high,'' he said. ``There
was never any understanding that Keith would be treated as a Group
II or Group III free agent. We made an outstanding offer and it was
rejected. Keith expects to be treated like a player who has played
out his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said Tkachuk is not prepared to demand a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith wants to play in Phoenix, he has made that very clear,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk staged a brief holdout before last season, sitting out
the Coyotes' preseason games. He returned when Smith said he would
attempt to work out a contract extension after the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the 30-year-old Sullivan, the Coyotes gained some depth at
center and left wing, specifically on the team's third or fourth
lines, and insurance against the possibility that free-agent
centers Bob Corkum and Mark Janssens might leave.
</P>
<P>
   Corkum becomes a restricted Group II free agent and Janssens
becomes an unrestricted Group III free agent today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real character player,'' Smith said. ``He's a fast
player who will give us more speed, and he's good on special teams,
like penalty-killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, 6-foot-2, 190 pounds is a native of Marshfield, Mass.
He had five goals and 13 assists in 77 games with the Bruins last
season. He has played in 453 NHL games with Calgary, San Jose and
Boston, collecting 41 goals, 62 assists and 103 points with 137
penalty minutes since entering the NHL in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The well-traveled Petit has played for a record 10 teams during
his 16-year NHL career. He had four goals and two assists in 32
games last year. &QL;

VENUS ROLLS INTO QUARTERFINALS 
BY BRUCE JENKINS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ She's out there winning with about half of
the Wimbledon tools she possesses. Even with that eagle's wingspan
and athletic grace, Venus Williams plays more of a Chris
Evert-Tracy Austin type of tennis. Nobody's going to change her
mind, either. And if she gets to the finals here, nobody will even
bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Now fully comfortable with the grass, the setting and the
pressure, Williams hammered out a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Virginia
Ruano Pascual Tuesday, avenging the loss (actually a retirement) by
her sister, Serena, to the Spanish woman the day before. Meanwhile,
Jana Novotna was completely outclassing the dangerous Irina Spirlea
6-2, 6-3 in another fourth-round match.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening conversation around the All England Club, there
was little mention of either match. It's all about the
quarterfinals now: Williams, looking so menacing in just her second
Wimbledon, against Novotna, who has been hanging around here
forever.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of that match will probably get Martina Hingis in the
semifinals. Hingis dismissed Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn with a
haughty flair 6-3, 6-2 to earn a quarterfinal spot against Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 winner over Dominique Van Roost of
Belgium. Hingis is looking and acting the champion, in command of
all she surveys. Sanchez Vicario, never a Wimbledon winner in 11
tries, had the dubious distinction of trailing 0-5 to Van Roost in
the first set.
</P>
<P>
   So if you are looking ahead, you are seeing Hingis, Novotna or
Williams in the final, almost definitely against Monica Seles. The
next obstacle for Seles is Natasha Zvereva, who has had her fun
(shockingly, over a sub-par Steffi Graf) but has never reached the
semifinals of any Grand Slam. The other quarterfinal in Seles' half
of the draw, Lindsay Davenport vs. Nathalie Tauziat, is seen to
have little significance on any front.
</P>
<P>
   When the patrons of Wimbledon last saw Williams, they had to
look quickly. She was gone in a flash _ losing to someone named
Magdalena Grzybowska in last year's first round _ then pretended it
never happened. A year's passing has done wonders for Williams, who
now says, ``I'm at the point where I can do this now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's startling to realize what Williams could be doing out
there. Heady old veterans like Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert
shudder at the prospect of Williams, a catlike 6-foot-2, making her
living at the net. ``She'd just throw a blanket over it,'' said
Evert. ``She would be so difficult to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who remember the '50s and '60s, when individual styles
made such a difference in tennis, there are daydreams of Williams
hitting a one-handed backhand: Slicing a few, then unloading the
topspin, and most importantly, having that one-handed shot as a
volley weapon behind her thundering serve.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Williams plays a one-note game. A scintillating note
of high resonance but solitary all the same. If this were baseball,
Williams would be Bob Gibson throwing nothing but fastballs. In
basketball, Grant Hill with only a 15-foot jumper. But that's
tennis in the '90s. Like most every other players of her
generation, Williams grew up on the baseline, and that is all there
is to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never give up the two-handed backhand,'' she says, to
the dismay of tennis connoisseurs, and it is probably too late for
her to change. The decision must come in the formative years, and
as Pete Sampras could tell you, it requires some courage. Sampras
was 14 when he made the switch, and until he got comfortable, he
was routinely thrashed by his junior opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Williams certainly has no idea what to expect against Novotna.
In a bizarre admission, she said she only looks at one name _ her
sister, Serena _ when a draw is announced. Other than that, she has
no idea who she is going to play until the matchup is set.
``Sometimes even then I don't know,'' she says with a coy smile.
``My mom's like, `Venus, who are you playing tomorrow?' And I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Novotna, who has played Williams just once (a victory in
Moscow last year), there is mostly relief about Wednesday's match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm happier that Venus is not a serve-and-volleyer,
because she really has a huge serve and if she came in all the
time, it would be rather difficult.''

STEPANIA SHOWS SOLID SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vladimir Stepania talked softly. At times, his mind
strained to understand the language spoken to him.
</P>
<P>
   Stepania, though, knew some English. The Sonics' first-round
draft pick from Slovenia was abreast enough with the United States
and NBA to say ``I'd rather play here.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be very little doubt about Stepania's ability to
compete in the NBA. If his past four days in Seattle proved
anything, he is definitely not an ordinary rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-11{ Slovenian performed drills and a little
half-court action with Jelani McCoy and Rashard Lewis, the Sonics'
second-round picks. It would be safe to say Stepania held his own
and even more accurate to say he dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play in Europe, 70-75 games. It's not NBA, but it's
professional level. Those guys (McCoy and Lewis) don't have the
same experience,'' Stepania said Tuesday when introduced at the
Sonics' practice facility.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after downplaying his impressive workout, Stepania said
the magic phrase again:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to test myself in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepania, the 27th pick overall, has proven to be one of the
better foreign players not in the NBA. He started playing as a
9-year-old. Stepania says he dreads going back to his Slovenian
team because there are not very many challenges remaining for him
there. A wiry 236 pounds, he only needs to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got plenty of confidence after seeing him play,'' team
president Wally Walker said of the 22-year-old. ``He's very skilled
and very competitive. If not for the lockout, there's a great
chance of him playing for the Sonics this season.''
</P>
<P>
   There lies the only major problem with Stepania.
</P>
<P>
   His mobility, athleticism, ballhandling, shooting touch and
knowledge of the game will apparently translate to the NBA rather
well. He helped Union Olimpija Ljublana to another Slovenian
championship last season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stepania must figure out if it is worth helping out the
Sonics next season. He is under contract for the coming Slovenian
season. Training camp there begins July 20, and the season can run
through May.
</P>
<P>
   So, either Stepania negotiates a buyout with his team and signs
a contract with the Sonics, or he finishes his European commitment
so he can become a Sonic for the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics could help Stepania buy the final year of his
contract, but they can offer no more than $250,000 assistance under
the old collective bargaining agreement. Stepania guessed he would
then owe roughly $400,000. But with the NBA's labor situation
unresolved and no relief in sight, Stepania is torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I'll be there (at the Slovenian training camp).
I'm tired,'' Stepania said. ``And, they signed three players at my
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepania plays mostly power forward, although he can play
center. He is not big enough to defend a player such as Shaquille
O'Neal. Stepania's game is more like Charlotte's Vlade Divac,
according to Bill McKinney, the Sonics' vice president of
basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, who scouted Stepania the most, cited his overall
skills as a reason to be excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mobility and knowledge of the game are impressive,''
McKinney said. ``He's got very good low-post moves. . . . You know,
players get stronger in time. One of the things he'll weigh is the
(NBA) experience having the facilities to get stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepania said he expected to be among the top 20 players
drafted. When the first round ended, he went to bed despite his
agent's belief Seattle would take him.
</P>
<P>
   Stepania is mostly intrigued by the opportunity to compete
against the best players in the world. He's often played against
Americans on other European teams. However, Stepania understands
the difference in the NBA's style of play. He watched NBA games
once a week when they aired at roughly 5 a.m. back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``European ball is a lot of shooting and passing. There are a
lot of smart players there,'' Stepania said. ``The NBA is a lot of
dunking and running. I like the NBA more because of my athletic
ability. Maybe I don't play my first year, (but) I think I can play
here.''

CHAPMAN SEES LABOR FEARS COME TRUE  
 SAYS MINIMUM-WAGE PLAYERS NEED BETTER DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The last time NBA owners and players went to war over
a collective bargaining agreement, Suns guard Rex Chapman was among
a group of so-called dissident players who attempted to decertify
the National Basketball Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   That's how strongly Chapman and about 130 other players believed
that the NBA's middle class would be hurt and that only superstars
would benefit under the proposed labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of 10 NBA seasons, Chapman turned out to be among
those hurt the most. He wound up playing the past two seasons for
the Suns while receiving only the league minimum for veteran
players _ an average of about $310,000 over the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   While superstars raked in tens of millions and rookies, despite
a new scale, continued to get big contracts, players such as
Chapman were squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'd say that's true,'' Chapman said Tuesday as the
league prepared for the lockout that began at 9 p.m. Phoenix time.
``But I'll play for a few more years, and I'll be done. Whatever
deal we're under, I'll be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the more important thing is that a deal gets done so
the league survives for the guys coming in now who will play the
next 10 or 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough for everybody, so both sides just can't be
greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time, with the union split, the league and players
agreed to a ``no strike, no lockout'' policy that got them through
the 1994-95 season. A year later, there was a short lockout before
an agreement was reached. But it included a clause allowing owners
to reopen the agreement this summer if players received more than
51.8 percent of ``basketball-related revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid us,'' Chapman said. ``We gave them an opt-out. This is
the deal the owners wanted. They got almost everything they asked
for in the last agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (dissident players) wanted to decertify the union because
we could see it would be bad for the middle class, guys who weren't
superstars. We ended up giving them everything they wanted, and now
here we are and they want a different system.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen in two years? Are they going to want
another new deal?''
</P>
<P>
   The league has conceded that mistakes were made when the last
deal was negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said Monday that at least 14
teams lost money last season. Commissioner David Stern said the
league as a whole was not profitable for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The players association, meanwhile, has questioned the league's
numbers. Players are willing to compromise on some issues, such as
a new rookie scale, but the players aren't willing to give the
owners a hard salary cap that would eliminate all exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The union has told the players to be prepared to miss paychecks
in November when the season is supposed to start _ something that
Chapman probably feels he has been doing for two years anyway.
Stern said Monday that the owners are prepared to take the lockout
into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a chance that will happen,'' Chapman said of
the possibility of losing games. ``I don't think there's a real
good chance, but in reality, it might. I don't think there's a real
sense of urgency in July. It's like the trading deadline. You hear
the rumors from November through January, but none of the deals are
made until the last two hours before the deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   But the owners may not feel any more urgency in November. They
have the luxury of a new television deal with NBC and Turner
Sports, which will pay teams even if games aren't played. Granik
said Monday, however, that the money would have to be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said he hopes NBA fans don't get the wrong idea about
the players' motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the deal the owners wanted,'' he said. ``I just hope
everything is well-thought-out this time. And I hope the fans
realize that we're not striking, we're being locked out.'' &QL;

PADRES ARE PICKED OFF IN HUMBLING LOSS TO A'S 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ About all you could say after the A's got their first
look of the year at the Padres was: (begin ital) This (end ital) is
the team that's giving the Giants such a run for their money in the
National League West? You've got to be kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres did not compile a snappy 53-29 record going into
Tuesday's 12-10 A's win playing like this. They were part of a game
so all over the place that A's general manager Billy Beane resorted
to hiding in the shower until it was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed in the shower during the whole ninth inning,'' Beane
said. ``I didn't want to come out. I was peeking out at the TV. I'm
the cleanest guy in the world now.''
</P>
<P>
   _Five San Diego pitchers were pounded for 14 hits; they also
combined for 10 walks, tying a season high and leading to five A's
runs.
</P>
<P>
   _San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman walked three straight in the
eighth to force in two runs and give the A's a 10-8 lead, soon
augmented by Mike Blowers' two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   _The topsy-turvy game ended when the Padres had a runner picked
off on the cheesiest play in baseball. That's right, the game ended
when A's manager Art Howe called for the old
fake-to-third-throw-to-first play and Mike Fetters executed it well
enough to get pinch-runner Ruben Rivera, who was stuck between
first and second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't work very often,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy.
``They always say `It never works.' But Fetters has a good one. He
sold it.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the game was going, each team scoring at least two runs
per half-inning from the seventh onward, it had that sickening feel
of a game that would never end. Everyone figured, or feared, the
runs would keep coming across and keep coming across, stretching so
long the new Bay Bridge extension would be completed before it was
all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look like anyone was going to quit hitting,'' Howe
said. ``I guess that was the way it had to end. It didn't seem like
anybody wanted to make an out any more.''
</P>
<P>
   That was why Howe called for third-and-first play, with runners
at the corners and the Padres down by two runs. He guessed that
Bochy would have Rivera trying to take second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could smell it,'' Howe said, sniffing a couple of times for
emphasis. ``Boch is aggressive. The tying run was at first. I knew
he wanted to get him in scoring position. I played with Boch. Me
and Boch are close. I know he's always up to something.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe made the right move, but it almost didn't matter. Catcher
Mike Macfarlane relayed the sign to Fetters, who peered in and
thought ``What the heck?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was kind of a little mess-up, too,'' Fetters said. ``I
didn't recognize the sign. Macfarlane put down the sign and I
stepped off. Then he had to gesture, so I knew what he wanted. It
was pretty funny that he had to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of bizarre. Guys are scoring and swinging the bat
and getting walked like that, and it ends on a pickoff. That's
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   That play was all that mattered in the end, even though just
about every A's player offered an important contribution. Ryan
Christenson raced into the right-center gap to snare Greg Vaughn's
drive in the sixth, and Rickey Henderson made his best throw of the
year to nail Ken Caminiti trying to score that inning on Wally
Joyner's fly ball in foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Voigt, the guy with the .129 average, picked up an RBI by
being one of the three straight Hoffman walked. Jason Giambi and
Matt Stairs both had multi-hit games. Billy Taylor (3-5) had his
first blown save since April 14 (he gave up four runs in 12/3
innings) but picked up the win anyway.

MONTGOMERY NEVER GAVE UP IN NFL OR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He wasn't a martyr and he wasn't an angel. Glenn
Montgomery was an athlete. He was a fighter, which was more than
enough.
</P>
<P>
   So when the accelerated atrophy of his muscles shut down his
body, when the disease named after Lou Gehrig started to claim its
insidious and fatal victory with such lightning-quick alarm,
Montgomery went down fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, 31, died Sunday with all of the pride, anger, honor
and dignity a fighter can muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a most courageous guy,'' said Dr. Stanley Appel,
director of neurology at Baylor University Hospital, where the
one-time Houston Oiler-turned-Seahawk was treated for amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about ALS is that the mind is perfectly intact as
the body melts away. The reason I feel so strongly about Glenn is
that he had such dignity and was such an inspiration, the way he
helped his teammates and friends to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   You would have expected nothing less from a 6-foot, 280-pound
battler, whose Oiler nickname ``Too Short'' spoke nothing of his
heart. He was a fifth-round draft pick, a guy who was never
supposed to play a lick in the NFL, but who wound up a starting
defensive lineman who could smash-mouth with the NFL's biggest,
meanest, most decorated offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other guys talked about being tough. Other guys acted tough.
But Glenn was just rock-hard,'' said Floyd Reese, the Oiler general
manager who was the team's defensive coach in 1989 when Montgomery
was drafted out of the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public looks at the sports world and sees athletes
who are so wealthy, and they think these guys never quite achieve,
that they could play better or harder or longer. But Glenn was an
over-achiever. He was the kind of player that a blue-collar guy
could appreciate for his total effort. He had such tremendous
intensity,'' Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   After seven seasons with Houston, Montgomery was traded to the
Seahawks in 1996. And during his first season in Seattle,
Montgomery was sidelined with a shoulder injury. But when the
shoulder did not heal, Seahawk trainers suspected it wasn't just
arthritis but the sign of something much worse. An MRI at the
University of Washington led to the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery never bargained for something like ALS, a disease
where your body fails to clear an amino acid out of your muscles
and the result is atrophy and paralysis and, within 2-5 years,
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took him awhile to accept that he had the
disease,'' said Seahawk quarterback Warren Moon, who grew close to
Montgomery as Oiler teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of pride. He was in denial for a long time. It
took him quite awhile to believe his career was over and that this
thing was going to take over his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon said Montgomery met with several other doctors, hoping for
a different, better diagnosis. At the same time, Montgomery's
initial reaction to the disease caused tremendous strife between he
and his wife. Moon said Montgomery's failure to start making
adequate plans for what lay ahead led to tension and anger, and
finally, Montgomery moved out of his home, living instead with a
former college teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a proud guy. He didn't want his wife babying him
and crying, and that created problems,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you saw him, he would be very upbeat, just the way he was
before, always in a great mood, putting on the impression that
everything was OK. But you just knew it couldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months, signs of Montgomery's deterioration were obvious.
Last November, when the Seahawks played in New Orleans, Montgomery
visited the Superdome, bringing food for his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe how fast it happened,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a guy strong as an ox, quick as a cat, and six months
later, if he was standing on uneven ground, he was likely to fall
over. He couldn't use his hands, and when he spoke you could
understand maybe 50 percent of what he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Moon saw Montgomery again, this time at a
fund-raiser for the G. Montgomery Foundation. The lineman was in a
wheelchair, unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem to affect his mind, from what I saw. He was so
alert, so on top of things. He wanted to visit NFL training camps
this summer and make people aware of ALS. He had this whole plan
and now ...
</P>
<P>
   Of all the so-called news in sports this week, none of it means
a damn thing next to one particular item: Glenn Montgomery, a
31-year-old defensive lineman, husband and father of two, died
after an 18-month battle with Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we didn't even have a chance to offer him a drug
(Miotrophin) because the federal Food and Drug Administration is
dragging its heels, even though the drug was shown to slow the
progress of the disease 26 percent,'' Dr. Appel said.
</P>
<P>
   After learning something like this, who cares if the NBA
millionaires have started a labor war or if the U.S. soccer coach
ruined a World Cup or if the Mariners' season is all but lost?
</P>
<P>
   The news of sports is the news of nothing compared to this _ one
tough lineman's fight worthy of recognition from all of us left
behind.

RICKEY STILL STEALS THE SHOW 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
 HENDERSON-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Rickey Henderson was always a blur. All that
speed and talent and exuberance swept him along in an insane blur
that seemed to defy nature or clear understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson at 39, leather-faced and giddy, still has the amazing
body, and he defies nature more than ever. But he has slowed down
enough for those of us with mere mortal perception to get a sense
of what he is all about and to fill in some of the blanks looking
back at a career that guarantees Henderson first-ballot induction
into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The running-back legs have him leading baseball in stolen bases,
and the trained eye has him leading the league in walks. Throw that
together with his infectious enthusiasm and his unflagging advice
and support for the A's young players, and you start to get a sense
of what those close to him have always understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to be playing still, that tells you how much he loves
the game,'' says Dave Stewart, a boyhood friend of Henderson's in
Oakland and a teammate on the last great A's teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you something about all the years before. Some of the
talent goes out of you, and you find other ways to show your love
for the game, talking to guys in the clubhouse, teaching them about
the game. But watching him play all these years, you always saw his
spirit for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's habit of moving a little too fast to follow is never
more apparent than when he's speaking. Even now, he sometimes
throws it into overdrive and unleashes a torrent of words so fast
and so syncopated, even veteran Henderson-watchers only catch bits
and pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes me laugh every time I see him, but sometimes you
can't understand what he's saying,'' teammate Kevin Mitchell says,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mom always tells me, `You need to slow down,' '' Henderson
says. ``But sometimes there's so much in my mind, it all comes out
all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   This might be the least-understood side of Henderson, the
restless intelligence behind the mastery of the basepaths. It all
starts with the legs, toned and strong ever since he was a kid
chasing the family chickens, but to watch Henderson work a pitcher
and make his way around the basepaths is to watch a man bursting
with ideas and creative impulses.
</P>
<P>
   The shimmying and strutting off the bag. The feint toward
second. The all-out burst of speed, followed by a few quick steps
before he puts the brakes on, showing it was all just a fake. The
constantly varying leads. The mocking stares.
</P>
<P>
   One trip around the bases can be as entertaining as a Mark
McGwire moon shot. Over the weekend in Denver, Henderson ended up
at third base and did a number on Rockies pitcher Jamey Wright. It
was like watching a Little Leaguer being outclassed by a
big-leaguer, so thoroughly did Henderson demonstrate his edge in
concentration and feel for the game. He faked a steal, and Wright
balked him home, just as Henderson had predicted to third-base
coach Ron Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's thinking,'' Henderson says. ``You're taught the
fundamental parts of stealing a base, but as far as knowing how to
make sure the pitcher knows you're there, that's thinking.
Sometimes they're more aware of you than the hitter. Sunday in
Denver, I was telling Wash, `I can make him balk if I keep it up,'
because I had yelled at him and saw him flinch. So I faked a steal
and he freaked out.''
</P>
<P>
   To fully appreciate moments like that, you have to think about
Henderson's audience. He's playing for history, and he's playing
for himself, and he's playing to do right by the game. But he's
also playing to pass something on to rookies like Miguel Tejada,
A.J. Hinch and Ben Grieve. Grieve could end up following Henderson
into the Hall if his rookie-of-the-year season paints an accurate
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never big-leagues anyone,'' Grieve says. ``He's probably
the most exciting player on our team, he and Tejada, guys who can
run and make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Henderson's place in the game as the all-time leader in
steals, and also among the all-time leaders in runs and walks,
there is no danger of any rookies failing to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I collected his card when I was in first grade,'' Hinch says.
``I had a Rickey Henderson rookie card and I got sent home from
school because I got in a fight over it. He has as much energy and
spark for the game as anyone in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at something like the all-time leaders in runs. He's
in sixth place and the names ahead of him are guys like Ty Cobb and
Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth. That shows you the mark the man has made.
And for all that, he really cares about his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the man. When we were in Seattle, he stood behind
the cage all during batting practice watching every pitch and told
me what I was doing. I heard the stories about Rickey, how he
didn't even know the names of his teammates, and now I'm a friend
of his.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinch, 24, was in diapers around the time Henderson started
wowing people. Born in Chicago, Henderson played baseball,
basketball and football at Oakland Tech before graduating in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Football was his love, and it showed. He was an explosive
running back and ended up with at least a dozen scholarship offers.
Stewart still goes a little glassy-eyed talking about Henderson as
a football talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played Babe Ruth baseball against Rickey, but to me the
first time I really noticed Rickey Henderson was when I went to see
Rickey play football for Oakland Tech, and that really impressed
me,'' Stewart says. ``He ran a kickoff back 101 yards. He made one
juke about the 5-yard line, made a couple of cuts and he was
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   An Oakland police officer named Jim Guinn scouted Henderson for
the A's, and director of player personnel Syd Thrift will never
forget the first time he saw Henderson at a predraft workout his
senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran him in a 60-yard dash and he ran it in about 6.4,
6.5,'' Thrift recalls. ``That's explosive speed. He had good power.
He was a center fielder with good range. He was the most exciting
player I've seen at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one problem: Owner Charlie Finley didn't want to shell out
the money to sign Henderson as a first-round draft pick. So Thrift
had to sweat out the draft, hoping no one else grabbed the unknown
Henderson before the A's could pick him in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night before the draft, I didn't sleep at all,'' Thrift
says. ``I was trying to figure out how to best place Rickey
Henderson so we could sign him. It was a huge gamble. Immediately
after the draft, I talked to Charlie. I told him I wasn't concerned
about No. 1 and No. 2 and No. 3, but I want to sign No. 4. He said,
`I want you to spend $10,000.' I had to sweat the whole night out
before we drafted him, and now I had to sweat out this, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrift and a lot of other people did not expect Henderson to
choose baseball over football. ``When Jim Guinn came back a few
days later with a signed contract, I almost fainted,'' Thrift says.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson put the decision in the hands of his mother, Bobbie.
``My Mom chose baseball for me,'' he says. ``I was mainly a diehard
football player. She said I was too small for football. When she
chose baseball, I cried. But she chose right.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has put to rest the talk of him as a disruptive
influence in the clubhouse, but he may never satisfy those who
questioned his willingness to play hurt. But even if Henderson made
errors of judgment as a younger man, it is hard to ignore the
message he is sending late in his career. He will be back again
next year, at 40, and he will still be dancing and dashing and
leaving everyone he crosses paths with smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm done playing, I want them to say `He played hard,' ''
Henderson says. ``People got into the habit of saying, `You're
joking it. You're not hurt.' But I don't think any player who knows
what's involved, the pounding you take playing the way I do, would
say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has played in 78 of the A's 81 games this season,
second only to Grieve. Once baseball's highest-paid player, this
year he is playing for $1.1 million in salary, plus incentives, and
he is not wasting much time wondering what the A's will offer him
for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I'm having fun,'' he says. ``I've been
through all that contract stuff. That's been a burn and a drag. Now
I'm like a kid out there. It feels like the beginning of my career,
just going out there every day and having fun.''

YANKEES BEAT PHILLIES, 9-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone walked briskly to the Yankee bullpen on
Tuesday night as the blue tarpaulin was being removed from the
field following a rain delay. Cone had not thrown a pitch in almost
an hour and wanted to loosen up his right arm. But he stopped on
the warning track and gazed up at the videotape replay of David
Wells' perfect game that was being shown to the soggy fans at
Yankee Stadium. What does it feel like to be perfect?
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Cone had that feeling. Using a tricky slider and a
powerful fastball, he toyed with the Phillies before and after the
50-minute delay while retiring the first 14 batters of the 9-2
victory. He was more than halfway to perfection and matching what
Wells did at the Stadium on May 17, and the 29,087 fans were poised
for something special.
</P>
<P>
   The drama died once Bobby Abreu squeezed Cone for a two-out
infield single in the fifth inning. Derek Jeter almost negated it
with a sprawling stab behind second, but his one-bounce throw was
not handled by first baseman Tino Martinez. So Cone had to settle
for being as perfect as possible after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd lets you know it,'' Cone said. ``You can't help but
get involved. You could tell they were into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the climax to Cone's pursuit of perfection, it was still
another marvelous night for the 35-year-old right-hander. Less than
three months after Cone wondered whether he might have to retire
because he had been bashed for 16 earned runs in his first two
starts, he throttled the Phillies on five hits while striking out
11 and walking none for the second straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Cone lost the shutout when Jon Zuber tomahawked a two-out,
two-strike, two-run homer in the ninth, the second home run of his
career. Still, Cone was the Cone of old for most of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better now than he's ever been in the three years that
I've been with him,'' Manager Joe Torre raved. ``I'm talking about
time and again going out with good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, whose arm has got stronger and whose mechanics have got
crisper following off-season shoulder surgery, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Joe has gotten more and more confidence in me now that
I'm healthy,'' Cone said. ``He told me that he trusts me. That's
one of the greatest compliments that a manager can pay a pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps George Steinbrenner should forget about the 200-inning
plateau that Cone (11-2) needs to trigger a $5.5 million option for
1999 and sign him now. Cone, who expressed a strong desire to
finish his career with the Yankees on Monday, is 11-1 with a 3.22
earned run average in his last 13 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impressive statistics, Cone is scheduled to start
against Baltimore on Sunday, and that could preclude him from being
an All-Star because he would not be rested enough to pitch in
Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it removes me from contention,'' Cone lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Cone tinkered with his motion on Tuesday night, as he often
does. Just before he pushed off the rubber, he kept his hands
together and paused near his chest longer than usual. Kind of like
Luis Tiant without a twist. Cone said he hesitates to set himself
for the pitch. Whatever the style, his pitches befuddled the
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Torre called him ``vintage Cone'' in the sixth when he escaped a
no-out jam with runners at second and third by striking out Doug
Glanville on a fastball, getting Gregg Jefferies to tap to the
mound on a fastball and striking out Scott Rolen on a slider. The
Yanks led by 9-0, and though he was no longer perfect, Cone liked
his results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the best pitching I've done all year,'' he said.
``That little stretch was the most quality pitching I've done in a
tight spot. That was more satisfying than anything I've done this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry drilled Carlton Loewer's 3-0 fastball for an
opposite-field homer in the second, minutes before the rain delay.
When play resumed, Chad Curtis singled off Loewer's first pitch to
deliver the second run, and the Yankees scored two more for a 4-0
edge. Loewer and Toby Borland combined to allow five runs on three
hits and four walks in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the outcome was a formality. The Yankees did not
experience a letdown following their emotional series with the
Mets. On the contrary, they were as dominant as usual against an
inferior team.
</P>
<P>
   So increase the major league-leading victory total to 56 for the
Yankees, even if Cone fell a bit short of perfection on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tremendously satisfying to do this considering the way I
started,'' Cone said. ``Physically, if I hold up, I'll be all
right.''

TRANSIT POLICE UNION EX-PRESIDENT IS SENTENCED IN SCHEME TO PAY
KICKBACKS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By BENAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ronald Reale, the former president of the city's
transit police union, and Richard Hartman, a leading labor
negotiator, were among five people sentenced to prison on Tuesday
by a federal judge in Manhattan for their roles in a
multimillion-dollar racketeering scheme. A sixth man was sentenced
in a related scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Reale, 45, who was sentenced to seven years, and Hartman, 57,
who received five, had been convicted in January with two other men
in a racketeering conspiracy that involved the payment of more than
$400,000 in bribes to transit union officers in return for more
than $2 million in union money paid to the law firm of Lysaght,
Lysaght &AMP; Kramer, which represented the transit union and other
local police unions.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Deborah Batts of Federal District Court in Manhattan said
that Reale had ``shamelessly abused'' a ``position of authority and
trust for his own corrupt gains and those of others.'' And she
called Hartman ``an architect of several of the kickback schemes,''
which increased his business as well as ``contributed to the
corruption of the labor negotiation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those also sentenced on Tuesday were James Lysaght, 51,
and Peter Kramer, 44, the former sole partners in the law firm and
labor consultants for the transit union, who received terms of 27
months each. Lysaght and Kramer _ and, earlier, Hartman _ did legal
work for the transit police union and also represented the union
that now represents all New York City police officers, the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   Reale and Hartman had also been convicted of trying to defraud
the city's Campaign Finance Board of matching funds during Reale's
1993 campaign for public advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York, said that the convictions and sentences ``are a warning
to those individuals who corrupt the election system or steal from
union members that they will be prosecuted and, if convicted,
sentenced to lengthy prison terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said that her office's investigation was continuing.
Although she did not elaborate, a federal grand jury subpoaened 10
years of financial records last year from the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association, as part of a widening investigation into
allegations of corruption. After the transit police and the city's
Police Department were combined in 1995, the PBA absorbed the
members of the transit police union.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman's defense lawyer, Gerald Shargel, criticized the
government on Tuesday, saying: ``I don't think it had anything more
than big eyes for a larger investigation. I don't think there's
ever been any evidence to substantiate what they've hinted at for
years _ the notion of widespread corruption in the PBA or
wrongdoing by the law firm.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shargel, as did the other defense lawyers, sought leniency for
his client. He told Judge Batts that Hartman ``has had a brilliant
career'' and was regarded as the pre-eminent representative of
police officers throughout this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Reale's lawyer, J. Bruce Maffeo, wrote to the judge that his
client's humiliation as a result of the conviction ``has eclipsed
his many accomplishments'' as a reformer and decorated police
officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Batts ordered Reale, Hartman, Lysaght and Kramer to
forfeit a total of $200,000 as part of their sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that money may be returned to the city's Campaign
Finance Board, said Nicole Gordon, the board's executive director.
Ms. Gordon said in a telephone interview that her agency, which
first uncovered the allegations of campaign fraud and took them to
Ms. White's office in 1994, would seek to recoup the $163,000 in
taxpayer money that Reale and Hartman were convicted of obtaining
fraudulently.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Batts also sentenced two other former transit union
officials on Tuesday who had earlier pleaded guilty. Thomas
Zichettello, 38, the former first vice president of the transit
police union, who had cooperated with the government's
investigation, received a six-month sentence for his role in the
racketeering conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Richardone, 37, the former treasurer of the transit union,
was sentenced to 33 months for his plea to one count of mail fraud
in connection with what prosecutors said was a scheme to use union
funds to buy luxury cars for himself, his friends and family.

BOAT HOPES TO RETURN BY AUG. 16 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Believe it or not, Billy Boat received good news
Tuesday after surgery at Indianapolis Methodist Hospital to repair
an upper femur fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who also suffered a fractured pelvis in Sunday's Indy
Racing League New England 200 at New Hampshire International
Speedway, may miss only two races and may return to the circuit in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   It was feared that Boat, who lives in Glendale, would miss the
remainder of the season, which resumes July 19 at Dover Downs
(Del.) International Speedway. Another race is scheduled July 25 at
Charlotte (N.C.) Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recovery period for such injuries is about eight
weeks, Dr. Kevin Scheid, who performed the surgery, said Boat could
drive sooner.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Boat's likely return to the driver's seat would be Aug.
16 at Pikes Peak (Colo.) International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Boat was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Bill, said he was told the recovery period could be
shorter because the swelling wasn't as bad as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Boat, 32, spent Sunday night in a Concord, N.H., hospital, then
was transported Monday to Indianapolis, where he underwent three
hours of surgery to insert an L-shaped plate and screws.
</P>
<P>
   The four-car collision occurred on Lap 96, when rookie J.J.
Yeley of Phoenix spun and collided with Boat, regarded as one of
the circuit's rising stars. Boat spun into the infield grass and
was struck broadside by Raul Boesel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nose (from Boesel's car) went through the sidepod and
through the tub and hit Billy's leg,'' said Heather Handley, a
spokeswoman for A.J. Foyt Enterprises. ``They (IRL officials)
couldn't get the nose out of the car for at least an hour after
Billy was put on a stretcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Boat hasn't talked to his son since Monday, when he
still was in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was full of morphine and couldn't hardly talk because his
mouth was so dry,'' the elder Boat said. ``But he sounded good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll have any problem getting back in the car.
He's been through this kind of stuff before and knows it's part of
the game. If a guy lets something like that (injuries) bother him,
he's not going to be a good racer. You just might as well hang it
up because those things happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worse part is drivers get mad because they can't get back
in the seat the next day.'' &QL;

MULTIPLE BIRTHS ON RISE, REPORT FINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Americans are giving birth to an increasing
number of triplets and quadruplets nationwide and locally,
according to a government report that attributes the increase to
fertility drugs and delayed childbearing.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple births, including quintuplets, rose by 19 percent over
1995 to 1996 for an all-time high of approximately 6,000 multiple
births, according to the National Center for Health Statistics in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility specialists and obstetricians in Los Angeles said
their birthrates for multiples mirror the nationwide trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely true everywhere, especially here in Tarzana,''
said Dr. Michael Vermesh, a reproductive endocrinologist at the
Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center's fertility program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to be more successful with procedures like in
vitro fertilization,'' said Vermesh. ``And because we're more
successful, we're getting more pregnancies and relative to other
populations we're getting more multiple births.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the national study, the boom is due to fertility drugs and
women who wait into their 30s to become mothers, said Vermesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is known that women who are older when they finally
conceive, the likelihood of carrying twins is higher, but I don't
think it applies to triplets or quadruplets,'' said Vermesh. ``I
think it's mostly the high-tech procedures that we're using
today.''
</P>
<P>
   At Glendale Adventist Medical Center, the number of multiple
births nearly doubled, from 16 in 1996 to 30 in 1997, according to
hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
   The increase came after two years of stability: 17 multiple
births in 1994 and 15 in 1995, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The boom at the hospital is due to referrals to its neonatal
intensive care unit and successful in vitro fertilization and donor
egg programs, said Charles March, a USC professor and
obstetrician/gynecologist at Glendale Adventist.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide increase in multiple-birth rates comes at a time
when the general birthrate is declining, according to the ``Report
of Final Natality Statistics, 1996.'' Births in the United States
declined slightly to 3.8 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the latest figures show that in 1996 there were
12,581 twin births, 475 triplets and 41 other multiple births from
a total of 538,628 births.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in multiple births was no surprise to mothers, who
said they've noticed the trend over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   When Tracy Darnell-Lujan joined the Antelope Valley Mothers of
Twins and Triplets Club two years ago, there were only eight
members. Today there are 90 mothers on the mailing list and 24 paid
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was pregnant and I started looking for support groups I
couldn't find anything out there,'' said Darnell-Lujan, a Lancaster
mother of 2-year-old triplets.
</P>
<P>
   The support group is made up mainly of mothers with twins, but
there is also one set of quadruplets, an expectant mother of
quadruplets and four sets of triplets, according to Darnell-Lujan,
the group's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the need is out there and with demand comes
production,'' said Darnell-Lujan.
</P>
<P>
   The National Center for Health Statistic's report also shows
that the rate of twin births has increased, but less dramatically
-- up 4 percent in 1996 from 1995 and 37 percent from 1980.
</P>
<P>
   At Temple Beth Hillel, a reform temple in Valley Village, early
childhood director Marsha Franklin said the increase in
multiple-birth parents, especially parents of twins, has prompted
her to search for a teacher that will run a multiple-birth support
group next fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, having twins in her preschool program was a rarity,
said Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, in the future I can just see there are going to be twins
and multiple sets if all goes well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With fertility drugs nowadays and also these parents are older
-- in their mid- to late 30s -- there definitely seems to be a
need,'' said Franklin, who already runs a Mommy and Me program that
helps parents deal with child-rearing issues.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in multiple-birth rates has also increased the number
of low-birth-weight and pre-term infants, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Kamosa, a Lancaster mother of 3-year-old triplets, gave
birth after 31 weeks, instead of going full term at 40. She also
was affected by toxemia, preeclampsia and almost went into
congestive heart failure during delivery.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the 35-year-old has three healthy children, conceived
naturally, and through the Antelope Valley Mothers of Twins and
Triplets clubs, she's had the support to make it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a joy to me to have the multiples,'' said Kamosa.
``To me this is just an incredible blessing.''

GIANTS SUCCEED IN ANNOYING DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Some of us were raised to believe the San Francisco
Giants exist for only one reason: to annoy the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're adults and we know better. The Giants exist not merely
to annoy the Dodgers but to mock them as well.
</P>
<P>
   The men in black are ahead of the boys in blue softball jerseys
for the second straight season, leading them by seven games in the
National League wild-card race, shameful enough considering the
spread between their bankrolls.
</P>
<P>
   What is more insulting is the way the Giants are doing it.
</P>
<P>
   With only left fielder Barry Bonds placing in the top eight in
All-Star voting at an every-day position, and Dodgers outpolling
Giants in five of the six races.
</P>
<P>
   With three starting pitchers at least 36 years of age, all so
healthy that they haven't missed a start, while Dodgers ace Ramon
Martinez is out for the year.
</P>
<P>
   With the spoils of two once-unpopular trades by general manager
Brian Sabean, including the one in 1996 that dispatched the beloved
Matt Williams, Mike Piazza-style, to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   With a clubhouse that has seen 80-percent turnover in the past
two years yet epitomizes !ital!esprit de corps!off!, the quality
that always eluded the home-grown Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   With a well-deserved sneer toward the wealthier rivals to the
south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Dodgers,'' said catcher Brian Johnson, drawing the
contrast between the Dodgers, perennial division favorites, and the
Giants, consensus long shots the season after their '97 division
title. ``They were born with silver spoons in their mouths, if you
will. They were given the division every year, but they haven't won
a division title lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the Dodgers are now, the Giants were supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   They won 90 games last year in the strangest way possible, while
getting outscored over the course of the season. Logically, their
success had to be the result of good luck, good timing or good
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us guessed it was good luck and based our '98
predictions on the what-goes-up-must-come-down theory of pennant
races. The Giants had to tumble back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Even those of us who gave the Giants and manager Dusty Baker
credit for their extraordinary unity got it a little wrong. The
Giants took all that ``chemistry'' stuff as a backhanded
compliment. As if they didn't have the talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that Billy Joel song _ `Everybody wears their
emotions on their sleeve, but some people roll up their sleeves,'''
said pitcher Orel Hershiser, caught up in the Giants spirit in his
first season with the club. ``We roll down our sleeves. You can see
our emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Los Angeles, the most searing memory of the '97 race might
be Johnson's 12th-inning home run Sept. 18 to beat the Dodgers. The
Giants jumped into a tie for first place and never trailed again.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants celebrated wildly on the field, emotion dripping from
their sleeves. The image stuck, a plucky Little League team riding
a wave of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it was a lot of guys that weren't household names
doing well,'' said Johnson, one of 20 Giants who joined the team in
'97 or '98. ``This year it's a bunch of guys that still aren't
getting a lot of respect who are still doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't convinced anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   At their current pace, equal to last year at 48-36, the Giants
will have back-to-back 90-win seasons for the first time since Dick
Dietz. So give us time to adjust to the thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have the time.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Cleveland Indians a few years back, they're a
small-market team that, through a series of smart moves, has
developed a strong core.
</P>
<P>
   By signing first baseman J.T. Snow through 1999; third baseman
Bill Mueller, closer Robb Nenn and left-handers Shawn Estes and
Kirk Rueter through 2000, second baseman Jeff Kent through 2001 and
Bonds through 2002, they've promised something good to watch when
Pacific Bell Park opens in two years.
</P>
<P>
   By trading prospects for pitchers Wilson Alvarez, Roberto
Hernandez and Danny Darwin as '97 division insurance, then letting
Alvarez, Hernandez and and closer Rod Beck go to free agency, they
stockpiled draft picks and precious money.
</P>
<P>
   By using five of the top 42 picks in last month's amateur draft,
they restocked their farm system. By spending the money, they got
Hershiser and shortstop Rey Sanchez as free agents and the
high-priced Nen in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Of the core, only leadoff hitter Darryl Hamilton can leave after
this season.
</P>
<P>
   With the lowest payroll in the NL West, lower even than the
expansion Arizona Diamondbacks, the Giants aren't a complete team.
The age of their rotation is worrisome. So is their lack of power
below Bonds, demonstrated when they lost 11 of 16 following Kent's
knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Either of those weaknesses could cost them the three-game lead
over the New York Mets in the wild-card race with which they
started Tuesday night's game against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   But if they win, it will be because of shrewd management, an
almost infallible bullpen and spectacular intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers fans, how annoying is that? &QL;

OFFENSE COMES THROUGH FOR BLAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They turned back the clock to the 1970s on Tuesday
night at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, among them Chicago Cubs broadcasters Chip Caray and
Steve Stone, wore clothing from the decade, including Afro wigs. A
glittering disco ball hung from the ceiling of the broadcast booth.
A red lava lamp glowed. The group Sister Sledge sang.
</P>
<P>
   And oh, yes, there was a baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Diamondbacks starting pitcher Willie Blair won was
so long, it seemed like it was the 1970s. But it was only a little
more than month ago, on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Blair's frustration came to a merciful end, like
platform shoes and leisure suits.
</P>
<P>
   By defeating the Cubs, 5-4, the Diamondbacks gave the
right-hander his third victory in 14 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a solo home run to Sammy Sosa, his 20th of the month
and 32nd overall, and a solo shot to Mark Grace. Henry Rodriguez
hit a solo homer off reliever Alan Embree. But the Diamondbacks
countered with a three-run shot by Matt Williams and a solo homer
by Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the second in a row for Arizona (29-54). The
Cubs (43-39) lost for the eighth time in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Blair lasted 6 innings, giving up three runs on six hits,
walking two and striking out four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think Willie was as sharp as he has been in other
games. But we gave him some runs to work with (Williams' homer came
in the first inning),'' Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   So Blair finally got a little justice, after he lost previous
games while pitching better?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Did Blair concur?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you go out and you don't have your best
stuff,'' he said. ``But you get a feel for what is working. I felt
I made the necessary pitches when I needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams ended a 14-game homer drought, his longest of the
season, with the shot off right-handed starter Mark Clark. His last
homer was on June 13 off St. Louis' Jeff Brantley at home.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' homer Tuesday night also increased his hitting streak
to 12 games. He also had a sacrifice fly in the third inning and a
double in the sixth. He has 14 homers, 41 RBIs and a .272 average.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this was a signal that he might begin a home-run binge,
Williams said it was a strong possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, they have come in bunches for me,'' he said.
``I've been hitting the ball a lot harder lately, even the outs. I
just want to continue to make good contact and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   After Williams' sacrifice fly scored Devon White in the fourth,
the Cubs snapped Blair's shutout in their half of the fourth on
Rodriguez's 18th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's eighth homer of the season with two outs in the sixth
cut the Arizona lead to 4-2, but Fox gave the Diamondbacks more
breathing room in the top of the seventh with a homer to right with
one out. His homer total matches his uniform number _ 6.
</P>
<P>
   Blair retired the first two batters of the seventh, but gave up
a single to center by Manny Alexander. Showalter called on the
left-handed Embree, who surrendered an RBI double to pinch-hitter
Matt Mieske. The run was charged to Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa connected on a 3-2 pitch from Embree for his homer with one
out in the eighth to make it 5-4. Rodriguez doubled with two outs,
and Showalter brought in right-handed closer Gregg Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Olson retired Kevin Orie on a fly ball to left to end the eighth
and retired the side in order in the ninth for his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive play of the game, and perhaps for the Diamondbacks
to date, came in the ninth on a foul popup by Alexander. Rookie
first baseman Travis Lee turned his back and sprinted through foul
territory toward the Arizona bullpen, then reached out at the last
second to snare the ball near the brick wall along the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my eye off it, then I found it again. I reached out and
it just fell in the glove,'' Lee said. ``The thing I was worried
about was David (Dellucci, right fielder) coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes after everything full-bore. I think he might have
tripped a little on the bullpen mound. Otherwise, there would have
been a pretty good collision.'' &QL;

DISNEY SHARES FALL 8 1/2 POINTS ON GLOOMY FORECASTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares of Walt Disney Co. took their biggest loss
in more than eight years Tuesday, losing 7.2 percent of their value
on worries about movies, home videos and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Disney shares plunged 8 1/8 to $105 1/16, marking the largest
decline since a 9.2 percent fall on Dec. 20, 1989. The
entertainment giant's loss accounted for 32.4 points of the
45.34-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the declines are nowhere near the terrifying 29 percent
drop that hit Disney on Oct. 19, 1987, also known as Black Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven analysts cut profit forecasts or lowered ratings Tuesday.
Long-time bull Stewart Halpern of Furman Selz lowered his rating to
``buy'' from ``strong buy,'' citing worse-than-expected performance
in video and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the stock is likely to be weighted down in the
near-term by investors taking more a `show-me' attitude,'' he said,
adding it would take another quarter or two for Disney to hit his
1998 target of $122.
</P>
<P>
   Shares have now dropped 17 percent since May 4, when the stock
hit an all-time high of 127 1/8. But they remain 42 percent ahead
of the 52-week low last July.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern cited soft sales of ``Flubber'' in U.S. home video and
foreign theatrical markets; competition from the World Cup soccer
tournament at foreign theaters; poor overseas performance by
``Starship Troopers''; soft consumer product sales overseas;

WHITMAN APPROVES $18.1 BILLION STATE BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman signed a new $18.1 billion
state budget into law on Tuesday night, using her line-item veto
power to eliminate $42.8 million in legislative spending, as well
as language prohibiting her from turning public employee jobs over
to private contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The state budget, approved by lawmakers on Monday, raises
spending by almost $1 billion for public schools, state colleges
and universities, preservation of open spaces, and various other
programs. It also puts $700 million aside in a ``rainy day fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Whitman and lawmakers had reached agreement on the
broad outlines of the new spending plan for the fiscal year, which
begins on July 1, she used her line-item veto power to strike some
spending increases that were included by lawmakers and some budget
language that her aides said would have reduced her authority.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman eliminated the biggest item that legislators had
included for property tax relief: a $10 million increase in state
aid for municipalities. Whitman aides said that before allocating
more municipal aid, the governor wanted to see what recommendations
her commission on property tax reform would make at its meeting
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman cut other spending increases, including a $6.5 million
addition for park maintenance and $6 million that had been added
for capital projects at state colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing concern about the rise in the number of ``special
appropriations'' that lawmakers added to the budget this year for
various projects in their districts, she warned that groups and
organizations receiving the extra aid should not rely on it in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   She also eliminated state spending for about a dozen legislative
projects, including $300,000 for a proposed Yogi Berra museum on
the campus at Montclair State University and $1.5 million for a new
Morris County Fire and Police Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Spending for various legislative projects totaled about $60
million in the new state budget, about $20 million more than this
year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in special appropriations reflects the
availability of revenues generated by our robust economy,'' the
governor said. ``During such times, it is appropriate to support
worthy causes and to meet unaddressed needs. The recipients of such
special appropriations should not, however, become reliant on state
support since such support is, by its nature, temporary.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cuts that Whitman made in the new budget were not
popular with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Robert Littell, a Republican and chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, said he was disappointed by many
of the changes the governor made. He had recommended the spending
increase in park maintenance and he called Whitman's decision to
reduce the allocation ``very shortsighted,'' particularly since she
was pushing to purchase a million acres of undeveloped land over
the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ask people to buy more land when you don't take care
of what you have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman also struck out language that would have prevented the
administration from withholding funds to municipalities for
development projects, like sewers and roads, that are inconsistent
with the state's growth-management plan.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of privatization of state jobs, she eliminated
language that would have prevented the administration from turning
any state jobs over to private contractors.
</P>
<P>
   But in a move suggesting that Whitman may not use privatization
this year, she left $7 million untouched that lawmakers had put
back into the budget, the amount her aides estimate privatization
would save. The Whitman administration is considering privatizing
an estimated 500 jobs in the Department of Transportation's
engineering department and the Corrections Department's food
service division.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Bagger, a Republican and chairman of the
Assembly Appropriations Committee, said the language had been
inserted because lawmakers did not think it was appropriate for
state employees to lose their jobs when the economy was pouring so
much extra tax revenue into the state's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer James A. DiEleuterio Jr. said that the question
of eliminating some state jobs and turning them over to private
contractors was still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the urging of some lawmakers and Mayor Milton Milan of
Camden, Whitman did not change language that authorizes a
state-appointed review board to oversee Camden's finances.

MEEK RANGERS NO HELP TO HELLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers right-hander Rick Helling took the
mound with one final opportunity to forge an All-Star-deserving
impression upon Cleveland Indians manager Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, though, found no support among the Rangers last night
at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Helling's attempt to become the major leagues' first 12-game
winner and perhaps secure Hargrove's selection to the 1998 American
League All-Star team went awry during a 4-1 defeat to the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who went meekly in Sunday's 7-0 loss to the San
Francisco Giants, managed only three hits for the second
consecutive game. Only a one-out, sixth-inning home run from third
baseman Fernando Tatis prevented the Rangers from their second
consecutive shutout and third during their past eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right-hander Darren Dreifort (5-6) dominated with a
fastball/slider combination and mixed in an occasional changeup
that gave the Rangers fits for eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff tonight was good stuff,'' Rangers manager Johnny
Oates said of Dreifort's seven-strikeout, no-walk performance.
``That was Class-A, No. 1 stuff. I would put it up there in the top
three we've seen all year. I put it right up there with the game
\RCleveland's Bartolo\S Colon threw against us.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had three pitches: a fastball that didn't go straight at 94
or 95 miles per hour, a nasty slider and _ once in a while _ a good
changeup. We just didn't get too many good swings at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling (11-4) pitched well himself, but the right-hander would
not be a match for Dreifort without command of his curveball. The
Dodgers' three run-scoring hits _ a second-inning single by left
fielder Matt Luke, a fifth-inning single by right fielder Gary
Sheffield and a two-run, sixth-inning home run by third baseman
Adrian Beltre _ came on fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'm most disappointed with is the home run,''
Helling said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between a two-run deficit and that of four runs
would be overwhelming with Dreifort pitching as he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping I could keep up with him,'' Helling said.
``I knew it was going to be tough to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, right-hander Aaron Sele (11-5, 4.26) and closer John
Wetteland (22 saves) will be among those Rangers who merit
Hargrove's consideration for the All-Star Game. The manager's
selections for pitchers and reserves will be announced at 5 p.m.
today. Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez were voted to the team as
starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't even thought that much about it,'' Helling,
whose earned-run average rose slightly to 4.25, said about being an
All-Star. ``I have no control over it. I'm happy with the way I've
pitched the first half of the season, but the last thing I want to
do is start thinking about individual stuff. You get into trouble
when you start doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates predicted last night that at least six AL pitchers
deserving of an All-Star berth will be slighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's deserving, certainly, with 11 wins,'' Oates said
of Helling. ``It'll be up to Mike.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said last week that he would be ``very hesitant'' to
choose a pitcher scheduled to start Sunday, since the All-Star Game
is Tuesday. Helling remains the Rangers' scheduled starter for
Sunday's game against the Seattle Mariners at The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Helling does not expect a berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have no idea,'' Helling said. ``With what Hargrove
said, I don't even know if it matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, a potential All-Star berth will not consume Helling's
thoughts between now and today's 5 p.m. announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be thinking,'' he said, ``about that home run I gave
up.''

DREIFORT, BELTRE LEAD DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Tex. _ They might be the Fox-run Dodgers, but once in
a while they play it like the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   The team that must decide if they want to play for today or live
for tomorrow, saw the future Tuesday night in Darren Dreifort and
Adrian Beltre, who led the Dodgers to a 4-1 interleague victory
over the Texas Rangers in front of 37,873 at the Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort could have been a Seattle Mariner and Beltre could have
been with the Cincinnati Reds. The Dodgers are confident those are
good moves for more than one night.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Ramon Martinez underwent surgery that will put him
out for a year, Dreifort limited the Rangers to three hits and one
run in eight innings. Beltre, the replacement for injured Bobby
Bonilla at third base, hit his first career home run.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the Dodgers won't look into Randy Johnson
during the offseason or Reds closer Jeff Shaw during the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
   But in this wildly uncertain season, the Dodgers for once looked
like they had options.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all that's happened we're not ruling anything out, but
we don't feel the need to panic,'' new manager Glenn Hoffman said.
``You have to look at everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Including a replacement for Eric Young, who is headed to the
disabled list after injuring his right thigh muscle for the third
time. Young, injured running out a ground ball in the first inning,
thinks he can still come back.
</P>
<P>
   But general manager Tom Lasorda said he expects to use Wilton
Guerrero at second and the leadoff spot and recall Alex Cora from
Triple-A. Both played most of the season in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which opened a six-game road trip, didn't really do
much for the Dodgers' place in the standings. Even a loss by the
division-leading San Diego Padres trimmed the Dodgers' deficit only
slightly to 12{ games.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre took 11-game winner Rick Helling deep in the sixth
inning, not the Double-A pitchers he beat up for the first three
months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about where I'm headed after Bonilla comes
back,'' Beltre said. ``To me every game is a confidence boost.
Whether I do well or do bad, I'm here. That is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre had a throwing error in the ninth inning of Sunday's 6-4
loss to Pittsburgh. It led to a run and led many to believe that he
was a talented player, but not ready for the big leagues. After
getting an RBI single in his first big league at-bat, Beltre went 2
for 18.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest proof of Beltre's ability was the Reds'
insistence that he be included in any trade for Shaw. The Reds have
hinted the Dodgers offered Paul Konerko, despite Lasorda's denials.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (5-6) made only 87 pitches on a 96-degree night and
thought he could pitch the ninth. But Hoffman said he wanted
Antonio Osuna to pitch instead. While they debate offers for Shaw,
the Dodgers are giving Osuna a final chance to see if he is the
closer. After earning the save against the Rangers, he is five for
five in save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's only mistake was a sixth-inning home run by Fernando
Tatis that was the first run in 21 innings for the Rangers, who
have dropped three straight and 12 of 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff was good stuff, probably in the top three we've seen
this year,'' said Rangers manager Johnny Oates of Dreifort. ``We
didn't get too many good swings off him.''

DODGERS TRADE AWAY STABILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walter Alston managed the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers for
23 years. Tommy Lasorda followed him for 20 more.
</P>
<P>
   Two managers in 43 years, not to mention three general managers
and one family of owners, is almost unprecedented in any sport. It
gave the Dodgers an unusual air of stability in a sport known for
high casualty rates in front office and managerial positions.
</P>
<P>
   During those 43 years, the New York Yankees changed managers 24
times, yet won three more pennants than the Dodgers. The Rangers
have been around for just 27 years, and Johnny Oates is their 14th
full-time manager.
</P>
<P>
   But, with one hefty check worth more than $300 million, the
Dodgers' famed stability has almost disappeared. New owner Rupert
Murdoch and the Fox Group, after buying the team from Peter
O'Malley, seemed to have turned the franchise into the West Coast
version of George Steinbrenner's Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' said Lasorda, who has found himself in the
middle of the maelstrom. ``Stability was always a strength when
Peter O'Malley owned the team. But \RFox\S figured they had to do
something. We weren't playing well. We were slipping.''
</P>
<P>
   The O'Malley family owned the Dodgers for almost a half-century.
But in the three months since Fox took over ...
</P>
<P>
   All-Star catcher Mike Piazza, after turning down an $84 million
contract offer, was sent to the Florida Marlins along with third
baseman Todd Zeile in a whopping seven-player deal that brought
Gary Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, Charles Johnson, Jim Eisenreich and
Manuel Barrios over from the world champions.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star pitcher Hideo Nomo was designated for assignment and
traded to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Fred Claire and manager Bill Russell were fired.
Lasorda has taken over as interim general manager, and Glenn
Hoffman, 27-41 as manager at Triple-A Albuquerque, was hired as
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Reggie Smith, pitching coach Glenn Gregson and
bullpen coach Mark Cressi were fired. Charlie Hough became pitching
coach, Mickey Hatcher took over as hitting coach and John Shelby
was named bench coach to replace Cressi.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were big changes,'' Hough said. ``There was probably no
better owner in baseball than the O'Malley family. The thing was,
people who worked for the Dodgers a long time knew they had a job
forever. It has been great. That's why this shake-up has caught
everybody by surprise. Things have changed but hopefully for the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Said first base coach Mike Scioscia, another longtime member of
the Dodgers organization, ``I think the face of the Dodgers will
change the club slightly with a new manager and with Fox Group
taking over, but the core of what the Dodgers are all about will
still be there. There are a lot of people in player development,
scouting and on the minor-league and major-league staffs who have
been around a long time and know how to do it. That will be there
for a long time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the changes, the Dodgers remain a major
disappointment. They entered last night's game with a 39-42 record
and in third place in the National League West. They have a $57
million payroll and a growing reputation as the biggest
underachievers in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating,'' Lasorda said. ``Very frustrating. If
somebody had told me in spring training that we would be 13 1/2
games out by the first of July, I would have told them they were
crazy. But that's what has happened, and we're trying to right it
if it can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But some problems are even greater than even the mighty Fox
Group can control. Pitcher Ramon Martinez underwent shoulder
surgery yesterday and is through for the season. First baseman Eric
Karros, third baseman Bonilla, outfielder Todd Hollandsworth and
shortstop Jose Vizcaino have all spent time on the disabled list.
Second baseman Eric Young left last night's game with a strained
right quadriceps muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things that have happened that have really
kept this team from being a very good club instead of the club we
have now,'' Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   That still doesn't help Hoffman, a former major-league shortstop
who was a surprise choice to replace Russell. Scioscia was
considered the leading candidate within the organization, while
such heavyweights as Sparky Anderson, Whitey Herzog and Lasorda
himself were also being mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Even now there is a strong feeling that Hoffman, unless he can
pull off a miracle, won't last beyond this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here taking it one day at a time,'' Hoffman said. ``This
is a game of adjustments, and I've made the adjustment to
major-league manager. Hopefully, these guys will see what I can do.
All you can do is ask for the opportunity, and I have that
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse, the players adjust on the fly and cling to the
hope they can make a run in the second half. A division title may
be a fading possibility, but the Dodgers, going into last night's
game, were eight games behind the San Francisco Giants in the
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``As players we have no say in what's going on with the
management of the team,'' said Johnson, the catcher acquired from
the Marlins. ``We just need to go out there every day and win
ballgames. It would be nice to have the same group together for a
long time, but it always doesn't happen that way. We still feel we
have a chance. The teams in front of us may not play as well in the
second half and we could play outstanding. We just have to play
well.''

ANGELS FINISH OFF JUNE IN STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels have been here before. The trick is staying
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels finished the month of June with a 4-3 victory over
the San Francisco Giants Tuesday night before 25,629 at Edison
Field and maintained their firm grasp on first place in the
American League West.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Angels know all too well, pennants aren't awarded on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson's three-run homer, a gritty performance by
starter Chuck Finley and clutch pitching by the bullpen (including
Troy Percival's league-leading 25th save) helped the Angels win for
the 10th time in 14 interleague games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels enjoyed their best month ever, finishing 22-6 and
going from 5{ games behind Texas to first place, 3{ games up on the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Angels sorry to see the month end?
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to end sooner of later,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``I'm just glad the month of June got here. We needed to do
what we did in June. I was glad to get May (12-15 record) over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, though, stressed the Angels don't have to put pressure
on themselves to repeat their success of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to win 22 games each month,'' he said. ``If
we're playing six games at home, we should win four or five. If we
do that, we'll look up in three months and like where we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to go out and win series, keep building on what
we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best Angels hitters of the month was Anderson, the
smooth-swinging outfielder from Kennedy High School. And it's no
coincidence that he keyed the team's offensive hot streak. Anderson
entered June hitting .264 with five homers and 21 RBI. In the
month, he hit .343 with five homers and 18 RBI, raising his average
to .290.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to compete, we need him to swing the bat,''
Collins said. ``He's a heck of a hitter. If he swings the bat like
he can, it gives us a heck of a lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley (8-4), who was 0-2 with one no-decision in his previous
three starts, gave up three runs and seven hits in 61/3 innings.
But he was far from sharp, tying a season high with six walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got off to a slow start against Giants starter Shawn
Estes (6-7). They had just four hits _ all singles _ through five
innings, and only one baserunner got as far as third base.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the second time Estes had faced the Angels _ he beat
them in an interleague game last season, giving up three runs in
six innings. No Angel went into the game with more than three
career at-bats against Estes, which didn't help matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about big-league hitters knowing the
pitcher,'' Collins said before the game. ``When you run into guys
you're not familiar with, it's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels broke through in the sixth with four runs on four
hits. Dave Hollins led off with his second single of the night and
went to second on Jim Edmonds' infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon followed, and after being refused a timeout by plate
umpire Mark Johnson, hit a line drive off the scoreboard in right
field, scoring Hollins to tie the game at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson followed with his home run, smacking a hanging
curveball into the right-field seats for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Finley had never faced the Giants before, though a few players
had seen quite a bit of Finley as members of other teams. Finley's
first pitch of the game was hit down the left-field line for a
triple by Darryl Hamilton, who scored later in the inning on a
groundout by Barry Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had plenty of baserunners in the ensuing innings, but
Finley worked his way out of trouble until the seventh, giving the
Angels offense a chance to rally.
</P>
<P>
   Finley left the game with one out in the seventh after yielding
an RBI single to Charlie Hayes, which cut the Angels' lead to 4-2.
Shigetoshi Hasegawa replaced Finley and gave up an RBI single to
Stan Javier _ the run being charged to Finley _ before getting out
of the inning when Rich Aurilia hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Freak accident: Eligible to come off the disabled list Tuesday,
pitcher Allen Watson instead will stay there for about another 10
days. But it has nothing to do with the strained flexor muscle in
his elbow that put him on the DL in the first place.
</P>

CLINTON TELLS OF RISKS TO GROWTH IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ President Clinton told American business leaders on
Wednesday that corruption, environmental neglect, weak financial
regulation and restrictive trade practices threaten China's growth
and full entry into the global economic system.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the American Chamber of Commerce here, Clinton
said rapid economic growth has brought significant challenges to
the Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
   He said the dynamic growth of the last 20 years and the rapid
pace of reform have changed the lives of Chinese citizens, bringing
more career choices and opportunities to run their own businesses,
but also breaking the system of guaranteed lifetime employment as
Beijing slashes payrolls at government-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's economy still is burdened with complicated and
overlapping barriers,'' Clinton said in his 21-minute address at
the Portman Ritz Carlton hotel. He said he hoped that Beijing would
make the difficult decisions needed to bring China into the World
Trade Organization on the same terms that govern the other members
of the global trading body.
</P>
<P>
   ``China and, indeed, Shanghai, face major challenges in
advancing economic progress beyond the present point,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   He specifically cited the problems of inefficient state
monopolies, weak legal and regulatory systems, wasteful and
polluting energy patterns, corruption, closed markets and poor
supervision of the nation's banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is prepared to work with China in meeting
these challenges because the success of China will affect not only
the Chinese people and Chinese prosperity, but America's well-being
and global stability as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also announced today that Clinton would meet in
Hong Kong with Martin Lee, the leading advocate for democracy
there. This is a calculated affront to Beijing, which took control
of the former British colony a year ago. The White House is playing
down the meeting, which will take place in the president's suite at
the Hyatt Hotel Kong on Friday. No public statements are planned,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession to Beijing on another sensitive issue, Clinton
formally stated on Tuesday that the United States did not support
independence for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government, which considers Taiwan a breakaway
province that should be politically reunited with the mainland, had
pressed Clinton to state the American policy while he was on
Chinese soil.

SHEFFIELD WOULD PASS ON ALL-STAR INVITATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Gary Sheffield will appeal a three-day
suspension handed down Tuesday for his role in Sunday's fight, but
he won't play if selected as a reserve for the July 7 All-Star
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who received five stitches over his left eye after a
bench-clearing brawl with Pittsburgh, learned Tuesday he and
Pirates catcher Jason Kendall each must miss three games. Sheffield
can play until a hearing is arranged, which isn't expected until
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said the eye injury, a sore lower back and the fact
that he hasn't been home since spring training, rules out any
appearance at the All-Star Game at Coors Field in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things,'' said Sheffield, who is batting
.338 in 38 games with the Dodgers and .303 overall. ``I want to
spend time with my family. It has been a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers do not have a clear pick among the reserves, which
will be announced Friday. It probably will go to Raul Mondesi, who
leads the club with 17 homers. Eric Young, who leads the National
League with 32 stolen bases, had an outside shot until re-injuring
his right thigh muscle running out a ground ball Tuesday in the
first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Charles Johnson is second to Mike Piazza in the voting
and played for NL manager Jim Leyland, but he is batting just .208
after going 0 for 3 Tuesday with two strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield was back in the lineup Tuesday and drove in a run in
the fifth inning. He said the altercation started Sunday when
Kendall started shouting obscenities after a near collision at home
plate. The brawl woke up the Pirates, who trailed by three runs at
the time and went on to score five runs in the final three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go into that thinking this would give the team a
boost or go the other way,'' Sheffield said. ``Everybody has a job
to do. That shouldn't affect the way you play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Charges dropped: Raul Mondesi will not faces drunk driving
charges stemming from a June 13 incident when he was pulled over
near his home in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi registered a .083 alcohol level, which is legally drunk
in California. But the Glendale district attorney office notified
Mondesi's attorney Miles Berman on Tuesday that charges would not
be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, benched the day of the incident, said his driving
became erratic after getting separated from friends who were
driving behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the district attorney's office that justice
has been done in my case,'' Mondesi said. ``Playing baseball in
America has been the greatest thrill in my life and I am thankful
for the opportunity to play here. I want to thank the fans and
Dodgers who stood by me during this unfortunate incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez lost for year: Dodgers right-hander Ramon Martinez
underwent surgery Tuesday to repair his right shoulder and is not
expected to pitch competitively until the middle of next season.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers orthopedist Frank Jobe repaired the rotator cuff during
the 1{-hour procedure at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in
Inglewood. Jobe, however, said the cartilage damage in the shoulder
was not as serious as first believed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will come all the way back,'' Jobe said. ``We think
his velocity can be like it was before. He starts rehabbing
tomorrow and we want him to maintain his range of motion and give
the tear time to heal. We know that takes six months to heal down
solid. Then he has to get his strength back. That is why I am
saying a year.''
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain, however, where Martinez will be in a year. He
is in the final season of a multi-year contract. The Dodgers hold
an option for next year. They could pick up the option for $5.6
million or give him a buyout at $600,000. The club is expected to
exercise the option and re-sign Martinez for a lower figure.

SCIENTISTS SAY MAN INFECTED WITH DRUG-RESISTANT STRAIN OF HIV 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The first known case of a patient being infected with a
strain of HIV resistant to the most powerful new anti-viral drugs
was reported Tuesday by San Francisco AIDS specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the 12th World AIDS Conference in Geneva said the
case could mark an ominous new turn in the global epidemic that has
already claimed more than 10 million lives.
</P>
<P>
   The mutated strain of the AIDS virus, seemingly impervious to
protease inhibitors and older anti-virals now in use, was found in
a newly infected patient at San Francisco General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be seeing an emerging and dangerous edge to the
epidemic,'' said Dr. Frederick Hecht of the University of
California at San Francisco, who delivered the report on the
disheartening case.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted by researchers at the University of Geneva
found similar drug-resistant strains of HIV in six of 57 male
patients, who, like the San Francisco patient, contracted the virus
through unprotected sex. A report on those cases was presented by
Dr. Sabine Yerly of the university's virology laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries ``should deliver a loud wake-up call on multiple
fronts in the battle against AIDS,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a
pioneer AIDS fighter who directs the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco case, confirmed through genetic analysis, was
a middle-aged patient of Hecht's. The man was recently infected
during unprotected sex with his HIV-positive partner, whose virus
became resistant after he was infected _ until now the only way
drug resistance was known to originate.
</P>
<P>
   The blood of both men is resistant to all four of the protease
inhibitors now in use, as well as to two older, widely used AIDS
drugs, AZT and 3TC.
</P>
<P>
   Protease inhibitors have generated huge excitement for the past
two years because they can reduce HIV to undetectable levels in the
blood. Taken in ``cocktails'' with other traditional AIDS drugs,
they have brought thousands of patients back to good health,
although patients must take the complex and costly combinations on
a daily basis for the therapy to work.
</P>
<P>
   Drug resistance to the older AIDS medicines like AZT has emerged
after long-term use, and has been caused by the tendency of the
AIDS virus to undergo mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Only one or two mutations are needed for the wily virus to
escape the killing effect of the older drugs, which attack HIV by
disabling an enzyme _ reverse transcriptase _ that the virus
requires to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The newer protease inhibitor drugs block a different enzyme.
Based on the extraordinary success of multiple-drug cocktails in
clinical tests, the protease inhibitors generated high hopes at the
last World AIDS conference in Vancouver two years ago. Scientists
at the Vancouver meeting theorized that it would be difficult for
the AIDS virus to develop resistance to the new anti-virals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Hecht and his colleagues have found that HIV can
quickly undergo genetic mutations many times. In the new case, it
took seven successive mutations for the virus to escape the effects
of the protease inhibitors, Hecht said.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug resistance, he said, was detected by scientists at
Virologic Inc., a small biotechnology firm in South San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   Hecht's report evoked widespread interest and concern among many
of the 12,000 scientists and AIDS activists at the Geneva
conference. Full details are being published in the New England
Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial by Fauci.
</P>
<P>
   As Fauci commented Tuesday, ``This report of another case of
drug resistance is not surprising, and people must assume that if
they get infected now, it's just the same as if they were a person
who got infected in 1983 before there were any AIDS drugs
available.''
</P>
<P>
   The protease inhibitor drugs have proved a ``welcome advance and
have rapidly improved the prognosis'' for many patients infected
with HIV, Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors and patients must expect that the virus will show
enough genetic ``plasticity'' to develop resistance as long as even
the best drugs cannot completely suppress the ability of the virus
to reproduce itself, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that resistance to the protease inhibitors may
spread rapidly from a very few early cases like the one Hecht
reported in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson also is obvious: The new drug combinations, which
involve many pills that must be taken in a rigorous regimen, can
induce HIV resistance if patients skip or discontinue their
scheduled doses of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study shows that we can do more harm than good if we
don't help patients take their medications correctly,'' said
Hecht's colleague, Dr. Margaret Chesney, a co-author of the report.
``The bottom line is that helping patients stick to these difficult
regimes is as important as the drugs themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To Hecht, a major lesson of the case he reported is the
increasing need to test patients for drug resistance before
beginning therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In his own case, he said, 35 patients were tested before
discovering the first patient who was infected with a virus
resistant to all four of the protease inhibitors now in use _
saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir and nelfinavir. In other studies
at UCSF, he said, 16 percent of newly infected AIDS patients were
resistant to the standard drug AZT, and 8 percent proved resistant
to 3TC, another drug frequently used in combination with one or
more protease inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our concern,'' he said, ``is that all of these drugs
could become useless because of resistance by the virus _ very much
as tuberculosis has become resistant to so many once-useful drugs.
These are warning signs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case Hecht reported, the previously uninfected patient
had engaged in unprotected, receptive anal intercourse with a
partner who had been infected since 1990 and had been sporadically
treated with nine different anti-viral drugs, including protease
inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   The infected partner did not ejaculate during intercourse _ a
practice believed by many gay men to be a relatively safe type of
sex.
</P>
<P>
   After not responding to protease drugs, the patient then began
treatment with several other anti-virals, but when they did not
work as well as in other patients, he took himself off all drug
therapy and so far does not seem ill, Hecht said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case doesn't mean that combination therapy is not a good
thing, said Thomas Coates, director of the UCSF AIDS Research
Institute. ``A lot of people are living longer and better lives due
to combination therapies, but it is clearly not the final answer.
We have to help afflicted communities understand that transmission
of resistant virus strains is possible, even by a (sex) practice
not considered to be very risky.''

MONTGOMERY NEVER GAVE UP IN NFL OR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He wasn't a martyr and he wasn't an angel. Glenn
Montgomery was an athlete. He was a fighter, which was more than
enough.
</P>
<P>
   So when the accelerated atrophy of his muscles shut down his
body, when the disease named after Lou Gehrig started to claim its
insidious and fatal victory with such lightning-quick alarm,
Montgomery went down fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, 31, died Sunday with all of the pride, anger, honor
and dignity a fighter can muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a most courageous guy,'' said Dr. Stanley Appel,
director of neurology at Baylor University Hospital, where the
one-time Houston Oiler-turned-Seahawk was treated for amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about ALS is that the mind is perfectly intact as
the body melts away. The reason I feel so strongly about Glenn is
that he had such dignity and was such an inspiration, the way he
helped his teammates and friends to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   You would have expected nothing less from a 6-foot, 280-pound
battler, whose Oiler nickname ``Too Short'' spoke nothing of his
heart. He was a fifth-round draft pick, a guy who was never
supposed to play a lick in the NFL, but who wound up a starting
defensive lineman who could smash-mouth with the NFL's biggest,
meanest, most decorated offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other guys talked about being tough. Other guys acted tough.
But Glenn was just rock-hard,'' said Floyd Reese, the Oiler general
manager who was the team's defensive coach in 1989 when Montgomery
was drafted out of the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public looks at the sports world and sees athletes
who are so wealthy, and they think these guys never quite achieve,
that they could play better or harder or longer. But Glenn was an
over-achiever. He was the kind of player that a blue-collar guy
could appreciate for his total effort. He had such tremendous
intensity,'' Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   After seven seasons with Houston, Montgomery was traded to the
Seahawks in 1996. And during his first season in Seattle,
Montgomery was sidelined with a shoulder injury. But when the
shoulder did not heal, Seahawk trainers suspected it wasn't just
arthritis but the sign of something much worse. An MRI at the
University of Washington led to the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery never bargained for something like ALS, a disease
where your body fails to clear an amino acid out of your muscles
and the result is atrophy and paralysis and, within 2-5 years,
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it took him awhile to accept that he had the
disease,'' said Seahawk quarterback Warren Moon, who grew close to
Montgomery as Oiler teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of pride. He was in denial for a long time. It
took him quite awhile to believe his career was over and that this
thing was going to take over his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon said Montgomery met with several other doctors, hoping for
a different, better diagnosis. At the same time, Montgomery's
initial reaction to the disease caused tremendous strife between he
and his wife. Moon said Montgomery's failure to start making
adequate plans for what lay ahead led to tension and anger, and
finally, Montgomery moved out of his home, living instead with a
former college teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a proud guy. He didn't want his wife babying him
and crying, and that created problems,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you saw him, he would be very upbeat, just the way he was
before, always in a great mood, putting on the impression that
everything was OK. But you just knew it couldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months, signs of Montgomery's deterioration were obvious.
Last November, when the Seahawks played in New Orleans, Montgomery
visited the Superdome, bringing food for his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe how fast it happened,'' Moon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a guy strong as an ox, quick as a cat, and six months
later, if he was standing on uneven ground, he was likely to fall
over. He couldn't use his hands, and when he spoke you could
understand maybe 50 percent of what he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Moon saw Montgomery again, this time at a
fund-raiser for the G. Montgomery Foundation. The lineman was in a
wheelchair, unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem to affect his mind, from what I saw. He was so
alert, so on top of things. He wanted to visit NFL training camps
this summer and make people aware of ALS. He had this whole plan
and now ...
</P>
<P>
   Of all the so-called news in sports this week, none of it means
a damn thing next to one particular item: Glenn Montgomery, a
31-year-old defensive lineman, husband and father of two, died
after an 18-month battle with Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we didn't even have a chance to offer him a drug
(Miotrophin) because the federal Food and Drug Administration is
dragging its heels, even though the drug was shown to slow the
progress of the disease 26 percent,'' Dr. Appel said.
</P>
<P>
   After learning something like this, who cares if the NBA
millionaires have started a labor war or if the U.S. soccer coach
ruined a World Cup or if the Mariners' season is all but lost?
</P>
<P>
   The news of sports is the news of nothing compared to this _ one
tough lineman's fight worthy of recognition from all of us left
behind.

STEPANIA SHOWS SOLID SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vladimir Stepania talked softly. At times, his mind
strained to understand the language spoken to him.
</P>
<P>
   Stepania, though, knew some English. The Sonics' first-round
draft pick from Slovenia was abreast enough with the United States
and NBA to say ``I'd rather play here.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be very little doubt about Stepania's ability to
compete in the NBA. If his past four days in Seattle proved
anything, he is definitely not an ordinary rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-11{ Slovenian performed drills and a little
half-court action with Jelani McCoy and Rashard Lewis, the Sonics'
second-round picks. It would be safe to say Stepania held his own
and even more accurate to say he dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play in Europe, 70-75 games. It's not NBA, but it's
professional level. Those guys (McCoy and Lewis) don't have the
same experience,'' Stepania said Tuesday when introduced at the
Sonics' practice facility.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after downplaying his impressive workout, Stepania said
the magic phrase again:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to test myself in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepania, the 27th pick overall, has proven to be one of the
better foreign players not in the NBA. He started playing as a
9-year-old. Stepania says he dreads going back to his Slovenian
team because there are not very many challenges remaining for him
there. A wiry 236 pounds, he only needs to get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got plenty of confidence after seeing him play,'' team
president Wally Walker said of the 22-year-old. ``He's very skilled
and very competitive. If not for the lockout, there's a great
chance of him playing for the Sonics this season.''
</P>
<P>
   There lies the only major problem with Stepania.
</P>
<P>
   His mobility, athleticism, ballhandling, shooting touch and
knowledge of the game will apparently translate to the NBA rather
well. He helped Union Olimpija Ljublana to another Slovenian
championship last season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stepania must figure out if it is worth helping out the
Sonics next season. He is under contract for the coming Slovenian
season. Training camp there begins July 20, and the season can run
through May.
</P>
<P>
   So, either Stepania negotiates a buyout with his team and signs
a contract with the Sonics, or he finishes his European commitment
so he can become a Sonic for the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics could help Stepania buy the final year of his
contract, but they can offer no more than $250,000 assistance under
the old collective bargaining agreement. Stepania guessed he would
then owe roughly $400,000. But with the NBA's labor situation
unresolved and no relief in sight, Stepania is torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I'll be there (at the Slovenian training camp).
I'm tired,'' Stepania said. ``And, they signed three players at my
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepania plays mostly power forward, although he can play
center. He is not big enough to defend a player such as Shaquille
O'Neal. Stepania's game is more like Charlotte's Vlade Divac,
according to Bill McKinney, the Sonics' vice president of
basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney, who scouted Stepania the most, cited his overall
skills as a reason to be excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mobility and knowledge of the game are impressive,''
McKinney said. ``He's got very good low-post moves. . . . You know,
players get stronger in time. One of the things he'll weigh is the
(NBA) experience having the facilities to get stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepania said he expected to be among the top 20 players
drafted. When the first round ended, he went to bed despite his
agent's belief Seattle would take him.
</P>
<P>
   Stepania is mostly intrigued by the opportunity to compete
against the best players in the world. He's often played against
Americans on other European teams. However, Stepania understands
the difference in the NBA's style of play. He watched NBA games
once a week when they aired at roughly 5 a.m. back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``European ball is a lot of shooting and passing. There are a
lot of smart players there,'' Stepania said. ``The NBA is a lot of

ANGELS DEFEAT GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels have been here before. The trick is staying
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels finished the month of June with a 4-3 victory over
the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday night before 25,629 at Edison
Field and maintained their firm grasp on first place in the
American League West.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Angels know all too well, pennants aren't awarded on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson's three-run homer, a gritty performance by
starter Chuck Finley and clutch pitching by the bullpen (including
Troy Percival's league-leading 25th save) helped the Angels win for
the 10th time in 14 interleague games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels enjoyed their best month ever, finishing 22-6 and
going from 5{ games behind Texas to first place, 3{ games up on the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Angels sorry to see the month end?
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to end sooner of later,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``I'm just glad the month of June got here. We needed to do
what we did in June. I was glad to get May (12-15 record) over
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, though, stressed the Angels don't have to put pressure
on themselves to repeat their success of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to win 22 games each month,'' he said. ``If
we're playing six games at home, we should win four or five. If we
do that, we'll look up in three months and like where we are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to go out and win series, keep building on what
we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best Angels hitters of the month was Anderson, the
smooth-swinging outfielder from Kennedy High School. And it's no
coincidence that he keyed the team's offensive hot streak. Anderson
entered June hitting .264 with five homers and 21 RBI. In the
month, he hit .343 with five homers and 18 RBI, raising his average
to .290.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson traditionally is a slow starter, so he didn't press
when he struggled in April and May this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go up there and get my at-bats every day,'' he said.
``If I start out fast, I start out fast, but I know I'll be there
at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Collins: ``When you put the lineup together, you've got the
(Cecil) Fielders and those guys in there, they need to be protected
so they see better pitches. If you want to pitch around Cecil,
we've got Garret there. He's just not missing pitches right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley (8-4), who was 0-2 with one no-decision in his previous
three starts, gave up three runs and seven hits in 61/3 innings.
But he was far from sharp, tying a season high with six walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tall guys get out of whack mechanically so easily,'' Collins
said. ``He's working at it. He'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got off to a slow start against Giants starter Shawn
Estes (6-7). They had just four hits _ all singles _ through five
innings, and only one baserunner got as far as third base.
</P>
<P>
   But they broke through in the sixth with four runs on four hits.
Dave Hollins led off with his second single of the night and went
to second on Jim Edmonds' infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon followed, and after being refused a timeout by plate
umpire Mark Johnson, hit a line drive off the scoreboard in right
field, scoring Hollins to tie the game at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson followed with his home run, smacking a hanging
curveball into the right-field seats for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tremendous comeback for us, especially with the way
Estes was throwing,'' Collins said. ``He had good stuff, I'll tell
you that. We had guys coming back to the dugout talking to
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   With 10 home runs, Anderson has already surpassed his total of
eight in 1997. But he says it's just a matter of making adjustments
based on situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been up in situations to drive the ball more this year,''
he said. ``Last year, I was in situations to get base hits to win
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Freak accident: Eligible to come off the disabled list Tuesday,
pitcher Allen Watson instead will stay there for about another 10
days. But it has nothing to do with the strained flexor muscle in
his elbow that put him on the DL in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he cut his wrist opening a beer bottle Monday
afternoon. The wound required six stitches, which will be removed
in 10 to 12 days. He won't begin throwing again for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a friend's house at the beach,'' said Watson. ``I had
a Corona bottle and was just opening it up. The top of the bottle
broke off and the momentum carried the jagged end into my wrist. I
wasn't drunk or nothing, I was just having a beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little scary. Blood was shooting out. I guess I'm
lucky... but not lucky baseball-wise.'' &QL;

JOHNSON FANS 12 ROCKIES IN LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To point out what went wrong at the Kingdome Tuesday
night would only be repeating the message scribbled on the
Mariners' locker room chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the first day of the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   That can only mean that the sinking Mariners are not about to
come up for air anytime soon. They indicated that with a 6-4 loss
to the Colorado Rockies in front of 28,221 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners endured yet another in a series of sloppily-played
defeats that have bolted them to the bottom of the American League
West. There were pitching lulls and mental mistakes aplenty.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner miscues erased a 12-strikeout effort by starter Randy
Johnson and dropped the Mariners 15 games under .500 at 34-49.
Manager Lou Piniella is about ready to throw his arms above his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this keep happening?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me anymore about it,'' Piniella said after the game.
``Write what you see. It's certainly not up to my standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (7-7) wasn't a consistently strong force on the mound as
he had been in his two previous starts. He yielded four earned runs
after giving up just one in his last 17 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But for as much as Colorado got to Johnson, he was untouchable
at times. Johnson recorded at least 10 strikeouts in a game for the
91st time in his career during the on-again-off-again performance.
</P>
<P>
   However, even Johnson could not overcome two late-inning
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   With the scored tied 4-4 in the seventh inning, M's third
baseman Russ Davis bobbled a ground ball, allowing Neifi Perez to
reach base. Perez later scored the go-ahead run on Dante Bichette's
single.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies added a cushion in the eighth. Johnson gave that run
away. Greg Colbrunn hit a one-out double and stole third. He
eventually scored when a Johnson fastball sailed over catcher John
Marzano's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy threw the ball well. He battled,'' Marzano said. ``He
didn't have the greatest stuff but he threw well when he needed to.
We've just got to start playing better basic baseball. It seems
like every time we make a mistake, it kills us. I've never seen
anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado parlayed three Mariner errors into two runs _ the
difference in the game. Second baseman Joey Cora committed his 14th
error of the season. Davis ran his total to 20.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems the situation is getting increasingly worse for the
M's, that's because they finished their worst June ever. After
going 21-7 last year, the Mariners hobble into July after going
8-20.
</P>
<P>
   They are even worse in comeback situations _ 1-39 when trailing
after eight innings and 4-28 in games decided by three runs or
fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, yeah, yeah. Piniella knows all of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get the runs in,'' Piniella said. ``We had some
chances and they wiggled out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners mounted a threat in the bottom of the ninth. Dan
Wilson pinch-hit for Marzano and poked a single to left. Joey Cora
followed with a walk. But Alex Rodriguez hit into a double play,
and Ken Griffey Jr. ended the game with a line drive out to right
field.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado did not chase Johnson until the ninth inning, so it was
not another case of the bullpen throwing the game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get his strikeouts but what you try to do with
him is stay close,'' said Colorado manager Don Baylor. ``When they
went up 3-1 (in the second), it's not late enough in the ballgame
where Randy just smells it and it's lights out. We just kind of
kept battling back and battling back. You can't let him get too far
out (in front).''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies pierced Johnson in the first inning when Perez led
off with a single and stole second base. Two outs later, Perez
scored on Vinny Castilla's double off the right-center field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson then yielded a single to Ellis Burks before retiring the
side.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners answered in the bottom of the first. Griffey
launched his 33rd home run of the season in the bottom of the
first. Griffey turned on Pedro Astacio's first pitch and sent the
ball down the right-field line into the foul-pole screen.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey homered in his 12th consecutive series. He trails St.
Louis' Mark McGwire by four for the major league home run lead.
McGwire hit his 37th Tuesday night in a loss to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The M's seized control and went ahead 4-2 in the third. Johnson
retired nine of the Rockies' last 11 batters in the middle innings.
But the Rockies began to apparently see his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's catcher Kirt Manwaring led off the fifth with a
double. The very next batter, Perez, belted his fifth homer over
the left field wall. The two-run blast tied the score at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Only three runners got into scoring position for the M's after
the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team starts losing guys start to press,' Marzano said.
``Once we relax, hopefully we'll play better.''

   1. LIV TYLER INTERVIEW Once a precocious teenager, Liv Tyler has
grown into a precocious adult. She will be onscreen soon in the
Bruce Willis blockbuster ``Armageddon.'' It's hard to believe Tyler
is only 20. Tall and voluptuous, she is also incredibly poised.
Virtually everyone who meets her is struck by her remarkable
openness and innocence - surprising traits, considering everything
she has lived through so far. The daughter of
groupie-model-musician Bebe Buell, Tyler learned at the age of 10
that her real dad was Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, who didn't even
know he had a daughter. By James Fallon. From W magazine. 1,500
words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
``ARMAGEDDON'' LOOKING TO MAKE DEEP IMPACT AT BOX OFFICE A
Texas-sized rock hurtles towards earth at 22,000 miles per hour. If
it hits, kiss the planet goodbye ... It's time for the summer's
second asteroid-threatens-to-destroy-the-earth 'popcorn' movie:
``Armageddon.'' So what makes it worth seeing, even if you've
already seen ``Deep Impact?'' Several of the movies' heroes - Bruce
Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck and the king of action-producers,
Jerry Bruckheimer, explain. (For the actors, it was something of a
life-changing experience to work with NASA experts and observe at
close range the space shuttle and other high-tech marvels.) By
Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,200 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
BOCELLI'S BLITZ Within the five years since the release of his
first CD in Italy in 1993, Andrea Bocelli has become one of the
hottest stars in the record business. Last year he sold 14 million
CDs worldwide, second only to the Spice Girls. At 39, Bocelli is a
late bloomer for a pop star, even for an aspiring opera singer. As
Richard Dyer explains in this profile, the singer became a pop star
almost by accident. The Boston Globe. 2,100 words. 4. NATIVE
AMERICAN WRITER SENDS 'SIGNALS' OF CHANGE ``Smoke Signals'' is the
first full-length feature film written, directed and co-produced by
Native Americans. Award-winning poet Sherman Alexie is the film's
guiding light. He wrote the script, based on his short fiction,
chose the director and was involved in every aspect of the
production. The results, says the talented and confident Alexie,
``prove that Indians can make good movies.'' The film mixes comedy
and drama, fantasy and reality as two young men travel from their
Idaho reservation to Arizona to pick up the ashes of one
character's recently departed father. By Joshua Mooney. BPI. 1,000
words. 5. THE OPPOSITE OF INNOCENCE There is nothing cute or
childlike about Christina Ricci's latest character in ``The
Opposite of Sex.'' Ricci plays Dedee Truitt, a nasty bit of
Southern discomfort who wreaks havoc in the lives of just about
everyone she encounters. Within the movie's first half hour, she
trashes her stepfather's funeral, steals her half-brother's hunky
boyfriend, and names him as the father of her unborn child. Ricci
received the script from her mother, and was immediately interested
in playing Dedee. By Renee Graham. BPI. 1,200 words. 6. FRASER'S
EDGE Actor Brendan Fraser's furrowed brow always manages to give
him a rather sweet air of faint bewilderment, which he used to
comic advantage in ``George of the Jungle,'' and which made him
touchingly vulnerable in the film ``School Ties.'' But at 6 feet 3
inches, the 29-year-old Fraser's price tag these days matches his
size: His salary jumped from $1 million for ``George'' to several
million for his latest film, ``The Blast from the Past,'' which
will co-star Alicia Silverstone. Find out in this interview why it
took a loincloth to propel Fraser to the brink of Hollywood stardom
. By Louise Farr. Fairchild. 1,600 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
IN THE MURKY WORLD OF KENJI MIZOGUCHI The films of Kenji Mizoguchi,
the Japanese director who is being given a comprehensive
retrospective at the Paris Cinimathhque until July 20, take one
into a strangely compelling world that does not easily yield up its
secrets. Although lionised abroad, Mizoguchi was less appreciated
in his own country. He was able to get audiences to accept the
violence of his films, their virulence and their moral
intransigence. Prostitution, whether literal or metaphorical, is
the mainspring of almost all his movies. By Bernard Eisenschitz. Le
Monde. (English translation available.) 1,800 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
SNO-KOAN Enigmatic Icelandic singer Bjork talks about the love of
information, fear of technology, the sound of schizophrenia, and
how today's young musicians use new technology. 1,000 words.

CLINTON HOPES STOPOVER IN HONG KONG WILL BOLSTER CONFIDENCE THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ When he visits Hong Kong Thursday, President
Clinton will convey what his aides hope will be a calming message
about Asia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive caps his nine-day tour of China late
Thursday with a 29-hour visit to Hong Kong, the enclave of Chinese
capitalism where leaders, investors and citizens are badly shaken
by the economic turmoil that has driven Asia to the brink of an
economic depression.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton hopes his visit will buck up
investors' confidence and celebrate democratic practices that
survived Hong Kong's smooth transition from British colonial status
to Chinese sovereignty one year ago Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During his summit in Hong Kong with Tung Chee-hwa, the
territory's Beijing-appointed chief executive, Clinton will discuss
additional steps that the United States can take to bolster Asia's
economic recovery. a White House national security official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meeting with Tung follows two days of consultations
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing and precedes a summit
in Washington in late July with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has ``an enormous stake in helping Asia out of
this situation because it will have a direct bearing on Main Street
in America,'' the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Asian nations accounted for 29 percent of U.S. world-wide trade
in 1997 of almost $2 trillion. Ten of America's top 23 trading
partners are in Asia. Hong Kong, China and Japan accounted for 51
percent of the $568.3 billion in U.S. trade across Asia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Clinton's visit to Hong Kong also will highlight
the seamless transition that Hong Kong made from 156 years as a
British colony to Chinese control last year. The ease of the
transition had reassured worldwide investors over the future of
Hong Kong, before the Asian financial crisis began exacting its
toll.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is urging Hong Kong's leaders to accelerate the 10-year
phase-in of full elections to allow Hong Kong voters to directly
elect all representatives. Two-thirds of the representatives in the
legislature are now appointed by Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit comes amid White House concern that Jiang could
suffer a political backlash at home if his overtures to the United
States go awry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked in an interview on state-run Chinese
television on Wednesday whether he or Jiang had the tougher job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he faces enormous challenges here at home of a
scope that Americans have a hard time imagining,'' Clinton said of
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said in an interview
that Chinese political hard-liners could challenge Jiang ``based on
any outcome that was less than positive,'' adding: ``We're trying
to be sensitive to how much load we put on the leadership structure
right now because we don't want to push it so hard that we push
them over the side of the cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials ruled out photographs or news coverage of
Clinton's private meeting Friday with Martin Lee, the head of Hong
Kong's Democratic Party and an opponent of the Beijing
administration. The move appeared designed to ease heartburn for
Jiang
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the worried economic environment is the fact that
Tung froze property sales in Hong Kong until next March in a bid to
stem tumbling prices in the worst economic downturn since World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong property prices have plummeted 40 percent this year;
the stock market has dropped 20 percent; unemployment has climbed
to a 15-year high; economic output in the hard-charging economic
tiger has fallen by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS - STORY MAY END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Hong Kong is his latest effort to use the
symbolic clout of the United States to persuade frightened
international investors to ride out a fast-moving economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Roger C. Altman, Clinton's former deputy treasury secretary and
now an investment banker, issued a bleak warning in an opinion
piece that appeared in Asian editions of the International Herald
Tribune as Clinton arrived in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dangerous moment,'' warned Altman. ``In economic and
financial terms, much of the East Hemisphere is in flames and the
fire is spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has steadily deepened his personal involvement in
finding a solution. In recent weeks, he has ordered $2 billion in
U.S. reserves to be spent to bolster the value of the Japanese yen
_ the first time that the United States has sold dollars to buy a
foreign currency since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He is pressing the Japanese government to overhaul insolvent
Japanese banks and stimulate its faltering $4 trillion economy _
the second largest in the world and the engine of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has encouraged Chinese authorities not to devalue
China's currency that would make Chinese exports more competitive
with the depleted prices of Japanese exports due to the fall of the
yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say that I appreciate the very constructive role China
has played in promoting financial stability in the region,''
Clinton told U.S. business leaders. Clinton praised Beijing for
doing ``its part in avoiding another round of competitive
devaluations.''

U.S. JET FIRES MISSILE AT IRAQI MILITARY SITE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a reminder that tensions have not disappeared in
the Persian Gulf region, a U.S. attack jet Tuesday hurled a missile
at an Iraqi military site, which had trained its radar on British
patrol planes flying over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials confirmed the missile launch by
an F-16 jet, the first against Iraq since November 1996, saying it
was standard procedure in response to what is perceived to be a
hostile action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned their radar on, and that's a first step toward
launching a missile, or it can be, and is considered threatening,''
said Vice President Al Gore, who fielded questions about the
incident at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that it was not clear whether the action was an
isolated one or part of a deliberate military escalation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know for certain. But we do know from the history of
patrolling the no-fly zones that there are a lot of incidents like
this from time to time and there are other possible explanations,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested that the action might
be an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not seen any evidence on the part of the Iraqis
altering their air defense system. We have not seen examples of
higher alert,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Cohen said that if U.S. aircraft or forces are
threatened, ``it will be met with a very vigorous response.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has about 20,000 military personnel in the
region, down from earlier in the year when the U.S. presence was
fortified in response to Iraq's refusal to allow United Nations
officials to inspect possible weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he did not expect to boost military manpower in the
region because of the latest incident.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, an Iraqi official called the incident ``proof of the
aggressiveness of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unjustified, aggressive act. No radar was opened,''
said an official at the Ministry of Culture and Information,
according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi news agency said the missile struck a drinking water
reservoir, according to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the United States and its
allies have used warplanes to patrol the southern part of Iraq. The
daytime incident occurred near Basra in southern Iraq, around 1:30
am., EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. jet was part of a 10-plane patrol that included four
British Tornadoes who were enforcing the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi radar had ``locked on'' or ``painted'' the British
planes, which is viewed as a sign that that surface-to-air missiles
would soon be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the U.S. jet, rather than the British, fired the
missile because it was equipped with HARM missiles, which he said
was best equipped to target the radar site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a split-second type of operation,'' he said. ``We have
a lock-on of the radar only seconds at a time. And so this decision
was made on that kind of a split-second decision-making status.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Secretary said it was not clear whether the Iraqi
military site had been hit. The Associated Press reported that
British officials said they believed it had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 planes in the allied contingent returned to the base
safely.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., plans to order
resumption of the patrols.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who is in China, was notified of the incident
by his National Security Advisor Sandy Berger while he was in route
to his hotel in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House found out about the missile firing soon
after it occurred, President Clinton was not informed until eight
hours later, about the same time the media found out about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official traveling with Clinton said that
officials delayed telling him about the missile firing because of
the apparent routine nature of the incident and the desire to get
more details.

NUMBER OF PEOPLE SICK FROM TAINTED TEXAS OYSTERS UP TO 128 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Fla., La., Calif., Colo. and N.M.) 
 
By KEVIN MORAN 
and CINDY HORSWELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ The number of people reported to have been
sickened by raw Galveston Bay oysters jumped again, going from 107
Monday to 128 Tuesday, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas Department of Health telephone hotline still was ringing
Tuesday with calls from people who have had intestinal problems
they think were caused by eating raw oysters and from health
officials who treated possible victims of the recent outbreak of
Vibrio parahaemolyticus, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the outbreak, which has shut down harvesting of
oysters by fishermen who lease state-controlled beds in the bay,
remains unknown, said David Estlack, of the Texas Department of
Health's Seafood Safety Division. This outbreak is the first of its
kind in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Results of tests on oysters and water from the bay beds are due
in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers have been working since Friday to keep suspect
oysters from being served in restaurants across Texas, California,
Colorado, Florida, Louisiana and New Mexico. At least 18 of the
people who reported falling ill after eating oysters since early
June were customers.
</P>
<P>
   Estlack said state health officials believe oyster wholesalers
and restaurateurs have taken all the suspect oyster shipments off
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Although some have suggested that high heat and low salinity in
bay waters because of drought contributed to development of the
Vibrio parahaemolyticus in oysters to levels high enough to cause
illness, Estlack said state officials aren't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a commonly occurring organism in sea water,'' Estlack
said. ``It has nothing to do with pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms from eating tainted oysters include diarrhea, abdominal
cramps, nausea, fever vomiting and headache, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   People who have suffered such symptoms within a day or two of
eating raw oysters have been asked to report the illness to state
officials by calling 1-888-883-9997.

   Innumerable aces &QL; 
don't serve public
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ The rains stopped Tuesday, and, suddenly, so
did the wild torrent of aces. If there is an obvious correlation,
it escapes me. But no matter. Good news is good news _ on both
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis is supposed to be about strategy, about plotting one's
way through the minefield of a match, about probing and prodding
until a seam is found in the opponent's defense. It is not supposed
to be about beating him unconscious with a Kevlar-graphite stick,
which for all practical purposes is what grass-court tennis has
come to among the, ahem, gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   A holdover habit from the last century at Wimbledon is to refer
to the ``gentlemen's singles.'' It would be more appropriate today
to call the competition ``Neanderthal men's singles.'' Fittingly,
both Goran Ivanisevic and Richard Krajicek are sporting new
tattoos, and Ivanisevic has also grown a beard. He looks like a
Barbary pirate without the eye patch.
</P>
<P>
   Crash. Fifteen, love. Boom. Thirty, love. Bam. Forty, love. Oh,
yes, smashing. Watching the Centre Court grass die is more
exciting. If you've seen one ace, you've seen most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the fourth round, Ivanisevic, Krajicek, Pete Sampras
and Mark Philippoussis _ a k a ``Scud'' _ were each averaging 22 or
more aces per match and winning 90-plus percent of their
first-serve points. Thomas Enqvist, an extreme case, was down 0-2,
0-30 before he actually touched his racket (barely) to a Sampras
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Women more watchable
</P>
<P>
   If clay is the great equalizer, routinely reducing the big
hitters to also-rans at Roland Garros, grass is the great
terminator. In effect, it shrinks the size of a skidding tennis
ball traveling 130 mph to that of a BB.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. These days, with rackets having been engineered
into becoming quasi-lethal weapons, devices only the NRA could
embrace, the women play the more interesting lawn tennis. They
actually have rallies and stuff.
</P>
<P>
   You'll note there is no relationship whatsoever between the
ace-count standings and the very predictable look of the distaff
draw in Wimbledon's quarterfinals. None of the last eight still
standing is ranked among the top four in said category.
</P>
<P>
   Although Venus Williams blows away her peers in service velocity
_ with a top speed of 125 mph, she has been surpassed by only 10 of
the men _ she rarely smacks an ace past anyone. Virginia
Ruano-Pascual whiffed but once against Williams on Tuesday, yet
Venus won easily in barely an hour's worth of effort.
</P>
<P>
   By coming to the net and volleying, Williams succeeded in
short-circuiting the Spaniard's intended impersonation of a human
backboard. As Venus noted later: ``I saw that she wanted to hit the
ball at least 50 times on one point, and I figured that on grass
that really shouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not. But the men go too far in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   No Borgs here
</P>
<P>
   The four blokes with the best chance of winning the Cup are also
the same Four Aces I've already mentioned. Despite tapering off
drastically in the fourth round, averaging a paltry 13 each per
victory, Ivanisevic, Philippoussis, Krajicek and Sampras are still
the runaway leaders. Goran's norm of 26, down from 30, is more than
any of the eight remaining women have total.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he calls Wimbledon ``the most important tournament for
me.'' It's the only tournament for him. He had dropped nine
first-round matches in the 14 events he had played this year before
coming here. If somebody returns Goran's serve, a dastardly chore
because he's 6-4 and lefthanded, half the time he doesn't know what
to do next other than cuss up a storm in Croatian.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever accused Ivanisevic of having fellow lefty Rod
Laver's tactical acumen. Of course, the Rocket probably never fired
104 rockets in four matches as Gorin' Goran has, either.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sweet, baby-faced Tim Henman, England's honey, turns
into a hun when he swaggers onto Centre Court. Nobody left in the
tournament has served harder than Henman's 133 mph, and he has
himself whacked 49 aces in reaching the quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Wimbledon today makes the memory of Bjorn Borg's
patiently hacking away for hours on end from the baseline seem a
fantasy. Borg was the ultimate right-place, right-time guy,
reaching the apex of his brilliant career when there was a dearth
of serve-and-volleyers and right before technology made his winning
form obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The Borg style was tedious in its own way, but it at least
resembled tennis as it was intended to be played. At Wimbledon,
circa the cold, wet summer of '98, we would be better off, I think,
with a little less bang for our bucks. Uh, pounds.

TRIPP TESTIFIES BEFORE GRAND JURY IN CLINTON INVESTIGATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Linda Tripp, whose tape recordings triggered a
criminal investigation of President Clinton, went before a federal
grand jury Tuesday to tell what she knows about the alleged
presidential affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Except for short breaks and lunch in a vacant room at the
federal courthouse, Tripp spent six hours with the panel examining
Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. Tripp secretly taped a number of her phone conversations
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old Pentagon worker was expected to return for more
testimony Thursday and in coming weeks, as prosecutors try to
determine whether Clinton and Lewinsky had sex, lied about it in
sworn statements and obstructed justice by trying to conceal the
alleged affair.
</P>
<P>
   Looking weary as she left the U.S. District Courthouse, Tripp
answered ``yes'' when asked if her session with the grand jury had
been easy. Otherwise, she declined comments as she made her way
past dozens of reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Her two grown children _ Allison and Ryan _ stood alongside her
attorney, Anthony Zaccagnini, outside the courthouse as he quoted
Tripp saying it had been ``easy to truthfully answer the questions
posed ... by the prosecutor and the grand jury.'' The lawyer
declined to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of virtual silence and seclusion, Tripp _ who
is viewed unfavorably by a vast majority of Americans in public
opinion polls _ said she was looking forward to her session with
grand jurors. Among her goals, she said in a Washington Post
interview, was convincing  &UR; them  &LR; she had not manipulated Lewinsky
as part of a book deal or an effort to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not cultivate Monica _ she cultivated me,'' said Tripp,
who is twice the age of Lewinsky. ``Monica is a very worldly
person. She educated me.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials dismissed questions about the timing of
Tripp's appearance, which coincided with the president's trip to
China. ``It hasn't had any impact on our work here,'' White House
spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House
counsel's office, said, ``We'll let the American people draw their
own conclusions about Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is being used by independent counsel Kenneth
Starr to examine whether Clinton or his associates tried to cover
up his alleged sexual misbehavior with Lewinsky or Kathleen Willey,
who has testified that the president fondled her during an
encounter outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Lewinsky have denied under oath engaging in
sex. Clinton has said publicly that he did not have a sexual
relationship with the former White House intern and did not
encourage anyone to lie. He also denied any improper behavior
during his November 1993 meeting with Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, an 18-year civil servant, was on the fringes of both the
alleged Lewinsky affair and the Willey encounter. A holdover from
the administration of President Bush, Tripp worked as a secretary
at the White House. She was among the last people who saw deputy
White House counsel Vincent Foster alive, and testified before a
Senate committee investigating his death, which was ruled a
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Tripp _ who by then had begrudgingly accepted a
transfer to an $88,200-a-year job at the Pentagon _ was quoted by
Newsweek magazine saying that in November 1993 she had seen Willey
emerge from the Oval Office with her lipstick smeared and her
clothing askew. Tripp recalled Willey smiling and saying she would
``never believe'' what had just happened in her meeting with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Before the article appeared, Tripp discussed the Willey episode
with Clinton's long-time friend and confidant, deputy White House
counsel Bruce Lindsey, who was involved in efforts to minimize
potential political damage Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   It was about this time that Tripp, who was working on a book
deal with New York publicist Lucianne Goldberg, began taping her
telephone conversations with Lewinsky. The two women had become
friends after Lewinsky had been shipped from the White House to a
job at the Pentagon. The working title of Tripp's book was Behind
Closed Doors: What I Saw at the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Tripp turned over about 20 hours of taped
conversations to Starr's investigators. She also gave them the
so-called ``talking points,'' two typewritten pages she said
Lewinsky provided as a guide to help throw Jones' lawyers off the
scent when they asked about the Willey encounter.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Starr's deputies, Tripp later wore an
electronic eavesdropping device and led Lewinsky through another
lengthy discussion of her alleged White House trysts with Clinton
and his effort to keep the relationship secret. Shortly after that
session, Tripp rushed off to meet with Jones' attorneys as they
prepared to question Clinton under oath about alleged extramarital
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Starr used the most recent tape to help secure
authority from Attorney General Janet Reno and a three-judge
federal panel to expand his investigation of Whitewater to include
possible White House involvement in obstruction of justice in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   In the tapes, according to published reports, Lewinsky discusses
a sexual relationship with the president and attempts by Clinton
and his friend Vernon Jordan to keep her from talking about it.
Some accounts indicate that Tripp appears leading Lewinsky into
making what could be incriminating statements.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a frequent golfing partner of the president, denied any
knowledge of a sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky. He
has acknowledged trying to help Lewinsky get a job in New York at
the behest of Clinton's personal secretary, Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   Since turning over the tapes, Tripp has continued her Pentagon
job but has worked from her suburban Maryland home and, at times,
from a government safehouse under the protection of FBI agents.

EXPERTS TOUT POSSIBILITY OF CONTROLLING, NOT ELIMINATING, AIDS
VIRUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Eradication of the AIDS virus from the body may never
be possible, but that does not mean the disease cannot be
controlled, experts said Tuesday at the 12th World AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
   While not optimistic about eliminating every cell infected with
the human immunodeficiency virus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in
Bethesda, Md., said he is hopeful the immune system can be
strengthened to control remaining cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us carry a herpes virus,'' he said. ``But we have
immune systems that keep it under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the ability of the immune system to recognize and
fight HIV would be the second step in treatment, after most of the
virus has been eliminated by potent drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A cure seemed right around the corner two years ago with reports
at the Vancouver AIDS conference in Canada that triple-drug
combinations, including the new protease inhibitors, were reducing
HIV levels in patients to undetectable levels and prolonging lives.
</P>
<P>
   But Fauci and others discovered a pool of inactive immune system
cells silently harboring HIV, making the task of a cure much
harder.
</P>
<P>
   This pool, spread throughout the body, appears to keep the
infection alive, even when treatment has reduced the virus in the
blood to undetectable levels for years, Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Dr. David Ho, head of the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center in New York City, had planned to discontinue
treatment in some patients where new drugs had reduced the virus to
undetectable levels for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   But discovery of this pool of infected cells caused Ho to change
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to plan strategies to deal with this late reservoir,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci said that when he evaluated people treated within days of
their infection with HIV, he found evidence that the pool of
resting infected cells already existed, indicating it is
established early in the infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this tells us is that even with the earliest possible
therapy, a pool of latently (or quiet) infected cells is
established very early,`` he said. ``The obvious question is 'Can
we do something to purge those latently infected cells?'''
</P>
<P>
   Fauci said it is not likely to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roberto Silicano of Johns Hopkins University Medical School
was more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now able to think in a rational way about HIV
eradication. My conclusion is that cure of HIV infection is not a
myth. In my opinion, this is a problem that we can tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Silicano said the newly discovered reservoir may be a major
barrier, but one that can be surmounted.
</P>
<P>
   The number of cells is low, no more than 1 million in some
cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took all of these cells, put them together and spun
them down to the bottom of a test tube, you would have a little
pellet that is barely visible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If patients are treated early, the size of the pool might be
reduced and the gradual death of cells in the pool accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been on the triple-drug combinations long enough to
determine how long it would take for the cells in the pool to die,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, Silicano said it has not been proven that
the reservoir can rekindle infection in a patient who stops
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, it is possible that in some situations, the
immune system may be able to control the small amount of virus that
is released when cells in this compartment are activated,''
Silicano said.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened in at least one case in Germany, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci warned that recent reports of serious side effects from
protease inhibitors and virus strains that are resistant to the
drug may make it impossible to continue treating patients lifelong.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients have developed high cholesterol and other high
blood fat levels, abnormal deposits of fat in the abdomen and upper
shoulders, and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not feasible to treat people indefinitely with toxic
anti-viral drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, he said, doctors have to develop a one-two
punch _ hitting the virus hard with potent anti-viral drugs and
then boosting immunity so that it can contain any deposits of
virally infected cells that remain.

CANADA, OTHER NATIONS PONDER THREAT OF U.S. CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA, June 30 _ Nineteen nations, including America's closest
friends, joined forces at a conference here Tuesday to protect
themselves from what they see as the gravest threats to their
collective cultures _ free trade and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the 19 countries, including Mexico, Britain and
Brazil, came to Ottawa to discuss ways to distinguish culture from
ordinary commerce, with the goal of denying the American
entertainment industry easy access to their markets.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, which organized the meeting, set the tone of the event
by not inviting representatives of the United States to
participate, though invitations had been extended to about 40
countries in all and half accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials said the United States was not included
because it did not have a Cabinet-level culture minister as do the
other countries. But the representative from Mexico, Rafael Tovar y
de Teresa, is president of the National Council for Culture and
Arts, which is roughly the equivalent of the National Endowment for
the Arts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the intent behind the snub seems to have been to
prevent the United States from imposing its view that Canada and
many other countries hide behind culture to erect commercial trade
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they closed the meeting to the public and to
news organizations to encourage frankness. But after some
embarrassment to the Canadians, the United States was allowed to
send observers from its embassy in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Observers and participants said the morning sessions went by
without any open hostility to American policies. Still, American
officials tried their best to keep the obvious slight from turning
into yet another skirmish over cultural policies. Gordon D. Giffin,
the U.S. ambassador to Canada, said he had recently met with
Canada's culture minister, Sheila Copps, and discussed at length
the blurry line between culture and the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that we'll be able to try to work things out,''
said Giffin, who attended a dinner for the culture ministers on
Monday night at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Hull,
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything that happened here was as low key as Giffin's
statement suggests. Canada and Mexico share little with countries
like Iceland, Croatia and others that attended the meeting except
for the fear that Hollywood and the rest of the American
entertainment industry threaten their cultures.
</P>
<P>
   The countries that took part want to form a special partnership
with enough influence to insure that culture is treated as an
important characteristic of a nation's identity, and not just
another category of merchandise governed by new international
treaties that seek unrestrained trade _ including films, television
programs, books and magazines _ between nations. ``Culture should
not be locked up in agreements on investment,'' said Marita Ulvsko,
Sweden's minister of culture.
</P>
<P>
   At a similar meeting on culture sponsored by the United Nations
in Stockholm in March, delegates recognized the need for closer
cooperation to protect their cultures. They agreed to press for
special exemptions for cultural needs in the continuing
negotiations for the latest global trade pact, the Multilateral
Agreement on Investment.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Ottawa, concrete actions seemed to be few, beyond
establishing a World Wide Web site linking culture ministries. But
there was an outpouring of concern over the loss of a nation's
culture to the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of its population shares both the English language,
as well as a continent-wide border with the United States, Canada
is in a unique position. Sixty percent of all the books sold in
Canada come from other countries, primarily the United States.
Three-quarters of the music played on Canadian radio is not
Canadian. Four of five magazines sold on newsstands in Canada are
foreign, primarily American. And when it comes to films, 96 percent
of what is shown on Canadian screens is foreign, the overwhelmingly
majority of it from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the best that Hollywood has to offer,'' said
Mrs. Copps, an outspoken critic of American policies on cultural
exports. ``In Canada, we also know, however, that culture is more
than Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, though it also shares a long border with the United
States, feels protected from overexposure to American culture by
the Spanish language. Although American films and television
programs are popular, the need for translations limits their broad
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize that there are international cultural
forces that promote the idea of common cultural standards,'' said
Tovar y de Teresa, who added that there was no need to panic. ``We
should be less fearful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he did not agree with the decision to exclude the
United States and that he hoped the next meeting of culture
ministers, which will be held in Mexico in 1999, would be more
inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's attempts to protect its culture have often infuriated
the United States. In the past, Canada has removed an American
country music cable station because a Canadian version became
available, and the government requires television and radio
stations to broadcast a minimum amount of Canadian material.
</P>
<P>
   But the most bruising battle with the United States has been
over Canada's attempts to protect its domestic magazines, which it
considers an essential aspect of Canadian culture. Canada has
desperately tried to keep out cheaply produced Canadian editions of
big American magazines, like Sports Illustrated, that carry few
Canadian articles but offer bargain advertising rates that the
Canadians can't match.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a stiff 80 percent excise tax on Canadian advertising
profits in local editions of American magazines was rejected by the
World Trade Organization, an international body that oversees trade
among most nations of the world, after the United States filed a
complaint. A proposal floated on Monday morning to impose a heavy
tax on Canadian companies that take out ads in the local editions
was abandoned later in the day. Now Canada is reported to be
considering an outright ban to prevent Canadian companies from
placing ads in those editions.

 &HT;    BOOKS ON DEMAND: A PUBLISHING BREAKTHROUGH?
 &HT;    580&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment
categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The book business is turning to a new page:
on-demand printing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it could work in the not-very-distant future. Looking
for a volume of retro rhymes, some bell-bottomed bibliophile will
bop into a local shop and browse menus on the computer screen of an
automatic book machine. Passing a credit card through an electronic
reader, the customer will transmit an order to a digital library,
which will then bounce a signal off a satellite to the book
machine's built-in printer.
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes or so, the book lover will be holding a
fresh paperbound copy of Rod McKuen's ``Listen to the Warm'' _
groovy, but sometimes hard to find, poetry from the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   This emerging technology could resurrect thousands of titles
that have gone out of print and exponentially expand the choices
for book buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have a big impact in terms of customer service,''
said Joyce Meskis, manager of the Tattered Covers Bookstore in
Denver, where the first BookMachine(cq) is to be installed by the
end of this year. ``There are so many titles in print that no
bookstore, now matter how large, could stock them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The in-store BookMachine is still being developed by the On
Demand Machine Corp. of St. Louis, but publishers and printers are
already using similar technology to take orders by phone or
Internet to provide next-day service on custom-made books.
</P>
<P>
   Through its Lightning Print Division, for instance, the nation's
largest book wholesaler, Ingram Books, prints books on demand _ as
few as one per order _ in its high-tech facility in LaVergne,
Tenn., and then ships the book or books to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real significance is that a book never has to go out of
print,'' said Larry Brewster, an Ingram vice president and general
manager of Lightning Print. ``In the long run, more books are going
to be available in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The same on-demand principles are being applied to other
elements of the popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, CDnow, a cyberspace record shop, lets customers
create customized CDs by selecting the artists and hits they want
from a Web site catalog of digitalized music. When the order and
credit card authorization are received via the Internet, the
company produces a personalized compact disc and mails it to the
customer. CDnow has licensed 60,000 songs from artists ranging from
Louis Armstrong to Patsy Cline to Bob Marley.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the book business _ burdened by the high costs of
keeping inventory on store shelves and returning unsold volumes _
that foresees quick economic relief from on-demand service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers no longer have to worry about unprofitable print
runs and warehousing costs,'' said Brewster. ``With on-demand
technology, you print to meet your demand _ whether the demand is
one copy or 1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The system reduces publishers' reprint risks for books that sell
slowly or sporadically over a long period. With on-demand printing,
the publisher no longer has to print a minimum run of 1,000 or so
copies and keep the books on shelves until orders hopefully arrive,
or allow books with some, albeit slight, demand to go out of print.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face this issue every month when we have our reprint
meetings,'' said Steven Schragis, publisher of Carol Publishing
Group in New Jersey. ``There are a lot of hard decisions when we're
out of stock on a particular title and fewer than 100 re-orders
come in. This program provides the answer for those books.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Ross, president of On Demand Machine Corp., said the
BookMachine will pay for itself in savings for bookstores. Ross
said $1.64 of the price of every book sold now goes to cover the
costs of shipping, inventory and return of unsold books to the
publisher. The BookMachine will eliminate these expenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the BookMachine will be leased, rather than sold, to
bookstores in order to ensure quality control. Many authors have
guarantees of print quality written into contracts with publishers,
Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Another major publisher involved in on-demand printing is Simon
&AMP; Shuster, which already has a digital library of 12,000 titles and
is adding 4,000 to 6,000 per year, said Don Seise, assistant vice
president of the company's Demand Production Center in Ramsey, N.J.
Most current on-demand printing is for paperbacks, he said, but
customers will be able to get hardcover books ``very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   While it might cost about $4.32 to print a book in the on-demand
system _ versus $1.85 each using the traditional offset printing
method in a 5,000-book run _ the advantage is obvious if only 200
books sell, Seise pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   The system is especially suited for academic books, where a
college professor might require a class of 50 students to buy a
certain book every semester or where textbooks are frequently
updated, rendering earlier editions obsolete, said Brewster of
Ingram's Lightning Press.
</P>
<P>
   However, on-demand printing will probably not be used for
best-sellers, at least until the technology makes another leap
forward, since traditional printing is cheaper if the books sell
fast and returns are minimal.
</P>
<P>
   So bookstores won't be bookless for a while.

 &HT;    BOOKS ON DEMAND: A PUBLISHING BREAKTHROUGH?
 &HT;    580&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment
categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The book business is turning to a new page:
on-demand printing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it could work in the not-very-distant future. Looking
for a volume of retro rhymes, some bell-bottomed bibliophile will
bop into a local shop and browse menus on the computer screen of an
automatic book machine. Passing a credit card through an electronic
reader, the customer will transmit an order to a digital library,
which will then bounce a signal off a satellite to the book
machine's built-in printer.
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes or so, the book lover will be holding a
fresh paperbound copy of Rod McKuen's ``Listen to the Warm'' _
groovy, but sometimes hard to find, poetry from the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   This emerging technology could resurrect thousands of titles
that have gone out of print and exponentially expand the choices
for book buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have a big impact in terms of customer service,''
said Joyce Meskis, manager of the Tattered Covers Bookstore in
Denver, where the first BookMachine(cq) is to be installed by the
end of this year. ``There are so many titles in print that no
bookstore, now matter how large, could stock them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The in-store BookMachine is still being developed by the On
Demand Machine Corp. of St. Louis, but publishers and printers are
already using similar technology to take orders by phone or
Internet to provide next-day service on custom-made books.
</P>
<P>
   Through its Lightning Print Division, for instance, the nation's
largest book wholesaler, Ingram Books, prints books on demand _ as
few as one per order _ in its high-tech facility in LaVergne,
Tenn., and then ships the book or books to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real significance is that a book never has to go out of
print,'' said Larry Brewster, an Ingram vice president and general
manager of Lightning Print. ``In the long run, more books are going
to be available in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The same on-demand principles are being applied to other
elements of the popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, CDnow, a cyberspace record shop, lets customers
create customized CDs by selecting the artists and hits they want
from a Web site catalog of digitalized music. When the order and
credit card authorization are received via the Internet, the
company produces a personalized compact disc and mails it to the
customer. CDnow has licensed 60,000 songs from artists ranging from
Louis Armstrong to Patsy Cline to Bob Marley.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the book business _ burdened by the high costs of
keeping inventory on store shelves and returning unsold volumes _
that foresees quick economic relief from on-demand service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers no longer have to worry about unprofitable print
runs and warehousing costs,'' said Brewster. ``With on-demand
technology, you print to meet your demand _ whether the demand is
one copy or 1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The system reduces publishers' reprint risks for books that sell
slowly or sporadically over a long period. With on-demand printing,
the publisher no longer has to print a minimum run of 1,000 or so

NEIGHBOR HELD IN `MEGAN'S LAW' SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ A 23-year-old neighbor of a paroled rapist who
authorities say was the target of vigilante gunfire two weeks ago
was arrested Tuesday and accused of firing five bullets into the
house where the parolee lived.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting at the home of the parolee, Frank Penna, 55,
occurred two weeks after the police circulated fliers notifying
neighbors and officials, under New Jersey's ``Megan's Law,'' that a
convicted rapist lived in their town.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect arrested Tuesday was identified as Jimmy Johnson,
23, of Linden, N.J. Johnson lives with his mother, Jean, and two
sisters, 9 and 17, in a two-family house around the corner from
Penna's home.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday at her home, the suspect's mother said
he was upset after reading the flier in early June about Penna.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson said she did not think that her son had fired the
five bullets into Penna's house. But after reading the flier, Mrs.
Johnson said, her son said: ```Oh, my God, my baby sister lives
next door to a rapist.' His mind just snapped that something might
happen to his baby sister. Me, my daughter and his baby sister are
Jimmy's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was charged with aggravated assault, illegal possession
of a handgun and illegal use of a handgun and ordered held in
$150,000 bail by Judge John Triarsi of New Jersey Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the importance New Jersey officials attached to
the case, the state attorney general, Peter G. Verniero,
interrupted his schedule to travel here from Trenton to announce
the arrest and denounce vigilantism against paroled sex offenders,
whose names and addresses are distributed to neighbors in police
fliers as a result of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law enforcement community is united in our intolerance of
any act of vigilantism against a known sex offender,'' Verniero
said in a news conference at the Union County Prosecutor's office.
``Megan's Law is not about violence or retribution. Unlawful
conduct will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The law recently survived one protracted legal challenge in the
federal court system and is now facing another by the office of New
Jersey's Public Defender. Both before and after the June 16
shooting, Verniero has voiced concerns that the law could be
legally jeopardized by any outbreak of violent acts against paroled
sex offenders who are publicly identified.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Defender's lawsuit, now before a federal appeals
court in Philadelphia, contends that the law is an unconstitutional
invasion of the privacy rights of the parolees.
</P>
<P>
   Until the shooting, the authorities say, Penna had lived without
incident at his home since his parole from prison in 1992, after
serving 16 years for raping two teen-age girls in Linden in 1976.
State parole officials say he is self-employed. They say he has not
violated terms of parole in the six years since his release.
</P>
<P>
   He has made no public statements about the shooting. Neighbors
say they have not seen him since.
</P>
<P>
   None of the bullets struck his basement apartment. All five
pierced the windows and walls of the first-floor apartment of Joan
Bazydlo, 66, as she watched television. She was not hurt.
Immediately after the shooting, she left the apartment and lived
with friends until she returned last Thursday. Ms. Bazydlo said
today she was thrilled that an arrest had been made.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Verniero and the Union County prosecutor, Thomas V. Manahan,
said they were confident of the evidence detectives had assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have evidence that leads us to the inescapable conclusion
this was a case of vigilantism,'' Manahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation has led to no other path,'' Verniero said.
</P>
<P>
   They said Johnson went to Linden police headquarters voluntarily
this afternoon after they distributed word in his neighborhood that
they wanted to question him about tips that he had a .45-caliber
handgun. Tests on shell casings found at Penna's house determined
that the five shots came from a .45, the authorities have said.
</P>
<P>
   During questioning Tuesday, Johnson told detectives that his .45
was at his father's home, Manahan said. Detectives found the
handgun there, the prosecutor said. Tests on Tuesday afternoon
confirmed that the recovered handgun was the one used to shoot at
Penna's house, Manahan said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Verniero declined to say if the suspect had made a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Manahan and Verniero said they were led to Johnson by a series
of tips. One resident, they said, saw two men running from the
vicinity of Penna's home after the shooting. Others residents of
Penna's neighborhood then directed detectives to a particular
neighborhood where rumors circulated about the shooting. There,
Manahan said, detectives picked up information about Johnson's
owning a .45. Eventually, they began looking for him for
questioning.

JUDGE RESCINDS PLEA DEAL, INFORMER MAY FACE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four years ago, Anthony S. Casso, who was depicted by
the authorities as one of the Mafia's most notorious leaders,
struck a deal with federal prosecutors. For disclosing mob secrets
and testifying against other high-ranking gangsters, he would
probably avoid a lifetime prison sentence even though he had
participated in 15 murder plots and other violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal judge in Brooklyn has authorized the government to
rescind that plea agreement on the ground that Casso, known by the
nickname Gaspipe, bribed prison guards to smuggle food and liquor
for him while in custody and that he lied about other prominent
mobsters who become government witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   He could now face life in prison. In a ruling released
yesterday, Judge Frederic Block of Federal District Court in
Brooklyn found that Casso, 58, had breached his signed cooperation
deal with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also denied his request that he be returned to the
federal witness protection program. Casso had said that he was
being treated harshly by prison authorities and that his safety was
endangered in a normal prison environment.
</P>
<P>
   Block's ruling clears the way for Casso to be sentenced next
Wednesday in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early '90s, federal law enforcement
officials identified Casso as the underboss and consigliere in the
Lucchese crime family, one of the five Mafia gangs in the New York
City region. In 1994, after becoming an informer, he pleaded guilty
to 70 crimes, including murder, attempted murder, extortion and
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors said they would
recommend leniency as a reward for his assistance in solving Mafia
crimes. He was placed in the witness protection program, which
provides inmates with more comforts than other prisoners get and
with new identities to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, George A. Stamboulidis, an assistant U.S. attorney,
told Casso's lawyers that he had violated the cooperation agreement
and that the government would not recommend leniency. Stamboulidis
said that Casso, while in two unidentified prisons, had assaulted
another inmate and bribed prison guards with cash, auto tires and
tickets to Broadway shows to supply him with vodka, wine and
steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Casso had made false statements that would
have wrongly discredited the testimony of two other top mobsters
who had defected: Salvatore Gravano, the former underboss of the
Gambino crime family, and Alphonso D'Arco, the former acting boss
of the Lucchese family.
</P>
<P>
   Casso, in a motion asking that the government honor the plea
agreement, said that prosecutors had acted in bad faith by not
pursuing his leads and not permitting him to testify at federal and
state trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put,'' Block said in his ruling, ``criminal behavior by
cooperators should be condemned, not condoned, and repudiation of
the government's obligations under a cooperation agreement is an
effective means of delivering such an important message.''
</P>
<P>
   Casso's lawyer, Matthew J. Brief, declined to be interviewed.

   Personal-care products like Rogaine or Retin A are aimed
specifically at a maturing populace, but age is not a big issue
when it comes to marketing fashion to baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say the strategy they employ to lure
middle-aged Americans into buying apparel transcends age.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion firms target the baby-boom generation by portraying
their products as fitting a certain lifestyle or state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty once was considered over the hill, but now it is widely
regarded as an age when people are at the peak of their
professional and personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   This new attitude is especially appealing to female consumers of
this era, who have broken the stereotype that maturity means a
woman is no longer attractive or desirable.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of fresh self-esteem among the middle-aged is the
target of many fashion firms: They're marketing their products as
part of an aspirational goal _ looking and feeling great,
regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   A brand _ whether it's as generic as Coca-Cola or has the
distinct cachet of Calvin Klein _ is often what compels consumers
to buy a bra, dress, suit or pair of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the power of a brand, targeting baby boomers _
generally defined as people born between 1946 and 1964 _ can be a
complicated issue.
</P>
<P>
   While the post-World War II generation can be characterized by
distinct demographic, social and economic traits, baby boomers have
a broad range of lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, fashion marketers said they are just as hard to peg as
their junior counterparts, who can range from 13 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   The segment includes boomers still living the disco lifestyle of
the '70s, those who prefer a quiet evening watching ``Seinfeld''
reruns, people dedicated to careers above all else, health
enthusiasts and those who ``shop till they drop'' at
Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   So while baby boomers may be an affluent and appealing target
segment, they also present a challenge to marketers because of the
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what some top executives _ a majority of whom are baby
boomers _ had to say about mid-life marketing:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Linda J. Wachner, &LR;  president, chairman and chief executive
officer of The Warnaco Group, said, ``I really don't think it's the
consumer as much as it is a state of mind when it comes to baby
boomers. As a matter of fact, I think consumers are sick of being
called baby boomers. It's really about an attitude and a look.
Staying sexy and pretty _ that's what the consumer wants.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wachner's estimation, the image of the glamorous, buffed
supermodel Christy Turlington is a main ingredient of the success
of Warnaco's ads for Calvin Klein Underwear and Calvin Klein Jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of women out there who don't look like Christy
Turlington, but many certainly want to look like her _ even though
they might not necessarily be young,'' Wachner said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Albert Shapiro, &LR;  vice president of corporate marketing at Liz
Claiborne Inc., stated, ``It's really all about a brand, not an
age. Fashion is all about lifestyle and attitude. I think in order
for fashion products to be successful, they need to have a
lifestyle appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that mature and glamour are relatively
exclusive. In fact, they are very clearly aligned. In part, the
more mature the woman, the more glamorous she is because she has a
sense of style, self-confidence and sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro noted that the ad campaigns for Liz Claiborne are
``distinguished to have universal appeal,'' and do not target
younger or older consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we selected Niki Taylor for our campaign,'' he
said. ``She's very appealing and approachable. We did consumer
focus groups with our ads, and compared her with other
possibilities. She does not turn people away. She represents the
Liz Claiborne attitude and lifestyle, regardless of age.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kenneth Zimmerman, &LR;  chairman and ceo of Kenar Enterprises,
said, ``We merchandise for a modern mind _ whether it's career or
casual. We use Linda Evangelista in our ads because she's a woman
in her 30s, not a girl. Kenar is addressing the real world. In our
ads, we show clothes for the woman with a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenar is about lifestyle and looking good. If you walk into my
Madison Avenue or East Hampton shops, my customers include three
generations, ranging from 21-year-olds to 40 and 70-year-olds,''
Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 48. I have a son who's 20, and I feel as young as him. He
borrows my clothes and I sometimes borrow his jeans. I think a lot
of people in America think like that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman said he has taken the message of fashion one step
further by addressing two hot-button issues: breast-cancer
awareness and pediatric AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign for early detection of breast cancer is targeted at
the baby boomer who buys Kenar; the other ad for pediatric AIDS is
aimed at a younger woman who most likely has young children, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers _ young and old _ are concerned about these
issues,'' Zimmerman said. ``We want them to know we are, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Barry Boyd, &LR;  executive vice president of the Hanes and Hanes
Her Way megabrands at Sara Lee Knits, noted, ``Our strategy
definitely is about brand, not age. Our brands are as generic as
Coca-Cola. And they have very broad, public appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have customers who are older, younger and people
in-between. We are very aware of demographics and age trends.
However, a lot of ad agencies today tend to think very young _ too
young. I try to discourage that. The 50-year-old of today is very
different from the 50-year-old of yesterday. She's far more
confident and she doesn't think like her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nancy Friedman, &LR;  vice president of marketing for Slackers, a
men's pants brand at Levi Strauss Co., noted, ``We introduced the
Slackers brand two years ago specifically to meet the needs of male
baby boomers, who are trying to adjust to the casualization and new
dress codes in corporate America. They felt they needed more
options between khakis and suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The launch has been very successful. The newest ad campaign
will be all about a competitive edge, doing well at work and home,
wanting to be noticed. We chose models in their late 30s _ men who
were not too modely, but nice looking; looks a consumer can relate
to,'' Friedman said. ``We've heard a lot of feedback from women
about doing a line for female baby boomers. That's on the
horizon.'' &QL;

   Submit to government graciously
</P>
<P>
   By Rowland Nethaway
</P>
<P>
   c: 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When Southern Baptists recently voted to amend
their essential statement of beliefs to declare that a wife should
``submit herself graciously'' to her husband's leadership, I
wondered if they could get away with that.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, it would seem to be illegal under some
federal law _ or at least unconstitutional _ for any
state-sanctioned institution to call for unequal treatment between
the sexes .
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Southern Baptists may not believe that wives
submitting to their husband's leadership is unequal as long as
husbands live up to their end of the bargain, which says a husband
must ``provide for, protect and lead his family.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if Southern Baptists, or some other denomination,
didn't believe that the marriage partnership was equal and said so
right up front? Could the government step in at that point?
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment says, ``Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion.'' That separation between
church and state appears to mean that the government cannot meddle
with the faith-based practices of religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, logic tells us that our society would never allow a
religion to practice human sacrifices, as many religions have done
throughout human history. Courts have allowed at least one religion
to practice animal sacrifices but that was highly controversial and
may have been overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the government got away with telling the Mormons that
they couldn't practice polygamy even though that was a faith-based
practice among consenting adults that harmed no one and was not
considered unusual in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The government felt that a man with multiple wives somehow hurt
society. In the case of the Mormons, the government sided with
established American religions and its own government-approved view
of traditional marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to interfere with the Mormons' belief in polygamy
appears to be in violation of the First Amendment's establishment
clause. But the government got away with it because that's what
most people wanted, an exercise that might be described as the
tyranny of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when David Koresh, the Branch Davidians'
self-proclaimed messiah, declared that only he could have sex with
all Branch Davidian women, the government had a clear duty to step
in and stop him from committing statutory rape on the children,
despite claims that sex with children was a faith-based practice.
</P>
<P>
   A Libertarian-type argument might be made that the government
shouldn't be in the business of sanctioning marriages in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   This argument would hold that it's none of the government's
business whether its citizens enter into the institution of holy
matrimony. Marriages should be left to the preachers, priests,
rabbis. Magistrates, bureaucrats, politicians and tax collectors
should butt out.
</P>
<P>
   Why does the government go to all the trouble to pass laws and
procedures to perform civil marriage ceremonies? Is it a courtesy
to atheists?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. More likely, however, the government has gotten
involved in marriages for the same reason the government gets
involved in everything _ it thinks it knows what's best, there are
votes in it and anything the government controls, it also can tax.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians know there are votes in being pro-family, at least
the popular view of America's traditional family structure.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Congress sees votes in taking up the Christian
Coalition's war on the so-called ``marriage tax.'' Despite the
flaws and the rush to judgment, legislation to repeal the marriage
tax will pass because the politicians, like the Southern Baptists,
are in the marriage business to stay.

 &HT;    Cable TV festival brings back early black films
 &HT;    (With BLACKFILMS-LINEUP)
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A lot of independent films are made to satisfy
the creative desires of the filmmaker. But pioneering black
independent filmmakers of the 1920s and '30s had a more profound
goal: to counter the demeaning, racist depictions of their people
seen in mainstream films at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Few Americans, black or white, know anything about these films,
called ``race films'' because they were made especially for black
audiences. Distribution was limited when they were made, and, in
the decades since, many have been forever lost.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Classic Movies has located 29 of these historic classics
and will air them on five consecutive Wednesdays, beginning July 1,
under the umbrella title ``A Separate Cinema.'' The films start at
7 p.m. and sometimes run all night, so serious film buffs should
prepare to do some serious taping.
</P>
<P>
   Husband-and-wife actors Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee serve as hosts
of the festival from the historic Douglass Theater in Macon, Ga.,
one of the first all-black theaters in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Modern audiences may be surprised by some of these movies. In
prolific filmmaker Oscar Micheaux's 1920 film ``Within Our Gates,''
for example, there are graphic scenes of lynchings and scenes of a
white man attempting to rape a black woman. In a later Micheaux
film, ``Scar of Shame,'' the focus is on class issues within the
black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these films first came out, there was a whole spectrum of
response among blacks,'' said Thomas Cripps, author and retired
history professor from Morgan State University in Baltimore. ``Some
people thought it was great because everybody was black. Others
said, 'Oh, you shouldn't see those Oscar Micheaux movies. They're
full of crime and sin and corruption.' There were others who
thought they were primitive compared to Hollywood films. That whole
spectrum surely will repeat itself. Some will marvel, and others
will say this is a past we should forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Cripps, who is white, became interested in black cinema when he
was studying Southern history and working on his dissertation on
black Republican politics in the South. A pioneer in the study of
black film, he wrote a paper in 1962, ``The Negro Reaction to the
Motion Picture `The Birth of a Nation,''' that attracted attention
in academic circles.
</P>
<P>
   White viewers, who probably have never heard of filmmakers such
as Micheaux, likely will have the same varied responses. Indeed,
the production values are often crude and the acting less than
impressive. But the stories, especially in the context of the
post-Civil War times, are fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of this early work has been dismissed because it was
thought of as perpetuating stereotypes,'' said Pearl Bowser, film
archivist and producer of ``Midnight Ramble,'' the '94 PBS
documentary about race films that introduces the TCM festival.
``Even Micheaux was criticized for that. ... We need to look at
these movies today not from the viewpoint of Hollywood stereotypes
but in relation to what the filmmaker is trying to tell us about
how he uses those stereotypes in the context of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn-of-the-century films and literature, black people were
portrayed as ape-like, oversexed and simple-minded. Such insulting
portrayals inspired the first independent black filmmakers, who
formed their own companies and produced their films on shoestring
budgets. They were driven by the lack of opportunity in mainstream
movies and by the deep desire to respond to negative images. The
biggest inspiration in the black film movement came from D.W.
Griffith's 1915 epic, ``The Birth of a Nation,'' which glorified
the Ku Klux Klan and vilified blacks. President Wilson praised the
film as an ``artistic triumph,'' and crowds flocked to see it.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, ``race movies'' arrived. Brothers George and
Noble Johnson of Omaha, Neb., formed the Lincoln Motion Picture
Company and began producing films. Their 1916 movie ``Birth of a
Race'' was a pointed response to Griffith's movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interoffice memos from Lincoln Films referred to the need to
get something on screen that repudiates what Griffith put on the
screen,'' said Cripps, a consultant on the series. ``In essence,
they said, `We must make these because they make those.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, Micheaux, an author and rancher in South Dakota, wrote
and directed his first film, ``The Homesteader.'' Sadly, that film
has been lost, but ``Within Our Gates'' was recovered in 1979 by
Cripps. The American Film Institute had found several films in a
vault in Spain, and one was missing its opening title. Cripps was
called in to investigate, and he recognized the film as ``Within
Our Gates,'' a controversial work that was banned in the South
because theaters were afraid it would lead to rioting. Festival of
little-known talents
</P>
<P>
   ``A Separate Cinema'' is organized into theme nights, starting
Wednesday with an evening devoted to Micheaux films, including the
newly restored version of ``The Symbol of the Unconquered,'' a
romantic drama about racial pride that criticizes blacks who pass
for whites. It also includes a stinging attack on the KKK. The
restored version has a new score composed by jazz legend Max Roach.
</P>
<P>
   July 8th's presentations feature the films of the multi talented
Paul Robeson, one of the few early black stars with whom white
viewers may be familiar, and Herbert Jeffrey, who starred in a
series of Westerns and soon became known as ``the black Gene
Autry'' because of his singing cowboy roles.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, the spotlight shines on the films of the glamorous
and exotic Josephine Baker and the crusading director-writer-actor
Spencer Williams (best-known today as Andy from ``Amos 'n' Andy''),
who spent most of the early '40s working in Texas (based in Dallas
but filming all over the state) making religious allegories such as
``The Blood of Jesus'' and ``Go Down, Death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those movies were very sentimentally religious,'' Cripps said.
``They were marvelously touching for being unashamedly
fundamentalist.''
</P>
<P>
   The films showcased on July 22 are crime stories, mirroring the
popular Warner Bros. gangster and mystery movies of the time. Ralph
Cooper, the top black mystery star, is featured.
</P>
<P>
   The festival winds up July 29 with sports and musical films of
the '30s and '40s. First up on the final night is ``The Jackie
Robinson Story,'' which starred the famous baseball player as
himself but was produced by a white company. This 1950 film marked
the end of the all-black race movies. Included in the musicals that
night is the film debut of Lena Horne in ``Duke Is Tops.'' Making
black films accessible
</P>
<P>
   So, why has it taken so long for these films to come to light?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just too many problems to mess with,'' Cripps said.
``They're a risk in terms of content because they're not like
Hollywood movies. They wear their low budgets on their sleeves. And
they've been inaccessible to the point that people say they're
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that fewer than 100 of an estimated 500 films produced
by black independents still exist is shocking, but Cripps said
there was no conscious attempt to get rid of them. Economics played
a big part in the loss. Because black film companies had so little
capital, they made fewer prints and had fewer vaults in which to
store them. Shot on nitrate film stock, they deteriorated quickly
and sometimes even exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood movies have disappeared, too,'' Cripps said. ``About
50 percent of all films ever made before 1950 were lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The early black films will have their largest audience ever
during the airing of ``A Separate Cinema.'' Even in their heyday,
race movies had limited exposure. They often were screened after
midnight (hence, the term ``midnight ramble'') in segregated
all-white theaters or in the relatively small number of all-black
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   But they managed to have a profound impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were seen as a resource that could transform what people
thought of themselves,'' Cripps said.

 &HT;    'Alice in Wonderland' mystery can drive one Mad
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For copies of Jane's book, ``Thanks for
Asking!'' _ a compilation of more than 600 favorite questions and
answers _ call 288-6291 or (800) 424-6291.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you answer two questions? What does the 10/6 mean on
the Mad Hatter's hat in ``Alice in Wonderland''? What do the words
``Ve Ri Tas'' mean (on a school sweatshirt)? _M. B.
</P>
<P>
   A: It means you did not study Latin; veritas is Latin for truth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mad Hatter's hat sports a card with ``10/6'' on it, which
had me stumped until I contacted the president of the Lewis Carroll
Society of North America. Joel Birenbaum says, ``It stands for the
price, 10 shillings and 6 pence. The hat is for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Interested in finding out more about Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a
k a Lewis Carroll? Contact the society at www.lewiscarroll.org or
write Ellie Luchinsky, LCSNA Secretary, 18 Fitzharding Place,
Owings Mill, Md. 21117.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am in the third grade. May I please have Michael Jordan's
address? I would like to tell him that I like him. Thank you. _Sean
Dunn
</P>
<P>
   A: Your good wishes will brighten the Chicago Bulls star's day.
</P>
<P>
   Write to the six-time NBA Finals MVP at his fan club: Jump,
Inc., 676 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 2930, Chicago, Ill. 60611. You
can also e-mail him at jump-inc.com. Don't wait by the mailbox.
Jordan receives about 1,000 letters a week, and perhaps more as
fans (they are legion) aim to persuade the congenial superstar not
to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My drinking glasses are developing a soap film in my
dishwasher. How can I remove the film and prevent this from
happening again? _Gerald W.
</P>
<P>
   A: You may not be able to remove the film. Some people swear by
regular use of Jet Dry. Denture cleanser often removes film unless
the glass has been etched by mineral deposits. Clean the inside of
the dishwasher with citric-based cleanser (diluted lemon juice).
</P>
<P>
   Wash the filmy glasses in vinegar (add a little to the load). Do
not place utensils or metal objects in the dishwasher with the
glasses. Repeat if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar: The verdict on emu eggs is in from the
American Emu Association-backed study by the Food Protein Research
&AMP; Development Center of Texas A&AMP;M University. The study says an emu
egg has about twice the cholesterol of a chicken egg but it is 10
times the size, weighing about one pound each. You do the math. And
oh, yes, the emu eggshell is green.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: It's time for all to realize: Feminism is not dead
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend and I groaned in chorus over the Time magazine cover:
``Is Feminism Dead?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wishful thinking,'' harrumphed Lynda. ``How many times have
you seen that cover?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we shouldn't take it so personally. This was, after all,
the magazine that once asked the same question about God.
</P>
<P>
   The cover art got us hopping mad, all over again. The lineup of
photos was intended to represent the state of feminism throughout
the ages: Susan B. Anthony. Betty Friedan. Gloria Steinem. Ally
McBeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ally McBeal? What is she doing there? Is she the Anti-Feminist _
proof positive feminism today is a waif, next to nonexistent?
</P>
<P>
   Those of us still brazen enough to call ourselves feminists
aren't surprised by the Time article. Ally's part of a historic
lineup, all right _ media attempts to define, and diminish,
feminism. To explain who we are, what we think and how marginal we
are.
</P>
<P>
   Time trumpets: ``Feminism: It's All About Me! Want to know what
today's chic young feminist thinkers care about? Their bodies!
Themselves!''
</P>
<P>
   What evidence do they use to support their
``decline-of-feminism''? Where are they looking for the ``face of
feminism''?
</P>
<P>
   Surprise! They're looking at other magazines (Exhibit A is the
celebrity-studded 25th anniversary party for Ms. magazine). They're
looking at Hollywood and pop culture. They're looking everywhere
except the places where real women live.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes on to compare ``then and now,'' in quick
snippets, comparing feminism past to whatever is most frivolous in
today's society: protests against male violence and Vietnam vs.
Glenn Close and Whoopi Goldberg performing The Vagina Monologues (a
performance piece about female private parts). Mary Richards vs.
Ally McBeal. Helen Reddy vs. the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   What a clever sleight-of-hand, taking the most insulting images
of women and linking them with feminism. Since when are feminists
responsible for the Spice Girls? If the '60s were the high water
mark for feminism, how do you explain I Dream of Jeannie?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to pull examples from popular culture to prove
whatever point you want to make. It's a lot harder to visit the
places where feminism is at work in the lives of women.
</P>
<P>
   I wish Time had visited Imogen Trolander's park in Yellow
Springs. Correction: It's not Trolander's park, it's the Women's
Park, and she's busily preparing for its dedication July 19, in
honor of the 150th anniversary of the first Woman's Rights
Convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y. ``It's a real turnoff that the
popular national media is so insulting to women and so disregarding
of their strength, their work, their wisdom,'' Trolander said.
</P>
<P>
   Trolander, married for 50 years, has seen too much progress to
feel downhearted about a vapid magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course feminism is alive and well,'' she said. It's alive
and well in the home, in the workplace, and, she hopes, in the
Women's Park: ``It's not a park for a big achievers. It's a bed of
tiles with the name of a woman _ any woman that somebody wants to
honor _ and some few words that describe her.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the kind of place where you could find the name of
your mother, your aunt, your kindergarten teacher. But you won't
find Ally McBeal.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonnette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: ... So the risk of transmission with swimming pool
water, or even wastewater, is virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where has the E. coli bacteria been all my life? As a kid, I
played in many swimming pools throughout the summers, but I don't
ever recall hearing about E. coli until recently. Is it a new
strain?
</P>
<P>
   A: It isn't new. The E. coli implicated in the current outbreak,
0157:H7, was identified in 1982 as a source of illness in people,
said the CDC's Katy Hopkins. That was the outbreak related to
contaminated hamburgers in the Northwest. There are literally
hundreds of strains of E. coli, most of which are harmless, Hopkins
added. They live within the intestines and don't cause any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many times has Larry King of CNN been married?
</P>
<P>
   A: He took the vows for the seventh time last November.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain what ``derivatives'' are? I've read that many
banks and insurance companies are heavily invested in them.
</P>
<P>
   A: Derivatives are financial contracts whose gains and losses
are tied to the performance of underlying financial instruments,
such as stocks and bonds. An option to buy or sell a stock is one
example of a derivative. Many companies use derivatives to hedge,
or reduce risk, from changes in interest rates, currency values and
commodity prices. But they also are used for speculation, and some
derivatives are considered more risky than others.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the case of Jeff Smith, ``The Frugal Gourmet'' on PBS,
ever resolved? Several months ago I heard some accusations were
made about him, but I never saw a followup.
</P>
<P>
   A: Smith has been accused of molestation by several men who
allege that he used his power as their employer to force them to
perform sex acts with him years ago. Edward Winskill, Smith's
attorney, has denied all accusations in the lawsuits and in public
statements by the plaintiffs. No criminal charges have ever been
filed against Smith and the statute of limitations has expired on
the alleged incidents. A civil case is set for trial July 9. One
sexual abuse lawsuit against Smith has been dismissed in Pierce
County, Wash., Superior Court. It involved Clinton Smith (no
relation to Jeff Smith), who was sentenced to four years in prison
in 1981, partly for stealing money from the Chaplain's Pantry, a
business Jeff Smith owned in Tacoma, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in a story I heard about the Greenbrier Hotel
in West Virginia. It supposedly had an underground area where U.S.
government officials would go in case of a nuclear attack.
Apparently its existence was made public only when information was
declassified in recent years. Can you tell me about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The former government relocation facility under the hotel was
a top secret of the Cold War. ``Project Greek Island,'' as it was
code-named, was designed to house members of Congress in the event
of a nuclear strike on Washington. The Greenbrier is in White
Sulphur Springs, W.Va., a four- or five-hour drive from Capitol
Hill. The secret 112,000-square-foot bunker was built into a
mountain when the hotel's West Virginia Wing was added in 1960. Its
existence was revealed in 1992, and in 1995 the bunker was opened
for public tours _ but with its furnishings and equipment removed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A wonderful montage of the NBA playoffs was shown recently on
ESPN ``SportsCenter.'' It was done to the music of ``He Got Game.''
Is it being sold to the public?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, ESPN says it's not available for purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did CNBC cancel the Charles Grodin TV program?
</P>
<P>
   A: When ``Charles Grodin'' was canceled abruptly earlier this
month, midway through its fourth season, the official reason cited
was that the talk show and the network were going in different
directions. NBC News President Andrew Lack, who is responsible for
CNBC's prime-time and weekend programmimg, said the network's
increasing focus on news-oriented programming didn't mesh well with
Grodin's increasing focus on social issues, ``and that warranted a
change.'' USA Today reported this comment from Grodin after he was
zapped: ``It's remarkable that they let me do it for three years. I
go against the grain and the grain is bottom line and business.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: News reports keep recommending that we wash our vegetables
and fruits as a safeguard against bacteria. Does that mean just
rinsing them with water, or should we use some kind of soap? If
soap is needed, can it be dishwashing soap, or should it be
antibacterial?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't need to use any kind of detergent, bleach or
special rinse. In fact, that would do more harm than good, says
Judy Harrison, food scientist with the University of Georgia
Extension Service. Her advice: Remove and discard the outer leaves
from green, leafy vegetables and wash one or two leaves at a time
thoroughly in clean water. You can peel other fruits and vegetables
to eliminate possible surface bacterial contamination, but some of
the fiber will be lost. So you're better off just washing them
thoroughly, using running water.
</P>
<P>
   One other recommendation is to choose fruits and vegetables from
a ``name-brand, reputable company,'' Harrison added. ``They tend to
have more strict control measures in place to ensure sanitation and
safety of their foods.'' She also pointed out that the United
States has the safest food supply in the world, so the problem here
isn't as acute as in some other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A committee is being formed to investigate the transfer of
technological information to China under the administration of
President Clinton. I thought this sort of thing was started in the
Ronald Reagan administration, and continued in that of George Bush.
Don't I also remember that either China or Japan gave Reagan $2
million after he left office? Which country was it, and why was it
given?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're likely thinking of the case of Reagan's visit to Japan
in October 1989. Reagan, who had left office the previous January,
and his wife, Nancy, were guests of the Fujisankei Communications
Group, a leading Japanese media conglomerate. Some eyebrows were
raised, particularly in the United States, when it was reported
that Fujisankei paid Reagan a $2 million fee to give two 20-minute
speeches during his stay. While Reagan foes questioned the taste
and seemliness of a former U.S. president accepting such an
enormous sum for so little work, his staffers rebuffed the
criticism by saying large honoraria were the norm in Japan at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand Bill Gates' net worth is an estimated $40
billion. When Cornelius Vanderbilt died, his fortune was estimated
at more than $105 million. What would that amount be today, if it
had been invested since 1877?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gates would look like a pauper in comparison, said Lawrence
D. Brown of Georgia Georgia State University. Brown based his
assessment on the assumption that Vanderbilt's $105 million would
have earned a return of 10 percent a year, compounded annually.
That's essentially what the stock market has done on an annual
basis over the past 121 years, he said. By that reckoning, at the
end of 1997 Vanderbilt's $105 million would have ballooned to $10.7
trillion. ``Vanderbilt would have been worth more than 267 times
what Gates is worth today,'' Brown said. ``Or, to put it another
way, for every dollar that Gates has, assuming it's 40 billion,
Vanderbilt would have almost 268.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonnette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Greg Louganis, the Olympic diver, who has
HIV? How is he doing now? He hasn't been in the news lately.
</P>
<P>
   A: The four-time Olympic gold medalist, who found out in 1988
that he had tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is
making the rounds to promote ``Looking to the Light,'' a video
diary of his life over the past two years. The video shows his
tedious daily routine of taking several medications that help him
battle HIV and a wide range of side effects. He participated in the
video project in lieu of another book. His autobiography,
``Breaking the Surface,'' was a best seller and was made into a USA
Network movie.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he was
appearing at a bookstore, he said he has ``some great doctors'' who
look after him physically and mentally. ``For some people, HIV has
become their first occupation,'' Louganis said. ``I just have other
things to do. ... I am reminded every time I take my medication,
but there are other things going on that's taking my focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Louganis also makes speeches, to student groups among others,
about health issues. ``With all my stumbles and falls, I've picked
myself up and I'm still going,'' he told an audience recently at
Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The League of Conservation Voters grades members of Congress
annually on their voting record on environmental issues. How can I
contact that group to get its scorecard?
</P>
<P>
   A: The scorecard is produced for each session of Congress. The
organization welcomes inquiries from everyone interested in knowing
how members of Congress have voted on issues related to the
environment, said spokeswoman Lisa Wade.
</P>
<P>
   The scorecards are free and can be obtained by writing: League
of Conservation Voters, 1707 L St. NW, 750, Washington, DC 20036;
or by calling toll-free 1-888-744-8683 or 202-785-8683. You also
can request the information by e-mail (lcv(at)lcv.org). And for
those with Internet access, the League has posted its scorecards on
its home page: www.lcv.org.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Margaret Thatcher doing these days? She seems to have
dropped out of the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   A: Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven _ her title since 1992 _ still
pops up on the lecture circuit from time to time. But other than
that, the former British prime minister appears to prefer a low
profile at her base in London. In April, she met with Zhu Rongji,
China's newly selected premier, during his visit to London. And she
traveled recently to the United States to address a group at St.
Louis University on the topic ``Reflections on Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think Thatcher has been forgotten, however. She was one of
only thee women selected by Time in April for its list of 20 people
designated ``the most influential leaders and revolutionaries of
the past century'' (the other two: Eleanor Roosevelt and Margaret
Sanger).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the atomic-powered merchant ship
Savannah?
</P>
<P>
   A: The N.S. (nuclear ship) Savannah is moored in the James River
at Norfolk, Va., along with about 100 other vessels in the James
River Reserve Fleet. It's under the jurisdiction of the U.S.
Maritime Administration. The Savannah, the world's first
atomic-powered merchant vessel, was launched in 1959. In 1979 it
was retired from active service, and in 1981 was moved to
Charleston's Patriots Point Naval &AMP; Maritime Museum, home of the
USS Yorktown (CV-10) and other vessels. The Savannah was designated
a National Historic Landmark in 1991 and was turned over to the
Maritime Administration and moved to Norfolk in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 595 1/2-foot Savannah will be in the James River
Reserve Fleet for quite some time _ because of radiation concerns
it will be at least 30 years before it can be safely scrapped,
according to the maritime agency's Robert Rohr _ it won't be
reopened to the public. It is constantly monitored with remote
alarm systems to ensure its ``integrity,'' Rohr said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Garth Brooks is the No. 3 best-selling recording
artist of all time. Is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: He appears to be No. 2. International statistics are hard to
come by, so this information applies to the United States. Brooks,
with total album sales of about 68 million, is second only to the
Beatles, whose total U.S. album sales are about 105 million (1
billion discs and tapes worldwide). But there's an asterisk
involved: As Brooks himself has noted, the keeping of statistics
didn't begin seriously until well after Elvis Presley was
established.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the current wages and benefits of the striking
General Motors workers?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to The Wall Street Journal, GM pays $44 an hour, on
average, in wages and benefits to its workers who are members of
the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent editorial said tobacco kills 400,000 Americans a
year. How does that compare to alcohol-related deaths?
</P>
<P>
   A: More than 100,000 deaths annually in the United States can be
attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, according to the
National Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you print ``13 Things Graduates Need to Know But Are
Never Taught,'' as read by Paul Harvey recently?
</P>
<P>
   A: Harvey read ``Rules Not Learned'' by Charles Sykes, author of
``Dumbing Down Our Kids,'' and is reprinted with permission of Paul
Harvey News:
</P>
<P>
   (1) Life is not fair. Get used to it. (2) The world won't care
about your self-esteem as much as your school does. The world will
expect you to accomplish something before you feel good about
yourself. (3) You will NOT make $40,000 a year right out of high
school. You won't be a vice president with a car phone until you
earn both. (4) If you think your teacher is rough, wait till you
get a boss. He doesn't have tenure. (5) Flipping burgers is not
beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for
burger-flipping. They called it ``opportunity.'' (6) If you screw
up, it's not your parents' fault. So don't whine about your
mistakes; learn from them. (7) Before you were born, your parents
weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way paying your
bills, cleaning your room and listening to you tell how idealistic
you are. So before you save the rain forest from the blood-sucking
parasites of your parents' generation, try de-lousing the closet in
your own room. (8) Your school may have done away with winners and
losers, but life hasn't. In some schools, they've abolished failing
grades. They'll give you as many times as you want for the right
answer. This, of course, bears not the slightest resemblance to
anything in real life. (9) Life is not divided into semesters. You
don't get summers off. And very few employers are interested in
helping you ``find yourself''; do that on your own time. (10)
Television is not real life. In real life, people actually have to
leave the coffee shop and go to jobs. (11) Be nice to nerds;
chances are you'll end up working for nerds. (12) Smoking does not
make you look ``cool;'' it makes you look moronic. Ditto for purple
hair and pierced body parts. (13) Living fast and dying young is
romantic _ only until you see one of your peers at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   And this, June graduates, is a footnote of my (Harvey's) own:
Get up when you fall down. Get up when you fall down. Michael
Jordan has missed the basket 9,000 times. He has lost almost 300
games. Twenty-six times, Michael Jordan has been trusted to take
the game-winning shot _ and missed. Jordan says, ``Over and over
and over again, I have failed. And that is why I succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: The book ``The Fourth Estate'' by Jeffrey Archer has a story
about a media mogul who takes his yacht out and jumps overboard to
commit suicide. Isn't this something that actually happened a few
years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're thinking about the case of Robert Maxwell, flamboyant
British billionaire press baron who was called ``the Citizen Kane
of his time.'' His unclothed body was found floating in the
Atlantic near the Canary Islands Nov. 5, 1991, several hours after
he was reported missing from his yacht. An official pathologists'
report from the Spanish National Institute of Toxicology concluded
that Maxwell, 68, had suffered a heart attack before he fell off
his yacht. The pathologists ruled out the possibility that his
death had been caused by poison, drugs, alcohol or foul play,
noting that there were no signs of violence on the body other than
marks on the head, apparently caused when the body was lifted out
of the water by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the report, some people speculated that Maxwell's death
may not have been from a heart attack. Not long before he died,
Maxwell had been accused in a book by U.S. investigative reporter
Seymour Hersh of having close ties to the Israeli secret service.
Maxwell was buried Nov. 10, 1991, at the Mount of Olives in
Jerusalem. He received what was close to a state funeral, with
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and President Chaim Herzog in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article mentioned that Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.)
receives $37,500 in veterans' benefits. What is that all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cleland receives annual disability benefits from the Veterans
Administration in the amount of $37,506, said his spokeswoman,
Julie Robinson. Cleland was left a triple amputee by wounds
suffered in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Will Smith paid for his role in the original ``Men
in Black''? I heard he would make $20 million for the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hollywood sources say Smith was paid $5 million for ``MiB.''
Although his base salary for the sequel is said to be $20 million,
it could be more. Like other heavyweights involved in the film _
Tommy Lee Jones and Barry Sonnenfeld _ he is said to be seeking
whatever amount is higher, the $20 million or 10 percent of the
film's gross income. Steven Spielberg, by the way, is seeking 20
percent of the sequel's gross.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article said that cholorine, when used in swimming pools,
wipes out virtually all bacteria and most viruses, including all
coliform, polio virus, hepatitis A and common cold germs.
Conspicuously omitted was any reference to the AIDS virus. Does
chlorine kill that, too?
</P>
<P>
   A: The risk of transmission in swimming pools or whirlpools of
HIV (the AIDS virus), or other viruses such as hepatitis B or
herpes simplex type II, is so low that it's unmeasurable, according
to medical experts at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. While the usual amount of halogen used to disinfect
swimming pools and whirlpools is considered more than sufficient to
kill these viruses, ``chemical germicide,'' such as chlorination,
isn't a factor. The simple dilution of the water wouldn't allow the
pathogenic agent to invade a susceptible individual, the CDC adds.
So the risk of transmission with swimming pool water, or even
wastewater, is virtually nonexistent.

 &HT;    Open winner often overlooked
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Her name is Alison Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   She's the one who actually won the U.S. Women's Open last year.
</P>
<P>
   You may have missed her. Not because she's only 60 inches tall _
well, maybe because of that, too _ but mostly because the giant she
beat by one shot on the Witch Hollow Course at Pumpkin Ridge in
North Plains, Ore., was the legendary Nancy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   You'd have thought Nicholas was the Witch Hollow witch for
having turned Lopez's Open coach into a pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a lot of sleep (Saturday night before 1997's
final round),'' said Nicholas, who was born in Gibraltar and lives
in England. ``I just wanted to enjoy (Sunday) and soak it all in. I
knew the crowd was going to be with Nancy all the way. I was
prepared for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the longest day of my life, I can tell you that. The
last day was magnificent. It was a fairy-tale scenario playing
Nancy Lopez head-to-head. It's something you dream about, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas, in fact, had done exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   She was a 17-year-old European with a handicap befitting a bogey
golfer when someone gave her a book. The subject was Lopez, who at
the time was crashing onto the LPGA Tour and winning almost every
tournament she played.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of decades later, about the only thing missing from the
Lopez resume' is a U.S. Open title. She has been runner-up four
times, and it was Nicholas, of course, who seated her in that
position most recently. She did it with a record 10-under par score
that was just enough to hold off Lopez, who lost despite becoming
the first woman to shoot four rounds in the 60s in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas grabbed sole possession of the lead with a second-round
66, never let it go and held up against one of the great heroines
not only of women's professional golf but of women's professional
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's Open time again.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expects Nicholas to use Blackwolf Run Golf Course as a
venue to pull an Annika Sorenstam, who won back-to-back Open titles
in 1995 and 1996. Sorenstam missed the cut last year, but stayed in
Oregon through the weekend to motivate and eventually congratulate
Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says what kind of person Annika is,'' said Nicholas, who
has played on the past two Solheim Cup teams for Europe with
Sorenstam and is one of six players on her side who has competed in
all four Solheim competitions.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Sorenstam, who has won the last two tournaments she has
entered, who is again the Open favorite. Nicholas, on the other
hand, has endured a mediocre LPGA season with three missed cuts and
a withdrawal in nine tournament. Her best finish this year is a tie
for seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe a year has passed,'' Nicholas said. ``It's
exciting and a lot of attention will be on me, I suppose. A lot of
top players have never won the U.S. Open (Lopez, obviously, will be
a sentimenal favorite in her 22nd attempt). My family is coming
out. We're just going to have a fun week.''
</P>
<P>
   About that attention ...
</P>
<P>
   ... Nicholas sat, unbothered, in the media center Tuesday
afternoon watching England vs. Argentina in the World Cup while
Lopez _ who else? _ ran past her scheduled time for a group
interview session.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas didn't seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can watch a little longer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And when England scored to take a 2-1 lead, it was Nicholas who
jumped up and yelled, 'Take that, you Argies!!!' That's the
reigning U.S. Women's Open champion. Not bad for a 36-year-old who
got involved with golf only when she decided tennis wasn't going to
take her very far.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't see your opponent across the net, it's a bit
tricky,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, look for Nicholas amid all the hoopla when the Open
begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She's the one about the size of the trophy with her name on it.

   Western thought about sex has been tainted by the notion that
the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. But science
is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice
versa. In fact, just about every aspect of our physiology diverges
_ how we metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory
system works and how resistant we are to infection. Dorion Sagan,
co-author with Lynn Margulis of ``What Is Sex?'' and ``Origins of
Sex: Four Billion Years of Genetic Recombination,'' reports.

<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

 &UR; ART FOR PURCHASE: One B&AMP;W shot of a patient recovering from facial
plastic surgery is available for purchase and can be sent to you

procedures (face lift, eyelid surgery, breast augmentation and
liposuction) performed in 1992, 1996 and 1997 by surgeons who were
members of the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons.
 &UR; By SUSAN GILBERT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the
odds of having insurance cover what is needed can be even trickier.

   Tired of battling doctors, billing clerks, HMOs? May be it's
time to organize, or ``unionize,'' the only unorganized part of
medicine _ the patients! _ writes Robert Lipsyte, author of ``In

imperfect union of imperfect people will include the measured
brand-testing of the Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation
of the teamsters' union under Jimmy Hoffa,'' he writes in this

   Are men worth it? More precisely, is the maxim true about
marriage being good for a man's health but hazardous for a woman's

without them, and which life will be longer, and which will simply
seem longer? Natalie Angier, a science writer for The New York
Times who is completing a book about women's bodies, takes a crack
at answering these questions.

<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   Every day, Marcie Rothman, 51, takes three Body Wise Female
Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22 ingredients
marketed as the natural answer to menopause. And she's not alone.
Like many women her age, Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments. But how safe are they? And just how effective? Karen
Stabiner, a Los Angeles-based writer who is the author of ``To

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York

concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   Western thought about sex has been tainted by the notion that
the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. But science
is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice
versa. In fact, just about every aspect of our physiology diverges
_ how we metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory
system works and how resistant we are to infection. Dorion Sagan,
co-author with Lynn Margulis of ``What Is Sex?'' and ``Origins of
Sex: Four Billion Years of Genetic Recombination,'' reports.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

marketed as the natural answer to menopause. And she's not alone.
Like many women her age, Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments. But how safe are they? And just how effective? Karen
Stabiner, a Los Angeles-based writer who is the author of ``To
Dance With the Devil: The New War on Breast Cancer,'' reports.

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   Western thought about sex has been tainted by the notion that
the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. But science
is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice
versa. In fact, just about every aspect of our physiology diverges
_ how we metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory
system works and how resistant we are to infection. Dorion Sagan,
co-author with Lynn Margulis of ``What Is Sex?'' and ``Origins of
Sex: Four Billion Years of Genetic Recombination,'' reports.

   &UR; WOMEN AND SEX: ON THIS TOPIC, SCIENCE BLUSHES &LR;  &QL;

 &UR; By GINA KOLATA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

procedures (face lift, eyelid surgery, breast augmentation and
liposuction) performed in 1992, 1996 and 1997 by surgeons who were
members of the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons.
 &UR; By SUSAN GILBERT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the
odds of having insurance cover what is needed can be even trickier.

   Are men worth it? More precisely, is the maxim true about

seem longer? Natalie Angier, a science writer for The New York

<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

 UNDATED: low 50s.''

<P>
   Avram Cheaney, 22, who grew up in West Virginia, quit
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and moved out to
California's Silicon Valley several months ago. He posted his
resume on the internet through a temporary computer employment
agency and got 25 calls. Today he earns $40 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I can work anywhere,'' Cheaney said. ``Any company
that has computers needs people and with my experience I am
light-years ahead of many people still in school. Two years'
experience is all that is needed. You can't say `I've been a
Web-page designer for 10 years' because the field hasn't been
around that long. The younger generation can get a jump on
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction is the anti-conventional nature of an
industry, many of whose giants _ Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak,
the founders of Apple computers, in addition to Gates, _ are
college dropouts. Job opportunities at computer companies often
emphasize loose dress codes and strange hours as well as the
financial possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is how Trilogy, the Austin-based software
company, describes its ``company culture'' on its Web site:
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters at Trilogy? Results, results, results. The focus
is not on how many meetings you attend or that you show up for work
at 7 in the morning every day. What's more important is the value
you add to Trilogy and the experience you bring. As for work hours,
Trilogy believes in flexibility. It makes the most sense that
people work when they are most productive, and only you know when
that is.''
</P>
<P>
   It says that some employees dress fancy for work because they
want to while others ``wear a clean T-shirt and shoes when they
want to dress up,'' adding: ``Some work from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
others don't believe in the cruel and unusual abuse of alarm clocks
and never show their faces before lunch time.'' There is further
talk of huge bonuses and ``company boats, spontaneous trips to Las
Vegas, nights out on the town, trips to Hawaii, fully stocked
kitchens.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who left school to take jobs say they want to go
back to school, either part-time soon or full-time later, both for
long-term job security and the satisfaction of completing their
degrees. But their elders worry that by the time those former
students feel the need to return, it will be too late.
</P>
<P>
   James L. Beug, chairman of computer sciences at Cal Tech, put it
this way: ``I have students from 10 years ago saying, `Oh Jim, my
company just folded and I don't have my degree to make a new job
search.' Meanwhile, our curriculum has changed vastly from 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is that these kids who haven't finished will last
about seven years on the job market. If they haven't learned to
learn and can't go sideways into management, what happens to
them?''
</P>

COMPUTER INDUSTRY LURING STUDENTS INTO DROPPING OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The high-tech field, the fastest growing of the United States'
economy, has become so voracious in its hiring that computer
science departments across the country are losing graduate students
and, in growing numbers, undergraduates to an industry fueled by
vast sums of money.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty positions in computer science are going unfilled and
doctoral programs have seen a big drop-off in applications.
Moreover, students working toward master's and bachelor's degrees
are increasingly abandoning their studies for well-paying jobs in a
field whose wealthy stars, like Bill Gates, famously dropped out of
college.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts fear that fundamental research will decline and
that the next generation of American computer scientists will be
stunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid we're eating our seed corn,'' said Peter J.
Denning, vice provost of George Mason University in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   For many young people, a job paying from $30,000 to $60,000 a
year seems far more appealing than pursuing a degree whose value is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A degree is just a piece of paper with a gold stamp on it,''
said Jonah Blossom, 20, who left Santa Barbara City College after
one year to take a full-time, $30,000-a-year job as a computer
specialist at a nearby concern where a number of his bosses and
colleagues did not finish their studies. ``That paper isn't going
to help you find bugs in a system or create compelling Web sites.
That depends on your ability. My employers are not interested in
certificates or where I've been to school.''
</P>
<P>
   While other academic fields over the years have witnessed shifts
in talent away from universities _ it happened in biotechnology in
the 1980s _ there is no precedent to what is happening today in
computers both in the scale and in the challenge it poses to the
discipline. It is as if every college student with any athletic
ability suddenly faced the realistic prospect of a career with a
professional sports team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without wanting to sound hysterical, this is really changing
the shape of education in a fundamental way,'' said Guy Smith, who
runs the multimedia laboratory at Santa Barbara City College. ``You
hear of kids leaving high school and making almost six figures.
Recently we brought in 30 computer information officers and asked
them about entry-level skills. I didn't hear the word `degree' come
up very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Liemandt dropped out of Stanford after his junior year
and founded the Trilogy Development Group, a hugely successful
software marketing company in Austin, Texas, in 1989. Liemandt says
his company, like many others, simply does not care about an
applicant's university credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we interview two people and one has a 4.0 from MIT in
computer science and doesn't impress us in the interview,''
Liemandt said, ``and the other dropped out of some small college
and impressed us, we'd always hire the second guy.
</P>
<P>
   Computer science professors, in something of a state of shock,
are sharply divided over what is happening and over how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Most are warning that when the overheated market for programmers
and Web-site designers cools or shifts in emphasis, those who have
left their studies will be, in essence, laid-off blue-collar
workers without credentials, like telephone operators after digital
switching or auto workers after robotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message is, make sure you aim to get yourself a career and
not just a first job,'' said Ellen F. Hartigan, vice president of
student affairs at Polytechnic University in New York who says her
students are being recruited for full-time jobs before getting
their degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our students are the first generation in their family
to go to college and they don't have the parental support that
encourages them to stay on and finish and go to graduate school,''
Ms. Hartigan said. ``These offers are very tempting. So we are now
much more proactive, teaching freshmen about career preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   At Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Fla., Richard
Newman, associate dean of engineering, says his institution is
trying to compromise with corporate raiders by urging cooperative
ventures whereby the companies pay for students to complete their
studies while they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even had two or three freshmen go off to take jobs setting
up Web pages,'' Newman said. ``We're trying to find a solution to
end the competition between us and industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But some computer experts say that universities have failed to
keep computer science curriculums up to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities have done such a bad job of providing what you
need to know that a B.A. in computer science is almost considered
worthless,'' asserted Allen Holub, an author and computer design
consultant in San Francisco. ``Many tenured professors came out of
math departments. Mathematicians make lousy programmers. They focus
on algorithms which are the underlying rules of some programs. But
the vast majority of programs today are not algorithm-based but
data-based.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Martin, a professor of computer and information
sciences at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, and a
member of the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board, acknowledges
that the gap between theory and practice has grown dangerously
large.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because of the growth of sophisticated new
computer languages, like Java, with which programmers can draw on a
prepackaged set of formulas and tools and simply plug them in,
without a need for understanding the underlying theory of computer
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curriculums are going to have to change. There is no question
about it,'' Martin said. ``Right now, we can't compete. You can
legitimately ask whether what we teach is as important as it used
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it is more of a hacker's world, and it is less obvious
that students need to know the fundamentals to function at a high
level. With the arrival of Java, they don't program in the same way
as in older languages.'' ``After a semester learning Java, a
student can already do an incredible amount,'' he continued. ``My
colleagues see their former students with a B.S. and stock options.
Maybe that's better than an M.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of well-paid, creative work without full academic
credentials in an exciting field is the result both of economic and
cultural factors.
</P>
<P>
   The American computer industry is exploding. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics projects a 108 percent increase in the need for systems
analysts, engineers and computer scientists from now until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are an estimated 933,000 jobs in the these fields,
and by 2006, the bureau estimates, that will rise to 1.9 million.
Yet the nation's computer science programs each year are graduating
only 25,000 students with bachelor's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   This projected gap is borne out by the experience of those in
career services.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every one of the 1,600 students graduating this year from
Northeastern were computer majors, they would all have jobs,'' said
Carol S. Lyons, dean of career services at Northeastern University
in Boston. ``We're seeing signing bonuses of $7,000 to $9,000,
relocation offers, stock options and starting salaries in the high
30s to low 50s.''

CIA CHIEF WARNS THAT AMERICA IS VULNERABLE TO COMPUTER ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MARK HELM   
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States, the only superpower in the
world, is vulnerable to computer attacks that have the potential to
cripple the nation, CIA Director George J. Tenet said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said several nations are developing plans and training
personnel to sabotage military and civilian computer systems in the
United States in the event of a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries realize there's no way they could beat the
United States in a conventional war, so they're looking to level
the playing field by going after our dependence on computers,'' he
told the Senate Committee on Government Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., asked him to
identify the countries, but Tenet declined. However, later in the
hearing, he hinted that Iran, Iraq and Libya were among those
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq, Iran and Libya have all put in programs to increase
their information technology in relation to their military
capabilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Defense Department study showed that the Pentagon's
computer systems were attacked 250,000 times in 1995. Last year,
Defense Department computer engineers secretly tested their
computer defense system by launching 38,000 attacks of their own.
The engineers, using computers and software available to the
public, succeeded in breaking into the systems 65 percent of the
time. More troubling, according to Tenet, was that 63 percent of
the attacks went undetected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have staked our way of life on the use of information ...
but we are building this on an insecure foundation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth A. Minihan, director of the National
Security Agency, the government's electronic spying division, said
the growing interdependence of computer systems around the world
not only boosts America's vulnerability but also helps shield the
identity of computer attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than attacking a system directly from their own
computers, hackers often go first through other computers.
Investigators then must attempt to backtrack until they discover
the origin of the attack, although in most cases they fail, Minihan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike a normal battle, in cyberspace we rarely know who is
hitting us and where they're hitting us from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minihan added that potential attacks may not always be aimed at
the military. Computer systems that are relied on by banks, public
utilities and transportation networks, such as trains, also are
considered primary targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like in World War II when we tried to disrupt the enemy's
war machine by bombing factories and wreaking havoc on their
economies, our enemies will try to take out our main industries by
cutting off their computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all computer attacks committed in the United States
currently are done by hackers who have no political goals, he said.
But he added, ``We know of one (politically motivated hacker
attack) and we suspect others.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said the foreign governments that are developing their
computer attack capabilities are known to be studying the hackers'
methods and how the U.S. military is responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they are working on programs to use this type of
attack, so we have a window of opportunity to get some defenses put
in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Minihan said the military is working on computer defense shields
that can detect and repel an attack but he said that a fail-proof
system has not yet been developed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Americans also face a serious security threat from the potential
problems stemming from the so-called Year 2000 computer bug, Tenet
and Minihan said. Because of a programing error in many older
computer chips, experts predict that many computers will shut down
or display incorrect information on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's defense systems run on computers that are
infected with the bug, some U.S. analysts fear that country's
missile defense systems could begin to malfunction or even break
down completely.
</P>
<P>
   The American analysts worry that the Russians could mistake a
shutdown of their missile defense systems as an attack, prompting
them to order a counter-assault, Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   In one scenario in which Russia's missile systems continue to
work but show incorrect information, U.S. analysts fear the
Russians might order a counter-attack to an assault that, in
reality, is taking place only on their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said U.S. military and civilian computer experts are
working with the Russians to ensure that no misunderstandings occur
on Jan. 1, 2000.

INTELLIGENCE CHIEFS: U.S. EXPOSED TO DIGITAL 'PEARL HARBOR'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two top U.S. intelligence officials warned
Wednesday that the nation faces grave danger of ``an electronic
Pearl Harbor'' _ a surprise attack launched in cyberspace by an
enemy state or terrorist band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information warfare has the potential to deal a crippling blow
to our national security if we do not take strong measures to
counter it,'' CIA Director George Tenet told a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   With computer networks running much of the U.S. economy, ``our
electric power grids and our telecommunications networks will be
targets of the first order'' in an Information Age war, Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``An adversary capable of implanting the right virus, or
accessing the right terminal, can cause massive damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Tenet said, the United States lacks any adequate
means to protect the integrity of vital public and private
databases, such as those that record billions of dollars in
financial transactions every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such system in place, and the private sector and
the government have the responsibility to work towards this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet's fears were echoed by Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan,
director of the supersecret National Security Agency, who noted
that today's heavy reliance on linked computer systems continues to
grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these advantages of electronic commerce are growing, our
technical ability to network has outpaced our ability to protect
those networks,'' Minihan said. This, he said, presents ``our
adversaries (with) a window of opportunity for an electronic Pearl
Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply hoping that someday we can add the needed security
before it's too late is not a strategy,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   Minihan said the nation needed a ``national information
assurance strategy'' that is far from being in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these things have been said (before),'' Sen. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee, told the witnesses. ``But ... when the head of the CIA
and the NSA come in and use terms such as 'urgent' and use the
Pearl Harbor analogy and so forth, I think that that speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet told the committee that two other major cyberspace issues
_ encryption policies and the so-called ``millennium bug'' were
linked to the dangers of electronic warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The prolonged standoff between the FBI and the software industry
over whether to grant the government a digital ``back door'' to
``recover'' encoded Internet communications was harming national
security, Tenet charged.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the feuding parties cut a deal, he predicted, ``we're
going to get a major terrorist event and we're going to mandate''
encryption controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a train wreck ready to happen unless we deal with the
recovery piece of this encryption debate. It sure is going to
happen,'' Tenet said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ``millennium bug,'' which could lead some older
computers to malfunction when they try to process dates beyond
2000, also raises concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign specialists hired to fix the bug could use their
access to implant coding that could be triggered in a future
conflict to destroy or provide access to vital information, Tenet
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Minihan agreed ``that there's no question that there's a
national security relevance'' to the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and Sen. Joseph Lieberman. D-Conn., who received
classified briefings from Tenet and Minihan on Tuesday, trod
delicately into an area rarely discussed in open hearings: the
Pentagon's own ability to wage an offensive cyberwar campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Lieberman whether they could ``assure people of the
country'' that ``we have a developed information warfare offensive
capacity,'' Tenet replied: ``Well, we're the wrong people to ask,
but we can assure them that we're not asleep at the switch in this
regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman saw a potential cyberspace parallel to the ``mutual
assured destruction'' doctrine of the Cold War era in which neither
the United States nor the Soviet Union ever could risk a first
strike for fear of being destroyed in a retaliatory hail of nuclear
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to panic people,'' Lieberman concluded. ``But
this is ... a whole new order of security threat, and we ought to
be able to figure out how to get together and defend against it.''

APPELLATE RULING WON'T DETER MICROSOFT FOES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WARREN WILSON   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Antitrust regulators say they are proceeding at full
steam in their litigation against Microsoft Corp., despite an
appeals court ruling Tuesday that some believe delivered a torpedo
below the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate decision came in a narrow case filed last fall,
the regulators pointed out, not the broader one they filed last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The newer case, which invokes the Sherman Antitrust Act and is
scheduled for trial in September, raises issues such as Microsoft's
allegedly anticompetitive dealings with computer makers and online
content providers that are separate from those discussed in
Tuesday's ruling, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein Wednesday reiterated his
confidence in the strength of the Sherman Act case and stressed
that it was distinct from the narrower dispute that prompted
Tuesday's ruling, spokeswoman Gina Talamona said.
</P>
<P>
   New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco, among the leaders of a
parallel effort by 20 states and the District of Columbia, took a
similar view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is a substantial development,'' Vacco spokeswoman
Mollie Conkey said. ``But we really believe it will not have a
significant impact on our case ... it isn't affecting anything
we're doing, as far as forging ahead toward the Sept. 8 trial
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Key competitors of Microsoft tried to hammer home those points.
One, Oracle Corp. chairman Larry Ellison, dismissed the ruling as
``a little tactical decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision came in a dispute that began last fall when
the Justice Department accused Microsoft of violating a 1995
consent decree by ``tying'' its Internet browser software to its
Windows operating system. Computer makers had no real alternative
to Windows, the government said, so tying the products together
amounted to an abuse of monopoly power. Microsoft said it had
``integrated'' the two products to better serve consumers, as the
consent decree specifically allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruled on Tuesday that U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson had made both procedural and substantive
errors in December when he referred the case to a special master
and ordered Microsoft to offer computer makers a browserless
version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The panel looked closely at the integration issue and said that
what Microsoft had done appeared not to violate the consent decree.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, it also examined the integration issue in light
of antitrust law and made numerous points that many observers read
as undermining the broader case as well.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently agreed. Buoyed both by the ruling and
today's retail release of Windows 98, the latest upgrade to
Microsoft's pervasive operating system for desktop computers, they
bid the company's shares to a record high for the second straight
day.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed Wednesday at 104 15/16, up more than 9 percent
from Monday's closing price of 95 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newer lawsuit's allegations are claims that Microsoft
abuses its Windows monopoly by denying computer makers
opportunities to customize their products and by driving bargains
with online content providers and Internet service providers that
squeeze out competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists it has done nothing wrong, but has nonetheless
granted some business partners more leeway in the last few months
in the face of mounting legal and political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling prompted speculation that Microsoft could
reassert its hard-nosed attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But Dataquest analyst Chris LeTocq considers that unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Microsoft realizes those issues are still on the
table,'' LeTocq said.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts suggested it would risk squandering the strategic
and public relations gains made with Tuesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, asked why the company's business practices should still
be litigated if Microsoft has already eased its stance, said the
lawsuit could both clarify what the company had actually done and
impose enforceable restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we believe that Microsoft has eased contractual
restrictions on Internet Service Providers and online providers as
a result of the states' and Department of Justice's investigations,
it is not clear how far Microsoft's changes actually go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Additionally, absent an injunction, it is possible for
Microsoft to revert to its former practices if the investigation or
litigation is terminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many observers agreed with Giga Information Group analyst
Rob Enderle that the appellate ruling undercuts one of the pillars
of the government's case, an argument without which ``it's hard to
justify a federal case of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors haven't yet found a ``smoking gun'' in the case
_ such as evidence of harm to consumers, Enderle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had a lot of allegations, some hearsay and some
documentation,'' he said, ``but almost a complete lack of credible,
independent witnesses.''

COURT DECISION REFLECTS DEBATE OVER HOW TO APPLY ANTITRUST LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Microsoft Corp., a federal appeals court ruling in the
company's favor on Tuesday was a gratifying triumph of sweeping
import for its long-running antitrust battle with the government.
</P>
<P>
   To the Justice Department and 20 states pitted against
Microsoft, it was merely a bump in the road as they head to court
again in September with a broader antitrust case against the
leading computer software company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet antitrust experts said Wednesday that the split decision by
the three-judge panel _ a majority opinion written by a
conservative and partial dissent from a liberal _ was both a big
victory for Microsoft and a reflection of the wider debate over how
antitrust doctrine should apply to high-technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   The majority ruling, they say, echoes the hands-off approach
championed by Microsoft, while the dissent mirrors the Justice
Department's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a landmark antitrust opinion,'' said Stephen Axinn, a
leading antitrust litigator. ``It deals with a classic fault-line
in antitrust _ when a court can second-guess a company's product
decisions. The majority opinion, at least for the moment, moves the
law further toward a non-interventionist stance, especially in
high-tech cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors viewed the opinion as a critical victory for Microsoft
and a green light to buy Microsoft stock, which rose 5.15 percent
Tuesday and a further 4.16 percent Wednesday to $104.9375, a
record.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and state attorneys general
Wednesday pointed to reasons why the impact of the ruling may be
limited. The appeals court struck down a ruling last year by a
federal judge who had ordered Microsoft to offer its Windows 95
operating system and Internet Explorer browser program separately.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
was intended to preserve competition in the market for browsers,
software used to navigate the Internet's World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, the Justice Department had alleged that by bundling
its browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system,
Microsoft was violating its 1995 consent decree with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's majority opinion, Justice Department officials noted,
applied to the consent-decree case and not necessarily to the
government's broader antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The broader monopoly case, based on a far more extensive federal
investigation, contains several additional charges against
Microsoft. But a pivotal argument in the case _ and one sharply
criticized by the appeals court majority opinion _ is that by tying
new software programs to its Windows operating system, Microsoft is
unfairly squelching competition in new markets, like Internet
software and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that it, and it alone, should be the arbiter
of what new software is bundled into its Windows operating system,
the equivalent of the central nervous system on some 90 percent of
personal computers. Besides, Microsoft contends, its Internet
browser is not a separate product, as the government asserts, but
an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court majority sided with Microsoft, saying ``the
limited competence of courts to evaluate high-tech product designs
and the high cost of error should make them wary of second-guessing
the claimed benefits of a particular design decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, legal experts say, could have merely struck
down Jackson's injunction with a brief ruling. Instead, it
presented detailed views on antitrust law and high-technology
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion, legal analysts say, is clearly intended as
a warning signal to the government, the states and Jackson, who
will hear the broader antitrust case starting Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion is very applicable to the broader case,'' said Joe
Sims, a partner at Jones Day Reavis &AMP; Pogue, who is a former senior
official in the Justice Department's antitrust division. ``It's a
first indication that this court believes that the conceptual
approach of the Justice Department is a stretch legally.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court majority ruling must figure into the
preparations for the broader case, acknowledged Justice Department
officials and state attorneys general, by suggesting where more
facts must be marshaled to strengthen its arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very definitely a bump in the road,'' said Richard
Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, ``but it doesn't
knock the wheels off our wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Miller, Iowa's attorney general, emphasized that the
appeals court setback will not prompt the states to reconsider
proceeding with the broader case. ``It's full-speed ahead _ no
thought of the opposite,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Several states filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the Justice
Department's consent-decree case. Though Justice Department
officials said no tactical decision has yet been made on appealing
the appeals court ruling, it is unlikely to try to appeal to the
Supreme Court _ saving that option, if necessary, for the broader
case.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion reflects the more conservative approach
termed ``judicial restraint'' by its advocates. Its author was
Judge Stephen Williams, a Reagan appointee and self-described
adherent of the doctrine of judicial restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative approach leans hard on the notion that if a
company, like Microsoft, can show a discernible consumer benefit to
its tying together of products or features, such bundling should be
permitted under antitrust law. The government contends that other
factors, especially the potential harm to competition and
innovation, should also weigh in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives tend to shun judicial ``balancing'' in antitrust
cases. Williams wrote, ``Courts are ill-equipped to evaluate the
benefits of high-tech product design, and even if they could place
an evaluation on one side of the balance, the strength of the
`evidence of distinct markets,' proposed for the other side of the
scale, seems quite incommensurable.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patricia Wald, a Carter administration appointee, took
issue with the majority opinion in some key respects. The majority
view, she wrote in her dissenting opinion, seemed to mean Microsoft
could bundle anything into its Windows operating system merely by
``identifying some minimal synergy associated with such
`integration.'''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wald suggested that some sort of balancing of consumer
benefit vs. economic harm in product decisions was, at times,
something courts should do.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means do I endorse routine judicial intervention in the
details of product design,'' she wrote. ``But I also do not endorse
(as the majority comes close to doing) judicial abdication in the
face of complexity. The courts are certainly capable of determining
whether a particular integration offers any synergistic benefits at
all or whether these benefits are minimal, significant or great.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Fox, a professor at the New York University Law School,
observed, ``The majority opinion is one possible interpretation of
antitrust law, but it's a very laissez faire interpretation. Judge
Wald's interpretation is much closer to the Justice Department's
argument.''

MICROSOFT RULING COULD AFFECT LARGER CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By BOB DART  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday that an
appeals court setback would not derail the Justice Department's
landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think we can proceed, and we'll do so,'' Reno told
reporters the day after an appeals court panel's ruling in a
related case undermined a key government position in its broad
lawsuit charging the software giant with illegal monopolistic
practices.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia struck down a temporary injunction that
had stopped Microsoft from requiring manufacturers to include its
Internet Explorer browsing software on computers that operate on
Microsoft's Windows 95 system.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal analysts called that ruling a major blow to the
Justice Department's broader charges that Microsoft abuses its
market dominance to stifle competition. The major antitrust case,
set for trial in September, focuses on Microsoft's ``bundling'' of
the upgraded Windows 98 operating system and Internet Explorer
browser.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling could ``cut the legs out from under the
Justice Department'' on a key part of the major case, said Robert
Litan, director of economic studies for the Brookings Institution
and a former deputy attorney general in the antitrust division of
the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be very discouraging from their point of view,'' he
said, adding that it appeared that the government was ``slam-dunked
by the court.''
</P>
<P>
   While the ruling was on a narrow issue, the language of the
three-judge panel was ``very broad,'' Litan said. ``They
essentially said that judges shouldn't be in the business of
designing software.''
</P>
<P>
   Litan said the message is unlikely to be missed by U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who issued the injunction that was
overturned and who is scheduled to preside over the antitrust
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The ``government has to put a brave face on this,'' but the
decision does ``cast a large shadow on the upcoming case,'' said
William Kovacic, a former Federal Trade Commission official who
teaches antitrust law at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``three legs'' to the Justice Department lawsuit, he
said. One contention is that Microsoft has entered restrictive
contracts with computer makers. That is not affected by the appeals
decision. The second allegation is that Microsoft tried to entice
its browser rival, Netscape, into a market division. That leg is
also not crippled by the decision, said Kovacic.
</P>
<P>
   However, the third leg is that Microsoft tried to use
``bundling'' of technology to extend its monopoly to other segments
of the market. ``This third leg is the most important part of the
case,'' said Kovacic. And this is the part that the appeals panel
dealt with specifically and sweepingly.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Justice Department vowed Wednesday to press ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence in the case we have filed,'' Assistant
Attorney General Joel Klein, head of the antitrust division, told
reporters after testifying in a congressional hearing on telephone
company mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the Justice Department is considering its legal
options, which include an appeal of the panel's ruling, and is not
negotiating a settlement with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday's decision involves the consent decree,'' Klein
said. ``The case we have filed in federal court is under the
Sherman Act. We think that the case is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft general counsel William Neukom said the
appeals court ruling has ``important consequences'' and is ``very
much a vindication of our business practices and our legal
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could use the ruling as the basis to file a motion
seeking a dismissal or summary judgment in the broader antitrust
lawsuit _ especially of the portions dealing with the browser
bundling, said Litan. If that happened, the Justice Department
would almost certainly appeal the panel's ruling to protect against
the possiblity of the case being thrown out, he said.

 Another Day, Another Merger _ Welcome to the New Economy  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phone rang at 3 a.m. yesterday, rousting PR guy Andrew
Johnson from his bed in Antioch.
</P>
<P>
   It was TCI corporate in Colorado, telling him to get dressed and
drive to Walnut Creek, because AT&AMP;T was buying its way into the
cable business and it was Johnson's job to inform TCI's Bay Area
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to another day in the New Economy, where the megamergers
just keep on coming.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson arrived at TCI's offices at 4:10 a.m. and relayed an
e-mail from TCI President Leo Hindery to the general managers at
all 128 TCI franchises in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   The managers were supposed to reassure TCI's 4,000 local
employees that no ``downsizing'' was expected if and when AT&AMP;T
became their boss.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery, The Chronicle's former chief finance officer, was still
on the phone late last night, explaining the deal from New York,
where he's spent the last 12 days cloistered with his negotiating
counterpart, AT&AMP;T Chief Financial Officer Dan Somers.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery said the seeds of the current merger were planted in
January, when TCI sold AT&AMP;T its share of the Teleport
Communications Group, a large-scale Internet service provider.
Meeting the AT&AMP;T brass for that and other deals forged the personal
relationships that led to the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is you date around, you date around, and after a
while, you say, `What the heck, let's get married,''' Hindery said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Self-fulfilling prophecy? &LR;  It's no accident that deals like
this occur in spurts. Morgan Stanley investment banker Rex Golding
told me recently that whenever a big merger occurs, bankers pay
discrete calls on other firms in the same industry, trying to match
them with potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good for us to claim credit but our role is to
precipitate the mergers,'' Golding said.
</P>
<P>
   So you can bet dealmakers are out there now, pitching the
WorldComs and Sprints as well as the Comcasts and Cox Cables on the
virtues of telco-cable matchups _ and the dangers of staying
single.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Whither goest antitrust? &LR;  While the merger wave continues to
surge, the political winds seem to have shifted against the Justice
Department and Federal Trade Commission, each of which has tackled
one-half of the Wintel monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's appellate court ruling in favor of Microsoft was a
slap at the antitrust case Joel Klein's DOJ lawyers have brought
against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, lawyers in the Beltway are buzzing
about a recent op-ed piece in the Chicago Tribune that ripped Klein
for pursuing a ``weak'' case against Microsoft while approving huge
mergers like the $70 billion Citicorp-Travelers deal. It wasn't the
opinion that caused the stir, but the fact that op-ed writer Steve
Frank is an attorney in the DOJ's civil appellate division.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel was sounding aggrieved yesterday, after the
Washington Post reported that the FTC had indirectly tried to win
over public opinion, by sending a pro-government briefing paper to
antitrust experts likely to get quoted by reporters. (You can find
the paper at www.ljx.com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is against the FTC's rules,'' said Intel
spokesman Chuck Mulloy.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Klein and his FTC counterpart Robert Pitofsky may
feel like the legendary King Canute who drowned trying to halt the
tides. Lawrence Sullivan, emeritus professor of antitrust law at UC
Berkeley, said despite their legal and PR setbacks, the antitrust
duo are right to buck the merger wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Klein is not a crazy, neither is Pitofsky,'' Sullivan said.
``They're thoughtful, cautious people who deserve support and
encouragement'' as they try to figure out how 19th century
antitrust plays in 21st century industries.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Magic words: &LR;  Personally, I say to heck with Sullivan and his
fellow travelers in D.C. It's the New Economy, stupid. Antitrust
drools. One-stop shopping rules.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that one rationale for the AT&AMP;T-TCI deal, the notion that
synergies and efficiencies result when consumers can get everything
from Seinfeld reruns to Web pages to phone calls from one
brand-name corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact once the dust settles, AT&AMP;T should acquire Domino's,
Costco and Sears, then merge the whole shebang into Citicorp, so we
can order everything from pizzas to microwaves, and debit the
transaction to our AT&AMP;T tele-banking account.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's one-stop shopping! Accept no substitutes.

 Lam Firing Up to 25% Of Staff  
 By Julia Angwin   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In yet another sign of troubles in the computer chip industry,
Lam Research of Fremont said yesterday that it will lay off 20 to
25 percent of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Lam said it will trim 1,000 to 1,200 workers _ in its second
round of layoffs this year _ mainly because of slowing sales and
financial turmoil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, chip equipment sales are slow in the summer, said
Lam chief executive Jim Bagley. But, he said, ``the situation today
is a dramatic slowdown ... with no improvements likely for fall
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The company refused to say where the layoffs would occur, but
the Bay Area is home to almost three-quarters of the firm's 4,400
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Lam said it will take a charge of up to $65 million related to
the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The company also expects to report a fourth-quarter loss of 5
cents a share before the restructuring charge, in line with
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Lam's troubles are only the latest ripples in the wave of bad
news that hit the chip sector, which is in its third consecutive
year of slowing growth.
</P>
<P>
   Lam's biggest rival, Applied Materials of Santa Clara, shed 15
percent of its workforce last month.
</P>
<P>
   And Bay Area chipmakers Intel, National Semiconductor and
Cypress Semiconductor all have announced significant job reductions
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sign of the times,'' said Mark FitzGerald,
semiconductor analyst at Merrill Lynch in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Like those companies, Lam blames the cuts on slowing PC sales,
an oversupply of computer memory and the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Lam said it expects chip companies to spend 30 percent less this
year on chip equipment than they did last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on this view of the industry, we have made the decision
to realign the company's cost structure,'' said Bagley, Lam's CEO.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Lam has internal problems, too. It is in the
midst of a turnaround after several years of losing market share to
Applied Materials and a Japanese firm called TEL.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lam laid off 700 workers worldwide because of
similar problems _ a dramatic slowdown in the chip industry, and
its attempt to turn the company around.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Lam officials told analysts that they are likely to
shut down the Chemical Vapor Deposition division _ an area Lam had
unsuccessfully sought to penetrate for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been struggling for a while,'' said Gus Richard,
semiconductor analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco. ``Now,
they're going to shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the troubles in the chip equipment industry,
however, Richard said he thinks that the industry soon may rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is going through what I consider to be the bottom
of a cycle,'' Richard said. ``I don't believe it's going to get
much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made after the market closed. Lam shares
closed at $22.06 yesterday.

 UNDATED: ... regular visitors.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A portal is a site that can successfully broker a significant
share of consumers' information, communication, and commerce
needs,'' says the Yankee Group's Wester. ``Anyone who doesn't have
significant share is just a damn Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest to a sure thing in the portal sweepstakes is Yahoo,
which practically invented the concept. Yahoo was created as an
Internet directory by two Stanford University graduate students.
But it quickly evolved into a one-stop center for many on-line
services. Today, Yahoo is not only the most popular site on the
Internet, with more than 30 million visitors a month. It's also one
of those rare Internet businesses that actually turns a profit _
$2.2 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo and the other search services have a major advantage in
the portal sweepstakes. They are perhaps the only Internet sites
that virtually everyone has to visit sooner or later. The Web is
now so big _ more than 320 million pages according to one recent
estimate in the journal Science _ that a search service is the only
way anybody can hope to find information.
</P>
<P>
   Other search services are moving quickly to take advantage of
their high traffic rates. In the past year, Lycos has added free
e-mail, chat rooms, and a software library where visitors can get
free or low-cost computer programs. In February, Lycos acquired
Tripod Inc., a Williamstown, Mass. company that provides free
personal Web pages to more than a million people. Davis says that
Tripod and other new features are leading Web surfers to spend more
time at Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were originally a go-through site. ... The success of Lycos
was based on how soon you left,'' Davis says. ``Now we've become a
destination site.''
</P>
<P>
   In Marlborough, Mass., the staff at AltaVista is heading in the
same direction. AltaVista is a high-powered Internet search service
created in 1995 by Digital Equipment Corp. to show off the speed of
its Alpha computers. Today, AltaVista is still one of the most
popular search sites on the Web, but the company has lagged in
converting itself into a portal.
</P>
<P>
   No more, says director of marketing Kathy Greenler. Even before
Digital's acquisition last week by Compaq Computer Corp., AltaVista
had begun making moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a slower path, but we've taken a global
perspective,'' Greenler says.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista has begun to offer the same kinds of services
available at other portals. The AltaVista site now features a link
to ABC News and CBS Sportsline and a free e-mail service. But
Greenler is especially proud of the site's translation
capabilities. AltaVista can make rough translations into English of
Web pages written in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and
German. It can also translate English pages into any of these
languages.
</P>
<P>
   If search services can count on high traffic volumes, the makers
of browser software might have an even sweeter deal. The leading
browsers from Netscape and Microsoft are usually preset so that the
first Web site to appear on a screen belongs to the browser maker.
</P>
<P>
   That's too good an opportunity for Netscape, which is reeling
from Microsoft's competitive thrusts in the browser and server
software markets. Netscape is turning its Netcenter Web site into a
portal in hopes that visitors will linger to use the free e-mail
and discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape senior vice president Jennifer Bailey says that 5.5
million Web surfers have registered to use the site since it was
opened in September. In the quarter ended in April, Netcenter
racked up $31 million in revenues from advertisers wishing to reach
those visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Netscape brand is by far more recognized and associated
with the Internet than any other portal brand out there, including
Yahoo,'' Bailey says.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft hopes to change that. Already the company runs several
of the most popular Web sites. Now Microsoft is testing a prototype
for a new portal called Internet Start, which will pop up on the
screens of future users of Microsoft's browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be the home for Microsoft customers on the
Internet,'' says Ed Graczyk, a Microsoft product manager. He sounds
modest enough until you remember that ``Microsoft customers'' are
about 90 percent of the world's computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Now established media companies, eager not to be shut out of the
Internet, are moving to make portals of their own. While Disney's
investment in Infoseek is the bigger of the two recent deals, NBC's
choice of a partner is more interesting. Infoseek is already a
major Web site, while Snap isn't in the top 25. NBC is betting that
its marketing clout can turn a little-known Web site into a
top-tier portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC knows about audiences and mass marketing,'' says NBC
spokesman Robert Silverman. Besides, according to Silverman, less
than 5 percent of Americans have ever heard of Yahoo, largely
because most people still don't use the Internet. Silverman sees
this as evidence that there's still plenty of room in the portal
market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, any number of other firms are trying to create
mini-portalsfor specialized audiences. For example, the leading
personal finance software firm Intuit Inc. offers Quicken.com, a
site laden with financial news and information.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, everybody agrees that only a few of these
companies will get enough regular visitors to attract a profitable
level of ad revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there'll be three winners _ Yahoo, AOL, and
Microsoft,'' says Chris Charron, an analyst at Forrester Research
in Cambridge. He also gives an outside chance to Netscape because
of the popularity of its browser.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other players, including Lycos and AltaVista, Charron
sees them as also-rans, and possibly as takeover bait for a media
company looking to build its own gateway to the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A portal, according to the dictionary, is a grand and impressive
doorway. It's the sort of entrance you would find on a Gothic
cathedral or the US Capitol _ and now, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Companies ranging from Internet specialist Yahoo Inc. to media
giant Walt Disney Co. are building ``portal sites'' on the World
Wide Web _ attractive, easy-opening front doors to the vast
information storehouse of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for the hottest trend on thehot and ever trendy
'Net.The rush to develop or acquire such digital gateways has
sparked a flurry of corporate dealmaking, prompted efforts to
develop portal brand names, opened up huge new potential for
advertisers, and boosted the market value of leading Internet
companies. Indeed, so many players are piling into the portal
market that some predict a shakeout before long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt the most contagious disease running amok among
Web marketers is portal-itis,'' jokes Gregory Wester, research
director for the Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the portals started as Internet ``search engines,''where
Web surfers go to track down information by keying in terms _ for
example, ``World Cup soccer'' _ and then clicking on the sites
found by the service. They are now expanding themselves into
gateways to dozens of on-line resources: news headlines, weather
reports, electronic mail, classified advertising, shopping, even
advice for small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Already, portals like Yahoo, Lycos, and Excite are among the
most popular sites on the World Wide Web, attracting millions of
visitors every month. But these firms face competition from some of
America's biggest media companies, which are eager to gain wider
audiences for their programming and other content.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks ago, the NBC broadcasting unit of General
Electric Co. invested $165 million in Snap, a relatively new and
little-visited portal operated by the popular Internet news service
CNet Inc. Then last Thursday, Disney, which owns the ABC television
network, acquired a 43 percent stake in Infoseek Corp. in a complex
deal worth about $900 million. Infoseek is an Internet search
service that's among the 10 most popular sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the browser war between software companies Microsoft
Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp. is turning into a portal
war. Both firms make Internet software thatautomatically directs
millions of users to their corporate Web sites. Microsoft and
Netscape are beefing up these sites, turning them into full-service
portals that will be the first Web sites many people see when they
dial into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The portal servicesshould sound familiar to users of such
traditional on-line computer networks as America Online or
CompuServe. These companies provided the same kind of service to
millions of customers over private computer networks long before
the Internet became popular. Indeed, many portal executives admit
that they want to duplicate the formula that has made AOL, with 12
million subscribers, far and away the world's most successful
consumer on-line business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become like a free version of America Online,'' says Bob
Davis, chief executive of Lycos Inc. Started as a site for looking
up other Internet sites, the Waltham, Mass. company now offers
about 200 services ranging from free e-mail to on-line parlor games
like chess and backgammon.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison amuses Barry Schuler, president of AOL's
interactive services unit. Not only does his company dominate the
commercial on-line service business, its Internet Web site,
aol.com, is the Web's second-most-popular location, with 22.8
million visitors in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers buy brands. That's an absolute,'' Schuler says.
``America Online is the only true national brand in the Internet
on-line world.''
</P>
<P>
   There are problems with AOL as a role model for portals. More
than 80 percent of AOL's revenue comesfrom subscriber fees. By
contrast, portals don't charge customers a dime. Anyone with
Internet access is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The portal players think the Internet can be made to pay just as
television has: by rounding up viewers and bombarding them with
advertising. The profits come from corporations ready to pay
millions for a chance to hawk their wares to an audience of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, portals cut distribution deals with major Internet
retailers. For example, the on-line bookstore Barnes&AMP;Noble.com pays
a premium to the Lycos portal. In exchange, Barnes &AMP; Noble gets
listed on the Lycos home page as the site's preferred source for
books.
</P>
<P>
   But comparing portals to TV channels suggests that a shakeout is
inevitable. After all, the bulk of TV ad revenues are earned by the
four major broadcast networks, with dozens of cable companies
fighting for the leftovers. Portal competitors think the same thing
will happen on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied battle for the top slots among portal sites has
begun.
</P>
<P>
   As with television, the key is ratings. The winners will be
portals that can attract tens of millions of regular visitors.

U.S. THREATENED BY DELAYS ABROAD ON 'MILLENNIUM BUG'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW MOLLISON  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ American prosperity could be eroded by slow
progress in many other countries toward updating millions of
computer systems and billions of microchips to recognize the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The damage ``would be about the same size as the expected
economic damage from the turmoil in East Asia,'' Maria Livanos
Gattaui, secretary general of the International Chamber of
Commerce, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we inject a sense of urgency without generating
doomsday hysteria?'' she asked some 1,700 senior high-tech and
government leaders at the World Congress on Information Technology
here.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates from 93 countries spent hours comparing notes on
the political and technical changes needed to fix or replace
millions of pre-1997 computers and software programs and billions
of embedded chips in electronic devices that won't know whether the
two-digit date ``00'' stands for 1900 or 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrespective of whether it is a problem of $1 billion or $1
trillion, it is a problem that is going to affect every country,''
said Ahmad Kamal, a Pakistani diplomat who heads the United Nations
working group on information technology. ``Due to the mere
existence of information-technology networks, no country is in an
isolated pocket that can be hermetically sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, government and corporate decision-makers
began focusing seriously on the problem in 1995. Prosperous
European and Asian countries followed up within the next two years.
A survey this year of governments in 158 of the world's poorest
countries showed that more than half had done nothing _ mistakenly
thinking of the so-called Y2K bug was a ``rich nations' problem''
that wouldn't affect their phones, power grids, shipping or fuel
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of late right now for many of us,'' acknowledged
diplomat Carl Frances of Trinidad and Tobago. ``The World Bank is
using British grants to sponsor 20 meetings, including one in
Jamaica for Caribbean countries within a few weeks, to see a
presentation an Italian firm has developed on what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, we do not have today the manpower with the precise
skills needed to do this work, `` said Junjie Li, a professor
working for a joint state-private software firm in Qingdao.
Imported software riddled with Year 2000 bugs is used to run
Chinese computers that handle everything from airports and military
missiles to the payrolls at government-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are outsourcing to Americans for the fixes,'' Junjie said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's government recently decided to give tax credits to
businesses that make deadlines and punish government officials who
miss them, said Kuo Yun, the former general who heads Taiwan's
official Year 2000 efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some American firms are subcontracting Year 2000 work
to India, where lower wages and longer hours cut the cost by
three-fourths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are running three shifts a day right now, doing a lot of
work right from Calcutta for customers in the United States,'' said
Tapan Mukerji, director of a systems integration firm. ``Of course,
we have our own Year 2000 problems, though not as intense or
extensive as in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't put it in the category of 'we're satisfied and we
don't worry about it,' or, you know, 'we're hysterical and our hair
is on fire.' It's somewhere in the middle,'' said Michael Dell,
chairman and chief executive officer of Dell Computer Corp. His
Texas-based company depends on the Internet, phone calls, faxes and
trips to coordinate operations in 42 countries.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Small firms, exporters and importers will bear the brunt of the
risks, predicted David J. Cassano, general manager of Year 2000
global initiatives for IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many small companies are still holding out hope that someone
will come up with the one tool, the silver bullet, that they can
install on a Friday and be okay on a Monday. It isn't going to
happen,'' Cassano said. He said IBM polls of its own customers
suggest that three-fourths of them ``either haven't gotten started
or are in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among large companies, ``globally, many of them are still
in the assessment phase _ sorting out what really has to get
fixed,'' Cassano said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts in Europe are handicapped by the diversion of many
programmers to work on converting financial systems for next year's
switch from marks, francs and other currencies to the new euro.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's economic turmoil has drained corporate and government
budgets that could have been diverted to Year 2000 fixes, as well.
</P>
<P>
   In many African and Latin American countries, private and public
leaders alike were concentrating on switching from
government-commanded economies to free-market systems, and did not
pay much attention to warnings from their technical staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some executives tell me 'I'm working on it,' and they just
mean they're still deciding which outside vendor they will try to
hire to perform a miracle,'' said Fernando Parra, president of DTS
Software Latin America, which works on Year 2000 fixes for clients
in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Parra said, ``Here in Brazil and in
most of Latin America the worst problem is huge governmental firms
_ telephone companies and banks and electrical companies _ that
move so slowly because they need to ask for public bids, and need
budgeting in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If a telephone company in Peru or in Brazil stops
working, or if an insurance company or bank shuts down for a few
days or a few weeks or whatever, it is a problem for everyone in
every country that is doing business with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it, everybody's behind schedule everywhere, and not all
the work will be done,'' said Barry Ingram, a vice president for
Texas-based Electronic Data Systems Inc., which does systems work
in most countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people have to do is assess all their systems, designate
the mission-critical ones that they must repair or replace, and
find ways to live with the errors in the rest of them,'' Ingram
said.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting problems should be kept in perspective, said
Cassano of IBM. ``If an ATM won't give you money, it doesn't mean
your money is not safe. It means the ATM is broken,'' Cassano said.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too much time on the Internet can warp your judgment. Your ideas
about the world come to you in jagged little bits instead of
flowing human voices, and that can mislead you.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself falling into the trap Wednesday, as I thought
about AT&AMP;T Corp.'s acquisition of the cable TV company
Tele-Communications Inc. My first reaction was a surge of what can
only be called bandwidth lust. All I could see at first was AT&AMP;T
using all that coaxial cable to deliver high-speed Internet service
to 33 million homes. Broadband data services, a reality at last.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe one of these days. But the track record of our local
cable company MediaOne brought me back to earth. A couple of years
after rolling out ambitious broadband plans, MediaOne is still
basically a cable company. In the same way, AT&AMP;T will come out of
the TCI deal as much a telephone company as ever.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it'll be a couple of years before the company
will serve up a full spectrum of broadband offerings to all its
customers. I can sympathize. MediaOne has so far managed to install
its hot new system almost everywhere except my neighborhood in
Quincy. We're supposed to get lucky sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps MediaOne is in cahoots with my boss to make me spend
more time at the office. Here at the Globe, my computer is
connected to our corporate network, which links to the Internet at
1.5 million bits per second, far faster than my telephone modem at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is immense. Not just because our Internet service
is fast, but because it's always on. Suddenly, the Web is the most
convenient source for information. I never use a Yellow Pages at
work; it's faster to look up phone numbers on the Web. When I want
corporate financial data, I download it directly from the
Securities and Exchange Commission. When I must question an
industry executive, I send an e-mail. It's often faster _ no
mucking around with voice mail _ and there's a written record of
our discussion.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to dial a phone number and wait to log on. I'm
always on. Suddenly, the Internet isn't ``out there'' any more. It
works like a very large hard drive inside the computer. This is why
I've defended Microsoft Corp.'s plan to build Web browsing into its
operating systems. It's precisely the best place for a browser.
Many more people will realize this as high-speed Internet access
spreads across the land.
</P>
<P>
   But that could take forever, and not because of technology.
Here's the dirty little secret of home broadband services:most
people don't seem to want them.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne is one of the leaders in deploying advanced cable
technology. Almost half of the company's 5.1 million customers are
capable of using cable modems. Yet only 40,000 of them have signed
up. That's a lousy 2 percent subscription rate. MediaOne spokesman
Rick Jenkinson won't say whether MediaOne can make money at that
level of market penetration, but it's not hard to guess.
</P>
<P>
   Still, MediaOne is not counting on Internet service alone to pay
the freight, any more than AT&AMP;T is. The real money is likely to
come from the sale of boring old telephone service. ``Customers
spend a lot more on telephone than they do on cable or Internet at
this time,'' said Jenkinson.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts alone, Bell Atlantic serves up 4.5 million
phone lines, many to businesses and individuals that lease them by
the handful. These lines bring in revenues of $1.75 billion.
MediaOne wants a piece. Its upgraded cable systems will be able to
handle voice traffic, and the company plans to start peddling the
service this fall. If MediaOne can get just a slice of Bell
Atlantic's business, that'll justify the expense of converting its
cable system to broadband.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is thinking the same way. It's mainly interested in selling
telephone service to those 33 million TCI subscribers _ and not
having to pay local phone companies for handling the start and
finish of the long-distance calls made by those customers. Today,
AT&AMP;T is locked out of the residential market because it doesn't
have wires running directly into customers' homes. They soon will.
And while those lines will provide millions of bits per second to
avid gearheads, it'll be plain old telephone service that pays the
freight.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEWIS _ Harnessing the power of computers to the American
soldier, the Army is preparing to formally unveil the first combat
division in history built from the ground up around the microchip
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of planning and experimentation with
state-of-the art computer technology embedded in communications and
weapons systems, the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Hood, Texas,
will be certified as ready for deployment in 18 months, said Gen.
William Hartzog.
</P>
<P>
   As commander of the Training and Doctrine Command, Hartzog has
led the Army-wide program to field the new systems.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Force XXI, for the 21st century campaigns in which it
will fight, the new Army structure aims at increasing combat
effectiveness, maneuverability and decision making through computer
applications throughout the combat and support forces, Hartzog said
in an interview at Fort Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Units will use state-of-the-art M1A2 Abrams tanks and M3 Bradley
infantry vehicles, but will require fewer per brigade. The division
will require only 15,000 troops, instead of the 18,000 now on its
roster.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the division will be an array of computer networks
that provide commanders and soldiers with unparalleled knowledge of
the battlefield before and during combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Force XXI concept emerged after the end of the Cold War as
Army leaders realized that future threats facing the United States
would likely bear little resemblance to the massive entrenched
Soviet Army in Europe, which the U.S. Army had designed itself to
fight, Hartzog said.
</P>
<P>
   Severe pressure to shrink the size of the Army, combined with
new threats from terrorists and spreading weapons of mass
destruction, impelled the service to embrace the technology
revolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Infantry Division, which consists of three heavy
brigades that rely on tanks and armored infantry carriers, will be
smaller but much more lethal due to new information systems used by
the commanding general and front-line riflemen, he said. While
retaining its combat punch for fighting in a conventional war, the
division can also be tailored for emergencies requiring a smaller
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In a major field test last year at the Army's National Training
Center in Southern California, a brigade from the Texas-based
division demonstrated how its digital computer power translated
into battlefield success, Hartzog said. Examples included:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.3l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Surveillance: When an enemy force began invading the
unit's operational area, surveillance aircraft and, later, unmanned
aerial vehicles, tracked the formation and transmitted data showing
the location and route of advance, allowing the brigade to
immediately prepare for battle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Air strikes: Helicopters attached to the brigade capitalized
on the same sensors to conduct an attack on the enemy, destroying
its air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground and air defense: Mobile systems such as Avenger
air-to-air missiles and the Javelin anti-tank weapon were found to
be increasingly lethal against the simulated enemy because their
units were able to deploy rapidly and accurately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Battle space dominance: Even though outnumbered, new
command-and-control systems enabled the digital brigade to
outmaneuver the enemy on an extended battlefield, particularly
because the unit's artillery had the technology to immediately
track and fire on targets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Logistics: In addition to maneuvering and fighting faster than
the enemy, computer technology also enabled the brigade to resupply
its combat units faster and more efficiently, allowing them to
return to the fight sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The current schedule is to equip and train the two heavy
divisions and the III Corps headquarters based at Fort Hood. The
1st Cavalry Division will be completed in the year 2003 and the
corps headquarters by 2005, Hartzog said.
</P>
<P>
   A parallel effort to add digital combat systems to the Army's
light divisions, particularly the 82nd Airborne and 101st Air
Assault Divisions, will proceed during the next decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the Army has historically been a very
conservative organization when it comes to radical restructuring or
introducing new technologies, Hartzog said the Force XXI program
has also aimed to accelerate the service's decision-making process,
particularly in terms of designing and procuring new weapons
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line to the computer revolution is that the soldier
in combat will have the answer to three fundamental questions,
Hartzog said: ``Where am I? Where are my subordinates? Where is the
enemy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have that (information), you have something that has
never existed in the history of warfare,'' Hartzog said. ``We
intend to have the entire force ready by 2010,'' he said, referring
to the Army's mechanized and armor divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hartzog, 56, has led the Army Training and Doctrine Command
since October 1994. He previously served as deputy commander of the
U.S. Atlantic Command and also commanded the 1st Infantry Division.
He is a combat veteran of Vietnam, where he served two tours.
</P>
<P>
   Hartzog was interviewed during a visit to the advanced ROTC
summer camp at Fort Lewis, where 4,000 cadets are undergoing field
training and leadership development this summer.

   BACKING FOR BILL TO SHIELD CHILDREN
</P>
<P>
   An Oklahoma congressman won preliminary support last week for
legislation that would require public schools and libraries to use
filters on their computers as a way to keep children from seeing
sexually explicit material on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Rep. Ernest Istook Jr., a Republican, was added
to an $81.9 billion budget bill pending in the House Appropriations
Committee to cover education, labor and health and human services.
The bill is expected to be sent to the full House after lawmakers
return from the July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Communications Decency Act was overturned by the
Supreme Court last year, lawmakers have sought more narrowly
tailored legislation to shield children without violating the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appropriations bill is a must-pass bill, so it is very
dangerous that the provision has been added to that bill,'' said
Ron Weich, a legislative consultant to the American Civil Liberties
Union, which successfully challenged the Communications Decency
Act.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Istook said the amendment stirred no controversy
among members of the subcommittee that approved it. ``There was no
opposition,'' the aide said. ``It was a 14-0 vote.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has
passed the Senate Commerce Committee. But it is narrower, applying
only to schools and libraries that receive federal financial
assistance in obtaining Internet access.

   THE FINE ART OF LURING READERS
</P>
<P>
   Want to learn how to put an end to junk e-mail forever? Don't
ask Avatar Publishing _ even though a piece of widely circulated
promotional electronic mail from Avatar has been luring readers
with the subject line: ``Never Receive Junk E-Mail Again!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be great to never get junk e-mail again?'' the
message begins. ``Well, no one can make you that promise,
unfortunately. But you can profit from junk e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Avatar, which has an unlisted phone number and has hidden its
return e-mail address, then invites the reader to mail $29 to a Los
Angeles address for more information and a junk e-mail starter kit
that includes a primer on what is legal and what is not.
</P>
<P>
   The message explains that Avatar is in a ``fun little war'' with
the producers of Internet filter software, to see just who can
outsmart whom. ``We know all the secrets,'' the message says.
``Obviously, or you wouldn't be reading this, would you?'' Probably
not.

   WHAT TO WEAR WHEN THE FUTURE COMES
</P>
<P>
   With all the dire predictions that airlines, banks, power grids
and even the federal government will be felled by ill-programmed
computers when the calendar turns over to Jan. 1, 2000, there is
now one less thing to worry about: what to wear.
</P>
<P>
   Two entrepreneurs in Birmingham, Mich., have come up with what
they have trademarked as the ``Official Logo of the New
Millennium.'' And they have the Web site _ and the T-shirts _ to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea grew from a brainstorming session a year ago, said
Larry Smith, a managing partner of the venture, called Millennium
321. (The 3 denotes the third millennium; the 21 refers to the 21st
century.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just read that M &AMP; M's had just applied to be the
official candy of the new millennium,'' he said. ``We thought,
`What could we do that could have a global impact?'''
</P>
<P>
   He and his partner, James Iacobucci, came up with a logo with
three columns that Smith said ``looks as though you're unzipping
the future.'' Shirts, sweatshirts and caps with the logo are for
sale on the company's Web site, which opened last week
(www.m321.com).

   IRS REDESIGNS FORM ON TAX-EXEMPT STATUS
</P>
<P>
   The nation's tax collectors are planning a surfing safari on the
Web to hunt for nonprofit groups that are really commercial
enterprises in charitable camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service is redesigning the application form
for organizations that seek tax-exempt status. The existing
application form asks for examples of brochures and other printed
materials, which IRS officials use to evaluate applications. More
than 1.5 million organizations have won tax exemption from the
service. The new form, expected to be released by fall, will add a
box for a would-be nonprofit to list its Web address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing ourselves up to 21st-century technology,'' said
Don Roberts, an IRS spokesman, ``and realizing that a lot of these
organizations have Web sites, as well as printed materials, will
help us evaluate applications.''
</P>
<P>
   KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, tells clients in its
June newsletter that having a list of nonprofit Web sites will also
help agents quickly check whether a tax-exempt organization is
straying too far into commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofits are allowed to engage in business activities like
operating museum gift shops if the activities are related to the
organization's core purpose. But if the venture is unrelated to
that mission, the group must pay taxes on any profits.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet on the IRS agenda for the 21st century: online
application for tax-exempt status.

 UNDATED: governance movement.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The parties with cross-cutting interests include large trademark
holders, who want to limit the number of so-called domains _ the
suffixes on Internet addresses, like ``.com,'' ``.net'' and
``.org'' _ to reduce the opportunities for others to co-opt their
brand names. It is one thing for Coca-Cola (www.coke.com) to make
sure no one is trying to do business as www.coke.org. It might be
far harder to police dozens of domains, to ferret out coke.web or
coke.store, for example. But small businesses and individuals would
like to see more domains created to increase the odds of obtaining
their own preferred addresses. Meanwhile, there are many
entrepreneurs intent on making a profit out of registering domain
names _ and perhaps just as many domain democrats who would rather
see registration be a strictly nonprofit enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the struggle is also between the old-guard
technical wizards like Postel and the new commercial interests that
have begun to assert themselves as the Internet expands. Tamar
Frankel, a law professor at Boston University who has taken a
leading role in organizing this week's conference in Reston, has
been accused by some Internet traditionalists of being an
interloper with no credentials _ or worse, a promoter for Network
Solutions Inc., a unit of Science Applications International Corp.,
which assigns the domain names that Postel helps catalog.
</P>
<P>
   To such criticism, Ms. Frankel replies: ``The issues now before
the Internet are not technical. They are political, they are
structural, they are organizational. What I find is that people who
are tremendously sophisticated in the technical workings of the
Internet are not necessarily knowledgeable in how to create an
organization _ especially one that has no clear model.''
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of academics, industry and government
officials and so-called netizens who are not entirely convinced
that a new electronic order will emerge on its own have begun to
seek a clear structure for the process. On Monday, for example,
Martin Bangemann, the European Union commissioner for industry, is
convening a conference in Brussels for industry representatives to
discuss his proposal for an international charter to coordinate
Internet regulation of electronic commerce. Next month, the faculty
of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of government will discuss the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet overlaps with geographical governments, but it
also floats above them,'' Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School,
said. ``So trying to work out governance is quite difficult, and no
analogy quite fits.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Magaziner, a senior White House policy adviser, was the
chief architect of the recently issued hands-off policy on domain
names. ``What we believe is the ideal kind of coordinating
structure of the Internet is not to have an intergovernmental
organization, but to have a number of private nonprofit
international groups that have specific charters,'' Magaziner said.
</P>
<P>
   But so far private industry has made little progress in
self-regulation. Some critics say that even an effective industry
effort would not necessarily safeguard the principles of democracy.
``My fear is that there won't be any accountability,'' said Andrew
Shapiro, a fellow at Harvard University's Center for Internet and
Society. ``Your common Internet user doesn't know diddly about
Internet domain name registration, and those people need to be
represented. It runs the risk of being intensely skewed toward
private, for-profit interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But some proponents of self-governance argue that the
participatory nature of the Internet will allow a bottom-up
approach to decision-making that has little precedent in the world
of parliaments and industrialists. David Johnson, director of the
Internet policy group at the Aspen Institute in Washington, points
to Farber's call for peace as an example of what he calls the
Internet's tendency toward natural ``self-ordering.'' After Farber
sent out his appeal he received vows of cooperation from many
sides. There is talk of a series of meetings around the world, to
which various factions would send delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, one of our senior moral leaders calls on the Net to grow
up and there's already progress in that direction,'' said Johnson,
a lawyer who was influential in drafting the government's
domain-name policy.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on recent research at the Santa Fe Institute and
elsewhere that holds that any complex system, whether technological
or biological, will spontaneously order itself, Johnson predicts
that the Internet will produce its own social order _ one that,
because it arises from the network itself, will have its own
legitimacy. Such an order would not rely on the delegation of state
power to representatives, but rather on contractual agreements
between Internet users who would then be responsible for their own
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people mean by self-regulation a small number of industry
players adopting voluntarily or even under duress some codes that
match what the government could legislate,'' Johnson said. ``What I
think the Net holds out as a possibility is a very different
mechanism.''

INTERNET CITIZENS DEBATE HOW TO FORM ONLINE UNION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are the times that try a cyberpatriot's soul.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jon Postel, who has served as the unflaggingly serene
citizen-sentry of the Internet's address system since he began
keeping track of it on a piece of notebook paper in 1969. But
Postel is weary these days, and a little bit grumpy _ and not
because the Internet has doubled in size yet again in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   It is because Postel, a University of Southern California
researcher, has recently been anointed a founding father of the
network's nascent political structure _ a move toward Internet
``self-governance'' that is being propelled by various
governmental, commercial and social forces.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three decades, Postel's work has been supported by a
combination of contracts from the federal government and consensus
by the Internet's ad hoc technical community. But now, as a de
facto delegate to what is shaping up as a constitutional convention
in cyberspace, Postel suddenly finds himself being accused of
seizing illegitimate power, threatened with lawsuits and bombarded
in e-mail wars.
</P>
<P>
   His critics include Jim Dixon, president of Euro Internet
Service Providers Association, a trade group of 600 Internet
companies in Europe. ``You have a small group of people asking that
they be given a large amount of power simply because they've been
there for a long time,'' complains Dixon, noting that Europe wants
more say in how the Internet will be run.
</P>
<P>
   His concerns are shared by many Internet industry leaders
outside the United States, who have made their feelings known to
Postel and the U.S. government via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Postel cannot help but feel besieged. ``I'd rather be doing the
technical stuff,'' he said recently with a sigh. ``But there are so
many questions that need to get answered. How do we form a
representative board? How do we make it international? How do we
find enough agreement to move forward?''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being Postel's private agony, these are among the
questions that are bound to be debated at a meeting near Washington
this week, at another in Geneva later in July and at various other
caucuses, conferences and online sessions this summer. The
partisans of the Net are working toward a Sept. 30 deadline for the
U.S. government to hand over control of a key portion of the
Internet to an as-yet-unformed nonprofit international group.
</P>
<P>
   Even for many Internet users who do not care much about the
specific job at hand _ determining who gets to register whom for
which types of Internet addresses _ the need to create a governing
system for that task has given a sense of urgency and common cause
to representatives from the government and industry, as well as the
libertarian technologists who have historically supervised the
Internet. Though they may have competing goals, all share a belief
in free-flowing communication and in the value of electronic
commerce, which the Department of Commerce recently reported was
growing twice as fast as the rest of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While no one is sure how it should work, the idea is that a
uniquely participatory medium like the Internet _ one that
transcends national borders and whose fast-evolving technology can
be shaped to fit social policy _ ought to be able to come up with
its own semiofficial political structure. Regulation by more
traditional means, the thinking goes, would stifle electronic
commerce and the free flow of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are sufficiently high to elicit a recent emotional
appeal from David Farber, a professor of computer science at the
University of Pennsylvania, who is a widely respected e-mail
pamphleteer with nearly 25,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we blow it, the result will be governance by governments
with all the negatives that holds for the future evolution of the
net,'' Farber recently wrote to his e-mail constituents. ``What do
we do. We could act grown up!! We could coordinate the meetings and
make it appear like we are organized. I wonder if the net
establishment is indeed willing to be grown up, or will they fight
till there is nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   His recent missive was a cry from the heart. ``This is a
defining moment,'' Farber said in an interview. ``If we can't pull
it together on something like this, governments are going to get
together and decide this is too important to their economic health
to leave in the hands of chaos. They'll start writing treaties, and
we'll end up with a very slow mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Farber is himself an Internet founding father. He was Postel's
thesis adviser in 1969 and assigned his student the task of
cataloguing Internet addresses. That academic exercise eventually
became a full-time job as the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority,
financed by the Department of Defense. While Network Solutions
Inc., a Reston, Va., company, has had an exclusive government
contract to register addresses under the most popular domains _
``.com,'' ``.net'' and ``.org,'' _ Postel has been responsible for
ensuring that each address corresponds to a unique string of digits
that all of the Internet's computers can recognize.
</P>
<P>
   And now Postel finds himself being swept toward that Sept. 30
deadline _ the date the Clinton administration recently set for
handing over control of the distribution of Internet addresses to
whatever international nonprofit group has formed by then. The
administration's report on the matter earlier this month prompted
the announcement of at least two meetings by competing factions,
with others rumored to be in the works. One, to take place in
Reston, Va., begins on Wednesday. The other, in Geneva, will start
July 21.
</P>
<P>
   With the administration and industry seeming to have more faith
in technology and market forces to regulate cyberspace than
legislation, the effort to supervise Internet addresses has become
the first test of the self-governance movement.

SUDDENLY A RUCKUS AT THE FRONT DOOR OF THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When America Online rebuffed AT&AMP;T's merger flirtations last
month, it could hardly have known that the long-distance giant
would soon marry what may be the online service's most potent
long-term enemy: the At Home Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At Home, in which AT&AMP;T will get a 42 percent interest as part of
its $31.8 billion acquisition bid for Tele-Communications Inc. last
week, markets a high-speed Internet service over cable television
wires. It is hardly a force today, with only about 100,000
subscribers. America Online says it has 12 million customers, more
than half of the homes in the United States that have online
access.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a new front is opening in the Internet wars with the
development of so-called broadband services like At Home that offer
transmission speeds 20 to 100 times as fast as traditional modems.
That is fast enough to offer rich graphics, live video feeds and an
end to the finger-tapping waiting that most online users endure
today.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the most visible battles in the broadband world are
among various technology providers _ for example, between
cable-modem systems and a new standard of high-speed Internet
access over telephone wires called digital subscriber lines. And
the cable industry itself is divided: One group backs At Home, and
another supports Time Warner's cable-modem service, Road Runner.
</P>
<P>
   But a much more intense clash is brewing over whether access to
broadband lines will be open to America Online or any other online
service or will be closed to all content except that chosen by the
system operator, just as cable systems now choose which channels to
carry. Not surprisingly, both At Home and Road Runner want to use
their wires to promote their own online news, information and
entertainment services.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter? For the same reason that media giants like
the Walt Disney Co. and General Electric's NBC have been buying
Internet directory services: It is clear that whoever controls the
front door that people use to start their Internet surfing _ a
``portal'' in industry jargon _ will control the biggest share of
advertising and shopping revenues. And whoever sells the connection
to the Internet, as America Online and At Home both do, controls
the portal.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the AT&AMP;T-TCI deal was announced, America
Online's chairman, Steve Case, issued a statement challenging At
Home's exclusive deal to provide high-speed programming over TCI's
cables and challenging AT&AMP;T to let his service offer high-speed
cable-modem access under its own brand.
</P>
<P>
   This did not sit well with At Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought that AT&AMP;T or TCI will become a dumb pipe and turn
over the portal service to AOL is just ridiculous,'' Thomas
Jermoluk, At Home's chairman, said in an interview last week. ``AOL
is paranoid about keeping exclusive control of the portal. But in
the new broadband world, the facilities provider wants to
participate in the revenue stream when users see ads and buy
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are compounded for At Home, which has a minority of
its shares trading publicly. The company has shot up to a value of
$4.2 billion despite huge losses because of the perceived potential
of its exclusive contracts with TCI and other cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, even if At Home controls the first screen its users
see, any At Home user with only a modest technical ability could
use the cable modem to gain access to America Online or any other
Internet service at high speeds. That is no different than the
ability of a current America Online user to jump right to Yahoo or
any other Internet site. But experience shows that that most people
do not tinker with default settings; they use whatever pops up on
the first screen they see.
</P>
<P>
   At Home, however, does not want simply to depend on inertia. It
has been developing attractive content that takes advantage of its
service's speed. Its news and information screens, for example,
have much bigger, brighter color graphics than other Web-based
services. And it offers a wide range of short video clips from
sources like CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Jermoluk says that one measure of the drawing power of these
flashy offerings is that half of At Home's first customers were
America Online members and that most of them dropped the online
service once they got used to the cable offering. His conclusion:
America Online will have to give up its dream of being the
exclusive portal in a broadband world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the access to the home,'' he said. ``If AOL wants to
get there with broadband, they will have to work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pittman, America Online's president, insists that despite
the protests over the current cable lockout, he is not worried. To
start with, it is very early in the game, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadband is just not ready for prime time,'' Pittman said. As
much as consumers may want faster access, broadband will not take
off, he said, until its price comes down from the current $40 a
month and customers can hook themselves up easily without
technicians visiting their homes, as the current technology
requires.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Pittman argues that for the foreseeable future,
the most likely prospect for broadband services is someone who is
already on line at slower speeds. Thus, America Online offers the
biggest pool of broadband prospects in the world. So the cable
companies and the phone companies will all eventually trip over
themselves to cut deals with the online service.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, economics always win,'' he said.
``Since we have so many subscribers, we have big buying power
already.'' Moreover, Pittman argues that AT&AMP;T's strategy of selling
telephone, cable and Internet services in one package will
ultimately prove ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about bundling, but what's missing is someone to
sell the bundle,'' he said. ``The only thing TCI can sell is cable
TV. AT&AMP;T has 80 million customers, but it was only able to get 1
million customers for Worldnet,'' the Internet service AT&AMP;T
introduced two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an interactive relationship with our consumers,'' he
added, ``so when we started offering long distance we converted 1
million lines in six months.''

COMPUSA: REVISING COMPUTER RETAILING
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ALLEN R. MYERSON  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDISON, Texas _ By a few minutes before midnight, a line
outside CompUSA's flagship store in this Dallas suburb stretched
past the training center entrance next door, the GNC nutrition
store, the Subway sandwich shop, the Packaging Store, the Elegant
Salon, the Converse Shoe Factory and Pam's Hallmark store.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had muted its mighty hype machine for the release of
Windows 98. But CompUSA, having just agreed to pay $275 million to
buy its chief rival, Computer City, from Tandy, was out to prove
that the computer retail store was not about to go the way of the
ice house.
</P>
<P>
   Its radio and newspaper advertisements offered the first 10
people in line a 266 megahertz computer for $98, and there were
special deals on modems, hard drives and so forth for those farther
back in a queue that began forming at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But how many in that line would buy a computer from CompUSA at
regular prices?
</P>
<P>
   Among the first 10 in line were Frank Callahan, a retired
regional sales manager for Raleigh Bicycles, and his wife, Janet.
Two years ago, when they bought their last computer, they came to
CompUSA to comparison shop. But they ordered their machine from IMS
Computers, a local assembler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get what we wanted built by IMS much cheaper,'' Janet
Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA's Packard Bell, Compaq and Acer models offered less
value and flexibility. ``Here, we had to take what was in the
package,'' Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Against competition from no-name direct marketers and shops like
IMS and big-name direct marketers like Dell Computer, CompUSA's
challenge is to keep the computer store alive even as it
diversifies into corporate sales and services.
</P>
<P>
   To attract customers like the Callahans, CompUSA again began
offering built-to-order computers last September under its own
brand name. Because the chain's previous effort to build its own
computers flopped a few years ago, this time it tried to avoid
accumulating a parts inventory _ whose value drops, on average, 2
percent a week _ by having contractors build the machines. But
since the contractors have not been able to keep up with demand,
the company says it will again start building computers.
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA's chief executive, James F. Halpin, a blunt, brusque
400-megahertz type of guy in an industry where last year's business
model is usually as outdated as last year's computer, came in and
saved the company in 1994 when it was on the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry has become even more competitive in the last
four years. Falling computer prices, strong competition and
diversification costs caused CompUSA's first-quarter profits to
fall 22 percent compared with the corresponding period a year
earlier, to $25.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Company-wide, sales rose 14 percent, to $1.45 billion, but for
the 122 stores that have been open a year or more, they rose just
1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As computer buyers become more informed and confident, direct
marketers like Dell and Gateway 2000 are growing faster than
computer superstores like CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   Halpin concedes that Dell and other companies that take orders
on line or over the phone offer more megahertz for the money. ``Our
major vendors haven't been able to give us machines that compete,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   While superstores as a category sold 3.1 million computers last
year _ an increase of almost a million in two years _ direct sales
rose by than 2 million, to 5.5 million units.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Direct markets are gaining a further advantage as more customers
shop on the Internet. Dell, which had sales of just $1 million a
day on its World Wide Web site in March 1997, was up to $3 million
a day by Christmas and is now billing $5 million a day on line _
more than 13 percent of its total sales.
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA also recently began selling over the Internet, but the
popularity of computers selling for less than $1,000, at slim
profit margins, is squeezing revenues. Dataquest, a market research
company in San Jose, Calif., expects computer sales to rise 16
percent, to 35.2 million units, this year, but revenues to rise
only 3 percent, to $69.5 billion. The average price will fall to
$1,974 this year from $2,223 last year, Dataquest predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Halpin portrays lower prices as an advantage because they expand
the market. Over the last two years, he said, the average family
income of computer buyers has fallen from $75,000 to less than
$50,000. ``Computers have become affordable to the middle class,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts called the Computer City acquisition a bargain,
pointing out that it eliminated a chief rival and afforded CompUSA
inexpensive expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Harrington, editor of Computer Retail Week, sees the
Computer City acquisition raising CompUSA's profit margins, but
wonders if the company is trying to do too many things at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't fully integrated all the businesses they've
started,'' Harrington said. ``A bleeding Computer City on its back
is really going to test the company to the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Though CompUSA announced that it would close some Computer City
stores, keeping the remainder staffed with qualified salespeople
could be a challenge. At one nearby Computer City store,
salespeople said that under Tandy, commissions had often doubled or
tripled their daily earnings. If CompUSA pays them like it pays its
own salespeople, who work without commissions, ``We're going to
leave,'' said one Computer City salesperson as others nodded.
</P>
<P>
   But in a field littered with wounded rivals _ Computer City has
been a steady money loser _ CompUSA and Halpin still appear to have
the best shot at revising the formula.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight last Thursday, Halpin was seen surveying the
600 or so customers storming through the doors of his San Francisco
store. ``I'm pumped!'' he was heard bellowing. ``It's like election
night. The votes are coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has positioned Windows 98 as minor upgrade, but Halpin
describes it as a spark for the whole computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I installed it on my daughter's computer at home,'' he
recounted. ``I asked her how she liked it. `Awesome,' she said.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case shoppers are less impressed, CompUSA is moving
beyond brick-and-mortar stores. ``We sell computers any way a
customer wants to buy them,'' Halpin said. ``We can deliver and
install from one PC up to 2,000. We want to train you. We want to
service you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Addison store's back offices include a sales operation where
each workday 28 salespeople ring up businesses and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, challenges grow in the consumer end of the business.
Despite a towering kiosk trumpeting CompUSA's built-to-order
computers, few of the customers who showed up at the Addison store
on Thursday seemed aware of this option. With its own label, the
company says it can beat even Dell's prices on such systems _ a
contention Dell disputes _ but it will have to convince the many
current CompUSA customers who say they visit the stores mostly to
see what's new, maybe buy some cables or software before heading
elsewhere to buy a computer.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many shoppers are increasingly able to outsmart
the best marketing schemes.
</P>
<P>
   As Lisa Adams and Howard J. Huang, Dallas medical students,
stood in a checkout line, they described what seemed like an offer
of free _ or better than free _ computer memory modules: 16
megabytes of memory for $38 with a $40 mail-in rebate, but with
only one rebate per customer. They explained, however, that the
memory could only be installed in pairs. One rebate on two memory
chips made the price higher than that charged by other marketers on
the Internet, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're counting on you to buy the other one,'' Huang said.
``Smart marketing trick.''
</P>
<P>
   But not smart enough. Huang and Ms. Adams were each buying one
16-megabyte module and pooling their rebates. They got 32 megabits
of free memory for Adams' computer _ truly for free.

INTEL'S ANTITRUST ALTERNATIVE: AVOID PUBLIC CONFRONTATION
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JOEL BRINKLEY  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Justice Department was readying its
antitrust suit against Microsoft this spring, the company hired a
dozen powerful lobbyists, choreographed rallies and news
conferences and issued sharp denunciations of the government. In
short, it waged the technology industry's equivalent of a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when the Federal Trade Commission was preparing its
antitrust suit against Intel this month, the company offered a
simple, polite statement: ``We are cooperating with the government
and will continue to cooperate. They are just doing their job, and
we respect their right to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the federal government filed its suit against
Intel, the world's largest manufacturer of microprocessor chips,
the company has remained largely silent, unwilling to offer
anything more than the most rudimentary public defense. And while
Microsoft representatives have been aggressively lobbying Congress
and the administration, Intel's are nowhere to be seen _ except at
the trade commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard from them at all,'' said a senior
Congressional aide, who would normally be a target of lobbying on
antitrust issues. ``I just cleaned out my in-basket, and there's
nothing from them there at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Mulloy, the company spokesman who management decided would
be Intel's sole voice on the subject, explains the silence this
way: ``We don't think it benefits either side in this case to
conduct a debate in the public forum.''
</P>
<P>
   But background discussions with other Intel executives and
interviews with analysts who track the company closely suggest a
more complex set of motives. For one, they say, Intel's leaders
believe that Microsoft's aggressive public-relations blitz
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe Microsoft hurt themselves as much as they
helped,'' said Michael Slater, editor of The Microprocessor Report,
an industry newsletter. ``Microsoft came across as basically
arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, a technology analyst with Cowan &AMP; Company, said,
``They took their cue from Microsoft and realized that the more
exposure they get, the less good it is for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Intel executive agreed. Just after Microsoft staged a
rally of sorts in New York in early May, at which the company's
chairman, William H. Gates, and other industry executives exhorted
the government to stay out of the software business, this executive
asked with a dismissive chuckle, ``Can you imagine Andy doing
that?'' Andy Grove, Intel's chief executive at the time, is widely
admired in the computer industry for being a fierce but gracious
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   No one contends that Intel's leaders are humble, self-effacing
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The egos at the top of Intel are every bit as large as the
egos at the top of Microsoft; they feel just as self-righteous,''
said Richard Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners, an
industry research company.
</P>
<P>
   But the company shows little of that to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel's not a company that likes to talk about anything but
product,'' Slater said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Intel's lawyers say they view the outcome of the trade
commission's suit as crucial to the company's future. The
government accuses Intel of threatening and injuring three computer
manufacturers as a means of coercing them to turn over patented
technologies by withholding technical information about Intel's
latest chips.
</P>
<P>
   The company insists that it must maintain full control over its
patented technologies and therefore will take the case all the way
to the Supreme Court if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts and Intel executives noted that the company
faces even greater threats beyond the scope of the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to deal with a real upheaval that has never
been seen before in the PC business _ pricing challenges'' in the
sub-$1,000 personal computer market, Peck said. There, Intel's
competitors are making real inroads, and the company's stock has
been in a prolonged slump. It closed Friday at $76.1875 a share,
down more than 25 percent from its 52-week high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the other challenges they face now,'' Peck said, ``this
doesn't have the highest priority. Besides, I don't think Intel
wants to be the test case, the litmus test for intellectual
property cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulloy says only, ``We have made a decision to litigate this in
the courts.'' And 10 days ago, the company did file a motion with
the court, arguing that the companies named in the suit _ Compaq,
Digital Equipment and Intergraph _ were customers, not competitors,
and therefore not subject to harm under federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mulloy does take issue with the notion that Intel's strategy is
a direct reaction to Microsoft's approach.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that Intel issued a press release on Sept. 24,
announcing that the FTC had notified the company that it had opened
an investigation _ several weeks before the Justice Department
filed its suit against Microsoft. And that early release was just
as low key as the more recent statements and remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company said it will cooperate fully with the FTC in its
investigation,'' the release said, and then concluded with a bit of
what turned out to be undue optimism: ``In 1993, after a similar
investigation, the F.T.C. concluded that no further action was
warranted, and the investigation was closed. Intel expects that the
current investigation will come to a similar conclusion.''

Internet spreading child porn, investigators say 
By Ron Martz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal investigators say it was not unusual for
25-year-old Stephen Parrish of Atlanta to spend six hours a day in
front of his computer, cruising the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most people who use the Internet for research or
legitimate entertainment, Parrish had a more sinister motive,
searching for child pornography and stalking young boys in teen
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Parrish had his
probation revoked for a previous child pornography conviction in
Florida and was sentenced to eight years and a month in federal
prison. Prosecutors said the sentence was one of the longest in
memory for probation revocation but was justified because of
Parrish's obssession with child pornography and young boys.
</P>
<P>
   That type of on-line obssession is not unusual for pedophiles
and some child molesters, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen people who spend 12 to 18 hours a day on their
computers doing this. They hardly have time to eat or sleep,'' said
Gene Weinschenk, director of the Cyberspace Smuggling Center for
the U.S. Customs Service in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish is among what federal officials believe is a growing
number of people, mostly male, who are using their computers to
collect and distribute child pornography and to cruise numerous
unmonitored chat rooms in search of potential underage sex
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a dirty old man in a trenchcoat hanging out by the
school yard, now you have dirty old men on the computer,'' said Pat
Johnson, supervisory special agent in charge of Crimes Against
Children investigations in the FBI's Atlanta office.
</P>
<P>
   The ``dirty old men'' have turned out to be pillars of the
community in some instances.
</P>
<P>
   _ The former city manager of Camilla, Ga., and his wife were
sentenced to 50 years in prison earlier this month after pleading
guilty to molesting the woman's two children. Investigators say the
couple had sex with the two teenage boys, photographed the acts and
distributed the photos and videos on the Internet while collecting
thousands of other images of child pornography on their computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ An Alpharetta father of five and youth-league baseball coach
pleaded guilty in May to transporting, distributing and possessing
child pornography. He was arrested on his way to St. Louis to meet
who he believed was a 13-year-old girl he had courted on the
Internet. The girl turned out to be an adult police officer who was
part of a sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Lafayette, La., a former Boy Scout leader and his one-time
roommate were each sentenced to 19 years and seven months in prison
for sexually exploiting children and producing child pornography.
Investigators found more than 1,800 images of child pornography on
computer equipment used by the men.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since January, customs officials say, they have arrested a
minister, a church choir leader, a pediatrician and the former head
of the child abuse unit of the New Orleans Police Dept., all on
child pornography charges and all involving use of computers.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Kenneth Lanning, who specializes in cases involving
the sexual victimization of children for the bureau's Behavioral
Science Unit in Quantico, Va., said customs had virtually wiped out
importation of child pornography by the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the advent of high-speed modems and computers made child
porn easily accessible from anywhere in the world,'' Lanning said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also has enabled pedophiles and child molesters to
more easily communicate with others like themselves, Lanning said.
``They spend a lot of time on-line with people who are like them in
an effort to validate their own behavior and feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials say the surge in use of personal computers is
directly linked to a marked increase in their arrests for kiddie
smut. In fiscal year 1995 Customs recorded 48 arrests for child
pornography. The following year that number doubled to 96 and in
1997 it jumped again to 136. As of April 1, 1998, Customs had
recorded 104 child porn arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the problem, the FBI set up an anti-child porn
unit called ``Innocent Images'' that Johnson says is ``the most
overt undercover operation in the country.'' Originally started in
1993 as an investigation into a missing 10-year-old Baltimore boy,
agents soon learned that a number of children in their area had
been sexually exploited over a period of time and that computers
were routinely being used to transmit images of child pornography
involving them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (investigation) gave rise to the fact that this was a
national problem. Until that time we had no idea about the scope
and magnitude of the problem,'' said FBI agent Pete Gulotta, a
former member of the Innocent Images squad.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent Images is now a nationwide undercover operation that
attempts to identify individuals who use computers to recruit
underage sex partners and those who distribute child pornography on
a large scale. The operation has become something of a
clearinghouse and repository for the FBI on child pornography and
child molesters who cross state lines to find their victims, known
to investigators as travellers.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception Innocent Images has obtained 181 arrests,
176 indictments, and 201 convictions (some individuals were
convicted of multiple offenses).
</P>
<P>
   Convicting pedophiles and child pornographers is usually not
difficult because many keep large collections and meticulous
records, according to Janice Jenkins, an assistant U.S. attorney
who prosecutes child porn cases in the Northern District of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the cases plead out because usually there is just so
much evidence,'' said Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   In one case prosecuted by Jenkins she said a doctor was caught
when he inadvertently left his computer on with a screen-saver that
showed two young boys having sex. His maid saw it and called
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these people it's not a matter of thinking; it's a matter
of need,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   What investigators and sex therapists are still trying to
determine is whether the Internet is prompting the seeming
explosion of child pornography or merely making it easier to get to
the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``This problem became more apparent as the Internet grew,'' said
Larry Faust, spokesman for the FBI's Baltimore office and Innocent
Images. ``It isn't necessarily growing. It's always been there.
We're just discovering the magnitude of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Strickland, a psychotherapist at the Highland Institutue
for Behavioral Change in Atlanta who treats pedophiles and other
sex offenders, said ``we're definitely seeing more people in
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   She attributes part of that to the FBI's interest and ability in
tracking down pedophiles who use their computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people they are going to catch are the obsessive
pedophiles who spend a lot of time on the Internet looking for
pictures or in chat rooms. That's their interest. That's their
arousal,'' Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Strickland said child molesters usually do not spend
as much time on the Internet as those who collect porn, there are
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more horrific cases on record, FBI officials say
that in 1996 they broke up the U.S. portion of a child porn ring in
which members linked their computers so they could watch children
being molested on-line. What was known as the Orchid Club allegedly
had members in nine states and four countries. The members
exchanged still pictures and videos of child pornography that
included real-time molestation of several children 10 and younger.
Sixteen people were indicted and three men are now serving federal
terms ranging from 30 to 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more insidious aspects of computer technology and its
relation to child pornography is a technique called morphing. Those
familiar with the technique can download photographs of innocent
children from an individual's home page about his family and morph
them into sexually explicit photographs that are then widely
distributed on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and investigators believe they are
only seeing a small portion of the problem with the Internet and
the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl Hedrick, an inspector who specializes in child pornography
for the U.S. Postal Service said that he has ``600 active cases
available for investigation at any one time'' in the region he
covers, which is Alabama, Georgia and the Panhandle of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am buried with investigations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hedrick estimates there are ``3,000-4,000 targets for potential
investigations of child pornography principally through the mail''
in his southeast region. ``It would be much, much higher if you
added computer cases. It's phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   In March the Atlanta FBI office put one agent full-time on cases
involving crimes against children, which includes sexual
exploitation and pornography. There have already been three
convictions with 13 cases still being investigated as a result of
increased emphasis on the problem, according to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a week goes by that I don't get several tips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now considering legislation that would toughen
penalties for those who use their computers to lure kids into
having sex. Passed earlier this month in the House 416-0, the bill
would make it a federal crime to send obscene materials to minors,
possess even a single image of child pornography or to simply make
contact with anyone under 18 for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activity.
</P>

enough for a situation that seems to be perilously close to
spinning out of control.

INTERNET SAFETY TIPS FOR PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tips for parents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Never allow children to have computers in their rooms or any
part of the house where they could have unsupervised access to the
Internet. Keep the computer in a public area of the home and make
unannounced checks to see what your children are doing on-line.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use services provided by your Internet Service Provider or
commercially available software to block access to chat rooms or
inappropriate sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Instruct your children to never give out identifying
information such as name, address, telephone number or school name
in a public message forum such as a chat room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage your children not to respond to any messages or
bulletin boards that are suggestive, obscene, belligerent,
threatening, or that make them feel uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stress to your children that the 12- or 13-year-old girl or
boy they think they may be chatting with on-line may actually be an
adult. Pedophiles often compile profiles of children before
recruiting them to become victims.
</P>
<P>
   _ Advise your children not to upload photographs of themselves
to anyone they do not know personally. They may be providing those
photographs to a pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your children should be instructed to never download
photographs from anyone they do not personally know. They could be
receiving pornography.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stress to your children the dangers of arranging face-to-face
meetings with someone they have met on the Internet.
</P>
<P>

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (The Week in Review)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In supercomputing, the time separating the
world's fastest computer from the scrap-metal heap is appallingly
short.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to supercomputers, to become obsolescent isn't
necessarily to become useless. While many of these machines are
mothballed in dank basements, a few are proudly displayed in
private homes as though they were objets d'art. They can also make
dandy space heaters.
</P>
<P>
   The obsolescence of a supercomputer is predictable. The reason,
of course, is Moore's Law. Three decades ago, the co-founder of
Intel Corp., Gordon Moore, observed that every 18 months it is
possible to place about twice the number of transistors on the same
piece of silicon. So now personal computers are nearly as fast as
yesterday's supercomputer _ which cost many thousands of dollars
more.
</P>
<P>
   The life span of a supercomputer, which may cost upwards of $30
million, is typically five years, and sometimes far less. Jack
Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who
maintains an annual list of the world's 500 fastest computers,
finds that about 250 machines fall off his list yearly.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no pasture to go out to when a supercomputer is
retired. No one reharnesses it to do the billing statements for the
local waterworks. The life of a machine is nasty, brutish and
short.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   In a warehouse in suburban Seattle, Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's
chief scientist, keeps a growing collection now numbering six
supercomputers _ three early Crays and three Connection Machines
made by Thinking Machines Corp. The Cray 1, designed in 1976 by the
legendary inventor Seymour Cray, was notable in part because it was
a round refrigerator-shaped cabinet encircled by a padded bench,
which was just the thing for technicians who needed to work on the
machine's innards.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the original Crays have less processing power than some
$1,000 personal computers, but as fashion statements, their time
may be here again.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold is now planning a new home that will rival that of his
boss, Bill Gates. It will have a living room big enough for a
supercomputer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key aesthetic is that it is the most expensive sofa in the
world,'' said Myhrvold, who bought his machines for their salvage
costs or for a few thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold is not the only computer designer who finds the
furniture concept attractive. Not long ago Brewster Kahle, one of
the founders of Thinking Machines Corp., learned that one of the
company's Connection Machines was sitting unplugged in the basement
of the Yale University computer science department.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that old supercomputers are remarkably expensive to
run. Electricity for a Cray 1 would cost $30,000 a month with an
additional $30,000 in electricity costs for the refrigeration
system, according to Dag Spicer, manager of historical collection
at the Computer Museum History Center in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The operating cost didn't bother Kahle, however; he paid Yale
$500 for the Connection Machine and then spent $1,000 for shipping.
It now sits in storage under a staircase in San Francisco, near his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Kahle has big plans for his Connection Machine, which has
thousands of flashing lights and would look right at home on the
flight deck of the starship Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awfully big,'' said Kahle. ``I think I'm going to need a
conference room to display it in, or maybe my next living room.''
</P>
<P>
   A small living room didn't constrain Dan Lynch, an Internet
pioneer who was one of the founders of Cybercash. Lynch, a wine
aficionado, says he has a Cray 1 as an objet d'art in his vineyard
in the Napa Valley along with ``a bunch of tired old '47 Chevys.''
</P>
<P>
   While at Convex, a Texas-based supercomputer company, Steven
Wallach, a computer designer, once used an Alliant supercomputer in
his office as a conversation piece and as partial support for his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   But even Wallach, who was one of the designers featured in Tracy
Kidder's book, ``Soul of a New Machine'' (Atlantic/Little, Brown,
1982), said he was surprised to learn that another Convex employee
had bought a Convex C-1 for its scrap price and was using the
computer to heat his garage.

Tech Report: Listen up _ minidisc or CD-RW? 
By Michael E. Kanell  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dueling formats _ you know the story.
</P>
<P>
   It could be VHS against Betamax. Or compact discs against vinyl.
Fax vs. e-mail, vs. the Postal Service. Among wireless phones, it
could be traditional cellular against personal communications
services, or analog against digital.
</P>
<P>
   In connecting to the Internet, there is a coming battle between
phone lines called Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines, known as
ADSL, and cable modems running over cable lines. And for them to
succeed, they must both overcome the slower but more entrenched
modems.
</P>
<P>
   The formats clash. Sometimes one dies, and sometimes they
coexist. Television did not kill radio _ although both were changed
by the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Music in the past few decades has provided some high-stakes
confrontations _ and plenty of reasons for consumers to place bets
on a winner by spending billions of dollar on a format. And if they
bet on a loser, well, they get to bet all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Before there were CDs, cassettes had to stomp eight-track
players and reel-to-reel. Quadraphonic sound arrived roaring and
expired quietly. Before that, long-playing vinyl records learned to
live with the 45 rpm single. That was, after the LP dealt a
post-World War II death blow to the old 78 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Now the industry is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   The minidisc is a format that offers users a chance to pick
their own selections. It lets people customize their workout or
driving music. There is a recording deck at home, but the medium
you carry is nice and light, affordable and portable.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds kinda like the cassette, doesn't it? And that is just
what the minidisc makers want to replace. After all, the minidisc
is a digital format, a far superior recording to cassette.
</P>
<P>
   Minidisc, while big in Japan, has never been a smash here. Sony
years ago introduced it to thundering apathy. Not one to be easily
beaten, Sony came back into the market about 18 months ago with a
new version and a marketing blitz. Prices for some minidisc
recorders have fallen since then from $600 to under $500 _ with
some still-cheaper machines to be released this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the minidisc has a new foe: the rewriteable compact disc.
The CD-RW has some potential advantages _ most obviously, that it
comes in the CD format. But the folks at Sony want you to know that
minidisc is easier to record, smaller and more portable than the
CD-RW. Sony also notes that current CD players cannot play CD-RW,
although any machine that can play CD-RW can play all your other
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle is still evolving. Both CD-RW and minidisc have
yet to amass the kind of market size that can make all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highest-profile makers of the technology are Philips
(http://www.philips
</P>
<P>
   .com/home.html) and Ricoh (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .ricohdms.com/welcome.html). Another good place to start for
more information about CD-RW and other similar technologies is a
Web site run by Worldspan Communications
(http://www.span.com/shoptext
</P>
<P>
   /c.htm).
</P>
<P>
   For more information about dealers selling the minidisc, call
Sony (1-800-222-SONY). For information about Sony's products, visit
the company Web site (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .sony.com).
</P>
<P>
   High-tech ethics
</P>
<P>
   Computer error? Yeah, sure.
</P>
<P>
   Technology offers choices, and apparently an awful lot of
Americans are choosing to do things with it that are somewhat ....
questionable, including the use of technology as an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   A study shows nearly half of America's workers have ``engaged in
unethical actions'' related to new technologies, according to the
report commissioned by Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America and
State Farm Insurance Cos.
</P>
<P>
   The study was released by the American Society of Chartered Life
Underwriters, the Chartered Financial Consultants and the Ethics
Officer Association.
</P>
<P>
   The second-most-common behavior listed in the study was
``wrongly blaming an error you made on a technological glitch,''
which 14 percent of those surveyed admitted to. Nearly the same
number acknowledged using office equipment to shop on the Internet
and copying company software for home use.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more ominously, nearly 50 percent reported that
technology was causing them increased on-the-job pressure. But
perhaps a lot of answers depend on your definition: More than half
of those responding said playing computer games during work hours
and using e-mail for personal messages was not unethical. By
contrast, 70 percent said using technology to intrude unnecessarily
on privacy was unethical _ for example, paging an employee during
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But the most common confession was one familiar to any Atlanta
commuter: 19 percent of those surveyed said they have created ``a
potentially dangerous situation by using new technologies while
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Is your computer watching you?
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has released a report on privacy to
Congress that seems to show the long arm of the Internet reaching
into your home and office.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on an online survey of 1,400 commercial Web
sites, concluded that upward of 85 percent of Web sites collect
personal information, while only 14 percent provide any notice
about that practice, according to the Electronic Privacy and
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   The center called the findings proof ``that self-regulation has
been so far unsuccessful.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report is available online
(http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/reports.htm). A previous report by the
center, called ``Surfer Beware,'' is also online
(http://www.epic.org
</P>
<P>
   /reports/surfer-beware.html).

Tech Tools: Many frustrations of computing call for the touch of a
poet 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I occasionally meet people who, upon finding that I'm
the guy who fills this space, tell me that they often read it but
rarely understand it, because it's too technical for them.
</P>
<P>
   I seldom know how to reply. I would like to take it as a great
compliment that my prose is presumably so intrinsically riveting
that people habitually read it even though they know they cannot
understand it. However, this smacks of fetishism, of some bizarre
kind of literary masochism. I am reluctant to assist in such
pursuits. Who knows where they might lead?
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, this column is dedicated to the literati among you
who run computers despite an innate loathing of them; consider it
your reward for reading this column even when it bewilders you.
</P>
<P>
   For those more involved in computers than poetry, I should
probably make clear that these are haiku, a form of Japanese verse
made with only three lines, the first usually consisting of five
syllables, the second of seven and the third of five.
</P>
<P>
   I am indebted to Dr. Frank Miller of Greenville, S.C., who sent
them to me, and to a gentleman named Robert Shiarella, who sent
them to Dr. Miller, and to whomever wrote them, wherever he/she may
be. She/he is a true artist.

   You ask way too much.

TechnoBuddy: Old, familiar antenna magical at enhancing reception 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hard for technology to shock people anymore. Once
upon a time, folks sat open-mouthed at their first sight of a
television set. When radio was first invented, some people
seriously thought it might be the work of devils. And nowadays we
have computers that can read handwriting, understand human speech
and translate more languages than a platoon of U.N. translators.
</P>
<P>
   So _ compared to all that _ I have my work cut out for me when I
tell you that the most magical technological device that I know is
an antenna. For most of you, an antenna is one of those ugly
aluminum things that once sprouted on rooftops across America. It
was replaced by cable TV and lately, in increasing numbers by the
pizza-sized dish antennas used by satellite TV systems.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why an antenna is such a magic device, think of
how it works. In its simplest form _ maybe one of those whip
antennas you find on portable radios and TVs _ it's no more than a
hunk of metal. There's no need to power it with electricity. Yet it
captures tiny electrical signals broadcast by the radio or TV
station and then translates those signals into music and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent more than my share of time building antennas because
of my ham radio hobby, sometimes stringing hundreds of feet of wire
between tall trees just so that I could talk and listen to people
around the world. Most of you will never have to embarrass yourself
in front of your neighbors as I have _ using a casting rod in my
back yard trying to get a fishing line over a tree so that I could
use that line to pull a rope over the tree so that I could hoist up
the wire. I'll never forget the way the neighbors peered out their
windows, wondering what kind of fish I hoped to catch in a tall oak
tree.
</P>
<P>
   But now that a lot of us live and work in steel-and-concrete
cages in the form of high-rises and apartment buildings, there are
practical reasons to learn a little about antennas. An
acquaintance, here at the newspaper, complained to me the other day
that her fancy portable shortwave radio couldn't pull in many
stations. And here at the newspaper, you can't pick up many of the
local AM stations.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in both cases isn't the strength of the signals. The
problem was that the buildings themselves _ both at the newspaper
and the place where my friend lives _ were blocking the signal.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the newspaper, we solved the problem by putting up a
simple wire antenna _ the kind you can buy at Radio Shack for about
$10 _ on the roof. Then we used coaxial cable _ that's the same
kind of shielded cable used to pipe in cable TV signals _ to
connect the antenna to the radio.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what I'll do with my friend. The outside antenna
doesn't have to be fancy at all to pick up commercial shortwave
stations or the local AM broadcast. In cases like the ones I
mentioned, the purpose of the antenna isn't to amplify the signal,
it's simply to grab the signal from a point outside the steel cage
and then to pipe that signal inside.
</P>
<P>
   You may be in the same boat. Even some homes have enough wire
and steel in them to make any kind of radio _ shortwave or regular
AM _ pretty feeble. The good thing about this problem is that an
antenna is one of the few technological devices that the average
person can build for himself. Unlike transmitting antennas, the
shape and length of the wire you use isn't all that important (in
fact, with most portable radios, you actually don't want to have
too big of an antenna _ the signal can overload radios built to
work with a whip antenna).
</P>
<P>
   So, whether you're trying to pull in a shortwave station from a
station in Beirut or just listen to the Braves on your broadcast
radio, consider draping a short length of wire out the window and
connecting it to the antenna terminal on your radio.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind how antennas work is maddeningly complex, but
building them isn't.

   ATLANTA _ Tomorrow is another day.
</P>
<P>
   It's also another day to see the 1939 classic ``Gone With the
Wind'' on the big screen the way it was meant to be seen. A
generation of mothers and grandmothers will be taking their teenage
daughters and granddaughters off to see their generation's
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a generation of daughters and granddaughters can take
the opportunity to check out ``GWTW'' on the World Wide Web and
maybe teach mom and grandma a little bit about cybersurfing at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   The official ``Gone With the Wind'' Web site has an easy address
to remember, http://www.franklymydear.com. ``GWTW'' buffs know this
is Rhett's (Clark Gable) parting shot to Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) at
the movie's end and one of the most memorable and classic lines
ever uttered in film (next to DiCaprio's ``I'm king of the world,''
of course.).
</P>
<P>
   New Line films, the distributor of the newly restored film, has
created a beautiful site, filled with classic photos and trivia. A
special treat is the time line, which gives an amazing
month-by-month account of the making of the movie. Visitors learn
about casting problems, costume problems and the insistence of
African-American cast members that certain words be deleted from
the script. In the '90s, its very trendy for movie companies to put
up Web sites for their films, but this site for the 1939 classic
has to be one of the richest, most informative and beautiful Web
sites ever done to complement a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the film are also fascinated with Margaret Mitchell and
her best-selling novel, on which the movie is based. While visitors
to Atlanta won't be able to find Scarlett's fictional homestead of
Tara (not that this stops them from asking directions), they can
visit the Margaret Mitchell House in person or on the Web at
http://www.gwtw.org. Here, visitors can read up on the woman who
penned the novel.
</P>
<P>
   The house, which is located in Midtown Atlanta, was one of
Mitchell's many homes and the one where she wrote most of ``Gone
With the Wind.'' Mitchell's story is also an interesting step back
into what the world and the South was like in her time. The design
is simple, and there is a lot of reading, but it's good reading.
</P>
<P>
   The Gone with the Wind Online Exhibit (http://www.lib
</P>
<P>
   .utexas.edu/Libs/HRC/HRHRC/DOS/GWTW/GWTW.html) is a project of
the Harry Ransom Humanities Center at the University of Texas at
Austin. It's a wonderful repository of ``GWTW'' memorabilia,
historical documents such as producer David O. Selznick's memo to
Louella Parsons, and pictures of the original costumes, including
the famous ``curtain rod'' dress. The site is elegantly designed
and a fascinating look behind-the-scenes at the making of ``Gone
With the Wind.''

Mac News: Excel makes better use of Mac's innovations 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the uninitiated, Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet
program has always been an 800-pound gorilla _ powerful and
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, because the program can be very useful if you're
not scared off by its impenetrable appearance and seemingly endless
list of features.
</P>
<P>
   In Excel 98, the latest version, Microsoft's programmers wisely
switched strategy. Instead of adding yet more functions, they
focused on making Excel easier to use and understand.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a program that, while still at times overwhelming,
is greatly improved. Here's a look at some of the more important
changes.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of my list is 16 levels of undo and redo. Many users
have long been reluctant to try Excel's powerful functions, fearing
a mistake would mess up their stock portfolio or home finances. Now
you can go back or forward 16 steps at a time. Nearly any misstep
can be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Excel now also lets you quickly check a formula analyzing a set
of numbers. For starters, there's a feature called AutoCorrect,
which automatically identifies and corrects 15 of the most common
formula errors.
</P>
<P>
   You can also double-click a spreadsheet cell with a formula, and
Excel will highlight any data involved in it. That way you can
quickly check to see if you've included the right numbers for the
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Another nifty improvement is the ability to name in English a
cell or range of cells. You can, for example, name a row of figures
``June sales.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes work easier yet, because then you can use that named
range of cells in a formula instead of typing in an arcane list of
cell addresses. For example, you could write a formula that says
``June sales minus June expenses.'' Now isn't that easier than
typing A4:B6 - C3:C8?
</P>
<P>
   Excel now includes lots of formula templates, easily accessible
from the upper left corner of any spreadsheet. Select one of these
templates and plug in your own cells or numbers. You can also cut
and paste parts of the templates to form formulas of your own.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Microsoft had ignored Apple Computer's
innovations in the Mac versions of its software. Excel 98 reverses
this practice. It reflects the new look of OS 8 and its
improvements, including contextual menus, drag-and-drop and sticky
menus. You can also easily link data between documents.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy Excel as a stand-alone product for $399 (the upgrade
is $149) or get it as part of Office 98. It's a suite of programs
that includes Word, Outlook and Proponent in addition to Excel.
Office retails for $499 (the upgrade is $299).

Cyberscene: Get informed about heat-related ills 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just about the coolest thing a person can do on the
Internet at this time of the year is to find ways to get out of the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of Web sites that suggest ways to stay cool
during the hot summer.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop is at the Atlanta-based Weather Channel site at
http://www.weather.com. That organization has a special site at
http://www.weather.com
</P>
<P>
   /safeside/heat/ devoted to dealing with the heat.
</P>
<P>
   You'll learn right away that staying cool in the extreme heat is
more than just a way of being comfortable. It can save your life.
You are reminded, high up on the page, that: ``In 1995, extreme
heat contributed to the deaths of almost 500 people in Chicago. And
that same year, it killed more people in the United States than all
other natural disasters combined.''
</P>
<P>
   So pay attention as you follow the well-thought-out links on
this page. At the click of your mouse, you can be whisked to areas
that tell you what you can do to stay cool (and safe) during a heat
wave; how to determine if your age or physical condition put you at
special risk; and how to prepare for a heat emergency.
</P>
<P>
   While sunburns aren't as serious as a heatstroke, they are very
common in the South. And since long exposure to the sun can
increase your risk of skin cancer, it's worth your time to learn
about protecting your skin from serious burns. So before we leave
the excellent Weather Channel site, let's drop in at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .weather.com/health/sunpro
</P>
<P>
   .html.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find out about sunscreens and lotions, but _ for those
who want to be really scientific about fighting the sun _ you can
also follow a link from this page to learn how to read the Weather
Channel's ultraviolet forecast maps that show the intensity of
these rays in different parts of the country. The UV ratings _
which start at zero and go to levels beyond 10 _ can call for
protection as simple as wearing a hat (at levels of 2 or below) to
staying inside if you can (when levels are 10 or higher).
</P>
<P>
   Our next site also originates in Atlanta. It's from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. The page, called ``Extreme Heat
_ A Prevention Guide to Promote Your Personal Health and Safety''
can be found at http://www.cdc
</P>
<P>
   .gov/nceh/programs/emergenc
</P>
<P>
   /prevent/heat/heat.htm. While the information isn't as
well-organized as what's offered by the Weather Channel, you will
find links from this page to topic areas that offer the same sort
of common-sense advice you got from your mother. For instance, you
are told to drink plenty of fluids, pace yourself when working in
the heat and to wear appropriate clothing. While most people who
have enough sense to come in from the heat already know these
things, you'll find plenty of details and tips that may come as a
surprise. For instance, it's smart _ on a really hot day _ to avoid
extremely cold beverages since the contrast in the temperatures can
actually produce a harmful shock to your system in some instances.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Federal Emergency Management Agency site, the last
heat-related page on our tour of hot sites says that even a cool
shower after coming inside from hot temperatures can ``result in
hypothermia, particularly for elderly and very young people.''
</P>
<P>
   So even common sense can fail you in hot weather. But, as long
as you're inside in air-conditioned comfort surfing the Web, you're
safe from even the hottest day.

OWNERSHIP FUZZY IN DIGITAL WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the gap between the computerized world and
the real one shrinking quickly, the implications of virtual actors
become more interesting. And so do the accompanying problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as you can kidnap real people to make money, you can
kidnap virtual people to make money,'' said Joseph Beard, a St.
John's University law professor who specializes in intellectual
property issues.
</P>
<P>
   By kidnapping, Beard means swiping the virtual re-creation of a
person, living or dead, and using it for profit. And that will get
easier and easier the more powerful and accessible the technology
becomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers tend to lag (behind) technology,'' said Beard. ``I
really thought we would have longer than we do have. But the
technology's really taken off. The goal is to be indistinguishable
from real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Swiss researcher Nadia Thalmann's MIRALab at the
University of Geneva can take two digitized photographs of a person
and spit out a pretty good 3-D computer copy that talks and makes
appropriate facial gestures and interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Given the burgeoning business of celebrity porn on the Internet,
particularly where a star's face is digitally pasted onto someone
else's nude body, the implications for digital theft can be
dizzying, and troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm W.C. (Field)'s grandson,'' said Ronald Fields, a
television writer whose grandfather has been rendered into a
digital character that cracks jokes, looks at questioners and
twirls his cigar. ``He's a real guy in our family. I feel, even if
I were a teetotaler, a Mormon, and Southern Comfort came and wanted
to do a commercial with him, I'd say yes because that was his
image. But if someone wanted to do a nude poster, I'd stop it.
That's my grandfather. I want to protect his image.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Rosenthal, who represents many celebrities' estates in
trying to stop improper use of their images, said copyright and
trademark laws are far from clear in what can be done to stop
digital kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain and New York have virtually no prohibitions on the
use of a dead celebrity's image, Rosenthal said. California gives
the estate control for 50 years, while Indiana has a tough 100-year
rule and other restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to happen,'' Beard said. ``If an
unscrupulous producer can take a couple of on-line stills and marry
them to a body double to make a porn flick, they will. The same
thing with overseas piracy of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beard and others said serious work needs to be done to
update laws governing intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the laws were created with the analog world in mind, and
now we're dealing with the digital world,'' Beard said. ``I
personally think the laws need some tweaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws assume, for instance, that once a celebrity is dead,
his or her works are ``frozen in time; no more films will be
made,'' Beard said. ``Now, that's no longer the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The current widely differing patchwork of state laws begs for
some national legislation providing ``sufficient postmortem
protection,'' Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I have is you can only control this so much,''
Fields said. ``There are thieves out there, and it is going to
happen, and we have to try to stop them.''

Smart homes good for the smart owner 
By Cheryl Crabb  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Owning a smart house can be great, especially once you
figure out how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Lora and Chip Gonzalez moved into their high-tech house at Creek
Ridge Point in Alpharetta, Ga. last December, and they're still
learning about all the things it can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone who doesn't know it, it can be fairly complicated,
'' said Chip Gonzalez, a 33-year-old salesman for a mutual fund
company.
</P>
<P>
   The couple has yet to master home entertainment. Although they
have the capability to play the same movie on all the televisions
in the house, right now, they are using standard cable like almost
everybody else. With only one computer hooked up, the Gonzalezes
also have yet to make use of wiring that enables home computers to
share information.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gonzalez said, having a smart house is starting to pay
off.
</P>
<P>
   A state-of-the-art security system with video cameras hooked up
to the home's television sets is one of the couple's favorite
features. A ``baby cam'' in the nursery allows them to keep an eye
on their 3-month-old son, Alexander. A similar video monitor on the
front porch allows the couple to see who is at the door by using
their TV's remote control to click on a designated home channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was here by herself one night when a salesman came to
the door,'' Gonzalez said. ``She was able to click on the TV
instead of going to look at him through the lead glass door.''
</P>
<P>
   The house's intercom system, which allows the couple to talk to
each other over any phone in the five-bedroom, five-bath house, is
also starting to come in handy, Gonzalez said. ``It's not a huge
house, but you can be in the far corners and not hear anybody,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez family paid about $2,000 extra to wire the house
with the Lucent Homestar system, a joint project of BellSouth
Corp., Lucent Technologies and Trademark Homes. Alpharetta-based
Digital Interiors Inc., an authorized Smart House Inc. dealer, was
recently hired to help install the system and to teach homeowners
how it works.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez's subdivision is among a few metro Atlanta
neighborhoods being wired with smart-house technology. But that
number is rapidly increasing. The wiring will enable tech-savvy
homeowners to create the ultimate home office; choose from endless
channels of music and entertainment; automate heating, air and
lighting systems; and control state-of-the-art security systems.
</P>
<P>
   Although most smart houses in metro Atlanta are priced at
$300,000 and up, they aren't only for the super rich in
neighborhoods surrounding high-tech business hubs. In nearby
Cherokee County, developer Hutson Homes is including high-tech
wiring in the cost of houses priced in the $150,000 and $200,000
ranges in his new subdivision Walnut Creek. For houses smaller than
2,500 square feet, upgraded wiring can be added for a few hundred
dollars extra, said George Ide, a home system designer with Digital
Interiors.
</P>
<P>
   One of Walnut Creek's first buyers, 25-year-old software writer
Josh Nunez, can't wait to get rid of the wires now strewn
throughout his Vinings, Ga. apartment. His wife Nicole, a speech
pathologist, also hopes the system will speed up research on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Central cable and phone connections inside the home form the
backbone of a smart house. Communications lines branch out like
spokes on a wheel. Numerous hardware and software systems use that
wiring to bring smart houses to life. Currently, the upgraded,
reconfigured wiring can provide services such as high-speed
Internet access. In the future, it will enable homeowners to take
advantage of a wide range of technology, such as high-definition
television or interactive cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telephone company is beginning to offer video over
telephone lines, and homes need to be wired to handle that,'' Ide
said. ``The TV will become like the computer. You'll be able to
order movies from a Web site on the TV using a remote control.''
</P>
<P>
   Bethany Green in Alpharetta provides a glimpse into that future.
The buyer of Chatham Holdings' model smart house there will be able
to control a multiroom, multisound audio system from a keypad on
the kitchen wall. The system includes a compact disc player and a
radio, and is tied into music channels from an 18-inch satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The owner will be able to program ``lifestyle preferences'' into
the home's central control panel tucked away in a small hallway
between the main foyer and the kitchen. The main control panel is
the base for the house's security, lighting, and heating and
air-conditioning systems.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to smart keys on a computer, the system gives homeowners
the ability to program their heating, air, security and lighting
systems for frequently used settings. When away, homeowners can
change preferences by calling their house on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``With your 'good night' button you can arm your security
system, turn off the lights and set your heating and air at the
preferred temperature,'' Ide said. ``'Vacation' does things like
set heating and air at a minimum and program lights to come on at
night so it appears you're home.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart-house technology has been around for at least a decade,
but builders have steered clear of it until now because of
additional costs to upgrade the interior wiring, said builder Jim
Bankes, who plans to build 80 high-tech houses at Rivermoore Park,
a 530-house neighborhood in Suwanee. The wiring adds about $1,200
to the cost of a 3,600-square-foot house. House prices at
Rivermoore Park start at nearly $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new fiber-optic cabling being rolled out in metro Atlanta,
and increasing reliance on home offices, is making the technology a
necessity rather than a ``little toy,'' Bankes said. Home computers
are now in 40 percent of American homes. But they are a fixture in
65 percent of metro Atlanta homes, according to a new Horizon Metro
Poll released by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Industry experts
estimate Americans will spend as much as $5 billion this year on
networks and other home-automation products.
</P>
<P>
   Upgraded wiring was ``definitely a selling point'' for Richard
Woyce, a 34-year-old computer software product manager. He works
from his house up to 40 percent of the time. Woyce and his wife,
Debra, moved into Rivermoore Park in March. High-speed Internet
access and more reliable online service are key benefits of owning
a smart house, he said. The couple also forked out $3,000 to hook
up a state-of-the-art security system. Eventually, Woyce envisions
installing a home theater. The house is wired for surround sound,
but building a home entertainment center costs $5,000 to $30,000,
said Ide, the home system designer.
</P>
<P>
   Families with busy lifestyles are the biggest market for
smart-house technology, but some senior citizens also are looking
for automated houses to make their lives easier, said Lisa
Montgomery, editor of Wayland, Mass.-based Electronic House
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes things easier for seniors because of instead of
running all over the house switching off every light, you do that
automatically with one command on your key pad,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if people don't want a smart house now, it might pay to put
in wiring when building, redecorating or adding space. The idea is
to create the capability for a wide range of future services. It
can cost 50 percent more to rewire an existing house.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers should do their homework before investing in home
technology products offered by builders and sold off the shelves at
the local computer super store, Montgomery warns.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-controlled systems are still in the development stage, as
some homeowners in Florida discovered. The sound of one couple's
pet parrot regularly activated their system, turning on the lights
and stereo while they were away. A barking dog led another
homeowner's system to place repeated long-distance calls to her
parents. And one homeowner, whose system was programmed to call
police at the mention of ``911,'' got visits from the police
whenever the TV program ``Rescue 911'' came on.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, upgraded wiring is one of the most popular
features being built in new houses. But for most Atlantans, owning
a smart house is probably at least five years away, said Joe
Padilla, an Atlanta Home Builders Association spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or 10 years ago, we were talking about Corian countertops
and two-car garages; this (home technology) is taking us to the
next level,'' Padilla said. ``Five or 10 years from now, this will
be commonplace in every home.''

 Norton Tops Win 98's Wizard  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Does the Maintenance Wizard in Windows 98 do essentially
the same thing as Norton Utilities, which finds and fixes problems,
improves performance and troubleshoots?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Ah, our first question about Windows 98! Maintenance
Wizard, which is new to Win 98, does in fact offer many of the
features that you get with a program such as Norton Utilities. It
lets you fix common hard disk problems, defragment the disk (also
called optimizing) and remove unnecessary files. You can even
schedule those operations to run on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   However, the $70 Norton Utilities offers some powerful features
beyond what Maintenance Wizard can conjure up. It can rescue
information from damaged disks, and recover files that may have
accidentally been erased.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Last month, my area code changed. That means the area code
also changed for the number I use to connect to the Internet. How
can I replace the old number with the new one?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Go to Windows Explorer, which you'll find under the
Programs menu after clicking the Windows Start button. In the
directory tree on the left side of the screen, click the entry
titled Dial-up Networking. This will display a list of connections.
Find the one for your Internet service provider and click using the
right mouse button. In the menu that appears choose Properties. Go
the tab labeled General and change the number, then click OK.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I'm searching for a handheld personal computer that I can
take outside the United States and use for Word, e-mail and faxes.
I've heard that phone lines in Europe are not compatible with ours.
Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; All the phone lines I've used in Europe have worked fine
with my laptop, and that includes Germany, Switzerland, France,
Italy and England. The problem is not the phone lines, but the
phone jacks, which are different for each country. You can buy a
set of international jacks at Radio Shack or at most big drug
stores.
</P>
<P>
   As for the computer, you'll need a handheld model that runs on
Windows CE (a smaller palm-sized PC doesn't let you do word
processing). You'll also need a modem. Some handhelds, like the
Philips Velo or Hewlett-Packard 660LX, come with modems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I am looking for software packages that I can use to create
a living trust. Hope you can help.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Living trusts, for those who don't know, are like wills,
only they let your heirs avoid having to go through lengthy probate
proceedings. When you transfer property to a living trust, it's
owned by the trust, not by you as an individual. But as trustee,
you can keep full control of it. After you die, the successor
trustee is in charge of transferring the property to family,
friends and charities you named as beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Software packages for creating living trusts include Living
Trust Maker, from Nolo ($48) and Living Trust Builder, from Jian
($33). Since I haven't used them, I don't know how good they are.
But I believe they are valid in most states, just like
computer-generated wills.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Please help me solve a problem that has been nagging me.
Does it do any harm to turn off the computer without proper
shut-down? I often do that because it gets stuck in the ``please
wait'' part of the shut- down process, and the advice on the
Microsoft Web site for troubleshooting this problem is too
complicated to begin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; It shouldn't inflict any permanent damage if you fail to
complete the shut-down procedure. However, the next time you start
the computer (as you've probably already learned), it may check the
system for errors before Windows boots up. And that can take a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, why is your system hanging during shut-down?
Unfortunately, the problem could be half a dozen things, including
startup files, memory conflicts or system settings. If you can't
live with the situation, you might consider just reinstalling
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Tip of the Week &QC; Give your right hand, wrist and elbow a break by
switching your mouse to the left hand for a while. You can easily
reverse the left-right button functions by going to the Mouse icon
in the Windows Control Panel (click Start, point to settings and
choose Control Panel).

NETWORKS FOR SUPER-LINKED FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the planet becomes increasingly networked, shrinking the
globe and redefining age-old concepts of community, all this
digital connectivity has so far bypassed our most fundamental
social unit, the family. Now, a rapidly emerging new industry is
betting that the next ``killer app'' will be a network in your
home.
</P>
<P>
   Already, according to the Dataquest research firm, two or more
computers are being used in an estimated 15 million American
households, a number that is expected to more than triple by 2002.
The assumption that people will want all those computers to talk to
each other, from bedroom to den to living room, kitchen, deck and
patio, has touched off a race for a chunk of a what Wedbush Morgan
Securities of Los Angeles estimates will be a $4 billion market
within four years.
</P>
<P>
   My own family contributed a few hundred dollars to the
beginnings of that market last month when it became clear that
installing a home network would cost a lot less than buying modems,
Internet access and printers for each the four computers
accumulated by three students and two increasingly Net-dependent
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding factor, though, was the introduction of a cable
modem into the household. Always connected and delivering incoming
data at better than 60 times the speed of today's fastest modems,
it quickly made the Internet the children's primary reference
library as well as a social and entertainment hub.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a bottleneck. The cable modem is connected to the
same multimedia PC that runs the color printer, the scanner and,
most importantly, a CD-ROM changer with an encyclopedia, an atlas,
a dictionary and other reference books.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the vast majority of our digital resources were
available only to the family member who happened to be using that
one machine. Simple efficiency, not to mention domestic harmony,
demanded that they be shared.
</P>
<P>
   That, says John W. Todd, Wedbush Morgan's vice president for
research, is a typical set of reasons for installing a home
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely shared Internet access that will drive the
home networking market,'' said Todd, who recently released an
investment analysis on the subject. ``But in addition, people are
quickly realizing that they can't afford to equip every computer in
the house with a complete set of peripherals.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapidly falling prices for network cards and ethernet hubs, the
equipment needed for the kind of high-speed network typically used
in corporate environments, now make it possible to connect two home
computers for less than $200 _ but only if both machines happen to
be in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest expense faced by would-be home networkers today is
the cost of running ethernet cables through walls, floors and
ceilings. Wiring a typical home can easily cost several thousand
dollars. I took this route because I am comfortable doing my own
wiring, but by the end of this summer, consumers will have a choice
of several easier, less costly alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The best features of all these new schemes is that they will
require no new wiring and most will configure themselves _ a
significant breakthrough, since setting up a network is a more than
daunting challenge for most weekend warriors.
</P>
<P>
   While none of these new systems will deliver the 10 to 100
megabits per second bandwidth of a cable-connected ethernet (at
least not yet) they will offer speeds up to 1.6 megabits per
second, about 30 times faster than today's fastest modems.
</P>
<P>
   They will arrive in three basic flavors: wireless, phone-line
systems and power-line systems.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless networks use a high-frequency radio signal to connect
computers equipped with tiny two-way radios, or transceivers. While
these are prone to interference from other radio sources, they will
be by far the most attractive options when the technology is
mature.
</P>
<P>
   One system is already on the market, but faster, more reliable
systems will be introduced later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, systems that use a home's existing
telephone lines _ without interfering with normal telephone use _
will be the most dependable and among the fastest and lowest cost.
The most developed of the home network technologies, they inspired
the creation earlier this month of the Home Phoneline Networking
Alliance, a standards group that includes industry giants like
AT&AMP;T, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, it also includes 3Com, Lucent Technologies and
Rockwell Semiconductor Systems, indicating that these three
companies learned a hard lesson when their years of sparring over a
standard all but destroyed the market for 56K modems.
</P>
<P>
   Systems that use existing electrical wiring employ the oldest
technology and, to date, are the more expensive and least
dependable of the home networks under development. But they are
also the most promising because of the ubiquitous nature of
electrical wiring in every room in most homes. Look for systems of
this type by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   None of these systems is likely to be really mature and
glitch-free for several years, but even in their primordial stages,
they will nurture the emergence, for better or worse, of the
super-connected family.
</P>

 By CORINNE LaBALME 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The World Cup of soccer, being held in France until July 12, is
the only sports event that can dwarf the Super Bowl and challenge
the Olympics for global TV ratings. And in peak tourist season, an
estimated 300,000 to 350,000 soccer fans will swell the ranks in
Paris.
 &HT;    While the games are spread among 10 French cities (including
Bordeaux, Lens, Lyons, St.-Etienne, Marseilles, Montpellier, Nantes
and Toulouse), the hub will be Paris and St.-Denis, six miles
north, where the 80,000-seat Stade de France was built for this
event.
 &HT;    The French are determined to leave their imprint on the 1998
version of the quadrennial tournament _ Yves Saint-Laurent has
designed uniforms for the officials (the final on July 12 will kick
off with a Saint-Laurent fashion show).
 &HT;    And although only 2.5 million people are lucky enough to hold
tickets for any of the 64 matches (sold out since mid-April), the
mayor of Paris and French soccer officials are determined that no
visitor to the city be left out of the action.
 &HT;    Six giant screens _ at the Place du Trocadero, the Hotel de
Ville, the Charlety Stadium, the Place Stalingrad, the Vincennes
Hippodrome and the Porte de Clignancourt _ show the games live.
 &HT;    The games are being played at a variety of other, nonofficial
places _ the Lido cabaret, for example, on the Champs-Elysees, is
opening its doors before dark to present special soccer lunches
with live screenings and a menu created by Paul Bocuse ($115, at
5.7 francs to the dollar).
 &HT;    However, behind the banner-waving crowds and the beer parties,
Paris will continue to lead a very active nonsporting life.
 &HT;    Look at it this way: With soccer fever displacing Mona Lisa
watchers, this summer may be an ideal time to avoid those endless
lines at the Louvre.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    ``The Glory of Alexandria,'' the city's blockbuster museum show,
includes a colossal 23-ton Ptolemaic statue recently discovered in
Egypt by underwater archaeologists plus a glittering array of
mosaics, illustrated texts and jewelry. Through July 26 at the
Petit Palais, Avenue Winston Churchill. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10
a.m. to 5:40 p.m., Thursday to 8 p.m.; (33-1) 42.65.12.73; $7.90.
 &HT;    Rudolf Nureyev's 1984 choreography for ``Romeo and Juliet'' is
reprised through July 15 at the Opera Bastille, 120 Rue de Lyon.
Tickets to each event: $5.25 to $70. Reservations for both at
(33-8) 36.69.78.68.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    This year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Eugene
Delacroix, and museums throughout France will honor the foremost
painter of the Romantic School.
 &HT;    In Paris, the Grand Palais is host to ``Delacroix, The Last
Years (1850-1863)'' through July 20; Avenue du General Eisenhower,
Clemenceau entrance. Open daily except Tuesday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
Wednesday until 10 p.m. Reserved tickets ($7.50 to $9.75) necessary
before 12:30 p.m.; admission $8.75 ($6.15 Monday) from 1 p.m.
Information, (33-1) 44.13.17.30; reservations, (33-1) 44.13.17.24.
 &HT;    The painter's secluded Left Bank studio, on a tiny square at 6
Rue de Furstenburg, is now the Musee Delacroix, where an exhibition
spotlighting his collaboration with the artist and engraver
Frederic Villot runs through July 31. Open daily except Tuesday
from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; $5.25 ($4 on Sunday; under 18 free). Call
(33-1) 44.41.86.50.
 &HT;    At the nearby St.-Sulpice Church, Delacroix painted a side
chapel with action-packed murals featuring St. Michael slaying the
dragon and Jacob battling with the Angel. And major Delacroix shows
are running in the Musee des Beaux Arts in Rouen (through July 15),
Musee des Beaux Arts in Tours (though July 31), Musee Leon Bonnat
in Bayonne (through Sept. 28) and the Musee Conde in Chantilly
(through July 20).
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Mondiresa, the organization that reserved more than 360,000
hotel nights throughout France for World Cup visitors, has a Web
site, mondiresa.com, that tracks cancellations and is available to
help find last-minute accommodations; (33-1) 53.92.60.00.
 &HT;    Some hotel rooms are still available in Paris; Rail Europe, for
example, has set up a special number for reservations: (888)
850-8918. Note that some hotels are raising their rates during the
World Cup.
 &HT;    The style is Directoire, the design theme is literary Paris at
the Hotel Libertel Quartier Latin, 9 Rue des Ecoles, fifth
arrondissement, (33-1) 44.27.06.45 or (800) 949-7562, fax (33-1)
43.25.36.70, a few blocks from the Sorbonne.
 &HT;    All 29 air-conditioned rooms at the year-old hotel are decorated
with portraits (Andre Gide, Colette and Jacques Prevert among
others).
 &HT;    The walls of the breakfast room sport discreetly stenciled
quotations from Baudelaire, while the inviting lobby offers
comfortable armchairs, a tea service and browsable bilingual
bookshelves. Doubles: $170.
 &HT;    Breakfast at the Etoile Pereire, 146 Boulevard Pereire, in the
17th, (33-1) 42.67.60.00, fax (33-1) 42.67.02.90, features 31
exotic jams and jellies like banana, chestnut, peach-hazelnut and
lemon. That's one for each of the 21 plain but reasonably priced
rooms and five suites overlooking a quiet courtyard.
 &HT;    The residential neighborhood in western Paris offers an
attractive garden and playground across the street, plus the shaded
jogging paths of the nearby Monceau and Bois de Boulogne parks.
Doubles: $140.
 &HT;    Budget: Artists and academics are drawn by the cheerfully
Bohemian aura at the 59-room Hotel Bellevue et du Chariot d'Or, 39
Rue de Turbigo, in the third, (33-1) 48.87.45.60, fax (33-1)
48.87.95.04. The stained-glass windows in the bar-breakfast room
exude the bygone glamour that the no-frills rooms lack.
 &HT;    The garment-district location north of the Pompidou Center is
nondescript but central; the spacious bedrooms sleeping four ($77)
are one of the city's best bargains. Doubles: $60.
 &HT;    Luxury: The exclusive residential district between Trocadero and
Place Victor Hugo is home to Le Parc, 55 Avenue Raymond Poincare,
in the 16th, (33-1) 44.05.66.66 or (800) 949-7562, fax (33-1)
44.05.66.00.
 &HT;    The British designers Nina Campbell and Viscount Linley created
a cozy country-house ambiance for the 116 air-conditioned rooms,
which are in four turreted turn-of-the-century buildings grouped
around a tree-shaded garden. Alain Ducasse, the Michelin
star-spangled chef, runs one of the hotel's two glamourous
restaurants. Doubles: $420 to $485.
 &HT;    The Marriott Champs-Elysees, 70 Avenue des Champs-Elysees, in
the eighth, (33-1) 53.93.55.00 or (800) 228-9290, fax (33-1)
53.93.55.01, brings American style (a floor-to-ceiling glass-topped
atrium) and American amenities (king-sized beds, computer hook-ups,
irons, no-smoking floors) to its 192 rooms. Some rooms have windows
only onto the atrium; the best ones overlook the Champs-Elysees.
 &HT;    The quiet outdoor dining terrace, shielded from automobile and
pedestrian traffic, is a summertime bonus. Doubles: $490 to $632.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Maceo, 15 Rue des Petits Champs, (33-1) 42.97.53.85, on the site
of the historic Mercure Galant near the Palais Royal, is the latest
spinoff of the ever-trendy Willi's Wine Bar. The ornate Napoleon
III walls have been daubed with Ralph Lauren Red. The menu features
vegetarian entrees as well as delicate seafood starters like
curried shrimp with bean sprouts. Dinner for two with wine: $100.
 &HT;    Adjoining the elegant Passage Vivienne shopping arcade, Le Grand
Colbert, 2 Rue Vivienne, (33-1) 42.86.87.88, is a lively brasserie
where, amid gilded 19th-century mirrors, diners enjoy green-bean
salad laced with foie gras, preserved duck and excellent sole
meuniere. Dinner for two with wine: $80.
 &HT;    Anastasia would feel right at home at Nikita, 6 Rue Faustin
Helie, (33-1) 45.04.04.33, especially when the Cossack musicians
play their violins and accordions. Tsarist treats at this romantic
White Russian hangout include creamed herring spiked with dill,
smoked salmon with blini, shashlik (marinated lamb kebabs) and
tangy Russian cheesecake. Dinner for two with wine and a Gypsy
serenade costs $115.
 &HT;    At Ma Bourgogne, 19 Place des Vosges, (33-1) 42.78.44.64, the
cuisine is as classic as the 17th-century stone arches that shade
its sidewalk terrace, with views of the fountains on the lovely
Place. Specialties include Burgundy-style snails with garlic and
steak tartare with some of Paris's most irresistible frites. Dinner
for two with wine: $95.
 &HT;    Le Rubis, 10 Rue du Marche St.-Honore, (33-1) 42.61.03.34, a
wine bar a few blocks from the Ritz, encourages customers to carry
their sandwiches and salads out to the oilcloth-topped wine barrels
on the sidewalk.A ham-and-cheese omelet runs $6.15 and a glass of
Beaujolais is $1.60. The petit sale (salt pork with lentils) is the
$8.75 plat du jour on Wednesday and worth noting on the calendar.
 &HT;    As far from the soccer frenzy as one can get within the city
limits is Le Pre Catelan on the Route de Suresnes in the Bois de
Boulogne, (33-1) 44.14.41.14. Not for nothing is it one of Paris's
most expensive one-star restaurants.
 &HT;    Beneath the stars in a glorious walled garden, Frederic Anton
presents dramatic main courses like boned sea bream baked in a
shell of rock salt and herbs (cracked open at the table to reveal
the flaky fish), with a fragrant Provencal stuffing of tomato,
basil and olives. Dinner for two with wine: $210.

 &HT;    Six giant screens _ at the Place du Trocadero, the Hotel de
Ville, the Charlety Stadium, the Place Stalingrad, the Vincennes
Hippodrome and the Porte de Clignancourt _ show the games live.
 &HT;    The games are being played at a variety of other, nonofficial
places _ the Lido cabaret, for example, on the Champs-Elysees, is
opening its doors before dark to present special soccer lunches
with live screenings and a menu created by Paul Bocuse ($115, at
5.7 francs to the dollar).
 &HT;    However, behind the banner-waving crowds and the beer parties,
Paris will continue to lead a very active nonsporting life.
 &HT;    Look at it this way: With soccer fever displacing Mona Lisa
watchers, this summer may be an ideal time to avoid those endless
lines at the Louvre.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    ``The Glory of Alexandria,'' the city's blockbuster museum show,
includes a colossal 23-ton Ptolemaic statue recently discovered in
Egypt by underwater archaeologists plus a glittering array of
mosaics, illustrated texts and jewelry. Through July 26 at the
Petit Palais, Avenue Winston Churchill. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10
a.m. to 5:40 p.m., Thursday to 8 p.m.; (33-1) 42.65.12.73; $7.90.

Delacroix, and museums throughout France will honor the foremost

 &HT;    The painter's secluded Left Bank studio, on a tiny square at 6
Rue de Furstenburg, is now the Musee Delacroix, where an exhibition
spotlighting his collaboration with the artist and engraver
Frederic Villot runs through July 31. Open daily except Tuesday
from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; $5.25 ($4 on Sunday; under 18 free). Call
(33-1) 44.41.86.50.
 &HT;    At the nearby St.-Sulpice Church, Delacroix painted a side

dragon and Jacob battling with the Angel. And major Delacroix shows
are running in the Musee des Beaux Arts in Rouen (through July 15),
Musee des Beaux Arts in Tours (though July 31), Musee Leon Bonnat
in Bayonne (through Sept. 28) and the Musee Conde in Chantilly
(through July 20).
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Mondiresa, the organization that reserved more than 360,000
hotel nights throughout France for World Cup visitors, has a Web
site, mondiresa.com, that tracks cancellations and is available to
help find last-minute accommodations; (33-1) 53.92.60.00.
 &HT;    Some hotel rooms are still available in Paris; Rail Europe, for
example, has set up a special number for reservations: (888)
850-8918. Note that some hotels are raising their rates during the
World Cup.
 &HT;    The style is Directoire, the design theme is literary Paris at
the Hotel Libertel Quartier Latin, 9 Rue des Ecoles, fifth
arrondissement, (33-1) 44.27.06.45 or (800) 949-7562, fax (33-1)
43.25.36.70, a few blocks from the Sorbonne.
 &HT;    All 29 air-conditioned rooms at the year-old hotel are decorated
with portraits (Andre Gide, Colette and Jacques Prevert among
others).
 &HT;    The walls of the breakfast room sport discreetly stenciled
quotations from Baudelaire, while the inviting lobby offers
comfortable armchairs, a tea service and browsable bilingual
bookshelves. Doubles: $170.
 &HT;    Breakfast at the Etoile Pereire, 146 Boulevard Pereire, in the
17th, (33-1) 42.67.60.00, fax (33-1) 42.67.02.90, features 31
exotic jams and jellies like banana, chestnut, peach-hazelnut and
lemon. That's one for each of the 21 plain but reasonably priced
rooms and five suites overlooking a quiet courtyard.
 &HT;    The residential neighborhood in western Paris offers an
attractive garden and playground across the street, plus the shaded
jogging paths of the nearby Monceau and Bois de Boulogne parks.
Doubles: $140.
 &HT;    Budget: Artists and academics are drawn by the cheerfully
Bohemian aura at the 59-room Hotel Bellevue et du Chariot d'Or, 39
Rue de Turbigo, in the third, (33-1) 48.87.45.60, fax (33-1)
48.87.95.04. The stained-glass windows in the bar-breakfast room
exude the bygone glamour that the no-frills rooms lack.
 &HT;    The garment-district location north of the Pompidou Center is
nondescript but central; the spacious bedrooms sleeping four ($77)
are one of the city's best bargains. Doubles: $60.
 &HT;    Luxury: The exclusive residential district between Trocadero and
Place Victor Hugo is home to Le Parc, 55 Avenue Raymond Poincare,
in the 16th, (33-1) 44.05.66.66 or (800) 949-7562, fax (33-1)
44.05.66.00.
 &HT;    The British designers Nina Campbell and Viscount Linley created
a cozy country-house ambiance for the 116 air-conditioned rooms,
which are in four turreted turn-of-the-century buildings grouped
around a tree-shaded garden. Alain Ducasse, the Michelin
star-spangled chef, runs one of the hotel's two glamourous
restaurants. Doubles: $420 to $485.
 &HT;    The Marriott Champs-Elysees, 70 Avenue des Champs-Elysees, in
the eighth, (33-1) 53.93.55.00 or (800) 228-9290, fax (33-1)
53.93.55.01, brings American style (a floor-to-ceiling glass-topped
atrium) and American amenities (king-sized beds, computer hook-ups,
irons, no-smoking floors) to its 192 rooms. Some rooms have windows
only onto the atrium; the best ones overlook the Champs-Elysees.
 &HT;    The quiet outdoor dining terrace, shielded from automobile and
pedestrian traffic, is a summertime bonus. Doubles: $490 to $632.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Maceo, 15 Rue des Petits Champs, (33-1) 42.97.53.85, on the site
of the historic Mercure Galant near the Palais Royal, is the latest
spinoff of the ever-trendy Willi's Wine Bar. The ornate Napoleon
III walls have been daubed with Ralph Lauren Red. The menu features
vegetarian entrees as well as delicate seafood starters like
curried shrimp with bean sprouts. Dinner for two with wine: $100.
 &HT;    Adjoining the elegant Passage Vivienne shopping arcade, Le Grand
Colbert, 2 Rue Vivienne, (33-1) 42.86.87.88, is a lively brasserie
where, amid gilded 19th-century mirrors, diners enjoy green-bean
salad laced with foie gras, preserved duck and excellent sole
meuniere. Dinner for two with wine: $80.
 &HT;    Anastasia would feel right at home at Nikita, 6 Rue Faustin
Helie, (33-1) 45.04.04.33, especially when the Cossack musicians
play their violins and accordions. Tsarist treats at this romantic
White Russian hangout include creamed herring spiked with dill,
smoked salmon with blini, shashlik (marinated lamb kebabs) and
tangy Russian cheesecake. Dinner for two with wine and a Gypsy
serenade costs $115.
 &HT;    At Ma Bourgogne, 19 Place des Vosges, (33-1) 42.78.44.64, the
cuisine is as classic as the 17th-century stone arches that shade
its sidewalk terrace, with views of the fountains on the lovely
Place. Specialties include Burgundy-style snails with garlic and
steak tartare with some of Paris's most irresistible frites. Dinner
for two with wine: $95.
 &HT;    Le Rubis, 10 Rue du Marche St.-Honore, (33-1) 42.61.03.34, a
wine bar a few blocks from the Ritz, encourages customers to carry
their sandwiches and salads out to the oilcloth-topped wine barrels
on the sidewalk.A ham-and-cheese omelet runs $6.15 and a glass of
Beaujolais is $1.60. The petit sale (salt pork with lentils) is the
$8.75 plat du jour on Wednesday and worth noting on the calendar.
 &HT;    As far from the soccer frenzy as one can get within the city
limits is Le Pre Catelan on the Route de Suresnes in the Bois de
Boulogne, (33-1) 44.14.41.14. Not for nothing is it one of Paris's
most expensive one-star restaurants.
 &HT;    Beneath the stars in a glorious walled garden, Frederic Anton
presents dramatic main courses like boned sea bream baked in a
shell of rock salt and herbs (cracked open at the table to reveal
the flaky fish), with a fragrant Provencal stuffing of tomato,
basil and olives. Dinner for two with wine: $210.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    We were in Copenhagen without a car and wanted to go to Roskilde
to visit the Viking Museum, where five formerly sunken ships have
been restored. While searching for a mode of transportation, we
discovered the Copenhagen Card _ a way of paying a single price for
admission to a variety of museums and attractions and
transportation.
 &HT;    We used the card to take the train for a 30-minute ride to
Roskilde. Then we continued to use it during our stay for admission
to the city's museums, castles and other sites.
 &HT;    It's a great value _ about $20 for one day, $46 for three days _
and is available at train stations, tourist offices and hotels.
 &HT;    For additional information about the Copenhagen Card or similar
cards for other Danish cities, call the Danish Tourist Board at
(212) 885-9700, or visit www.woco.dk on the Web.
 &HT;    Now some U.S. cities are following Europe's lead by instating
their own passes and enhancing the idea with additional discounts
for mature travelers.
 &HT;    For example, CityPass cards are now available in Boston, New
York, San Francisco and Seattle, and they include special senior
prices.
 &HT;    CityPass features tickets to six popular attractions in each
city. And what a bargain! CityPass users save about 50 percent on
the combined total cost of regular admissions.
 &HT;    For example, in New York, the CityPass can be used at the
American Museum of Natural History, the Empire State Building, the
Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the
Museum of Modern Art and the Top of the World Trade Center.
CityPass costs seniors $18 compared to the regular adult price of
$26.75.
 &HT;    CityPass attractions in San Francisco include the Blue &AMP; Gold
Bay Cruise, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the M.H. de
Young Museum, the California Academy of Sciences and Steinhard
Aquarium, the Exploratorium, the California Palace of the Legion of
Honor and zoo. Here, the CityPass price for seniors is $19.85.
 &HT;    In Boston, the John F. Kennedy Library/Museum, the New England
Aquarium, the John Hancock Observatory, the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Museum of Science
are included. The price for seniors: $20.50.

 Love Him Or Hate Him _ King of the Business Press Release  
 By Tom Abate   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If business news gushes out of corporate America with fire-hose
intensity, then Lorry Lokey is the guy directing the nozzle.
</P>
<P>
   Lokey, 71, is founder and president of Business Wire, the San
Francisco firm that disseminates about half of all the business
press releases in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, 15,000 pieces of corporate propaganda on everything
from products to mergers pour into Business Wire's offices. The
firm's 335-person staff pumps these releases into thousands of
national and international media outlets such as newspapers,
magazines and wire services.
</P>
<P>
   Companiespay Business Wire anywhere from $65 to $1,350 to send
out a release, depending on whether the distribution is local or
global.
</P>
<P>
   Media outlets pay nothing for the information and can choose to
use it or _ more often than not _ trash it.
</P>
<P>
   Lokey said his privately held firm will gross $70 million this
year and now is neck and neck in market share with its only
national rival, New York-based PRNewswire.
</P>
<P>
   Lokey said his firm has a 63 percent share of the Northern
California market, which includes most high-tech news releases.
</P>
<P>
   Since founding Business Wire in 1961, Lokey has seen enormous
changes in the way business news is disseminated and received. Back
when he started, releases traveled on teletype machines, and the
business staffs at most papers were small or nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the releases travel over high-speed private electronic
networks, and the number of business journalists working at
newspapers and specialty magazines has exploded.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest boost to his business has come from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Lokey said that when Business Wire was founded, there was no
established procedure for issuing business press releases. The
Texas Gulf Sulphur case changed that. In the mid-1960s, the
Securities and Exchange Commission prosecuted officers of the Texas
firm for buying shares in their own company before publicly
distributing news of a major ore discovery.
</P>
<P>
   That case established the precedent that important business news
must be widely circulated, to level the investment playing field
between insiders and the general public.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Telling all? &LR;  Authors Jennifer Edstrom and Marlin Eller blew
through San Francisco yesterday to tout their insider's book on
Microsoft, ``Barbarians Led by Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Edstrom is a freelance writer and the daughter of Pam Edstrom, a
partner in Microsoft's long-standing PR firm.
</P>
<P>
   Eller is a former lieutenant of Gates who became a millionaire
on Microsoft stock.
</P>
<P>
   Although they wrote it together, the duo disagreed on several
scores, including the conclusions one could draw from the book.
</P>
<P>
   To Edstrom, Microsoft emerged as a ``predatory'' firm that
should be reigned in by antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Although Eller left the company in 1995 (he now runs
Seattle-based Sunhawk Corp., which publishes sheet music on the
Internet), he defended Microsoft, which he joined in 1982 as
employee 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're going out to eat the grass and, yes, we want to
eat all the grass, and if some of the other grass-eaters die, that
doesn't make us a predator,'' Eller said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors even disagree on Edstrom's motivation for writing
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Edstrom, 29, said the book was not an act of rebellion against
her super-successful mom, but a chance that any journalist would
have seized.
</P>
<P>
   Beside her, 45-year-old Eller sat shaking his head. ``Total
rebellion,'' he said, pointing at his younger collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Ramblin' man: &LR;  The digerati rocked the Fillmore last Friday
night at the Electronic Frontier Foundation's second annual
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   As tech events go, EFF's gig was magnitudes more fun than the
norm, with people actually dancing instead of milling around
reading name tags.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment was provided by four amateur bands _ Where's
Julio, The Raving Daves, The Flying Other Brothers, and David Gans
and the Broken Angels _ whose members hail from local tech firms
like Excite and PeopleSoft.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the night was a success. EFF board member John
Gilmore said the group raised about $170,000, up from $130,000 last
year. EFF will use the money to lobby in favor of First Amendment
issues that relate to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   And though my wife and I danced until the baby sitter demanded
that we return home, it did seem odd to see the light show project
the names of corporate sponsors like Merrill Lynch and Pacific Bell
on the brick walls where Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin rebelled
their way to fame.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the times, they are a changin'.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Planning to get away this summer? Then act fast. This summer is
promising to be the biggest travel season ever, according to a poll
released by ASTA (American Society of Travel Agents) and Fodor's
Travel Publications on May 22.
 &HT;    The ASTA/Fodor's Annual Summer Hot Spots Survey is the result of
a poll of some of ASTA's 27,000 travel agents. They were asked to
name the top five domestic city destinations they have been booking
for this summer. In descending order: Orlando, Las Vegas, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.
 &HT;    ``Since this is a summer survey, it's really a byword for family
travel,'' James Ashurt, manager of communications for ASTA,
explains.
 &HT;    Orlando was far and away No. 1 because of Disney's continued and
unsurpassed reign as the most popular vacation destination in
America.
 &HT;    There's also the surge of interest in Disney's new ``Animal
Kingdom'' attraction, according to ASTA.
 &HT;    But surprisingly, value also plays a role when American
travelers choose Orlando as a vacation spot. In a separate survey
in which ASTA travel agents were asked about the destinations they
book for the value-conscious consumer, Orlando ranked No. 2 after
Cancun. The value is there because of the wide variety of
affordable air/hotel packages to the area and the selection of room
prices for every pocket.
 &HT;    Las Vegas ranked second. But while gaming enthusiasts will
always come to the Nevada city, the high ranking doesn't
necessarily reflect a huge influx of gamblers.
 &HT;    Las Vegas has become firmly established as a major family
destination, with a variety of packages for parents traveling with
their children. It's so affordable that it ranked third, after
Orlando, in ASTA's poll of destinations for value-conscious
travelers.
 &HT;    The next three cities were ranked closely together. San
Francisco ranked third, attracting visitors because of its scenic
beauty and laid-back lifestyle.
 &HT;    Los Angeles was fourth and Hollywood played a major role in its
ranking. The chance to visit studio lots and step into the
epicenter of the entertainment business is a major draw. So are the
area's fabled beaches.
 &HT;    New York, revitalized, booming and welcoming, was ranked fifth
in popularity for summer travelers. That's due to a reinvigorated
Broadway, with record-breaking productions of such shows as ``The
Lion King'' and ``Ragtime.''
 &HT;    The restaurant scene, from trendy places such as Balthazar to
the latest East Village sushi bar, has never been hotter. And the
civic pride of New Yorkers has never been greater or more
contagious.
 &HT;    The other cities in the ranking, in descending order, were
Seattle, San Diego and Washington, D.C., in a tie for seventh,
followed by Boston and Phoenix.
 &HT;    In terms of international travel, ASTA agents ranked the
following destinations. London was first, followed by Paris, Rome,
Cancun, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Madrid, Dublin, Vancouver and Athens.
 &HT;    What the poll really means is that there has already been
significant demand for these destinations. With the American
economy booming, domestic hotel rooms will be very hard to find
this summer, especially in New York and San Francisco. Planning
ahead and booking as soon as possible are key to getting a
reasonably good deal on a vacation.
 &HT;    For those who like to do it themselves, the Web is a viable
option. And hotel brokers, such as Quikbook (381 Park Avenue South,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com), Express
Reservations (3825 Iris Ave., Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-356-1123;
www.express-res.com) and Hotel Reservations Network (8140 Walnut
Hill Lane, Suite 203, Dallas, Texas 75231; 800-96-HOTEL;
www.180096hotel.com) can often provide 20 percent or more off the
cost of a domestic hotel room.
 &HT;    But ASTA, naturally enough, advocates using a travel agent _
someone who has essential travel information at their fingertips,
someone who knows which hotels are likely to have space and a
reasonable room rate. And agents can obtain some of the best prices
around for airfare and car rentals.
 &HT;    ``The Web is an excellent resource and there's lot of
information,'' Ashurst says. ``But that's part of the problem. Not
everyone is technically savvy enough to use it properly. You're not
getting professional advice or experience when you do. There's no
personal insight. And people are busy, they don't have the time to
do what it takes to get the information. The time factor doesn't
get included in the equation about whether the Web is better than a
travel agent.''
 &HT;    Ashurst points out, however, that an increasing number of travel
agents are using the Web themselves, both for communication
purposes and to research on behalf of their clients. And this
research will cost you. The days when an agent gave information
away for free are fast disappearing.
 &HT;    ``You pay a travel agent as you would pay any other
professional,'' Ashurst explains.
 &HT;    It's estimated that about 70 percent of ASTA's members are
either charging fees or are planning to charge fees. Those fees
vary widely, but they might run a consumer between $5 and $15 per
airline ticket. But research fees might be waived or deducted from
the cost of a vacation.
 &HT;    To find the nearest ASTA travel agent, contact ASTA at 1101 King
St., Alexandria, VA 22314; 800-965-ASTA.

BOOTING UP VIRTUAL STARS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Soon, very soon maybe, Marlene Dietrich will slink
across the screen again, and W.C. Fields will crack his
misanthropic jokes at trade shows. And a stoic Abe Lincoln could be
explaining the Civil War to museumgoers or cavorting in a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't Buddhist reincarnation come to the entertainment
world. And it's not another clever use of recycled film-clip
cutouts, like those of John Wayne and Fred Astaire in recent beer
and vacuum cleaner commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It's new computer technology that soon should be good enough to
resurrect the dead with lifelike three-dimensional re-creations
convincing enough for computer screens, television, games, museum
exhibits, trade shows, even movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're approaching (an image good enough for) a medium close-up
for a big theater screen of a virtual character where you couldn't
tell it was computerized,'' said Steve Sherer, CEO of Sherer
Digital Animation, whose recent works include a digital Humphrey
Bogart and a virtual Lincoln that reminds of nothing so much as the
well-known audio-animatronic figure at Disneyland's exhibition
devoted to America's 16th president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're right on the edge of being able to show it,''
Sherer said. ``Within the year, we'll see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, an interactive W.C. Fields character has been shown off
recently at a New York licensing show and at a Universal City
conference on digital humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, but it's not 100 percent,'' said Sandra Kay Helsel,
the conference's director and U.S. editor of VR News. ``There's
still a gap.'`
</P>
<P>
   But the gap is shrinking, quickly, Helsel said. And as it does,
people are now seriously considering how to apply the virtual
technology to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying now is, how do we use this?'' Helsel said.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility: the Michael Keaton movie ``Multiplicity'' gone
slightly mad, as big stars use ``digital clones'' to be two places
at once, experts said. A good example would be if Michael Jordan
wanted to appear at a trade show in Los Angeles while the NBA
playoffs were running in Chicago. With digital technology, he could
``appear'' at the show while coming off a pick for a big
three-point shot.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another possibility, said Greg Panos of the Performance
Animation Society, is that the technology will ultimately create a
new class of faceless yet famous performers, like the anonymous
Fields impersonator.
</P>
<P>
   Panos said they will be as ``famous as the digital character
they play. They might be very big, but they can go shopping without
being accosted. There will be a whole new class of digital actors
who will become as famous as real actors.''
</P>
<P>
   The digital Fields can interact with an audience and moderator,
cracking jokes, looking at individual questioners and twirling a
cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The character is controlled by a Fields impersonator working
from behind a screen, Oz-like, with motion-capture sensors attached
to his face that send commands to a computer directing the
on-screen character, said Jeffrey Lotman, CEO of Virtual Celebrity
Productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part that's a little sad is when you're not going to be
able to tell the difference,'' said Lotman. ``But we can create a
Mikey (of Life cereal fame) that would never grow up, a Mr. Whipple
(of Charmin tissue ads) that would never die, and most importantly,
there would be new performances of our classic performers.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Riva, who runs an intellectual property brokerage, would
like to include Dietrich, his grandmother, in that list of
perpetual performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in this room has any different relationship with
Marlene Dietrich now than they did 10 years ago,'' said Riva. ``For
all intents and purposes, she's still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Riva said, she would be virtually alive, too.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to boil down a Berlin archive _ containing truckloads
of his grandmother's papers, films, still photos and audio
recordings _ into a ``digital playbook'' for the computerized
artificial intelligence that would govern a virtual Dietrich
performing in new movies.
</P>
<P>
   But true artificial intelligence, sought for decades by
researchers, remains far in the future, several experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're way far away from a digital computer that can think and
interact with people on its own,'' Sherer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearer term, however, characters like the Fields one _
combining high-quality animation technology with motion-capture
technology _ will allow celebrities to create a more enduring image
of themselves, Lotman said. They'll be able to perform decades past
their prime, or even their life, Lotman said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Masur, president of the Screen Actors Guild, said the
technology shouldn't threaten his group's members, and it may even
expand their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I quarrel with is that there will be characters
created that will replace humans,'' Masur said. ``It isn't going to
happen, or it may, but isn't going to be successful. People go to
movies to see people they can make contact with.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be so sure about that connection thing, however. At
another recent conference at the American Film Institute in Los
Feliz, software gurus were showing clips of an !ital!idoru!off!,
the Japanese word for a virtual idol.
</P>
<P>
   Kyoko Date, the idoru's name, was created for an advertising
agency in Japan and has become hugely popular there, said Garry
Hare, president of Oz Interactive Inc., whose program animates
Kyoko Date to perform on the Internet, television and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Kyoko Date is hugely popular in Japan, even selling several hit
songs under her/its name, Hare said. She/It gets 200 marriage
proposals a week.
</P>
<P>
   Something of a similar phenomenon is occurring in the United
States with Lara Croft, the animated star of two Tomb Raider
computer games that now is being used in a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   But those characters are different from virtual celebrities,
which Masur said are unlikely to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless your heart, but I think you're doomed to mediocrity,''
Masur said to researchers. ``I don't believe there's going to be a
lot of Marlene Dietrichs in the future, because what made her
memorable was ineffable. The fact is, when actors work, all kinds
of things are taking place, accidents happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, even when an actor has little talent, ``they're
absolutely riveting,'' Masur said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible, under the 100 monkeys theory, that you could
create a character that's riveting?'' Masur said. ``It's possible.
In the short term, it probably would be interesting. But in terms
of carrying a film, I don't think so. Human performers bring things
to performances. You will have cut out a rich source of
collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Hare agreed with Masur, even though his company is busy trying
to create compelling virtual characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of bringing W.C. Fields back to life, I don't know,''
Hare said. ``You do it once or twice, then who cares? If you're
doing an animated film, do an animated film.''
</P>
<P>
   Real stars have an important place in film, Hare said, and not
just for their performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want real stars so they can go out and bang the drum and
promote a movie,'' Hare said. Resurrecting long-dead stars isn't
``a compelling use of the technology. A lot of times we use
technology because we can, not because we should.''
</P>
<P>
   Helsel, an anthropologist, said too much emphasis is being put
on technology, and not enough on the social-science implications of
virtual humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't gotten into the soul, but can you?'' Helsel
asked. ``They'll never be able to get the soul into these
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many current celebrities are having their faces and
figures scanned into computers in anticipation of a virtual career,
said Steve Williams, an Oscar-nominated special effects supervisor
for films such as ``Spawn,'' ``The Mask'' and ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I kept hearing was synthetic actors would never
happen, it's not right,'' said Williams. ``But it seems to me even
saying that implies that it will exist. Synthetic humans are
inevitable. I think it's a shame in a way, but it will happen.''

 2 Bay Area `Push' Firms Shoved Aside  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rule 101 of Internet start-ups: The window of opportunity to
cash out for big bucks is open only briefly before it abruptly
shuts.
</P>
<P>
   Take the cautionary examples of PointCast and Marimba, a pair of
Bay Area companies that pioneered technology to broadcast, or
``push,'' customized information to computer screens over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, both were anointed the Next Big Things on the Net.
Marimba's photogenic chief executive, Kim Polese, radiated from the
cover of major high-tech publications andTime magazine named her
one of the 25 most influential people in America. And executives at
PointCast _ which was being touted as an overnight success story _
spurned a $400 million buyout bid from media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the push companies have been shoved aside. Yahoo and
Excite _ whose Web-search sites have been made over into ``portal''
sites that combine free e-mail, message boards, news and shopping _
are all the rage on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Sunnyvale-based PointCast reportedly is seeking a buyer, even
though it filed last month to go public in July. The company hopes
to sell 4.3 million shares of stock for about $10 to $12 a share.
At $11 a share, PointCast would be worth $235 million _ about half
of the Murdoch offer.
</P>
<P>
   Marimba hardly made a peep for months until it announced a major
software upgrade last week. The Mountain View company _ which is
backed by the powerful Menlo Park venture capital firm of Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers _ still has plans to go public, possibly
in 1999, but sources say it too is on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Marimba's VCs) saw any exit, I can't believe they wouldn't
have taken it by now,'' said David Simons, managing director of
Digital Video Investments in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of PointCast and Marimba highlights the fickle nature
of the Internet market, which has careened from one concept du jour
to another, industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is full of fads, and I think push was the biggest
of them,'' said Jim Clark, chairman and co-founder of Mountain
View-based Netscape Communications, the mother of all Internet
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun shines brightly on a select place for a concerted
moment and then it passes. If you don't cash in, you're f_,'' said
Michael Wolff, author of ``Burn Rate: How I Survived the Gold Rush
Years on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in this market is timing, timing, timing,'' Wolff
said. ``It's all about promise, hype and heat _ not about business
performance. PointCast and Marimba's time came and went.''
</P>
<P>
   The time apparently is now for companies with portal sites. In
the past month, Walt Disney Co. has bought 44 percent of Infoseek,
NBC made substantial investments in Cnet, and AOL shunned a $30
billion takeover offer from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But Marimba CEO Kim Polese vehemently disputes the notion that
Marimba is passe. In fact, she claims the company is at the center
of ``the next great wave on the Internet _ distributed enterprise
applications.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been quietly kicking serious butt,'' said Polese in
discussing the company's new software program, Castanet 3.0, and
its expanding customer list, which now totals 800 _ including
Federal Express, Ford Motor and Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Castanet 3.0 lets corporations ship software programs and
upgrades over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Marimba has nearly doubled its workforce over the past year, to
130.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to do a pile-on or an IPO rush,'' Polese said.
``It's not about an immediate payoff, but about building a
substantive company that will be consistently profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Polese admits Marimba ``could have done a better job defining
what we do.'' Because it didn't, she said, ``we were lumped into
the push category. We've always been much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Marimba's problems are over its identity, PointCast's stem
from stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape's Communicator
Web browsers offer free ``push'' features. And PointCast has lost
subscribers amid complaints that the service was delivering too
much unwanted content and slowing down internal corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   PointCast CEO David Dorman has said the company is making a
transition from strictly broadcasting news to consumers. PointCast
wants to become the de facto information conduit for employees at
Fortune 500 companies, delivering companywide messages, sales
updates, employee news and a calendar of corporate events, as well
as traditional news.
</P>
<P>
   PointCast officials, who are in the midst of a legally mandated
quiet period before the company goes public, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, PointCast's and Marimba's overheated hype machines
and willingness to talk may have led to their current predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   One Silicon Valley venture capitalist said, ``These guys
trumpeted themselves loudly, but didn't do a good job of explaining
who they were. They set themselves up for a fall.''

INTEL BETTING ON `WARRIOR PRINCESS' CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAN FOST   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp. thinks it has found a savior to help carry the
company out of its slow-growth doldrums: Xeon, or as one analyst
calls it, ``the warrior princess chip.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the Pentium II Xeon, which Intel officially starts
shipping to customers today, could add $1.5 billion to $3 billion
to Intel's revenues this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the growth Intel has going forward will be from these
chips,'' said Nathan Brookwood, a microprocessor analyst with
Dataquest in San Jose. ``This is really central to the company's
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   With Xeon (pronounced zee-on), the world's largest chipmaker
moves firmly into the high-end market. The new chip will run
servers and workstations, powerful computers used to manage
Internet traffic, large databases and fancy graphics applications.
</P>
<P>
   The chip should spur new competition between Intel customers and
IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and other makers of big
corporate computers who use a different kind of chip.
</P>
<P>
   Although Intel already supplies chips for some servers and
workstations, Xeon gives it a new capability. Instead of selling
chips for computers that cost $2,000 to $10,000 _ a market Intel
now dominates, according to Peter Kastner, an analyst with the
Boston-based Aberdeen Group _ Intel will now move into servers that
start at $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of money can chase the chip blues away. And Intel's
had plenty of blues lately _ a year of flat growth, slow sales in
Asia and an antitrust prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Even Intel's vaunted technology came into some question, as the
Santa Clara giant announced a delay in its next generation of
high-end chips, Merced.
</P>
<P>
   For a fleeting moment last week, Xeon looked like it might have
caught the same bug. Word leaked out that when ultra-powerful
computers tried to run four Pentium II Xeons at once, a flaw was
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel says such ``errata'' are routine, and while this one
will delay certain high-end computers several weeks, it won't stop
today's official launch of Xeon. Intel is working on a set of
software instructions to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the most complex devices on the planet,'' said Intel
spokesman Bill Calder. ``There are 7.5 million transistors now on a
single piece of silicon smaller than the size of your thumbnail.
... We test, we check, we validate all the time. You can't possibly
have a perfect chip. All processors have errata.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger challenge for the Pentium II Xeon will be beating
some established competition in the high-end market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xeon is just a Pentium chip,'' said Jeff O'Neal of Sun
Microsystems, group marketing manager for products made with Sun's
Sparc chips _ one of Xeon's chief competitors. ``It's desktop
technology trying to play in the enterprise market. It looks from
this perspective like Pentium's last gasp. How far can they push a
20-year-old architecture?''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's customers don't see it that way. Kevin Joyce, director
of product marketing for Sequent, an Oregon company that makes
servers that cost from $50,000 to more than $1 million, said the
400 megahertz speed of the Pentium II Xeon beats Sun's speeds.
Sun's chips are based on RISC architecture, or reduced instruction
set computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel, which has been lagging RISC performance, makes it clear
they are capable of delivering processors that out-perform RISC,''
Joyce said.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest's Brookwood said the companies buying high-end servers
and workstations want the best performance available, and they're
willing to spend what it takes to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Intel notes that for its customers, the price-for-performance
equation improves with Xeon. Since 1996, Intel has sold the Pentium
Pro for big corporate computers. But last fall, Intel announced
that it was coming up with new names for its chips. It released the
Celeron for the sub-$1,000 PC market, and now it launches Xeon for
the high end.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium II Xeon will sell for $1,124 to $2,800 _ a much
higher price than the desktop Celerons but comparably priced to the
Pentium Pro. Jonathan Joseph, analyst with NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco, said he expects Intel to sell 1
million Xeon chips this year and 6 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   While PC sales have slowed, server and workstation sales are
soaring. Big servers are needed to keep up with the soaring growth
of the Internet. Big software programs require more-powerful
processors to run them.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's market clout, and its ability to run the increasingly
popular Windows NT operating system, give it a huge edge as it
moves into the high-priced arena, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Will Xeon push Intel out of the chip industry slump? Not by
itself. ``Intel's problems have largely been a result of a slowdown
in the PC market,'' analyst Joseph said. ``Intel now represents the
PC market. It's got 90 percent of that market. If prices are under
pressure, Intel will feel that pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Xeon, Joseph said, will only account for 5 to 10 percent of
Intel's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   While Intel won't say how much it expects to make from the chip,
it concedes that Xeon alone won't restore the phenomenal growth it
enjoyed until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never is a silver bullet,'' said John Miner, Intel vice
president and general manager of the enterprise services group. ``A
nice portfolio of products allows us to ride the ups and downs of
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Xeon was two years in the works, Miner noted.
</P>
<P>
   The name Xeon, like Pentium and Celeron before it, is the
concoction of Sausalito-based Lexicon Branding. Lexicon coined the
word after much effort, looking for something that adhered to
Pentium's Greek roots but also would give it a forward look.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``x'' at the front, Lexicon President and founder David
Placek said, the name evokes ``the next generation.'' With ``eon''
meaning a period of time, ``It all came together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, a coined name can be the most effective route for
you,'' Placek said. ``We have found, when you have a new product
and you put a newly created word like `Xeon' on it, that says,
`Hey, this is new.' ''

INVESTORS BEWARE IN INTERNET CHAT ROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe you have a big chunk of money to invest and are looking
for sage advice. Or you already own stocks or mutual funds and want
an expert to evaluate your holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't you consult an unemployed actor, or a kid who dishes
out macaroni at a college cafeteria?
</P>
<P>
   Absurd, you say?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but such people _ and others with no greater expertise
_ dispense stock-market tips every day on investment-oriented Web
sites, sharing their wisdom with thousands _ perhaps even millions
_ of other investors.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest bull market of all time, coinciding with the
development of the Internet _ the greatest communications
revolution of all time _ has made investment chat rooms and
bulletin boards wildly popular.
</P>
<P>
   This worries the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
National Association of Securities Dealers and other regulatory
spoilsports.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that the investment advice you get on the
Internet may be misleading or false _ often deliberately so. What's
more, you can't depend on the regulators to protect you because
they monitor only a tiny fraction of all Internet chit-chat.
</P>
<P>
   Unscrupulous promoters have used the Internet to falsely hype
stocks they own, and shady short-sellers have used it to bash
stocks in an effort to force prices down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spreading publicity about a company or an individual has never
been easier,'' notes John Reed Stark, special counsel for Internet
projects with the SEC's Division of Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Iomega, a disk-drive maker listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, and Comparator Systems, an over-the-counter company that
makes fingerprint-identification systems, are prominent examples of
stocks that went on wild roller-coaster rides because of Internet
postings.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, 1996, an unidentified individual bombarded numerous
Internet bulletin boards with frenetic messages touting Newport
Beach-based Comparator:
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who hasn't gotten on this stock, get in now. Share
price jumped from 6 cents to 12 cents today!!!! Don't miss the
boat!!!!
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is currently trading at .25 ... this morning's open
was .06. I think it will continue to rise to about one dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it reached a dollar on the next trading day _ May
6. More than a half-billion shares changed hands in less than a
week before suspicious Nasdaq officials halted trading on May 9.
</P>
<P>
   When Comparator opened for trading again more than a month
later, it sank back to 6 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet gives someone the ability to lend themselves an
air of legitimacy that is difficult to obtain in the outside
world,'' says Elisse Walter, chief operating officer for regulation
with the NASD.
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``We try to remind people that the old rules still
apply: If something looks too good to be true, it probably is.
Don't let the speed with which information is available these days
make you act without careful deliberation.''
</P>
<P>
   A chat room is like a big cocktail party, where dozens of
investors exchange ideas in real time. You type your own comments
on your computer keyboard and read what others have to say on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Bulletin boards are less fleeting and tend to be more
substantive. Investment buffs type out their opinions _ often at
great length _ and their messages go straight to the Web site's
archives, where other investors can read them at their leisure and
respond with their own postings.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of investment sites _ nobody knows exactly
how many _ but experts say the bulk of the gabbing evidently gets
done on four of them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft's www.investor.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Motley Fool, whose chat rooms and bulletin boards are
accessible by typing in the key words ``Motley Fool'' on America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.siliconinvestor.com, owned by Go2Net Inc., of Seattle,
which runs several Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ www.yahoo.com, sponsored by Santa Clara-based Yahoo Inc., the
Internet media company.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to demands from its customers, E-Trade Group, the
online discount broker based in Palo Alto, recently began rolling
out chat rooms on its Web site (www.etrade.com).
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time any brokerage firm has done this, but it
may not be the last. Says Tom Taggart, a spokesman for rival
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.: ``We don't do it yet, but I wouldn't rule out
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's chats currently are accessible to only about 10
percent of the firm's 400,000 customers _ mainly those who
expressed interest &UR; .  &LR; They should be available to all of them _ and
on a limited basis to noncustomers _ by the end of August, says
Kathy Levinson, president of E-Trade Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Although chat rooms are popular, their value as an investment
tool seems negligible _ to put it politely. Perhaps 80 percent of
the verbiage consists of social interaction between chat-room
veterans (``Winslow _ nice to see you again'').
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the conversation degenerates into irrelevant
wrangling, as when an Arab and a Jew recently launched a debate
about Palestine on an AOL investment site and wound up hurling
obscenities at each other in CAPITAL LETTERS.
</P>
<P>
   Even when someone actually chats about investing, the content is
generally superficial. (``Medical Manager Corp. is suddenly
popular.'')
</P>
<P>
   Chat rooms, it seems, serve mainly as group-therapy sessions for
people who are in the market and nervous about it.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin boards are profound by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   A man hiding behind a screen name but identified in his AOL
profile as a junior high school teacher recently posted a
well-reasoned defense of Amazon.com Inc., the online book retailer,
on a Motley Fool bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to other posters who wondered how the stock could go
from $9 to $100 in a year when the company has yet to turn a
profit, he argued that www.amazon.com is becoming a phenomenally
popular Web site _ a ``primary destination'' for Net surfers. That
means it might eventually be able to sell books ``at cost'' and
still make a profit by selling ads.
</P>
<P>
   That may turn out to be an entirely valid theory _ but consumer
groups warn that you shouldn't take any single statement as gospel
when researching securities on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The less-sophisticated investors, I think, take seriously any
well-written comment,'' says John Markese, president of the
180,000-member American Association of Individual Investors. ``We
tell people not to act on anything unless they confirm it from a
disinterested third-party source, such as Value Line or Standard &AMP;
Poor's.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter G. Crane, managing editor of IBC Financial Data in
Ashland, Mass., contends that investors can learn little of value
from chat rooms or bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't going to have a chief financial officer of a
company giving you inside data. You're far more likely to encounter
some hypester. Investment professionals and company insiders still
have a stranglehold on the really good information.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Forrest, head of online operations for Virginia-based
Motley Fool, insists that his service provides plenty of added
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had cases where people were talking about semiconductor
manufacturing in a chat room, and someone will log on from Korea
and tell you what's happening in the chip industry there,'' Forrest
observes. ``You're never going to get that from a security
analyst's report.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrest says Motley Fool bulletin-board readers were among the
first to hear that AT&AMP;T Corp. was seeking a marketing and
technology alliance with AOL _ something that was officially
confirmed in mid-June. ``There were several rumors on our boards
long before it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Motley Fool does its best to keep its chat rooms and bulletin
boards free of fraud, Forrest says.
</P>
<P>
   Motley Fool employees are present in each of the six chat rooms
to monitor the conversations. Anyone who seems to be unjustifiably
hyping a stock will be booted. Those who appear to be spreading
false information about a stock _ a violation of federal securities
laws _ will be reported to the SEC. The SEC and NASD have their own
Internet surveillance programs, but they are still rudimentary.
Evidently no one has yet been prosecuted or disciplined
specifically for statements they made in chat rooms or on bulletin
boards.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange declined to say what, if anything,
it does to combat Internet investment fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC says it relies primarily on tips and complaints from
outsiders to advise it of possible Internet abuses. But it also has
begun assigning staffers to monitor some chat rooms and bulletin
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Stark concedes that the SEC can never fully scope out the
Internet's ``infinite territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASD is spending millions of dollars to create a
computerized Internet surveillance program called Netwatch. The
rollout is scheduled for this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Netwatch will try to detect unjustified hyping or bashing of
stocks by brokerage firms and their employees, over whom it has
disciplinary authority.
</P>
<P>
   Once Netwatch is up and running, NASD's computers will
continuously scan the bulletin boards on the most-popular
investment Web sites. Bulletin boards lend themselves to this kind
of surveillance because the postings remain accessible for long
periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   Netwatch will not be able to scan chat rooms, where words come
and go too quickly for effective automated surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The computer will search the bulletin boards for hyped-up catch
phrases such as ``easy money,'' ``get rich quick,'' ``can't lose''
or ``double in a month,'' regulation chief Walter says.
</P>
<P>
   If a company that doesn't get mentioned often on the bulletin
boards suddenly starts showing up frequently, that could serve as a
``red flag,'' Walter remarks.
</P>
<P>
   It may simply turn out that the company issued a surprisingly
good or bad earnings report, or announced a merger. But if there is
no obvious cause for the proliferation of messages, NASD will try
to determine whether someone is manipulating the stock.

LSI TO BUY CHIP SUBSIDIARY FROM HYUNDAI ELECTRONICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ LSI Logic Corp. said Monday that it had agreed
to acquire Symbios Inc., a Silicon Valley-based subsidiary of
Hyundai Electronics America, for about $760 million in cash,
including assumption of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Symbios, which had 1997 sales of $620 million, is a leader in
Small Computer System Interface, known as SCSI and pronounced
scuzzy, chips used to connect to networks and peripheral devices,
like disk and tape drives.
</P>
<P>
   LSI, which is based in Milpitas, Calif., is best known for its
system-on-a-chip technology, used in products like Sony's
Playstation video game player, but has also been a participant in
the market for disk-drive controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes four days after Hyundai, a unit of
Hyundai Motor Co., and Adaptec Inc., the leading producer of SCSI
devices, ended an earlier accord in which Adaptec planned to buy
Symbios for $775 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Adaptec said it had learned that the Federal Trade Commission
was unlikely to approve that merger because of the combined
companies' apparent domination of the SCSI market.

 LSI Logic To Acquire Hyundai's Symbios  
 By Amy Doan   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chipmaker LSI Logic Corp. said yesterday it will acquire Symbios
Inc., a Hyundai Electronics America unit that makes high-end data
storage and adapter cards, for $760 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us an `instant on' in the storage market that we
couldn't get through licensing,'' said Bruce Entin, vice president
of Milpitas-based LSI.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said the acquisition is a natural evolution for LSI.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little overlap in the product lines of the two
companies,'' said Nimal Vallipuram, managing director of Bear
Stearns &AMP; Co. Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives LSI a broader base of intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   LSI is known for its chips for networking equipment and for
``system-on-a-chip'' technology, which combines multiple computing
functions onto a single chip.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Symbios will help LSI penetrate higher-end
computing markets by integrating Symbios' storage features with its
existing line of chips, analysts and LSI said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most analysts viewed the purchase as a shrewd way for
LSI to tap into the fast-growing storage market, one said that LSI
was ``paying too much'' for Symbios.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, it's an expensive move,'' said Robert
Chaplinsky of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco. ``They're paying
greater than 1.2 times Symbios' 1997 sales.''
</P>
<P>
   But LSI's Entin called the $760 million purchase price ``quite a
bargain in today's market.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes just days after Adaptec Inc. of Milpitas, which
also develops storage technology, halted its planned acquisition of
Symbios over concerns that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission would
block the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Adaptec on Friday said it believed the FTC would object to
perceived monopolies in certain markets. Together, Adaptec and
Symbios control 80 percent of the market for high-end data storage
products, according to Hambrecht &AMP; Quist LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Both Adaptec and Symbios offer technology that lets computer
servers communicate with other systems on the network like scanners
and printers.
</P>
<P>
   LSI had been talking with Symbios during the same six-month
period Adaptec was courting it, according to LSI's Entin.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from LSI and Symbios met Saturday afternoon after the
Adaptec deal was scuttled and agreed to the acquisition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   LSI will take an undisclosed charge in 1998 for the purchase,
and will assume Symbios' liabilities. LSI had revenues of $1.29
billion in 1997 and Symbios had sales of $620 million.
</P>
<P>
   LSI has 4,400 employees, 2,100 of whom are in the Bay Area.
Symbios, based in Fort Collins, Colo., has 2,400 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition should be complete, pending regulatory approval,
by September 30, the end of LSI's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at LSI said they do not expect any layoffs at either
company. Symbios will be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of
LSI.
</P>
<P>
   LSI closed up 19 cents at $23.31.

COMPAQ TO LAY OFF 1,000 WORKERS IN HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN and KAREN SANTOS  
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The 1,000 Houston layoffs announced Monday by Compaq
Computer Corp. were planned before the company's purchase of
Digital Equipment Corp. and were inevitable even if Digital hadn't
been acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The local cuts come with the elimination of factory lines that
make desktop system boards _ also known as motherboards _ and some
consumer PC operations, said Greg Petsch, Compaq's senior vice
president for manufacturing and quality.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs, in manufacturing and warehousing, are part of 5,000
worldwide, most of which are directly related to Compaq's $9
billion acquisition of Digital.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs will take place over a 6-12 month period, with most
of them happening sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Compaq still expects about 17,000 layoffs worldwide,
which a Compaq spokesman called ``the big-picture number.'' About
15,000 of those will involve Digital employees.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000 Houston cuts represent about 7 percent of the
14,000-person work force at the company's headquarters. The
combined Compaq/Digital workforce is about 84,000.
</P>
<P>
   More job cuts are coming here, but they'll be few and will be
offset by new jobs resulting from the acquisition, Petsch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, this represents the majority of the (layoffs) that
will take place in Houston,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They are the largest number of job reductions since the company
cut about 2,000 positions through layoffs and attrition in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The local cuts are the result of ongoing changes in the way
Compaq is building and distributing its personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   From its beginning, Compaq designed and built its own
motherboards for its desktop computers. But what started as a way
to engineer technological advances into Compaq's systems, soon
became a drag on its ability to bring large numbers of PCs to
market quickly.
</P>
<P>
   With its new line of both business and consumer desktops, Compaq
has started using motherboards designed as commodities by other
manufacturers, Petsch said. As older machines that use Compaq-built
motherboards are phased out, those workers will be laid off, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who assemble Compaq's lower-priced consumer PCs are
being laid off because those machines will be built in the Far East
where labor costs are cheaper. Petsch said Houston workers will
still work on Compaq's higher-priced Presario systems. That
includes PCs configured and purchased via in-store kiosks through
Compaq's new ``Built for You'' scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the consumer business, it's my sense that the
Houston factory is no longer a low-cost production plant,'' said
William Conroy, an analyst in Houston with Sanders Morris Mundy.
``Labor is just a small cost of the PC, but in an industry this
hypercompetitive, to say that every dollar counts is an
understatement. It's quarters, dimes and nickels that count.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's stock closed Monday at 29 5/16, up 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the workers streaming into a McDonald's across the street
from Compaq's northwest Harris County headquarters seemed concerned
about the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected it, with this big merger,'' said one employee.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was as fatalistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned. I've put in a lot of years (at Compaq). I don't
want to let it go,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is usually helpful to the employees it lays off, said
another worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help people get another job better than any other company
in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sockwell, director of human resources for manufacturing at
Compaq, said the laid-off workers will receive a cash severance,
continuation of benefits and may be offered a chance to apply for
other jobs within the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also in discussion with some other firms regarding the
outplacement of these employees,'' Sockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say how many weeks of severance pay workers would
receive.
</P>
<P>
   Petsch said that even though the local layoffs were planned
before the Digital acquisition, their announcement was delayed
until Monday ``to keep all this together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used the Digital acquisition to help validate our decision
points,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Conroy said Compaq held back word of the layoffs
because, ``It's probably more salable to do it today than three
months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also will close its warehouse and logistics facilities in
Houston, the result of the company moving to a build-to-order
system, Petsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Compaq built its computers based on sales
forecasts and used its warehouses to hold inventories waiting to be
sold. But to better compete with companies such as Dell Computer,
which sells its PCs direct to buyers, Compaq now assembles
computers only after orders are received.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's goal is to have 95 percent of its products deliverable
to the customer within five days.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also has transferred much of its storage needs to its
resellers and a network of satellite warehouses around the country,
Petsch said.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston warehouse space, as well as the assembly lines freed
up by the motherboard and consumer PC layoffs, will be used for
expansion of the built-to-order system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is the top PC manufacturer in the world and, with its
acquisition of Digital, is the second largest maker of all kinds of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the market for personal computers is in flux. Compaq is
trying to recover from a glut of commercial PCs that flattened its
profits in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Also, recent reports show that the consumer PC market, which had
been healthy earlier in the year, slowed over the past couple of
months as buyers awaited the release of Microsoft Corp.'s new
Windows 98 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The other 4,000 manufacturing layoffs will come as Compaq closes
and consolidates plants as far away as Australia, China, Brazil and
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It affects plants operated by Compaq, Digital and Tandem
Computer, the Cupertino, Calif.-based maker of large systems that
Compaq bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, plants that builds Tandem computers in Stirling,
Scotland, and Digital machines in Irvine, Scotland, will be closed.
Their operations will be moved to Compaq's own factory in Erskine,
Scotland. The former Digital factory in Irvine will become home to
Compaq's services operation.

COMPAQ BEGINS TRIMDOWN IN WAKE OF DIGITAL ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp., which completed its $9.5 billion
acquisition of Digital earlier this month, Monday said it will lay
off 5,000 manufacturing workers worldwide and close eight plants
and distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first part of a previously announced massive
restructuring that will eventually claim 17,000 jobs, including
15,000 Digital workers.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring will leave Compaq with a total of 67,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the shake up is about much more than Compaq's effort to
absorb Digital. It's also part of a year-old plan to completely
overhaul the way Compaq makes computers _ an effort to keep up with
one of the industry's most successful companies, Round Rock,
Texas-based Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest job cut_1,000 workers_comes at Compaq's
manufacturing facility in Houston. Compaq will cease production of
printed circuit boards for computersand some consumer products. The
company will also reorganize its Houston warehousing and
distribution operations.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the overhaul of US manufacturing operations, Compaq
began laying off 600 administrative workers at the Marlborough,
Mass., facility that formerly served as headquarters for Digital's
manufacturing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Another 3,400 jobs will disappear as Compaq closes facilities
worldwide, or merges them with Digital facilities. Digital's
operations in Taiwan will be phased out. Digitaloperations in
Australia, Scotland, Brazil and Singapore will be closed, with
operations moved to Compaq sites in those countries. In Japan,
Compaq will consolidate operations at a former Digital center which
assembles computers for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shannon, publisher of a newsletter on Digital, notes that
Massachusetts got off lightly in this round of layoffs beecause of
the focus on manufacturing. ``There's precious little of it in this
state,'' he said. ``It could be an awful lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital's workers in Massachusetts are concentrated in sales,
customer service and hardware and software engineering, as well as
corporate administration.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many more cuts still to come. Greg Petsch,
Compaq's senior vice president for manufacturing, said that further
layoffs were being planned in staffing for specific product lines,
the company's sales organization, and in corporate administration.
</P>
<P>
   Along with helping Compaq to absorb its Digital acquisition, the
changes are part of the company's year-old plan to adopt more
efficient methods of getting computers to customers. Compaq was the
darling of the computer industry last year, but has stumbled in
recent months. The company manufactured computers faster than its
distributors could sell them. That led to slower orders for new
machines and forced drastic price cuts that have weakened profit
margins throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of 1998, Compaq reported profits of $16
million, down from $414 million a year earlier. And the company
predicts that it will just break even this quarter. Meanwhile,
cross-state rival Dell Computer has seen its earnings grow
steadily. In its first quarter ended in April, Dell earned $305
million, up 54 percent from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Dell sells virtually all its computers by telephone or over the
Internet, assembling them only after an order is received. This
dramatically reduces the company's costs, leading to stronger
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Now Compaq is trying to embrace a similar model. The company has
launched an Internet site to sell directly to consumers. It's
cutting back on productionof some electronic components, opting to
buy them instead. At the same time, it's trying to keep good
relations with its traditional distribution channels that bring in
most of Compaq's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very delicate balance,'' said Roger Kay, an analyst
with International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. ``They have to
maintain their channel balance because they can't withstand the
hiccup in revenue ... At the same time, they have to get their cost
model in line with Dell's.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq stock closed up 3/8 at 29 5/16 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

Dell Computer bases assault on Europe from Ireland 
By Jerry Mahoney  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ Shortly after boarding a plane in Chicago
for a flight to Austin in 1989, Desmond O'Malley pulled out notes
on his next appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's minister of industry and commerce couldn't believe his
eyes. His staff was sending him to drum up investment from a $17
million computer company called PC's Limited, whose founder and
chief executive was only 24.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley couldn't imagine someone so young would be worth his
time, and he let his staff know he was displeased. ``But they told
me this was a very special 24-year-old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley's skepticism dissipated shortly into his two-hour
meeting with Michael Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell already had a sales operation in London, and the CEO was
``in a great hurry'' to go after the European market. O'Malley knew
of a vacant Atari plant in Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   By early fall 1990, only 10 months later the meeting, several
hundred workers in Dell's new Limerick plant were rolling out
desktops and notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the story grows every time O'Malley, now a member
of the Irish Parliament, tells it. Dell Computer Corp. is now the
third-biggest PC maker in the world. And Ireland has become the
staging area for Dell's assault on the ready-to-boom European
market, the next big battleground in the PC wars.
</P>
<P>
   Dell now has a sales and support call center in suburban Dublin
and two plants in Limerick that make computers for customers
throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa. A planned third
Limerick plant will increase Dell's Irish work force to 4,500, its
largest outside of Central Texas, where it has 12,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland ``is really the backbone of Dell's infrastructure in
Europe,'' Michael Dell said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   And Europe is crucial to Dell's ambitions to become the No. 1
computer maker.
</P>
<P>
   Europe provides nearly 25 percent of Dell's revenues _ $3
billion in the last fiscal year. Analysts' projections for this
year are as high as $5 billion. Many European countries are coming
out of a recession, and the European Union is knocking down trade
barriers, forcing companies to modernize their operations to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, from government agencies in Dublin to Dell employees
in Limerick and the Dublin suburb of Bray, are well aware of their
country's role in Dell's ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message from Michael Dell is so clear and unequivocal
about Ireland's importance for Dell in Europe,'' said Fiona
Hopkins, a technical support supervisor in the Bray call center.
Ireland's strength
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, known for its lush scenery and rich literary tradition,
may seem an unlikely place for a company like Dell. But Ireland has
emerged in the last decade as one of the strongest economies in
Europe. It has lured scores of foreign companies, many of them
high-tech firms, with low taxes, job-creating incentives and a
well-educated work force.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is both a foundation of the new Irish economy and an engine
of change, exporting from the U.S. its lean build-to-order
manufacturing approach and modern management practices.
</P>
<P>
   Its employees recite the benefits of the Dell approach but have
had to adapt to the rapid, sometimes frenetic pace that the system
demands. Dell doesn't build a computer until it's been ordered and
paid for, and some PCs are shipped within hours of the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't tend to have the kind of red tape where you have to
go through the correct chain of command,'' said Aine O'Dwyer, who
works at the Bray call center, which handles orders from Irish and
British customers. ``Decisions are made so quickly that you just
don't have time for that kind of bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the island in the original Limerick plant, Denis Kelly,
42, a manufacturing manager, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who solves the problem,'' he said. ``I just want
it solved.
</P>
<P>
   At the brightly lit Limerick factory, the employees, aware that
competitors are adopting Dell's approach, are under constant
pressure to shave even pennies and seconds from operations. The
loudest sound in the factory is the occasional hum from a power
tool. On average, the plant produces more than 4,000 computers a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the only thing that differentiates my process is
automation, they (competitors) can buy it as quick as I can,'' said
Kelly. ``So there has to be something different for us to stay
ahead of them. They can't instill the Dell philosophy as fast as I
can here.''
</P>
<P>
   The factory moves so quickly that employees returning from even
brief vacations are required to meet with training instructors to
see whether the system they learned is still in use.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is growing so fast in Ireland that new jobs are always
available, offering employees bigger paychecks and training in new
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm measured on how successfully I move people into other
operations,'' said Kelly, who by mid-morning one recent day had
interviewed eight employees for a new post on the factory floor.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining Dell five years ago as an assembly-line operator
at Limerick, James Keays, 27, has graduated to three other
positions, including repair technician and training instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Higgins, 27, leads an area known as Dell Plus, where large
orders of computers are diverted briefly so software specific to
corporate customers can be installed. He's putting in 50 hours a
week and plans to advance up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look toward a manager role,'' Higgins said. ``It's a policy
of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dell culture challenges traditional Irish assumptions
and practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish are not accustomed to working weekends, particularly
Sundays. Contract workers help keep the Limerick plants and the
Bray call center going seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Dell doesn't allow smoking at work, a problem in a country of
heavy smokers. But employees have no complaints about the chance to
share in Dell's success by owning stock. ``The growth is beneficial
for everybody. It means there are always new opportunities
coming,'' O'Dwyer said. ``We're all very keen to see the stock
price rise.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell has had to make some adaptations of its own. Because many
Irish don't drive, Dell buses employees back and forth every day.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the polished factory floor, Kelly reflected on the
clash between modernization and Irish culture that surfaces when he
has to correct an employee's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Ireland, the family is still very strong,'' he said. ``Most
of us (supervisors) will see these boys and girls as adopted sons
and daughters. If 'twas my daughter, I'd put my arm around her and
say, 'Look, honey, you ain't doin' what you're supposed to do.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You obviously can't do that in a corporate environment,''
Kelly said, adding. ``Unfortunately, in my opinion.'' The Irish
deliver
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell praises the performance of his company's Irish
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ireland has just exceeded all of our expectations,'' he said.
``And we've continued to make commitment after commitment,
investment after investment there, because the operation and the
people there keep delivering.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell will need its Irish work force to keep delivering.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle for Europe, the second-largest market behind the
United States, Dell faces archrivals Compaq Computer Corp., IBM and
Hewlett-Packard Co. as well as ambitious smaller European companies
such as Vobis Microcomputers of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, Dell may be the most feared of the big PC
makers. With its efficient manufacturing system, it can fill orders
and upgrade technology faster than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I describe 1997 as the year of Dell paranoia,'' said Simon
Pearce, an analyst with International Data Corp. in London who
studies the European market. ``When I went to the vendors, all they
could talk about was Dell.'' Changes in Europe
</P>
<P>
   Three looming changes in Europe offer PC companies a market with
staggering opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   First, Europe is emerging from a recession that stifled spending
and may have created pent-up demand for computers as well as other
goods. Second, companies may go on a spree of computer buying as a
way to avoid potentially massive computer confusion when the
calendar switches to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The most important change begins Jan. 1, when 11 European
nations become a single market that will phase in a single
currency, the euro. Trade barriers between them also will fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is a lot of these companies are waking up to
the old idea of productivity,'' Dell said in an interview earlier
this month, two days after returning from visiting customers and
operations in Italy, Switzerland and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a banker or a construction company or any kind of
business, you pretty much realize that you're going to have
competition from European competitors and you're no longer in this
island market that's protected under one country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Western Europe's Europe's economy is roughly the same size as
the U.S. economy but has half as many computers. Europeans bought
only 23 percent of 80.6 million computers sold worldwide last year.
The United States accounted for nearly 48 percent, according to
Dataquest, an industry research company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a common currency and lowered trade barriers,
pan-European trade will have little resemblance to commerce in the
United States, where companies easily cross state lines. Each
market will require a tailored marketing strategy, said Chris Jones
of Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Through 18 subsidiaries in Europe, Dell is tailoring its
approach to individual markets. Selling computers in Germany will
require a different approach than selling them in Italy. The
Internet is increasingly important to Dell's direct-sales models,
and it has Web sites in more than a dozen European languages.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's European customers include such blue bloods as British
Petroleum and the German automaker Daimler-Benz. Dell's desktops
and servers help run operations throughout the government
bureaucracies of England and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But at Trinity University in Dublin, the economics department
recently replaced a half-dozen or so Dell computers with Gateway
machines because of complaints among faculty and staff about
service.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government's Department of Enterprise, Trade and
Employment has nearly 400 Dell computers out of 660 throughout the
department.
</P>
<P>
   While they're ``very reliable,'' Dell's slowness to send help
when a problem does arise is annoying, said Richard Barry, who
helps maintain the department's computer network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we have to remind them that we have a three-year
warranty,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about these complaints, sales director Tim McCarthy in
Bray acknowledged that some customers have legitimate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can give you names of many happy customers,'' he said. A
crowded field
</P>
<P>
   Among the handful of global computer makers that control the $80
billion industry, Dell had the best financial performance in 1997.
Revenue soared 58 percent and profit rose 82 percent. While working
with a larger base, Compaq's revenues rose 22.8 percent and profits
were up 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dell maintained its momentum in the first quarter of this year,
earning $357 million on $4.3 billion, while IBM, Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard disappointed investors because of price cuts. The
quest to become No. 1 requires Dell to elbow aside an aggressive
Hewlett-Packard, which passed Dell as the fastest-growing PC maker
in the first quarter and leads Dell in France and Germany. Dell has
a much bigger challenge catching Compaq, which not only leads Dell
in the major European markets but overtook Dell as Ireland's No. 1
PC vendor in the first quarter, according to estimates by
International Data Corp. Compaq got a third of its $25 billion in
sales last year from European customers.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard recently opened a second European plant in
Holland, and Compaq acquired an up-to-date manufacturing site in
Scotland when it bought Digital Equipment Corp. this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives hope to take market share from Compaq while it's
busy combining its operations with those of Digital. ``Compaq is
looking more like a sumo wrestler now,'' said Ashok Kumar, an
analyst with the Piper Jaffray investment firm. ``With the DEC
acquisition, they've put on some weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq officials declined to comment about the coming battle in
Europe. Several European companies have formed a coalition across
borders to reduce the prices they pay for components. Vobis and
Siemens Nixdorf lead the American-based PC companies in the German
market, but analysts expect that, in time, Dell and the other U.S.
companies will dominate Germany as well as the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The PC business has always been fiercely competitive, and that
will continue as key battlegrounds shift around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The coming battle is in Europe, but Dell also is planting its
stake in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   The company is building a small manufacturing and sales facility
in China, another country with huge potential. Later this year
comes a factory in South America, probably Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I think about it is, look, there's 300 million PCs in
the world today,'' Dell said. ``About 30 percent get replaced every
year. Ten years from now there will be 1.4 billion machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean this is the beginning of an industry.''
</P>

Tech companies help spur Irish economy 
By Jerry Mahoney  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMERICK, Ireland _ In the alley behind Gerry Walsh's
148-year-old business, a 50-foot-tall crane swings across the gray
sky. The racket of a concrete truck backing up to one of several
downtown apartment projects makes it impossible for Walsh to have a
conversation with an employee.
</P>
<P>
   The dapper, silver-bearded merchant doesn't mind. The
construction, as much as the parade of consumers that crowds the
sidewalk in front of his Newsom's department store on a blustery
afternoon, signals unprecedented prosperity for him and this city
of 80,000 on the River Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   The boom is not just in Limerick, where Dell Computer Corp. and
other large U.S. and European technology companies are hiring
furiously, but also in Dublin, Cork and most of the rest of the
Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Just three decades ago, Ireland was a poor nation of small
villages and farms that had more in common with some Third World
countries than with the industrialized West. For more than 150
years, its best and most dependable export had been its people.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ireland has become Europe's top-performing economy. Last
year, the gross domestic product grew by 8.3 percent, compared to
2.2 percent growth in Germany, 3.5 percent in the United Kingdom
and 3.8 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Record job growth and surging exports have been fueled by low
corporate taxes _ the corporate income tax is 10 percent _ and a
national policy that pays foreign companies to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly can't think of any time that has been comparable
in Ireland, or even in Europe. It's really quite astonishing,''
said Terry Baker, an economist with the Economic and Social
Research Institute, a consulting company in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Irish, imbued with their country's history of
poverty, famine and often brutal domination by England, worry that
the good times will disappear, like the elusive leprechauns of
Irish folklore hiding their pots of gold.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, however, that this pot of gold is no fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of jobs
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp.'s expansion plans symbolize Ireland's
growing industrial clout.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is increasing its manufacturing capability in Limerick,
people and adding to its sales and support center in the Dublin
suburb of Bray. Overall, the expansion is expected to add 3,000
jobs to Dell's Irish operations over the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Other American companies are expanding as well. Motorola Inc.
plans to hire more than 100 workers at an electronics plant in the
southern city of Cork, where it also is starting an advanced
semiconductor design facility.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. last month opened a second Pentium chip
manufacturing plant near Dublin. The entire complex, Ireland's
largest manufacturing site, is expected to employ 4,000 workers by
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox Corp., even as it is cutting jobs in other countries,
recently announced it will create 2,200 jobs in Dublin and in
Dundalk, near the Northern Ireland border.
</P>
<P>
   For many young people in Ireland, the jobs are opening doors to
new worlds.
</P>
<P>
   James Keays, 27, and his wife, Tracey, 26, bought a house in
Limerick two years ago. This spring, they took up skiing, jetting
off to the Pyrenees Mountains in Spain for a weeklong vacation on
the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Dell, Keays was a waiter at a Limerick coffee
shop. Tracey, his then-girlfriend, worked at Dell and urged him to
apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said the money was good,'' said Keays, who installs
software on Dell computers for large customers. ``Before that, I
wouldn't have seen myself buying a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, technology companies, global pharmaceutical and
banking firms and thriving Irish-owned businesses, which have
piggybacked on the business of the multinationals, created 10,000
jobs. That is a record for this nation of 3.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other factor, credit for the boom goes to
government policies, dating to the 1970s, that entice foreign
companies with generous cash incentives.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish also get high marks for their higher-education system,
which turns out graduates with skills geared toward key industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, they're coming out with just the right degrees,'' said
Intel spokesman Howard High. ``When we rated them out, they came
out comparable to a University of California-Berkeley or a Stanford
University over here.''
</P>
<P>
   To maintain the good times, the government is pouring money into
schools and computer networks _ the equivalent of $450 million over
the next several years _ to prepare the country for the time when
the global companies move manufacturing sites to lower-cost
countries in Asia or Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where Ireland is unique is it offers a high-skill environment
at a moderate cost,'' said Martin Cronin, who directs the
government's effort to lure multinationals from his office in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   The average manufacturing wage in Ireland is about $19,200 a
year. In the Austin area, it is $21,400.
</P>
<P>
   Global concerns such as Dell, Intel and Citibank are providing
more than jobs. They are introducing modern management practices
that had been foreign to Irish workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   They are teaching their Irish managers skills whose benefits are
beginning to ripple across the economy, said Ed Walsh, a visionary
educator who founded Limerick University in the 1970s and built it
into a model for cooperation between higher education and business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irish manufacturing was poor before, very inefficient,'' Walsh
said, sitting in a red overstuffed chair with his morning cup of
tea. ``We have a new generation of Irish people who are
well-educated and experienced in the best management practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they are not used to good economic times, the Irish
have been quick to capitalize on them.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Walsh, the merchant, heads a Cork-based company that
recently purchased small department stores, including Newsom's, in
four cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at the Limerick hardware and housewares store have
increased 35 percent in three years, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Several nearby merchants who are enjoying the vibrant trade are
remodeling stores and refurbishing dated facades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of money in Limerick and the surrounds,'' Walsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of work in the computer industry in Limerick,
and the workers make good incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers of ``Angela's Ashes'' might be amazed at the bustle, not
to mention the optimism. But reminders linger of the gritty city
described so poignantly in Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning
book about his poverty-wracked Limerick family a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny but cool morning this spring, a young homeless couple
and their two dogs slept near a boarded-up storefront on the fringe
of Limerick's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Business and government leaders chafe at the nickname, ``Stab
City,'' that the Dublin newspapers gave Limerick a few years ago
after an outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
   There are pockets in both cities where unemployment runs as high
as 60 percent, said Jan O'Sullivan, a member of the Irish
Parliament and former mayor of Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   The problem persists despite hundreds of openings at Dell and
other employers, and O'Sullivan said the government must attack it
with training programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a cycle,'' she said. ``The father and
grandfather were without jobs. A lot of people can't just go out
and get jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those benefiting from the new prosperity have complaints.
The most serious is the rising cost of housing.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for housing in the Dublin area, where the average cost of
a home is $132,000, will push prices up 25 percent this year,
according to a recent study by NCB Stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors keen to take advantage of rising prices are buying new
apartment buildings before they're completed.
</P>
<P>
   Older buildings are snapped up and longtime residents are forced
out by rising rents.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish government said earlier this year that affordable
housing would be a national priority in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic growth, many mom-and-pop businesses
languish while the government pays companies such as Dell to create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little money available for the guy who has a
small business and will only hire three or four people,'' said Doug
McLernon of Trinity University's economics department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, young and old alike are brimming with pride about the
country's economic health and membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   There also is intense hope that the historic Northern Ireland
peace agreement, which voters overwhelmingly approved in May, will
finally put an end to the killings in the North and the South.
</P>
<P>
   While this may be Ireland's finest moment, the country's sad
history always clouds the national consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put everything together,'' said Baker, the Dublin
economist, ``things have never been this positive for Ireland,
which, of course, makes everyone wonder what can go wrong and when
it will go wrong.''

Dell to exec sees Ireland as doorway to Europe 
By Jerry Mahoney  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Thefollowing is an interview with Michael
Dell conducted by Austin American-Statesman business writer Jerry
Mahoney on June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much time do you spend in Europe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it's a little harder because they're further away. I'd
say, certainly when I'm there, it's a big portion of the time. I'll
probably go over about four times this year to Europe. We tend to
rotate different countries, different operations, reviews.
</P>
<P>
   I was over in April, and I was there in January-February time
... and I went back in October. But it's important to get over and
understand the differences in the markets and what customers are
doing and understanding their requirements better. The other great
thing is the market, Europe is just booming.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is that a lot of these companies are waking up
to the old idea of productivity and that they have to be
competitive in a world market. For example, I went to Italy and you
talk to the Italians, and what just about every Italian
businessperson will tell you is 'Well, the Euro is coming, and
because of the Euro we have to catch up with the Germans.'
</P>
<P>
   And if you're a banker or a construction company or any kind of
business you pretty much realize that you're going to have
competition from European competitors and you're no longer in this
island market that's protected and sold under one country. You talk
to the Germans and they think about the Americans and the Japanese,
they think about their competition on a global scale. Real Audio

   More Real Audio excerpts from Michael Dell's interview.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a lot of the Germans see this as a real kind of
pinnacle time for their economy and their all excited about the
Daimler-Chrysler merger.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are either of those companies customers of Dell?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're both customers, both very good customers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do they buy from other vendors too?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh yeah, it's pretty rare that you can get all the business.
It's kind of like the Chicago Bulls, they don't win every game, but
they win a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is Dell in Ireland with manufacturing and later with the
call center?
</P>
<P>
   A: This goes back to 1990 when the business was growing quite a
bit across Europe, and it came time to have a manufacturing center
for all of Europe. The things we considered included the work force
availability, infrastructure, education level, the political
environment, the receptivity toward new businesses, the incentive
structure, labor availability.
</P>
<P>
   You consider all these things and Ireland came out number one in
all categories. The only category they didn't come out number one
in was, which was a question at the time and now I think it's not
an issue, is the question of if you put you're plant in France or
Germany or the UK, you probably have some enhanced business in
those countries, which is true, but all the other things
dramatically offset that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think there's a stronger, bigger corporate structure
that would maybe spinoff from that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the idea that you would be able to get more business. If
you look in Malaysia where we have a plant, we're the number one PC
supplier. It's kind of like in the Austin area, who do people buy
their PCs from? You kind of have the home town advantage.
</P>
<P>
   So you could make the argument, if you're going to have the home
team advantage, you should put it in a big city or a big town or a
big country. Ireland has just exceeded all of our expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the business in Europe grow very quickly, but the
operations there have kept pace, we've expanded it and we've
continued to make commitment after commitment and investment after
investment because the operation and the people there keep
delivering. The results are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of the employees I met over there said Michael has been
unequivocal about Ireland's role in Dell's plans. What is that
role?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, it's really the backbone of our European
infrastructure. If you look at Europe, we have more employees in
Ireland than we do anywhere in Europe. In fact, outside of Austin,
there's no place in the world where we have more people than
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   There are some real good reasons for this. In our business, if
you think back to the computer companies of the past, they had this
idea that you stuck plants everywhere around the world, kind of one
in every town. The problem with that is you don't get any critical
mass and the key part of Dell's business models is inventory
velocity.
</P>
<P>
   If you took our plant on Metric Lane and you said OK here's this
plant that's producing a couple million computers a year, and we're
going to divide this plant into 10 plants and spread them all out
over the United States. Would you get higher inventory velocity or
lower velocity? Much lower, no question. Real Audio Listen to this
portion of Michael Dell's interview in Real Audio.
</P>
<P>
   You have more places to have stuff and more forecast inaccuracy
so the same applies: Austin is to United States as Ireland is to
Europe for Dell. It pays for us to concentrate our resources in a
particular geographic area. I'll put a little disclaimer on the end
here.
</P>
<P>
   At some point it gets to be too much in one place. And that's
true of anywhere in the world whether it's Austin or Ireland or
Malaysia because you could run into other kinds of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Workers, for example?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the availability of work force, the availability of
infrastructure. I think we're a ways away from that but we keep
making commitments to the same places so I think we're away from
that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you look at the European market two years, five years,
10 years down the road, and it's importance to Dell?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dell's business in Europe this year will be approximately the
same size as all of Dell was three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Wow. What is that $3 billion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Last year it was $3 billion, this year according to the
analysts' estimates, close to $5 billion. I mean this is really
neat stuff. I think a lot of people look at Dell and they go, 'Gee
this is an incredible story.' But actually it's a lot of incredible
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Europe in itself is an incredible story. If you just had
Dell Europe as a company, it'd be an amazing company. The thing's
11 years old, it's growing like wild. It's a very profitable,
successful business for us.
</P>
<P>
   The economy in Europe is about the same size as the economy in
the U.S., but there's half the number of PCs in Europe as there are
in the U.S. And what I think is going to happen is over time, that
gap will be narrowed considerably. Think about it this way.
</P>
<P>
   If the average employee in the average company in Western Europe
costs the company about $140 a day. I'm including salary, benefits,
labor, overhead, everything, which, by the way, is not that
different than the rate in the U.S. A PC costs $2 a day. What
people figure out is instead of giving people slates and chisels,
you give them PCs.
</P>
<P>
   These are the weapons of capitalism, the tools of modern
productivity. The growth rates in Europe are tremendous. The growth
in the U.S. for Dell continues to be very strong, and even Asia is
growing pretty nicely for us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have the Europeans been just a little slower to realize that
efficiency?
</P>
<P>
   A: They've been slower to adopt in an aggregate market, but you
would see companies in Europe ... into computing as any company in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   You see companies in the Nordic region doing the same thing, but
then you see other companies that were more regional competitors
and didn't feel compelled to engage in computing as much.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the use of PCs in the home has not been as popular,
although that's one of the fastest growing areas of our business,
not only in Europe, but in the U.S. as well.
</P>
<P>
   Our consumer growth right now in Europe is about 100 percent.
So, as income levels increase, as the cost of telecom comes down in
Europe, you'll see more and more PCs in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you project that the European market at some point is
going to become more important to Dell's overall revenues than the
U.S. as this market matures?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think so. I think, like the movie Godzilla, size
matters. I mean, the U.S. market is still the biggest market in the
world. The way you ought to think about is, think about the top
markets in the world. It's U.S., Japan, Germany, UK, France.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those markets are in Europe, but even those three
together and the rest of Europe aren't as big as the U.S. So the
U.S. is still a huge, huge market, and I believe a market that will
continue to grow. If you look at the education market, the home
market, small business, medium-size businesses, and even large
businesses who are on a replacement calysts continue to speculate
that this enterprise market is going to be a problem for Dell. Do
you get tired of hearing that?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I'm used to hearing analysts repeat themselves. There
is another thing that goes on here. And that is that the analysts
will quickly recoil and come up with a different approach when they
see Dell delivering results.
</P>
<P>
   We've had now seven quarters in a row of server growth in excess
of 150 percent. That keeps happening, and people say, 'Well, gee,
maybe we did miss something here.'
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems to me that's a Compaq and Pfieffer's strategy of
punishing Dell.
</P>
<P>
   A: Doesn't seem to be working very well.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at the facts, OK. Two and half years ago, if you
said, let's look at the server market, you know, You needed a
microscope to find our server business. Now in the U.S. market,
we've got 14 percent share, Compaq has 30.
</P>
<P>
   HP has 12 and IBM has 10. So we're 40 percent larger than IBM in
the server business in the U.S. And we're almost half the size of
Compaq. And by the way, all this has occurred, this unprecedented
growth and share gain, with what I would consider to be our first
round of server products, which were pretty good but not awesome.
</P>
<P>
   And now, enter the new generation of products, which comes out
starting with the PowerEdge 2300, which has already come out. And
then the end of this month with Intel's Xeon introduction, we have
a whole new range of server and storage products.
</P>
<P>
   I think the game gets really interesting here because Dell goes
from fast-follower in the server market to product leadership.
</P>
<P>
   And if these guys think they're going to maintain 40 percent
gross margins as we're zooming ahead of them in technology, and the
customer everyday realizes that there's no reason to pay these
proprietary margins ... I hope they believe that. Because they're
going to be in for a very unpleasant surprise and it's called Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the delay of new Intel chip going to affect your plans?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not measurably. This is Heywoods. No '70s collection would be
complete without them.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Bertha Butt Boogie''? ``The Morning After''? Gimme a
break. Why would anyone consider singing about a woman's ample
backside or a romance aboard a doomed luxury ocean liner? How
utterly '70s. That would never happen today.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. Wait. I forgot about ``Baby Got Back'' and ``My Heart Will
Go On.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   Were there songs that Rhino missed? Sure. The roadkill called
``Muskrat Love'' by The Captain and Tenille. ``Margaritaville'' is
missing in action. There's nothing to hint that rap music broke out
of its crib with Sugarhill Gang's huge hit, ``Rapper's Delight.''
There's neither a Bee nor a Gee in sight, and there's nary a whiff
of Manilow.
</P>
<P>
   But the general mix is great. One minute you're enduring the
``Godspell'' reject, ``One Tin Soldier.'' The next moment you're
ready to skip class after hearing ``School's Out'' by Alice Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   So here now is a condensed, disc-by-disc review of the box's
outta sight highlights _ and lowlights. Right on!
</P>
<P>
   DISC ONE
</P>
<P>
   The first of the disc's 24 songs to smack you in the face is
``American Woman,'' by The Guess Who. Sure, it's got great
screaming vocals and chugging drums and guitar. But the lyrics?
Let's just say it's odd for a man to scream ``American woman, get
away from me,'' during the height of the sexual revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vehicle'' by the Ides of March quickly redeems this disc. When
Jim Peterik belts out ``I'm your vehicle baby/I'll take you
anywhere you want to go/Great God in heaven/You know I love you,''
you feel like you're listening to the commencement address at the
Tom Jones School of Macho Vocals.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite end, ``Band Of Gold'' is covertly snide. Freda
Payne tells the tale of an unfulfilled bride who hopes her man will
``walk back through that door and love me like you tried before.''
Nothing like an impotent wedding night to send a song rocketing
Viagra-like up the charts, eh?
</P>
<P>

Dell helps wire Irish city 
By Jerry Mahoney  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNIS, Ireland _ Ireland, in a furious pace to transform its
agrarian economy to a technological marvel in just over one
generation, hopes to have the world's first fully wired city.
</P>
<P>
   The project is called the Information Age Town. It's a joint
effort between Ireland's national telecommunications company, Dell
Computer Corp. and Ennis, a prosperous city of 20,000 whose origins
date to the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, each of Ennis' 12 schools was wired with a powerful
Dell server and Dell Optiplex personal computers for every
classroom _ 750 computers in all.
</P>
<P>
   Next, every school will be connected to the Internet by Telecom
Eireann, and the city's 7,500 students and teachers will get
personal e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   But the most ambitious part of the project is just getting under
way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Internet access, each of Ennis' 5,800 households
will get a computer from Dell, which manufactures them 20 miles
south in Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   Dell will discount the price of the computers and Telecom
Eireann will provide a subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the computers, each household will be asked to
contribute the equivalent of $360, which will be used for future
community projects, said Kyran Kennedy, director of the Clare
(County) Education Centre in Ennis.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, already the No. 1 personal computer company in Ireland,
outbid Gateway and other PC makers to supply the computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to understand that market, which is on
our doorstep,'' said Tim McCarthy, sales director for Dell in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The close tie-in with Ennis schools _ including specific uses
for special-education classes _ may have swayed Telecom Eireann's
judges, said Kennedy, who oversees the project for Ennis schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're trying to do is make everybody Internet-wise,
e-mail-wise and computer literate,'' he said. ``I would be happy if
the initial response was that all teachers saw the computer as a
friendly teaching aid.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that many of Ennis' 400 teachers are leagues
behind their pupils in their computer abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greater challenge is, what are we going to do in six
months' time when the novelty wears off?'' Kennedy said. ``And the
only solution is to get the curriculum totally integrated on the
PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   State-owned Telecom Eireann is a former monopoly now facing
competition for international business because of the opening of
markets associated with Ireland's membership in the European Union.
Competition for local business will begin in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The company also worries about customers who may bypass any
local call provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're heavily dependent on local call revenue,'' said Colm
O'Toole, who is managing the Ennis project for Dublin-based Telecom
Eireann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see voice telephony over the Internet as a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the Irish government recently began IT2000.
</P>
<P>
   Over three years, the $70 million project will put 60,000
computers in schools throughout the country, train 20,000 teachers
in the uses of information technology and wire every school to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for every teacher and student in Ireland to have
an e-mail address, according to the national Ministry of Education.

Dell Computer attempts to build up service in Ireland 
By Jerry Mahoney  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Dell Computer Corp. called last summer,
Mike Riley said, ``No thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old manager had just opened a state-of-the-art call
center for Halifax plc, the British bank where he had built a
rewarding career over 35 years. Content, proud of the center and
confident in his understanding of banking, Riley brushed off the
overture from Dell. ``Technology is often a young man's game,''
Riley said he worried at the time.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Dell wanted to move him from his home in Yorkshire,
England, to the Dublin suburb of Bray, to run the company's sales
and customer-support center for Ireland and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's operation in Bray handles more than 3,000 calls a day
from Irish and British customers seeking technical help.
</P>
<P>
   Such facilities have become corporate nerve centers that can
play a key role in a competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   As the leading direct seller of computers, Dell has developed
its close contact with customers into an asset. For example, orders
received by phone, in which customers select the components they
want, may foretell shifts in buyer preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing emphasis on providing good service that is
rippling across the computer industry adds pressure on PC makers to
quickly and accurately help customers who phone in with problems.
What's more, because the labor-intensive call centers are expensive
to operate, companies seek ways to make them as efficient as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set up some of the best call centers in Europe, period,''
said chief executive Michael Dell. ``So he got on our radar screen
in the search process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Riley, having spent most of his life in northern England,
did not relish the idea of moving his wife and two daughters across
the Irish Sea.
</P>
<P>
   That was last summer, and much has happened since, beginning
with a flight to Austin and a 90-minute conversation with Dell at
the company's Round Rock headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five years with the bank in the U.K., and I gave up
everything after talking to Michael,'' Riley recalled,
half-sitting, half-leaning, with arms folded, against a table in
the burgeoning Bray facility that he has run since last fall. ``It
was a leap of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men talked about Dell's opportunities and challenges and
the role Ireland would play in the company's plans, said Dell, who
meets with most candidates for senior positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) got very intrigued with the opportunity to do something
different and be a part of something special.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom is the oldest of Dell's overseas operations
and is its No. 2 market after North America. Dell's U.K. sales grew
by more than 50 percent last year, to more than $1 billion. While
Dell relies on large corporate accounts for more than half of its
sales, its consumer business more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   On the job only eight months, Riley is making plans to hire 400
more workers and to double the size of the 106,000-square-foot
building in Bray, a Dublin suburb between the sea and green Wicklow
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The company wants to push U.K. sales to $2 billion this year.
Riley finds Dell's rapid growth unsettling at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've learned is, if you don't manage growth, it
manages you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite any concerns he may have about Dell's industry-leading
pace of growth, Riley has started a friendly competition with the
home office.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by strong fourth-quarter sales of the popular
Dimension desktop computer, which resulted in a higher average
price than it brought in North America, Riley challenged the Texas
headquarters to beat the U.K. on average price this year.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Larson, Dell's vice president and general manager for the
United Kingdom and Ireland, learned of the challenge in a meeting
with Riley and other supervisors two days after she arrived from
Austin in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, 'Uh oh ... I haven't even had a chance to review
these numbers yet','' she said. `` 'What is this guy talking
about?' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Come on, Susan,' `` Larson recalled, laughing. ``
'Let's not be a wimp. You're over here now. You're one of us. We've
got to go challenge those guys.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The competition is now formal, with updates posted for employees
on Dell's internal network.
</P>
<P>
   Another Riley goal, when he finds the time, is to establish a
paperless workplace at the Bray center. That means that every
letter, report and memo from a multitude of sources is properly
dealt with immediately -- scanned in and filed in the database.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is to come up with something so good that the
Americans have to swallow deeply and say, 'We're going to do that.'
``

hand-held scanners. Its 30-bit technology promises more colors and
detail than 24-bit rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Versatility is the strength of this image-transfer device. It
boasts a straight paper path that won't bend, shred or mutilate
hard-to-replace photos and documents, and it has a detachable head,
which, like a hand-held scanner, can be used to scan books,
magazines or other bound materials. The removable head also makes
it easy to clean. EasyPhoto's ClearScan II technology is designed
to automatically brighten, sharpen and color correct dull images.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $149, the EasyPhoto scanner can be seen at

<P>
   Users of the TrackMan Marble FX input device may have less
reason to fear the effects of repetitive-strain injury. The
point-and-click tool from Logitech combines comfort and
functionality in a futuristic design that eliminates the
multiclicking death grip sometimes required to operate a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with four programmable buttons, the Marble FX is easily
customized via the Mouse Properties dialog box. The bundled
MouseWare software provides a host of commands, which can be
assigned to any of the buttons _ from double-clicking to closing an

   Versatile videocamera
</P>
<P>
   Digital videocameras were once exotic toys for the well-heeled,
but like many things digital, cost and technology have put them in
the hands of the average consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Kodak Digital Science DVC323, for example. At $169,
this videocamera is within the budget of many computer users. It
has a wealth of fun and practical applications.
</P>
<P>
   Its two main functions are capturing still and video images for
transfer to computer files and for real-time videoconferencing.
Small enough to fit atop a monitor, the DVC323 will let you chat
face-to-face with friends from around the world. (Provided, of
course, you have friends around the world and they, too, have
videoconferencing capability.) It can be used to send still image
and video clips downline, as e-mail messages. Bundled with loads of
image-editing software, video quality is good, but installation is
reported to be a little challenging.

 Software's Sequoias  
 By Julia Angwin   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two giants are battling for dominance of the consumer software
industry _ and neither one is named Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the attention paid to the Redmond, Wash., software
giant, it is not the nation's top seller of software in stores.
</P>
<P>
   There are two contenders for that spot: Cendant Corp., a
troubled Southern California conglomerate that owns everything from
hotel chains to software, and The Learning Company, a Cambridge,
Mass., software firm that keeps gobbling up its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dominates the overall software market, but most of its
sales come from businesses, not stores.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, Cendant held the No. 1 consumer software spot.
But then The Learning Company announced its intention to buy rival
Broderbund for $420 million _ which would boost it to the No.1 spot
in sales, according to PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Broderbund acquisition puts The Learning Company one step
ahead,'' said Stephen Dube, senior analyst with Wasserstein Perella
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, each company has less than a 10 percent slice of the $2
billion market for consumer software _ which ranges from computer
games to desktop publishing to educational titles.
</P>
<P>
   Their battle illustrates the increasingly competitive nature of
the consumer software industry, where shelf space is hard to come
by and prices are falling.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the only way to survive the shelf battles and price
wars is to have a huge lineup of titles and hope for a best-seller
_ such as Broderbund's Myst, the best-selling game of all time _
that will pay for the non-hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to look like the book publishing industry,
where it's hard for a single-title publisher to break into the
market,'' said Jeff Tarter, publisher of Softletter, an industry
newsletter in Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small companies are fine as long as they have hits,''
Tarter said. ``But if they hit a dry spell, they go broke.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such a fate, Cendant and The Learning Company have both
used acquisitions to build large libraries of titles. In fact, both
firms were born from mergers.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Company is the successor to SoftKey Software _ a
Cambridge, Mass., company that was created in 1994 as the result of
a merger of three small software companies.
</P>
<P>
   SoftKey changed its name to The Learning Company after buying
the Fremont software firm with that name.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, The Learning Co. has bought eight more firms,
racking up huge financial losses but also ringing up the sales.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, The Learning Company racked up losses of $475 million
on sales of $392 million. But at the same time, its stock has
steadily climbed to yesterday's all-time high of $29.63.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is betting that The Learning Company eventually will
turn a profit once it has gobbled up the all companies in its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Learning Company has acted as a consolidator,'' said Larry
Marcus, software analyst at BT Alex. Brown in San Francisco. ``We
forecast them to be the fastest-growing market share leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Company also has an advantage because it focuses
only on software, ``while Cendant is more scattered between
categories,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cendant is barely a software company. It was formed in
December from the $11 billion merger of direct marketing firm CUC
International and HFS Inc., an owner of hotel chains such as Days
Inn and Ramada, and real estate brokers such as Century 21.
</P>
<P>
   Before the merger, CUC had been on a two-year buying spree in
the software and Internet industry _ snagging software industry
leaders Davidson Associates and Sierra On-Line, as well as a number
of Web site companies.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cendant was created, the company has slowed its
acquisitions, partly because it ran into financial trouble. On
April 16, Cendant shares plunged 46 percent after the company said
it had discovered accounting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's stock has not yet bounced back, even though the
company fired the people involved.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cendant has been leading a software-industry trend
called ``net zero pricing,'' according to David Cole, senior
analyst at DFC Intelligence, a market research firm in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the company is giving away software. For example,
Cendant offers some titles for sale at $29.95 _ and then gives the
buyer a manufacturer's rebate of $29.95, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cendant is a direct-marketing company,'' Cole said. ``They
figure that's a good way to get names'' for future sales prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co. has been matching Cendant's deals, Cole said,
but neither side can afford to keep it up forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for companies trying to make money off the software
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts say the companies that can afford to lose
money in the short term likely will be the long-term winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect there to be continued consolidation,'' said Andrea
Williams, Volpe Brown Whelan analyst. ``It's a profitable business,
but it's only profitable for a few companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it sad because there's less selection?'' she asked.
``Ultimately, the reason for that is, the market's not supporting a
broad selection.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, TLC spokeswoman Susan Getgood said
consolidation is good for consumers. ``To some degree, it
guarantees that the brands that they love and trust will continue
to be available to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that consumers are paying less for their computers
_ which now cost less than $1,000 _ and they want to pay less for
their software, too. Many PCs now come with the software basics _
word processing, e-mail, spreadsheet, database, Web browser,
graphics program _ already included.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software has to come down in price to reflect those changes,''
said Rob Enderle, analyst at Giga Information Group in Santa Clara.
``There are only a few large players that can afford the cost of
mistakes. We end up across the gamut with larger, more powerful
companies, for good or for bad.''

IN FIRST FEW DAYS, WINDOWS 98 SELLING AS WELL AS WINDOWS 95 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Windows 98 went on sale last week with little fanfare and a puny
marketing budget compared with its relentlessly promoted
predecessor, Windows 95. And Windows 98 also came to market under a
legal cloud, as Exhibit A in the Justice Department's antitrust
suit against the Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, it seems, at least not in the first few days. Windows
98 flew off store shelves just as quickly as did Windows 95 when it
went on sale, even slightly faster, according to PC Data, a market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four days of sales, from last Thursday through
Sunday, retailers sold 530,000 copies of Windows 98, PC Data
reported Tuesday, based on daily sales reports from 20 chains with
6,000 stores. In its first four days on the market three years ago,
Windows 95 sold 510,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had sought to deflate expectations for Windows 98,
positioning the new operating system as a ``tune-up'' to its
predecessor instead of a ground-breaking new product. With the
low-key introduction, most analysts had expected Windows 98 sales
to build more gradually than was the case with Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was wrong in saying there was no pent-up demand for
Windows 98,'' said Ann Stephens, president of PC Data in Reston,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the early results, analysts say, do not necessarily indicate
how well Windows 98 will do in the long run. The first few days of
retail sales tend to be to computer enthusiasts, who are but one
slice of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the guys who regard putting a new operating system
on their personal computer as a form of entertainment,'' said Chris
LeTocq, an analyst at Dataquest, a research firm in San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the number of these computer enthusiasts has increased
sharply in the last few years as more and more people use
computers. By the end of this year, the number of personal
computers in use running some version of Microsoft's Windows
operating systems will be 376 million, Dataquest estimates. At the
end of 1995, the number of machines using Windows was 153 million,
according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   With more people using Windows machines, the potential market of
those who might spend $89 to upgrade to Windows 98 is far greater
than when Windows 95 was introduced _ making the initial sales of
Windows 98 somewhat less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, about 90 percent of all shipments of PC operating
systems come already installed in new machines instead of as
retail, shrink-wrap programs for upgrading an existing operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   David Readerman, an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities, estimates that Windows 98 will generate revenues for
Microsoft of $3.2 billion in its first 12 months from sales to both
computer makers and retail customers.

MICROSOFT RULING SHOWS A FAULT LINE OF ANTITRUST THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ State and federal prosecutors insist that while
last week's federal Appeals Court ruling favoring Microsoft Corp.
might force them to alter their legal tactics, it also offers a
road map to help sharpen their new antitrust case against the
software giant.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of intense discussion, Justice Department
prosecutors and state attorneys general are even more determined to
press their case, several of them said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has yet to decide whether to appeal last
week's ruling in an earlier federal suit against Microsoft. But
because the new case brought by the federal government and 20
states earlier this month deals with some of the same issues, state
prosecutors say they have decided that the Appeals Court opinion
has to be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of discussion, and the consensus is this
was the dicta of just two judges,'' Wisconsin Attorney General
James Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new case, Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelly
declared, ``We would be remiss if we stopped short of taking this
case up to the highest decision-making body we can get to'' _ in
this case the full Appeals Court or, if necessary, the Supreme
Court. Federal officials say they share that view.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the Appeals Court
overturned a District Court injunction that had prohibited
Microsoft from requiring computer manufacturers to install
Microsoft's browser software for navigating the World Wide Web as a
condition of installing Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 and its successor, Windows 98, which went on sale
last Thursday, are the operating system used on more than 90
percent of all computers sold today.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 opinion, the panel said Microsoft had the right to add
whatever new features it wanted to its operating system, even if
that included ``bundling'' other products, as long as the result
benefited customers. The opinion contained the clear message that
this standard could also be applied to at least some of the issues
in the new case. Acknowledging that, a senior prosecutor directly
involved with the case said that last week's decision ``gave us a
framework to follow _ and a framework to attack'' in the new case.
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal antitrust suits have been consolidated,
and Steven Houck, chief of the Antitrust Bureau in the New York
attorney general's office _ and the lead litigator for the states
in the new suit _ agreed that the Appeals Court ruling would help
prosecutors define their new case.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said that the ruling would ``change the
emphasis of how we present our evidence'' in at least two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, Houck said: ``We think the most important part of our
case is now the exclusionary contracts Microsoft has with Internet
service providers that require them to refuse to promote competing
browsers. What the Court of Appeals said had no impact on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under arrangements with several companies that serve as Internet
gateways _ including AT&AMP;T Worldnet and America Online _ Microsoft
places links to these companies' Web sites on the first screen
users see on their new computers. As part of those arrangements,
Microsoft has required the companies to promote only Microsoft's
browser, Internet Explorer, to the exclusion of competing products,
most notably Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser.
</P>
<P>
   In March, just before Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, was
scheduled to testify before a Senate committee about this and other
practices, the company announced that it was dropping these
restrictive contract provisions. But Houck remains skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft says they have eased those restrictions,'' he said.
``But I haven't seen the contracts. I've asked for them and haven't
gotten them. In any case, there is a body of case law that says if
you alter your behavior in the face of a lawsuit, it does not moot
the suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle agreed, saying, ``We are particularly concerned with these
restrictive contracts with online services.''
</P>
<P>
   Houck and other attorneys general also said that they would
alter their method of litigating another part of the case that most
resembles the ``bundling'' charge in the earlier federal suit. In
the first suit, the Justice Department accused Microsoft of
violating a provision of antitrust law that regulates ``tying'' _
the bundling of one product with another as a condition of
licensing the more popular product _ in this case tying Internet
Explorer to Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court ruling was framed around the tying provision.
But Houck said the plaintiffs would press the new case using a part
of the law that regulates monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the law, monopolists are less free to engage in certain
behaviors, including this sort of behavior,'' Houck said. ``If the
Appeals Court decision holds, then the courts have abdicated any
responsibility for regulating the software industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the
attorneys general and federal lawyers had accumulated far more
evidence against Microsoft for their new case than the Justice
Department had gathered in its earlier case.

LAW PROFESSOR IN MICROSOFT CASE SAYS HE WAS MISINTERPRETED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal antitrust lawyers aren't the only ones who have taken
issue withlast week's federal appeals court ruling in favor of
Microsoft Corp. The decision has also drawn fire from a Harvard Law
School professor who says the court based its ruling in part on a
misinterpretation of his writings.
</P>
<P>
   Einer Elhauge said that the court last week erred in throwing
out an injunction ordering Microsoft to provide computer makers a
version of its Windows 95 operating system that does not contain
the Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Washington had issued the injunction at the
behest of the U.S. Justice Department. Federal attorneys argued
that Microsoft had violated a 1995 antitrust consent decree by
forcing computer makers to use Internet Explorer in order to obtain
Windows 95. The decree barred Microsoft from forcing companies to
buy one Microsoft product as a condition for buying another
product, a practice known as ``tying.''
</P>
<P>
   But a three-judge appeals panel ruled 2-1 that Microsoft's
actions did not violate the consent decree, because Internet
Explorer is an integrated part of Windows 95, and not a separate
product.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court based its ruling on a standard treatise in
antitrust law, written in part by Elhauge. In an op-ed piece in
Monday's New York Times, Elhauge said the court had misread his
analysis in deciding whether Microsoft had violated the consent
decree.
</P>
<P>
   Elhauge argues that since any consumer can combine Windows 95
and Internet Explorer as well as Microsoft can, the two should be
treated as separate products. The appeals court said Microsoft, by
combining the two products, created a new integrated product that
was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got wrong the interpretation of the legal standard,'' he
said. ``It's a fairly subtle misinterpretation,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He noted Microsoft faces a similar antitrust complaint in a
larger case filed last month by the US Justice Department and 20
states, thus giving the federal courts a chance to rethink the
issue.

 Fast Fall For Maker Of Myst  
 By Dan Fost   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For longtime fans of Broderbund Software, last week's
acquisition by The Learning Co. wasn't just another merger.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co. represents everything Broderbund was not: A big
mean merchandising machine. Where Broderbund, the last independent
maker of multimedia, built its reputation on innovation, The
Learning Co. has grown to its mega-status by swallowing companies
whole and undercutting the competition.
</P>
<P>
   That undercutting was among the factors on which Broderbund
blamed its unprofitability. Indeed, it's one of the reasons
Broderbund executives finally took the desperate measure of
shopping the company, and selling it at what many in the industry
saw as the bargain price of $420 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a shame to see things end up this way for
Broderbund,'' said Eric Winkler, Broderbund's former marketing
communications director, who now is director of marketing for IBM's
Edmark division in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the same sad feeling as someone saying goodbye to a
longtime friend. It took (founder) Doug Carlston and (former
president) Bill McDonagh 18 years to build what was a special
place. To see it go to anyone less than a Disney and at a price
that is so far below the value Wall Street placed on the company
just a year ago doesn't seem to do those 18 years justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler recalled a company heyday in which children of employees
filled the halls, employees brought their dogs to work and Friday
get-togethers built a sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   In another irony, in Broderbund's prime, it nearly bought The
Learning Co. That was only two years ago, an eternity in the
consumer software trade. At the time, The Learning Co. was a
smaller, Fremont-based entity.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund had offered $440 million for The Learning Co. at that
time, a whopping sum _ nearly nine times The Learning Co.'s
revenues. It lost out when Cambridge, Mass.-based SoftKey
International made a hostile $606 million bid. SoftKey changed its
name to The Learning Co. when it completed the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to those overheated days, The Learning Co. last
month agreed to buy Broderbund for an estimated $420 million, or
roughly the company's revenues plus its cash.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Carlston, a Harvard lawyer, founded Broderbund with his
brother Gary in 1980. In the early years, it was a games company,
but it soared to great heights with Where in the World is Carmen
Sandiego? educational software. Doug Carlston also acquired The
Print Shop, which became another Broderbund mainstay. In the 1990s,
Broderbund scored another hit when it published Myst, a quirky
computer game that went on to top the all-time sales charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broderbund basically invented the connection between good
product and good brand in our industry,'' Learning Co. Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Michael Perik said in a conference call to
analysts when the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund stock soared in those years, topping $70 before it
fell into a long slow decline. It had fallen as low as $15 a share
this month, finally rebounding on the acquisition rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech landscape has changed drastically from
Broderbund's early days as a barn-burner. Several factors hurt the
company, analysts say:
</P>
<P>
   _It was late to recognize the significance of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _It depended too much on its old hits. ``Myst is still
incredibly successful, but that's more luck than anything they did
on their part,'' said Andrea Williams, an analyst with Volpe Brown
Whelan and Co. in San Francisco. ``You can't be a one-hit wonder
and survive. At least, you can't survive for long on your past
successes.''
</P>
<P>
   _It just couldn't compete in the new land of the software
giants. The Learning Co. and Cendant, in their war to build market
share, offered rebates of as much as the entire price of individual
software titles.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund officials long complained about the pain such tactics
inflicted. Ultimately, analyst David Cole figures they decided,
``If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   When it competed against The Learning Co., Broderbund always
pointed to the quality of its products. Even at the merger
announcement, Broderbund CEO Joe Durrett said the deal brings
``great distribution, execution and management skills to what I
think is arguably one of best sets of evergreen titles the software
industry's ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice he didn't say anything about joining The Learning Co.'s
strong lineup of titles. ``The original SoftKey was known for
shovelware,'' analyst Cole said, using a derogatory industry term
for software that's crammed into boxes and sold before it can be
polished to a higher quality.

   If you have an e-mail account, you may have chuckled over one of
these ditties.
</P>
<P>
   Call them Web witticisms if you will, because there's really no
name for them. They're amusing little electronic tidbits that
ricochet all over the Internet as recipients guffaw and e-mail them
on to their pals.
</P>
<P>
   Where do they come from? Who knows? Where did the first
``knock-knock'' joke come from?
</P>
<P>
   So in case you've missed them, or if you're not yet part of the
computer revolution, here are some especially wacky ones:
</P>
<P>
   - You can't trust dogs to watch your food.
</P>
<P>
   - If corn oil comes from corn, where does baby oil come from?
</P>
<P>
   - Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead
of me, for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either, just
leave me alone!
</P>
<P>
   - Time is what keeps everything from happening at once.
</P>
<P>
   - When you find yourself getting irritated with someone, try to
remember that all men are brothers _ and just give them a noogie.
</P>
<P>
   - Puppies still have bad breath after eating a TicTac.
</P>
<P>
   - Why do they call it a TV set when you only get one?
</P>
<P>
   - Follow your dreams! Unless it's the one where you're at work
in your underwear during a fire drill.
</P>
<P>
   - Never hold a Dustbuster and a cat at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   - Give me ambiguity or give me something else.
</P>
<P>
   - If you don't like my driving, don't call anyone. Just take
another road. That's why the highway department made so many of
them.
</P>
<P>
   - Never sneeze when someone is cutting your hair.
</P>
<P>
   - What was the best thing before sliced bread?
</P>
<P>
   - This land is your land, this land is my land. So stay on your
land!
</P>
<P>
   - Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   - Never ask your 3-year-old brother to hold a tomato.

LEADING BUSINESS GROUP CALLS YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEM `HUGE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MARK HELM   
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling the year 2000 computer glitch a potential
``disaster in the making,'' the National Association of
Manufacturers on Tuesday accused President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore of failing to make the problem a national
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the NAM, a lobbying group
representing 14,000 businesses, said at a news conference here that
many U.S. companies will not have enough time to fix the computer
glitch by Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a large, global disaster in the making,'' he said of the
problem, which experts warn will occur when computers originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year will
fail or malfunction on that date because they will think the year
is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Janinowski said Clinton and Gore, who often handles technology
issues for the administration, have neglected the issue and called
on them to increase public awareness of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we, both in the business community and in the country as
a whole, need is leadership at the national level, and we simply
have not seen it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, administration officials said the president and vice
president were both concerned about the problem and were doing
everything possible to help solve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that the president holds as a high priority,
and he has stressed that to all the government agency heads,'' said
Jack Gribben, spokesman for the President's Council on the Year
2000 Problem.
</P>
<P>
   Janinowski also said the problem is being made worse by the
reluctance of most companies to disclose what progress they have
made toward solving it. He said the companies are holding back
information on their efforts because they fear it could be used
against them in future lawsuits stemming from the glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are worried that plaintiff lawyers will say, `Look,
the company's own information shows they weren't going to have this
problem fixed in time; so they must be guilty,''' Janinowski said.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Congress to enact legislation that offers companies
some legal protection in return for full disclosure of their
efforts to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we get complete information on where companies are at
on this problem, we as a country risk large-scale disruptions in
our economy,'' Janinowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, has introduced legislation that
would require companies to disclose what they have done to solve
the problem and what work they have left to do. But his bill does
not provide companies legal protection for giving the information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The millions of people out there putting their money into
these companies have a right to know if they're prepared or not,
and those companies have an obligation to tell them,'' Bennett said
at a Senate hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Janinowski's call for legal protection came on the heels of
recent announcements by computer consulting branches of the giant
accounting firms Deloitte &AMP; Touche and Price Waterhouse that they
will not accept new clients seeking Year 2000 help. Both units have
listed fear of lawsuits as a reason for scaling back their
operations.

ROCKWELL TO CUT 3,800 JOBS AND SPIN OFF CHIP UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rockwell International Corp.'s transformation to
commercial electronics from the military business suffered a
setback Monday when the company announced that it would spin off
its semiconductor division to shareholders, cut 3,800 jobs and take
a pretax charge of $625 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, which made the B-1 bomber and the Space Shuttle, had
been counting on the electronics business, which it saw as fast
growing and glamorous, to carry it into the future. Rockwell had
sold its military and aerospace businesses to Boeing Co. in 1996
for $3.2 billion and spun off its auto parts business last year
into a publicly traded company, Meritor Automotive Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But while fast-growing, electronics, particularly
semiconductors, can be extremely volatile. Rockwell, which is based
in Costa Mesa, Calif., had been buffeted by plunging prices and
slower than expected sales growth for personal computer modems, for
which it is a major supplier of chips.
</P>
<P>
   Losses in the semiconductor division and pressure from
shareholders led Rockwell to conclude that it did not have the
stomach after all for boom and bust cycles and that the chip
business did not mesh that well with its other, somewhat more
predictable, businesses _ industrial automation equipment and
avionics.
</P>
<P>
   ``These really are different businesses,'' Don H. Davis,
chairman and chief executive, said today in an interview. Asked why
Rockwell had not seen that a year ago, he pointed to the modem
market. ``We saw prices drop significantly more than we ever
thought they would at the time and that changes the dynamics of the
whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the losses in its chip division, Rockwell's
largest business, it is experiencing flat sales, in part because of
the economic problems in Asia. While its avionics business remained
strong, Rockwell said it would report lower than expected profits
for the third fiscal quarter, which ends Tuesday, the second
consecutive quarter in which it has had earnings below estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the special charge, Davis said, earnings for the
quarter were expected to be 30 cents a share, including the
semiconductor business. But counting only continuing operations,
earnings will be 45 cents a share compared with 56 cents in last
year's third quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of about 68
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for continuing operations will be about $1.7 billion, up 5
percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year, the company expected earnings a share from
continuing operations of $2.30 compared with last year's $2.12, on
sales of about $6.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the sluggish earnings, Davis, a company veteran
who took over as chief executive last October and as chairman in
February, Monday announced a major corporate overhaul, which he
predicted will result in pretax savings of $100 million in fiscal
1999 and $200 million annually starting in 2001. Investors greeted
the announcements with cautious optimism as the stock, which has
fallen much of this year, climbed 56.25 cents, to $49.
</P>
<P>
   Lior Bregman, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer, said that
Rockwell resisted divesting its chip business at a time when it
could have been sold for a high price. Now, ``they are doing it out
of weakness rather than strength.'' He also speculated that the
avionics or automation business might be divested at some point in
the future because they did not seem to fit together well either.
</P>
<P>
   The worker cutbacks, primarily in the automation business,
amounted to more than 9 percent of the 41,000 Rockwell employees
not in the semiconductor business. The chip division, which has
7,000 employees, is likely to have its own revamping later, though
officials said there will not be too many layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The $625 million charge included $275 million of intangible
asset writeoffs and goodwill mainly related to the company's
Reliance Electric motor business and $160 million for severance
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The new semiconductor company, which does not yet have a name,
will have revenues of about $1.3 billion, making it a midsized chip
company.
</P>
<P>
   The chip division had been a part of Rockwell for about 30
years. But it became a significant part of the company only in the
last few years, with the divestiture of the aerospace and auto
business, and with the boom in the sale of modems because of the
popularity of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the semiconductor division tripled from $530 million in
fiscal 1993 to $1.59 billion in fiscal 1996 before leveling off in
1997. Modem chips account for about half the division's sales.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers had been hesitant to buy modems because of a
format battle that erupted last year between Rockwell and a rival,
U.S. Robotics, which is now part of the 3Com Corp. Even though they
have now agreed on a standard for the new modems, operating at 56
kilobits a second, sales have not fully recovered and prices have
remained weak.

INTEL BETTING ON `WARRIOR PRINCESS' CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAN FOST   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp. thinks it has found a savior to help carry the
company out of its slow-growth doldrums: Xeon, or as one analyst
calls it, ``the warrior princess chip.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the Pentium II Xeon, which Intel officially starts
shipping to customers today, could add $1.5 billion to $3 billion
to Intel's revenues this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the growth Intel has going forward will be from these
chips,'' said Nathan Brookwood, a microprocessor analyst with
Dataquest in San Jose. ``This is really central to the company's
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   With Xeon (pronounced zee-on), the world's largest chipmaker
moves firmly into the high-end market. The new chip will run
servers and workstations, powerful computers used to manage
Internet traffic, large databases and fancy graphics applications.
</P>
<P>
   The chip should spur new competition between Intel customers and
IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and other makers of big
corporate computers who use a different kind of chip.
</P>
<P>
   Although Intel already supplies chips for some servers and
workstations, Xeon gives it a new capability. Instead of selling
chips for computers that cost $2,000 to $10,000 _ a market Intel
now dominates, according to Peter Kastner, an analyst with the
Boston-based Aberdeen Group _ Intel will now move into servers that
start at $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of money can chase the chip blues away. And Intel's
had plenty of blues lately _ a year of flat growth, slow sales in
Asia and an antitrust prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Even Intel's vaunted technology came into some question, as the
Santa Clara giant announced a delay in its next generation of
high-end chips, Merced.
</P>
<P>
   For a fleeting moment last week, Xeon looked like it might have
caught the same bug. Word leaked out that when ultra-powerful
computers tried to run four Pentium II Xeons at once, a flaw was
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel says such ``errata'' are routine, and while this one
will delay certain high-end computers several weeks, it won't stop
today's official launch of Xeon. Intel is working on a set of
software instructions to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the most complex devices on the planet,'' said Intel
spokesman Bill Calder. ``There are 7.5 million transistors now on a
single piece of silicon smaller than the size of your thumbnail.
... We test, we check, we validate all the time. You can't possibly
have a perfect chip. All processors have errata.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger challenge for the Pentium II Xeon will be beating
some established competition in the high-end market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xeon is just a Pentium chip,'' said Jeff O'Neal of Sun
Microsystems, group marketing manager for products made with Sun's
Sparc chips _ one of Xeon's chief competitors. ``It's desktop
technology trying to play in the enterprise market. It looks from
this perspective like Pentium's last gasp. How far can they push a
20-year-old architecture?''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's customers don't see it that way. Kevin Joyce, director
of product marketing for Sequent, an Oregon company that makes
servers that cost from $50,000 to more than $1 million, said the
400 megahertz speed of the Pentium II Xeon beats Sun's speeds.
Sun's chips are based on RISC architecture, or reduced instruction
set computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel, which has been lagging RISC performance, makes it clear
they are capable of delivering processors that out-perform RISC,''
Joyce said.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest's Brookwood said the companies buying high-end servers
and workstations want the best performance available, and they're
willing to spend what it takes to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Intel notes that for its customers, the price-for-performance
equation improves with Xeon. Since 1996, Intel has sold the Pentium
Pro for big corporate computers. But last fall, Intel announced
that it was coming up with new names for its chips. It released the
Celeron for the sub-$1,000 PC market, and now it launches Xeon for
the high end.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium II Xeon will sell for $1,124 to $2,800 _ a much
higher price than the desktop Celerons but comparably priced to the
Pentium Pro. Jonathan Joseph, analyst with NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco, said he expects Intel to sell 1
million Xeon chips this year and 6 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   While PC sales have slowed, server and workstation sales are
soaring. Big servers are needed to keep up with the soaring growth
of the Internet. Big software programs require more-powerful
processors to run them.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's market clout, and its ability to run the increasingly
popular Windows NT operating system, give it a huge edge as it
moves into the high-priced arena, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Will Xeon push Intel out of the chip industry slump? Not by
itself. ``Intel's problems have largely been a result of a slowdown
in the PC market,'' analyst Joseph said. ``Intel now represents the
PC market. It's got 90 percent of that market. If prices are under
pressure, Intel will feel that pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Xeon, Joseph said, will only account for 5 to 10 percent of
Intel's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   While Intel won't say how much it expects to make from the chip,
it concedes that Xeon alone won't restore the phenomenal growth it
enjoyed until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never is a silver bullet,'' said John Miner, Intel vice
president and general manager of the enterprise services group. ``A
nice portfolio of products allows us to ride the ups and downs of
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Xeon was two years in the works, Miner noted.
</P>
<P>
   The name Xeon, like Pentium and Celeron before it, is the
concoction of Sausalito-based Lexicon Branding. Lexicon coined the
word after much effort, looking for something that adhered to
Pentium's Greek roots but also would give it a forward look.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``x'' at the front, Lexicon President and founder David
Placek said, the name evokes ``the next generation.'' With ``eon''
meaning a period of time, ``It all came together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, a coined name can be the most effective route for
you,'' Placek said. ``We have found, when you have a new product
and you put a newly created word like `Xeon' on it, that says,
`Hey, this is new.' ''

MANY FRENCH ARE PASSING UP LONG EXTRA-MARITAL AFFAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French husbands are abandoning the once-accepted
institution known here as the ``five-to-seven,'' referring to the
early evening hours they spent with their mistresses before
returning home for dinner with their families.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of time and money has gradually obliterated the practice,
says sociologist Michel Piatte of Paris University. In fact, he
adds, while the French may still engage in the occasional
extra-marital fling, men have been forced by changing times to give
up what Piatte calls ``institutionalized infidelity'' engaged in as
a matter of course by their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``French men take lovers but no longer keep mistresses,'' he
explained. ``There is an important distinction between the two.''
Lovers are temporary; mistresses are long-term.
</P>
<P>
   None of this may rate headlines, but it probably should.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing less than a social revolution, marking a
transformation in the relationship between the sexes here that was
centuries old.
</P>
<P>
   The five-to-seven was so commonplace even in the recent past
that it was employed as a plot device in countless novels, plays
and films. But writers don't evoke it any more, Piatte observed,
because ``it doesn't reflect French life now. It's something from
another era.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern economic conditions and heavy traffic have proved fatal
to the five-to-seven,'' Piatte noted. ``At five o'clock, people are
still at their desks. When they finally leave their offices, they
are likely to face an hour in traffic jams. There is simply not
enough time for a few relaxing hours'' of hanky-panky.
</P>
<P>
   The five-to-seven, which started declining about a decade ago,
assumed that there was a long-lasting liaison, something
increasingly rare these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mistress was usually supported in a material sense,'' Piatte
said. ``Her apartment was paid for by the man in her life as were
her clothes. She was what used to be referred to as a kept woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Most French women now refuse to be put in such a humiliating and
dependent position, according to political analyst Anne Kreibel.
What's more, she added, the acquiescent wife no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wives are no longer content to keep dinner warm wondering when
their spouses will turn up,'' Kreibel said.
</P>
<P>
   But Raoul Chautemps, an author of several books on French social
history, argues that the transformation has really been the work of
the tax system. It costs a lot to maintain a second household, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is that tax officials will discover that someone is
keeping a mistress and will start looking for hidden income,''
Chautemps said. ``In the old days, nobody in France worried about
that because tax evasion was easy. Now it is anything but. As with
so many other matters, it is the tax collector who has changed the
way people live.''

BIZARRE MURDER SHOWS DIRE SHORTCOMINGS IN NEW YORK LAW

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Yakov Gluzman wanted his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   He was a world-class cancer researcher _ a brilliant,
$170,000-a-year scientist who'd emigrated to America from the
Soviet Union, by way of Israel. For 25 years, he'd been married to
Rita Gluzman, a chemist, and he wanted out of that marriage.
</P>
<P>
   So Yakov moved out. He left Rita in their fancy house in Saddle
River, N.J., and moved into an apartment near his laboratory in
Rockland County, N.Y. For the next year and a half, Rita would
visit him.
</P>
<P>
   They continued a physical relationship, but Yakov held firm. He
still wanted a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Furious, Rita enlisted the aid of her cousin, Vladimir Zelinin.
He was in this country illegally, a refugee from Kyrgyzstan in
south-central Asia. Help me kill Yakov, Rita told him, or back to
Kyrgyzstan you go. OK, said Vladimir.
</P>
<P>
   One Saturday night about two years ago, Rita and Vladimir
sneaked into Yakov's apartment in Rockland County. When Yakov came
in, they killed him with an ax. They then moved his corpse to the
bathtub and cut it into 68 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Yakov's remains went into plastic garbage bags, which went into
the trunk of Vladimir's car. He was to dump what used to be Yakov
into the Raritan River behind a little industrial park in East
Rutherford, N.J. Rita Gluzman knew the neighborhood. She operated a
computer components business in that industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Only, as Vladimir was feeding Yakov to the fishes, an East
Rutherford cop came cruising by and asked him what he was doing.
Growing up in Kyrgyzstan, Vladimir had developed a healthy terror
of uniformed men with guns. He spilled his guts to the cops,
implicating Rita.
</P>
<P>
   Since the murder had taken place in Rockland County, the case
ended up in the hands of the district attorney there, a guy named
Michael Bongiorno. But Bongiorno realized that he had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   He had Vladimir cold. Vladimir had, after all, been caught with
all those pieces of Yakov, and he'd confessed. But prosecuting Rita
was another proposition entirely.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the murder, Rita and Vladimir had cleaned
Yakov's apartment pretty thoroughly. There was physical evidence
that Rita had been in the place, but none that she'd been there on
the night of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   All Bongiorno had going for him in prosecuting Rita was
Vladimir's confession. And, in the wonderful, compassionate state
of New York, you can't convict somebody on the uncorroborated word
of an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   Bongiorno had no case against Rita _ not under the laws of the
Empire State.
</P>
<P>
   But Rita had made one big mistake. She'd sent Vladimir across a
state line to dispose of the body. That meant that the U.S.
attorney could act. And federal courts do permit conviction on the
uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   So, the feds moved in and prosecuted Rita under a federal
statute called the Violence Against Women Act. The law was designed
to nail wife-beaters who cross state line to batter their spouses.
Both Rita and Vladimir were convicted and sent to federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   This bizarre and macabre story is detailed in a fascinating new
book, ``Severed Relations,'' by New York author Tim Hays. It's a
chilling, captivating true crime story, but it's something else as
well. It's a story that points out that, in its treatment of
criminals, New York offers a level of protection well beyond what
the U.S. Constitution and common sense requires.
</P>
<P>
   Yakov Gluzman was murdered in a particularly vicious way. And if
Rita Gluzman had ordered her cousin to dump those 68 body parts in
the Hudson rather than in a river across a state line, New York
prosecutors couldn't have touched her.
</P>
<P>
   Am I the only guy who sees something seriously screwed up here?
</P>

LAX FOOD SAFETY COULD SPOIL THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Kathy Felt learned an unexpected lesson in
graduate school four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Money was tight, food was scarce and a knish on the kitchen
counter wasn't going to last long with her roommates. So she ate
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was way before I knew anything about food safety and when
I was a hungry graduate student,'' Felt said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the knish, a baked dumpling, had been left
unrefrigerated several hours. Long enough to cultivate the kind of
bacteria that sickens thousands of people every year.
</P>
<P>
   Felt, now 27, remembers the nausea. Then the diarrhea. The next
several hours blurred in the bathroom. ``I was just violently,
violently ill,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Felt is a program assistant at Cooperative Extension of
Albany County, where she tries to keep others from making the same
mistake by passing along tips on food safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only the bacteria were visible so people could see it, that
would be interesting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This July 4th weekend, food-borne illnesses will be waiting for
a chance to spoil picnics and parties.
</P>
<P>
   Not to ruin your appetite, but consider deviled eggs, chicken
salad and hamburgers. That's a menu of potential problems like
salmonella, staph and E. coli contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
estimates that E. coli, found in some hamburger meat, is
responsible for 20,000 illnesses and 400 deaths a year.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Tom Gallagher, a former meat inspector, will
stand guard at the picnic he's helping to host this weekend in
Albany County.
</P>
<P>
   If people put out the salads too early for lunch, he'll stick
them back in the cooler. As a general rule, two hours
unrefrigerated is the limit for picnic foods. If the sun is shining
on your table, an hour tops.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, a Cooperative Extension agent, is especially careful
about meats. Before he slaps the hot dogs and hamburgers on the
grill, he'll use a wire brush to remove any leftovers from the
picnic a week ago. To keep meat from sticking, he sprays on Pam.
</P>
<P>
   The key to a healthy burger is making sure it's well-cooked,
brown in the middle with no pink juices. Gallagher's pet peeve is
the platter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think nothing of bringing out a platter of meat,
cooking it up and putting it back on the same platter with the raw
juices on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though tempted, he keeps his mouth shut. Nothing ruins a party
faster than talk about bacteria. ``Generally, I don't say anything.
I'll go and rinse it off.''

<P>
   Two and a half years ago China and the United States stumbled
into a military confrontation that neither had sought or
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in retrospect, the March 1996 face-off between U.S.
aircraft carriers and Chinese warships and land-based missiles may
have had a salutary effect. The crisis reminded both countries of
the stake each has in positive relations with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two governments have worked hard to establish a
respectful dialogue about a range of bilateral and international
issues. Summits and other high-level meetings are once again a
regular feature of Sino-American diplomacy, and there have been no
further military confrontations in the Taiwan area.
</P>
<P>
   Until President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in
June 1995, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland had been moving toward
mutual accommodation through informal economic and cultural
exchanges and dialogue. On both sides of the strait there was a
consensus on the ideal of ``one China'' and the imperative of
realizing it through some form of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   This consensus, endorsed by the United States, kept the peace
and fostered an atmosphere conducive to negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   But again the consensus has collapsed. Taiwan seems convinced it
can campaign for independence with the military backing of the
United States. If war is to be prevented, Washington must convince
Taipei as well as Beijing that it is time for them to work out a
mutually acceptable relationship.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has underscored the U.S. interest in resolving
the Taiwan question by peaceful rather than violent means. Yet most
American observers, including most members of Congress, have drawn
a lesson that the prospect of U.S. military intervention can deter
a Chinese attack on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders have always said they would go to war to prevent
the permanent division of China. They now believe that they are
likely to have to do so. China's armed forces have begun a
decade-long effort to acquire the capabilities to overwhelm
Taiwan's formidable defenses.
</P>
<P>
   If a demonstrated ability to do this proves insufficient to
dissuade Taiwan from separation, China's armed forces expect to
receive an order to invade the island, notwithstanding the risk of
conflict with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) displays
of force that followed Lee's visit to the United States stimulated
fear and dislike of the mainland and accelerated the demise of
popular support for reunification. The sudden arrival of U.S.
aircraft carriers halted any conciliatory moves toward Beijing. It
convinced the leaders of Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties
that they could count on U.S. intervention to shield them.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has attempted to shake this
conviction through quiet dialogue with Taiwan. But its leaders put
much more credence in the unqualified public statements of support
they hear from majorities in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's leaders make no secret of their belief that, whatever
the cause of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait, U.S. congressional
pressure would quickly overwhelm a reluctant Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   And so Taiwanese politicians have concluded that they have wide
latitude to reject reunification and to maneuver the island toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's Kuomintang (KMT) still pays lip service to reunification,
saying that it might be considered when and if the Chinese mainland
democratizes. Hsu Hsin-liang's opposition Democratic Progressive
Party flatly opposes reunification under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
embraced the concept of ``one China'' _ although they disagreed, of
course, on which was the legitimate regime.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, cross-strait trade was worth about $26.5 billion a
year. About 35,000 Taiwanese companies had invested $30 billion in
the PRC. Nearly 1.5 million visits _ the vast majority of them from
Taiwan to the Chinese mainland _ were being made each year. The
steady relaxation of tensions included minor steps to facilitate
the exchange of mail and trade across the strait.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing and Taipei also established a regular channel of
communication between citizens' groups, or ``nongovernmental''
organizations, to handle discussions with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Lee now asserts that the Republic of China, first established in
1912 by Sun Yat-sen, is still a sovereign independent nation whose
territory is limited to Taiwan and its offshore islands, and
entitled to international recognition as such.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's efforts to redefine itself as a sovereign nation-state
distinct from the PRC have been backed by well-financed ``pragmatic
diplomacy'' aimed at changing the global context of the Taiwan
question and raising the island's profile. Taipei has used economic
grants to persuade developing countries to recognize it as a state
separate from the PRC and to support its campaign to gain a seat at
the United Nations and other world groups.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, Taipei cannot join international
organizations unless Beijing agrees. Beijing was willing to
compromise on this issue when Taipei's membership was consistent
with the principle of ``one China.'' Taipei's new insistence on
independence has made additional compromises unacceptable to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a flag and other symbols of nationhood, it is difficult
to see what Taiwan would gain from formal separation from China.
Nor, truth be told, would Beijing gain much from reunification.
Mainland China is already benefiting from Taiwan's economic
know-how and financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Taiwan accept Lee's redefinition of the status quo and
see no reason to return to a view of the status quo as ``one China,
even if not now.'' In short, Taiwan's domestic politics now makes
it difficult for its leaders to address Beijing's reunification
agenda, even if they wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's political establishment does not want to appear to be
against talks across the strait because that would not sit well
with the United States or Japan. The problem is that Taiwanese
public opinion will only permit talks with Beijing about how to
preserve and enhance Taiwan's separation from China. Taiwan's
leaders know that Beijing cannot accept such a premise for talks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the 1950s, there is a real danger that
decisions in Taipei, not just Beijing, could ignite a conflict in
the Taiwan Strait. The United States, as well as both Chinese
parties, would be a loser in any such conflict, whether American
forces joined it or not.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy can no longer hope to deter war exclusively by
keeping Beijing at bay. The United States must also discourage
decisions and actions by Taipei that could leave Beijing with
little choice but to react militarily.
</P>
<P>
   But such a policy cannot be implemented if Congress and the
administration remain at odds. A serious effort to forge a national
consensus on policy toward China, including Taiwan, is overdue. The
United States should state unequivocally that it will not support
or endorse any unilateral change in Taiwan's status by either
Beijing or Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   The rising military tensions in the Taiwan Strait also call for
a reevaluation of arms sales to Taiwan. In the 1982 Sino-American
communique, China pledged ``to strive for a peaceful solution to
the Taiwan question.'' In return the United States promised to cap
the quantity and sophistication of its arms sales to Taiwan,
``leading to a final resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot hold Beijing to its word if Americans
do not keep theirs. The sale of 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan in 1992
and some subsequent deals do not square with the 1982 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is now wavering in its determination to stick with a
policy of peaceful resolution of its differences with Taipei. How
much of this wavering is due to U.S. noncompliance with the 1982
communique and how much to Taipei's new opposition to reunification
is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan no longer work
to boost Taipei's confidence that it can work out its differences
with Beijing. Instead, they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its
own way, regardless of history, geography and the views of Chinese
across the strait. This is not the message the United States should
be sending Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   That is why at a minimum the United States should return to
strict compliance with Ronald Reagan's 1982 understanding with Deng
Xiaoping and insist that Beijing do likewise. And as the United
States considers further arms sales to Taiwan, it should weigh
their impact on Taipei's intentions and behavior as well as
Beijing's.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest strengths of Taiwan's 22 million people are their
superior political and economic systems, not their capacity to
outspend, outarm or outfight the nearly 1.3 billion Chinese across
the strait _ with or without backing from U.S. forces. Taiwan's
security depends, in the end, on its ability to work out a mutually
satisfactory relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is no longer the central actor in cross-strait
relations, but its words and actions continue to shape their
context.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should return to a focus on the most important
interest of the Taiwan question _ ensuring that it is resolved
peacefully, by mutual accommodation, rather than in war.
</P>
<P>
   The regular summit meetings on which China and the United States
have now embarked offers ample opportunity to do so.

the Taiwan Strait. The United States, as well as both Chinese
parties, would be a loser in any such conflict, whether American
forces joined it or not.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy can no longer hope to deter war exclusively by
keeping Beijing at bay. The United States must also discourage
decisions and actions by Taipei that could leave Beijing with
little choice but to react militarily.
</P>
<P>
   But such a policy cannot be implemented if Congress and the
administration remain at odds. A serious effort to forge a national
consensus on policy toward China, including Taiwan, is overdue. The
United States should state unequivocally that it will not support
or endorse any unilateral change in Taiwan's status by either
Beijing or Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   The rising military tensions in the Taiwan Strait also call for
a reevaluation of arms sales to Taiwan. In the 1982 Sino-American
communique, China pledged ``to strive for a peaceful solution to
the Taiwan question.'' In return the United States promised to cap
the quantity and sophistication of its arms sales to Taiwan,
``leading to a final resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot hold Beijing to its word if Americans
do not keep theirs. The sale of 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan in 1992
and some subsequent deals do not square with the 1982 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is now wavering in its determination to stick with a
policy of peaceful resolution of its differences with Taipei. How
much of this wavering is due to U.S. noncompliance with the 1982
communique and how much to Taipei's new opposition to reunification
is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan no longer work
to boost Taipei's confidence that it can work out its differences
with Beijing. Instead, they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its
own way, regardless of history, geography and the views of Chinese
across the strait. This is not the message the United States should
be sending Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   That is why at a minimum the United States should return to
strict compliance with Ronald Reagan's 1982 understanding with Deng
Xiaoping and insist that Beijing do likewise. And as the United
States considers further arms sales to Taiwan, it should weigh
their impact on Taipei's intentions and behavior as well as
Beijing's.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest strengths of Taiwan's 22 million people are their
superior political and economic systems, not their capacity to
outspend, outarm or outfight the nearly 1.3 billion Chinese across
the strait _ with or without backing from U.S. forces. Taiwan's
security depends, in the end, on its ability to work out a mutually
satisfactory relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is no longer the central actor in cross-strait
relations, but its words and actions continue to shape their
context.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should return to a focus on the most important
interest of the Taiwan question _ ensuring that it is resolved
peacefully, by mutual accommodation, rather than in war.
</P>
<P>
   The regular summit meetings on which China and the United States
have now embarked offers ample opportunity to do so.

DEMOCRACY ADVOCATES VOW CHANGE IN HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ A year after Britain turned its longtime colony over
to Chinese control, two outspoken democracy activists vow to push
the tempo of reform in Hong Kong's legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lee, Hong Kong's best-known democracy advocate, said in
his law office that he would introduce a motion calling for debate
on making the chief executive and entire Legislative Council
elected by popular vote. The newest council was sworn in Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's chief executive is picked by an 800-member election
committee; 20 of the legislature's 60 seats were popularly elected
in the May 24 election. Most of the other 40 seats are allocated to
conservative, pro-business members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We desire to increase the pace of democratization and the
changing of the Basic Law,'' said Lee, leader of the popular
Democratic Party. Of Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa, Lee
added, ``They are very consistent in making sure our numbers are
reduced everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Basic Law has been Hong Kong's constitution since the island
and the adjoining New Territories became part of China on July 1,
1997, after more than 150 years of British rule. It specifies that
24 seats will be popularly elected in 2000, increasing to 30 seats
in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist government in Beijing would need to approve any
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said he believed democracy could be advanced more quickly,
even in the face of determined opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Taiwan,'' Lee said. ``Ten years ago, the people of
Taiwan were oppressed by the Kuomintang (nationalist party).
Indonesia more recently _ Suharto was given another five-year term,
or so he believed. Now, he is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Lau, the American-educated founder of The Frontier, a
2-year-old reform group, went further, saying she will call for a
constitutional convention to revise the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very well to go back to the Legislative Council and
debate,'' she said in her office located in a public housing
project. ``At the end of the day, we will be outvoted. That's not
enough. We need a mass meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to demonstrate to Beijing that we have the support of
the people,'' said Lau, who also favors a directly elected
legislature and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's secretary for constitutional affairs, Michael Suen,
said that Tung's administration believes democratization will
happen in due time. Holding a copy of the Basic Law, Suen said,
``It's all here. You need time to do this _ cautiously, gradually,
one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in the final years of British colonial rule did Hong Kong
residents gain a semblance of democracy, including a directly
elected Legislative Council. That was replaced by the new council
and the colonial governor was replaced by the chief executive, a
position that must ultimately answer to rulers in Beijing.

LEADERSHIP TURMOIL STIRS GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago the nation's 2 million Greek Orthodox cheered the
news that Metropolitan Spyridon had been chosen to be their new
archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, there is revolution within the Greek church,
with people who once supported Spyridon now formally demanding his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   What started last year as criticism by some church activists of
what they considered Spyridon's autocratic style, has ballooned
into a full-fledged attempt by many deep-pocketed Greek Orthodox,
including several in Boston, to force the archbishop to step down.
</P>
<P>
   It's an extraordinary display of public dissent that has
dismayed many Orthodox and non-Orthodox Christians. Some Orthodox
say the seriousness of the controversy is underscored by the makeup
of the dissident group, Greek Orthodox American Leaders, or GOAL.
The group's leaders are some of the most powerful church members;
at least 20 of GOAL's 54 leaders have each contributed $100,000 or
more to the Greek church over recent years, according to church
records and GOAL leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The archbishop fails to have an understanding of fundamental
American values _ freedom of expression, the dignity of the
individual and participatory decision-making,'' said Dr. Thomas
Lelon, executive director of GOAL and vice president and dean of
academic affairs at Nichols College in Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon, through a spokesman at the archbishop's headquarters
in New York, declined requests to be interviewed for this story.
But in an interview published in June in the official newspaper of
the Greek Archdiocese of America, he chastized his critics for
failing to put the good of the church ahead of their own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate that individuals have concerns and issues, and
even band together, but the church is not composed of parties and
lobbies,'' Spyridon told the Orthodox Observer. ``We are all
members of the Body of Christ. I hope we never forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   GOAL leaders have taken their campaign against Spyridon across
the country, trying to convince the rank and file that financial
mismanagement and a leadership style that devalues the laity should
cost the archbishop his job. So far, they have held meetings in 17
different cities, including Boston, where typically the meetings
are held by teleconference or in private homes. Their first meeting
was last November in Southborough, Mass. at a Nichols College
conference center.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  A showdown between Spyridon and his detractors could occur
early next month when the church's clergy and laity gather for
their biennial convention.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has tainted the Greek Orthodox Church, caused church
donations to drop, and left many to wonder whether Ecumencial
Patriarch Bartholomew, who appointed Spyridon and is the spiritual
leader of the world's 300 million Orthodox, will intervene.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Orthodox church sources say, Bartholomew is
standing behind his embattled archbishop but is becoming
increasingly alarmed by the turmoil engulfing the church. Some GOAL
members and other church activists have personally appealed to
Bartholomew to oust Spyridon.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon's defenders say the archbishop is being victimized by
malcontents, unhappy with Spyridon's efforts to safeguard the
church's Orthodox integrity from changes to suit American tastes.
For instance, Spyridon has chafed at the decreasing use of Greek in
the liturgy, and the abandonment of Byzantine chanting in favor of
Christian hymns. His critics believe he is trying to impose Old
World customs on a modern American Greek church that has moved
beyond its Greek origins.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Spyridon supporters acknowledge he faces a series of
problems he must deal with if they are not to undermine his ability
to lead the church:
</P>
<P>
   _The church's flagship educational institution, Hellenic College
and Holy Cross School of Theology in Brookline, Mass., is under
investigation by two independent academic accrediting agencies
investigating whether academic standards were violated last year
when the president and three professors were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Some professors have told the Globe that the four priests were
fired for their refusal to cover up sexual misconduct by another
Greek Orthodox priest. Archdiocesan officials say the firings were
based on personality conflicts and had nothing to do with the
sexual misconduct, which occurred at a campus party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at least two professors have left the school in
recent weeks, according to two priests who work at the college. A
spokesman for the school could not be reached. The number of new
students entering Holy Cross for the September term is 25.
</P>
<P>
   _The Archdiocesan Council, the panel that helps Spyridon run the
church, has raised concerns in a report prepared by a special
committee about what they described as ``serious cash flow
problems'' in the church's finances, including the archbishop's
attempt to purchase a $1.4 million home without the council's
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Dimitriou resigned as the archdiocese's financial director
earlier this year. Church sources said it was because of
disagreements over the way church funds were being handled.
Attempts to reach Dimitriou last week were unsuccessful. Spyridon
abandoned his attempts to purchase a house, and aides say church
finances are being audited by an outside accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   _Priests in parishes in Massachusetts, Ohio, and California say
that Sunday collection box donations have dropped significantly in
the past few months. ``People who are disgusted by the direction of
the church's leaders are voting with their pocketbooks,'' said one
priest in a parish in Boston's western suburbs, who like seven
other priests interviewed for this story asked not to be identified
because they did not want to be linked publicly with the
controversy. Some supported Spyridon, others did not.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond issues of leadership style and financial management,
observers say the conflict between Spyridon and dissidents is also
a cultural clash.
</P>
<P>
   Though Spyridon was born in Ohio, he has spent most of his
adulthood in Greece and in Istanbul, where he has been shaped by a
strongly hierarchical and cleric-run church structure. Before his
appointment two years ago, he had lived many years in Italy,
serving as a priest and then as metropolitan.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the United States in 1996 and found a church that had
fully embraced American democratic values, where a premium had been
placed on giving laity a strong voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been puzzled that this commitment to Greek Orthodox
tradition has been misintepreted by some people as a negative
change, a `roll-back' or backward turning for our church,''
Spyridon told the Orthodox Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Spyridon's supporters recall that when he was appointed, it was
hoped he could help unite the 5 million Orthodox Christians in
America into a major religious force.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Methodios, bishop of the Greek Diocese of Boston,
said that Spyridon has endured a steep ``learning curve,'' and is
now trying to be more conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's becoming more tolerant of situations he can't
change as quickly as he wishes he could,'' Methodios said.

PERFORMANCES PROPEL WILD IRISH CRIME YARN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
I WENT DOWN 
Directed by: Paddy Breathnach 
Screenplay by: Conor McPherson 
Starring: Peter McDonald, Brendan Gleeson, Peter Caffrey, Tony
Doyle 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: R (pervasive strong language, some sexuality and violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I Went Down'' is an offbeat Irish gangster movie that
overcomes its meandering nature with engaging performances, an
avoidance of formula and, above all, its characters' way of making
us take everything personally _ as they certainly do. Protagonist
Peter McDonald, as a Dubliner named Git who isn't even a criminal
but did time for an inept petty crime committed by his foolish old
father, is able to convince us that most of what he does is
improvised as the mission he's pressured into undertaking never
goes as planned, insofar as there even is a plan.
</P>
<P>
   The most convincing thing Git does is simply stand there and not
say too much as, barely out of prison, he learns that his dumb
buddy has run afoul of their unfriendly neighborhood gang boss,
played with surly panache by Tony Doyle. The only way Git can
prevent his pal's fingers from bring broken, he's told, is to
hightail it into the country and bring back one of the boss's
associates, Frank, with 25,000 pounds that's also missing. To
insure Git's focus on the task at hand, the boss sends along one of
his thugs, a hapless oaf named Bunny (Brendan Gleeson), as driver
and backup.
</P>
<P>
   Once into enemy territory, with Bunny playing Hardy to Git's
Laurel, they run into the usual traps, betrayals and
double-crosses. Convincing us he's making it up as he goes along,
and is able to stay ahead of the local goons because they're even
slower-thinking than he is, Git finds their quarry imprisoned in a
houseful of armed men. Breaking in with Bunny, they remove the
sought-after Frank at gunpoint. Then things really start getting
complicated as Frank turns out to be the Sheherezade of Irish
crime, a glib con man who won't stop talking until he finds
something that'll get to Git and Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   He knows nothing about the missing money, Frank swears, adding
that their boss only wants to get back at him for having bedded the
boss's wife. What's clear is that there's something rancorous in
the shared past of both older criminals, and that Git and Bunny are
unlikely to learn the full truth of it. What's also clear that
Frank is about to wear them down, or at least numb them into
lowering their guard at precisely the point where they want it up.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the comic bumbling starts to wear thin, and it begins to
occur to the chocolate-munching Bunny that he's not destined to
become the next John Wayne, the film convulses on cue, leading us
back to the feuding older men. If the climax seems anticlimactic
and ordinary after what had been its zigzag wildness and mournfully
funny larkiness, it at least throws into relief the inventiveness
of most of what has gone before, including an endearing belief in
the saving grace of blarney as the lowlifes realize with more than
a twinge of regret that they're really not inhabiting an American
tough guy movie after all.

PIONEER GROUP: OLD LINE, NEW FRONTIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when many executives of retirement age are selling
their firms and repairing to the fairways, John F. Cogan Jr., 71,
is jogging through Siberian timber farms, inspecting African gold
mines in a dead-faint heat, and conversing with Kremlin chiefs
about foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   And that is when he is not eyeing new ways to get citizens in
former communist countries to buy mutual funds, or tending a stable
of US funds, one founded during the Roaring Twenties.
</P>
<P>
   Cogan, the irrepressible president of the Pioneer Group Inc., is
the Energizer bunny of the asset management world.
</P>
<P>
   Bowtied and spunky, he presides over a paradox. Pioneer, one of
the nation's oldest mutual fund companies, epitomizes the rarefied
Boston Brahmin culture that considers the art of managing money a
gentleman's endeavor. Yet it also boasts &UR;  &LR; a passel of assets in
some of the world's wildest emerging markets, boldly going where
traditional investors fear to tread. The company, whose $23 billion
in total assets make it a relatively small player in the mutual
fund world, began aggressively investing in emerging markets long
before they became fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Pioneer's eclectic collection of assets has led some
shareholders of the publicly traded Boston company to wonder if
Cogan has stretched his dealings too thin.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, investors are salivating at the prospect that
Cogan &UR;  &LR; _ who has run Pioneer for 35 years _ may sell off all or
part of the company &UR;  &LR; to cash in on the record prices that asset
management firms now command.
</P>
<P>
   More than seven decades after legendary investor Philip L. Caret
founded Pioneer with the then-novel idea of investing in
undervalued companies, what is perhaps the asset management world's
most idiosyncratic company is at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   With operations ranging from a core US fund business to timber
farms in the Russian Far East, a gold mine in Ghana, and funds and
ventures in the former Soviet bloc and Asia, Pioneer is literally
all over the map. So is the company's share price, which, after
quadrupling earlier this decade, has slumped. And so, too, is
Cogan, a Harvard-trained lawyer who mixes a rigorous globe-trotting
schedule for Pioneer with a practice at Hale and Dorr, a prominent
Boston law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for any reason I lost my energy level, I would want to
retire,'' says Cogan, blue eyes flashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see us remaining independent,'' he adds. But he notes that
is ``always a challenge'' given the temptingly high values of asset
management companies in a buoyant stock market.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Pioneer's main business is domestic mutual funds, &UR;  &LR; with
retirement money accounting for 40 percent of fund sales. But it is
the company's capital-intensive overseas doings that garner the
most attention _ and, sometimes, the greatest criticism from
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic fund business comprised 50 percent of the company's
1997 revenues of $343 million. While Russian financial services
contributed the next greatest chunk, 16 percent, other operations
abroad, including mutual funds, real estate and gold mining,
provided much slimmer revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Only three years ago, Pioneer's Teberebie Goldfields gold mine
in Ghana, &UR;  &LR; one of Africa's largest, generated most of the company's
profits. Since then, the operation has been tarnished by the lowest
bullion prices in 20 years and by power supply glitches, and the
mine has slipped into the red.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, where Pioneer runs a securities brokerage, a bank,
and some of the former Communist giant's first mutual funds,
turmoil stemming from Moscow's transition to a market economy has
depressed stock and debt markets and raised questions about
Russia's prospects for growth. Pioneer's Forest-Starma timber
operations in Siberia have been temporarily felled by collapsed
demand from Asia and moribund log prices. The troubles will hand
Pioneer a $10 million loss for the second quarter and have
depressed the company's already limp share price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It is not unusual for mutual fund companies to have subsidiary
assets _ Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest fund firm, has
telecommunications, real &UR;  &LR; estate, newspaper, and limousine
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of fund companies are now going overseas to tap into
the next investment frontier _ although few own and operate
physical assets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But some wonder if Pioneer should become less diversified to
compete in the burgeoning mutual fund business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cogan is brilliant, and he sees a lot of different
opportunities that others don't see,'' says &UR;  &LR; Michael S. Beall,
executive vice president of Davenport &AMP; Co., a financial services
firm in Richmond, that holds a 1.5 percent stake in Pioneer. ``I
think he sees too many for a company of his size. I just question
the efficiency of trying to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer faces more than volatility in commodities and emerging
markets. The value-style investing that made some of the company's
15 stock funds good performers in the last decade has been less
fruitful in today's market, which favors well-known, large-company
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Over 12 months through June 18, Pioneer funds have been erratic.
Returns at the company's Capital Growth fund, which invests in
lesser-known, underpriced companies, are less than half the 20.1
percent average of other such funds, according to fund tracking
firm &UR;  &LR; Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Returns at most other Pioneer
funds that buy ``value'' stocks are squarely in the middle or at
the bottom of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pioneer's Growth Shares fund, which buys large
company stocks, has soared over the same period, gaining 35.6
percent, compared with the average 20.1 percent. And the flagship
Pioneer fund, a growth and income fund started in 1928, rose 26.7
percent, nearly 8 percentage points above its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Not all is gloomy for the company. Last year Pioneer's revenue
rose 43 percent, to $343 million, mainly on record sales of its US
funds. Earnings rose 55 percent to $29.2 million. And the strong
stock market has more than doubled Pioneer's total assets in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   But redemptions of shares in Pioneer funds last year rose
sharply from &UR;  &LR; the previous year. The company was the first to set
foot in many foreign markets but now has a pack of competitors
nipping at its heels in the global race for investors' money. &UR;  &LR; As
the mutual fund and retirement assets businesses soar, Pioneer is
having to compete with larger fund houses with broader offerings
and more marketing muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Among analysts and shareholders, ``there is discussion now that
maybe they should try to sell off the mutual fund business,'' says
R. Bentley Offut, an analyst at Offut Securities in Hunt Valley,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, Pioneer as a whole could fetch as much as $1
billion, with Cogan, who owns 14 percent of the common stock and
even greater voting rights, pocketing at least $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, investors bought Pioneer stock on the strength of the
company's gold mine. Now, with production setbacks, analysts
speculate that Cogan may seek to &UR;  &LR; sell the gold interest. The
company tried but failed to spin off its gold-mining subsidiary in
1995. The plan was intended to raise cash to prospect new veins in
Africa and Russia, but it faltered because of &UR;  &LR; a drop in bullion
markets and pricing issues for the gold unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hate to take this world-class operation and give it
up in a fire sale,'' says Pioneer chief financial officer William
H. Keogh. But he acknowledges that shareholders have been concerned
about the mine's profitability.
</P>
<P>
   But to Cogan, whose company has been through everything from the
Great Depression to the 1980's Wall Street boom, &UR;  &LR; the mine is a
hedge against inflation designed to produce revenues when stocks
falter.
</P>
<P>
   While he still considers natural resources ``a natural fit'' for
the mutual fund company, he adds &UR;  &LR; that the mine's fate is ``an open
question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a fine line between patience and
stubbornness,'' Cogan says,``and I've always got to watch that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogan, who runs three to four miles daily, and who describes
himself as ``adventurous with a sense of protocol'', shows no
desire to retire soon from the company he has molded in his image.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, in training that foreshadowed &UR;  &LR;  his predilection for
the unconventional, Cogan was already looking eastward. In a
Harvard undergraduate thesis on the role of astrology in European
medieval medicine, he examined the influence of Byzantium.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing law school, he considered a practice in
California before joining Hale and Dorr, which counts Pioneer as a
client. In 1963, he bought Caret's interest in Pioneer, then an
old-line, blue-blood mutual fund house.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, at a time when no asset managers were looking
at foreign markets, Cogan registered Pioneer to sell US mutual
funds in Germany. After the Soviet bloc's collapse, he raced into
Russia and Eastern Europe to set up the region's first funds. None
of them produce big revenues yet. But many of them, especially in
Poland, have been quite successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cogan's probably the most complete one-man band I've ever
met,'' says David Silver, a former chairman of the Investment
Company Institute, a mutual fund industry trade group. (Cogan is an
ICI chairman and does much philanthropic work in Boston).
</P>
<P>
   Still, some shareholders carp that Cogan's capital-intensive,
long-term strategy inhibits short-term profits and that Pioneer
needs to ramp up its stock price, which has been more or less flat
since mid-1995. Now at 27 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange, it
is &UR;  &LR; down 1 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of love them and hate them,'' Beall says. ``I like a
lot of the things they have, but they can just wear me down. Jack
is a little too long term in his vision for some of us.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cogan, long term is precisely the point. Describing
Pioneer's future as increasingly overseas, he speaks of
a &UR;  &LR; potpourri of assets _ mutual funds for the Chinese, pension
schemes for Russians, and gold as a hedge against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many times along the way, people would say,
`Jack, don't spend your money on this _ why don't you just drop
it?'' he says, describing Pioneer's first forays oversees.
</P>
<P>
   But Cogan makes clear that much of Pioneer's future lies far
from his perch in downtown Boston. ``A lot of the play,'' he says,
``is going to be abroad.''

REFORMERS SAY THERE'S MUCH TO LEARN FROM JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To make teaching a more attractive profession to the smartest
college graduates, the model reformers cite most often is Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In a comprehensive comparison of 26 countries that prompted much
hand-wringing in this country last fall, Japan, like most of the
nations surveyed, outranked the United States in math and science
at three grade levels from elementary to high school.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the difference is cultural, but questions on the test
suggested some of the differences may be in the way the United
States trains and treats teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese teachers have larger classes than their US
counterparts, their students watch as much television, and spend
less time in school. Yet teachers there get more intensive
training, including a year residency in a school much like medical
residencies in the United States. They then take a highly
competitive exam, after which those who pass are placed in school
under the direction of a master teacher, who is assigned to counsel
young teachers for the year. In that year, teachers also spend 60
hours in special, school-based training sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Salaries are higher for beginning teachers, although they don't
rise as dramatically as salaries do here. And the profession is
much more competitive. Only one out of six teachers in training are
certified to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very selective,'' said Richard Murnane, professor of
education at Harvard and author of ``Who Will Teach?'' ``That means
you've got a profession people want to go into. Just raising
salaries is not a very effective way of getting better teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   And teachers have better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   They get 25 hours of preparation time for every 20 hours they
teach. US teachers, by comparison, get 8.3 minutes per hour of
teaching, according to the National Commission on Teaching and
America's Future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our general view of teaching is that if the teacher is not in
front of the classroom, she is not teaching,'' says Paul Reville,
the head of the Massachusetts Education Reform Review Commission,
set up to study the success of the 1993 school reform law. ``In
Japan, they spend a fair amount of their day with one another,
talking about student performance and talking about ways to improve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, says Richard Elmore, an education professor at
Harvard, is that we get what we demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers have higher status in every other industrialized
nation,'' Elmore says. ``Americans don't take the profession
seriously, they don't think it takes much skill to teach. So we
tend to get that level of skill.''

ELECTRONIC PRISONER BRACELETS HAVEN'T CAUGHT ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY R. DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Six months ago, Stephen C. would end his nights by
lifting himself off a barstool at closing time. Now, he rushes home
to beat his 6:30 p.m. curfew.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30 on most nights, he is fast asleep, curled up with a
book. &UR;  &LR; Any thoughts of slipping out are arrested by the black band
hugging his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even chance it,'' he said, bluntly. ``If I screw up I
go back to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen, a convicted drunk driver, is among a handful of
offenders in Massachusetts who serve time outside of prison,
strapped to an electronic bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic monitoring, widely viewed as tougher than probation
but less stringent than prison, has become known through such
celebrated cases as those of Raymond and Shirley Souza, the elderly
Lowell couple convicted in 1993 of raping their grandchildren, and
of Adalberto Bonilla, the Boston police officer who was arrested
last month on home-invasion charges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being a significantly cheaper and potentially
more-productive alternative to incarceration, they barely are being
used in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the lack of appeal range from a penchant among
prosecutors, attorneys, and judges to shun a newfangled device to
the weekly fees offenders must pay to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Poor public relations also may play a role. Criminal justice
experts have not yet extolled the virtues of home detention, and
state authorities seldom have chosen to use it on offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 46,000 adults on probation in Massachusetts, about 125
are beholden to the gadget. That contrasts with Michigan, which
uses electronic monitoring on 3,000 of its 52,222 probationers and
parolees, and North Carolina, which has bracelets on 750 of 92,456
such offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 24-hour-a-day sanction,'' said John F. Cremens Jr.,
Massachusetts' &UR;  &LR; first deputy commissioner of probation. ``We'd like
to see it used more.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic monitoring is available for people convicted of
nearly all offenses, but county-run programs tend to disqualify
violent offenders, sex offenders, and people serving mandatory
minimum drug sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Bracelet wearers can live at home, hold a job, and keep family
ties but venture away from home only at specific times agreed to
with probation officers. The bracelet emits radio waves 24 hours a
day that alert officers when an offender is AWOL.
</P>
<P>
   Bracelet wearers also must take a Breathalyzer-type test every
time they enter their homes. They speak and breathe into a gun that
is hooked up to sensitive equipment through phone lines, and the
gun reads their blood-alcohol level. A positive alcohol reading
could land an offender back in a cell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; An offender who is released with a bracelet must pay 25
percent of his or her job earnings to the Department of Correction
or to local law enforcement agencies. &UR;  &LR; Stephen C., a construction
worker, pays $125 a week to the Norfolk County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have left me in prison to rot,'' he said, asking
that his last name not be used to avoid embarassment. ``It's the
price of freedom, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study by the Massachusetts Institute for a New
Commonwealth found that using the bracelet could help cut down on
recidivism. It found probationers and parolees to be behind 60
percent of the heroin and cocaine transactions in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vastly underutilized,'' said Michael Gritton, policy
director of the institute, which conducted the 1996 study. ``The
biggest opportunity to lower crime in this state is in the area of
community corrections, and electronic monitoring is one of the two
or three most effective tools we have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritton recalled cases in which violent offenders struck again
while on probation, including Brian J. Nagle, a convicted child
molester and probationer who was charged last month with sexually
assaulting a 6-year old boy in Amesbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why wasn't he on a bracelet?'' Gritton asked, adding that
Nagle lived around the corner from a Boys and Girls Club. ``In most
cases like this one if we don't use electronic monitoring, then
we're using nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   US District Court Judge Nancy Gertner relies on the bracelet
often, particularly for nonviolent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly prison and not exactly home,'' she said.
``It's appropriate for people for whom prison makes no sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gregory Phillips of Roxbury District Court said the
bracelet is best applied to teenagers. ``I like the concept of
having tighter, more secure positions with respect to juveniles as
opposed to adults,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bracelet is easy on state coffers _ it costs about $10,000
per year &UR;  &LR; _ while a cell bed costs more than $30,000. Many criminal
justice experts say society benefits when offenders keep up family
relations and maintain job skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong case to be made for using it more,'' said
Francis J. Carney, executive director of the state Sentencing
Commission. ``They're almost as restrictive as if the offender's
behind bars, but in a more constructive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Community Corrections, created last year and
funded at $17 million, hopes to use more electronic monitoring in
Barnstable, Worcester, Hampden, Bristol, Suffolk, and Norfolk
counties, said Jonathan Randall, deputy director of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk County, which was ordered by the federal courts to ease
jail overcrowding in 1988, was one of the first places in the
nation to use electronic monitoring. During the past decade, it has
used bracelets on nearly 2,000 offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no joke,'' said John H. Flood, the Norfolk sheriff.``A
lot of guys don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flood recalled an offender who was under strict house arrest but
who went a few feet out into his backyard to soak up some sun. The
bracelet alerted authorities that he left the house. The offender
was given a second chance. He tried again to leave his house to do
some gardening. He was caught again. This time, he was thrown in
jail for 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go on a bracelet, you understand that this is a
privilege,'' Flood said.

NEED FOR TEACHERS ACROSS US SQUEEZES STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the news that half the teacher candidates could not pass a
test of basic skills has shocked Massachusetts over the past two
weeks, it is merely a hint of what is to come nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   As a baby boomlet pushes enrollment to its highest level ever,
and teachers hired for the baby boom prepare to retire, the United
States will find itself replacing 2 million of its 2.7 million
teachers over the next eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as schools demand more of students, their teachers are
still held to remarkably low, if any, standards. With between 30
and 60 percent of new teachers across the country already failing
in basic skills, schools will have no choice but to staff the
nation's classrooms with undereducated and unqualified candidates
when the demand for new recruits rises.
</P>
<P>
   It is this tension between quantity and quality that has
historically frustrated efforts to improve a profession long
plagued by low salaries, low test scores, and the old jibe, ``Those
who can't, teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider California, where a 1996 initiative to shrink class
sizes put so much pressure on schools that they hired 11,000
teachers without credentials. In Los Angeles, 59 percent of new
hires _ 2,100 teachers _ had never been in a classroom. Hundreds
more were let in without passing basic skills tests.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, after so many prospective teachers failed the
test last month, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci called for testing
all teachers and firing those who fail. But before that, he, like
President Clinton, California Governor Pete Wilson, and dozens of
others, had talked only of hiring more teachers _ 4,000 of them in
Cellucci's case _ and not at all of how to get better teachers. Yet
if the teachers who fail skills tests are fired, who will replace
them?
</P>
<P>
   States have talked tough in recent years about teacher tests,
but faced with so few qualified applicants they set a passing
standard even lower than the one Massachusetts set last week _ an F
nationwide compared to a D here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we've tended to solve the problem is the way
California is: put warm bodies in front of kids,'' says Richard
Elmore, professor of education at Harvard and a member of a
nationwide commission on teacher education in the mid-1980s. ``You
don't open school without having teachers in the classroom, so any
determination we have to crack down on the quality of the teaching
force goes out the window when we need teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   And now more than ever, the nation needs teachers. Whether
states fire bad teachers, hire more teachers to shrink class sizes,
or just replace the ones who will retire, the challenge will be not
only to find more candidates, but more qualified candidates.
Solutions come from all directions, and faster than you can add 2
plus 2. But fixing what's wrong with the nation's teaching force is
a more complex equation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
An urban issue
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To some, calling America's teaching problem a shortage is a
misnomer. Over and over, suburbs find hundreds of applicants queued
up for a dozen or so jobs. Education schools report that enrollment
is up.
</P>
<P>
   But urban districts and bulging border states like Texas,
California, and Florida are having a harder time finding enough
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the teachers who do apply want to teach elementary
school, or subjects like English or history. Sixty percent of
Massachusetts superintendents surveyed by the business-backed
research group Mass Insight last year reported problems finding
qualified teachers for foreign languages, science, or math. Other
states face similar shortages.
</P>
<P>
   So if not everyone agrees on whether there is a shortage of
numbers, they agree almost unanimously about the shortage of
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure are initiatives like Clinton's plan to
hire 100,000 more teachers to shrink class sizes, and similar plans
by several other governors. In California, the class-size
initiative created a demand for 21,000 teachers, more than half of
them hired without completing basic training like student teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did bring in a lot of people off the street,'' says Emily
Feistritzer, head of the National Center for Education Information
in Washington, which publishes an annual survey of who enters
teaching. ``When you get that kind of demand, there's no other
way.''
</P>
<P>
   So when so many teaching candidates in Massachusetts failed the
state's new literacy test, the obvious question became: how would
existing teachers do if forced to take the same test?
</P>
<P>
   The indications suggest a similarly dismal answer.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 11,000 students in 10th grade, Harvard Professor
Richard Murnane found that those with the strongest academic skills
were least likely to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Entering college, those who declare an interest in teaching have
historically had lower SAT scores than those who do not. And while
the scores required to enter teacher colleges have risen
nationwide, they still lag behind the average scores of
college-bound freshmen. A study by the Massachusetts Board of
Education in 1996 found teacher education programs accepting
students with as low a combined SAT score as 642, out of a possible
1600. Public colleges like Salem State, which turn out the most
teacher candidates, required scores only in the 800s, still far
below the average state combined SAT score of 996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically open admissions,'' says Massachusetts Board of
Education Chairman John R. Silber, the former Boston University
president who argues for shutting down teacher education programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, 44 states have imposed teacher tests,
trying to demand more of those who come out of teacher colleges.
But the tests have proven no guarantee of high standards. The most
commonly used Praxis test grades between 150 and 190; in most
states, passing is between 168 and 172, barely the halfway mark.
Virginia, with a passing grade of 178 is considered the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Knowing the score
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In response to public demands for tests, teachers unions often
argue that a score can't measure a gift for teaching.
</P>
<P>
   But if common sense doesn't support the notion that teachers
with high scores might produce students with high scores, repeated
studies have. In a report last November, the National Commission on
Teaching and America's Future found that states that had made the
most investments in teaching had produced the most gains in student
tests.
</P>
<P>
   But what appears most important is teachers' grounding in the
subjects they teach.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report quoted a Texas study which found that
teachers with expertise in the subject they teach accounted for 40
percent of the difference in students' reading and math scores. A
New York study found it even more significant, accounting for 90
percent of the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this area, too, American teachers lag.

AN AUCTION TO MAKE MERCHANT IVORY PROUD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Mitchell Owens is the design editor of Traditional Home magazine.  
 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is a country-house auction without the house? The answer: A
mirage of marketing. That is the case with the sale on Wednesday at
Christie's in London dedicated to Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire,
the biggest house in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on reflected glory and occasional provenance by
association, the auction house has spun a slender cache of books,
art and furniture into a Merchant Ivory-like production.
</P>
<P>
   But given the riches of the Earls Fitzwilliam, who inherited
Wentworth in 1782, the splendors, though few, are nonetheless
extraordinary. Among them is the Rockingham Chaucer, printed in
1473-74 and acquired by a Fitzwilliam ancestor in 1776. Valued at
$1.1 million, it is the last privately owned first edition of ``The
Canterbury Tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Paintings by Stubbs and Reynolds are represented, but the star
is a 7-foot-by-4-foot portrait of the Countess of Carlisle, painted
in 1637 by Sir Anthony van Dyck, which is expected to bring $5
million. It is, however, merely the largest of a half-dozen
portraits by the artist owned by the family, so it seems fair to
presume that the really good stuff is still at home.
</P>
<P>
   Home, however, is not Wentworth. Though the catalogue limns its
glory _ the cavernous interiors are depicted in 1920s photographs _
its demise is ignored. Leased to a teachers' training college from
1946 to 1986, it was sold in 1989, a decade after the death of the
10th and last earl.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Bode of Christie's confirmed that most of the items in
the sale come from a collection in the south of England. Yorkshire
residents identified the primary beneficiary as the eighth earl's
only child, Lady Juliet de Chair, 64, who lives in Essex.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is expected to bring between $13 million and $16
million, money that Lord Hindlip, chairman of Christie's
International, said would ``protect the future of the family and
the remainder of the collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole aside, there are, after all, no Fitzwilliams left, and
much of what is being sold is either redundant or of little
historical importance. At least 16 of the 106 lots have no apparent
Wentworth connection. The catalogue reports, for example, that lot
47, a George III mahogany pedestal desk ($17,000-$24,000), was
purchased at Christie's in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Juliet and her family have been a steady source of
Wentworthiana since 1948, when Christie's handled a sale of
furnishings after the death of her father. The earl _ called ``King
dandy and scum'' by Evelyn Waugh _ was 37 and estranged from his
wife, a Guinness beer heiress, when he was killed in a plane crash
with his 28-year-old mistress, Kathleen, Marchioness of Hartington,
the favorite sister of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   A recent castoff was the heroic 1762 George Stubbs portrait of
the champion stallion Whistlejacket, which had a state room created
for its display. Depicting the Arabian steed as a mass of
mane-tossing, barebacked muscle, the painting was acquired last
December by the National Gallery for a reported $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Built around 1630 by the first Earl of Strafford, and
extensively Palladianized by his heirs in the 1700s, Wentworth is a
freak of domestic architecture, a tribute to statistics over style.
As one visitor laconically wrote of the swaggering 606-foot-long,
365-room structure, ``The house has always rather overwhelmed the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Its fabulous contents were assembled in the 18th century by the
Marquess of Rockingham and his son, Charles, a British prime
minister whose cheering for the American Revolution cost him his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the son's best additions to Wentworth are the sale's
least well documented: 19 pieces of furniture attributed to an
obscure pair of 18th-century Yorkshire cabinetmakers, Richard
Wright and Edward Elwick. Executed in toothsome exotic woods like
amaranth, padauk, sabicu and fustic, the works shed light on a
design team about whom much remains to be written.
</P>
<P>
   Barely known outside a small circle of connoisseurs and
scholars, Wright and Elwick were followers of Chippendale and, as
Christie's experts discovered to their surprise, helped furnish
Wentworth in the 1750s and 1760s. Though relying on their idol's
popular portfolio of designs, the pair often interpreted
Chippendale's fashionable sketches into sinewy, slightly menacing
furniture that seem perfectly suited to Wentworth's hypermasculine
majesty.
</P>
<P>
   The pagoda-swoop shoulders of nine dashing yew-wood dining
chairs recall the epaulets of the evil flying monkeys in ``The
Wizard of Oz'' ($65,000-$97,000).
</P>
<P>
   Their Wentworth masterpiece, however, is a secretary-on-cabinet
made for Lady Rockingham, the prime minister's wife
($330,000-$490,000). A circa-1765 chinoiserie sensation crowned by
a spiky pagoda hung and faced with five different patterns of
fretwork, it is success, power and fashion in one trendy
multicultural package: rococo drawer pulls, neo-classical urns and
Gothic arches framing the letter slots.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of Wright and Elwick's creations, the nine-foot-tall
secretary is the real thing: a provincial masterpiece whose honesty
of construction is a gentle rebuke to the occasionally obfuscating
sale it graces.

 UNDATED: ... teachers lag.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its original 1996 report, the teaching commission _ a group
of education professors, teachers, business people and politicians
formed by the Rockefeller Foundation and Columbia University _found
that one-quarter of all high school teachers have not taken a
course in the subjects they teach since they were in high school
themselves. For math teachers, the figure rises to 30 percent. Half
the nation's high school students are taught science by someone
other than a science teacher or scientist, with the proportions
highest in poorer urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1987 and 1991, the percentage of teachers entering the
classroom with either a college minor or major in the subject they
teach, dropped from 74 to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, not all teachers are bad. Even Frank Haydu III, who
Monday said he will resign as the state's interim commissioner of
education amid fallout from his decision to demand that teachers
pass the state test, warned against ``teacher bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the number of truly incompetent teachers is only
five percent _ the figure given by Stanford University professor
Edwin Bridges in his book ``The Incompetant Teacher'' _ multiply
that by at least 20 students in a classroom, and it's nearly three
million students across the country learning from unqualified
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   For the students, the effects may outlast the incompetent
teacher. According to an ongoing University of Tennessee study that
has tracked students in two large school districts over 15 years,
the results of both good and bad teaching can be seen in student
test scores as long as four years later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Causes for concern
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as the quality of teachers has gotten worse, it has become a
self-fulfilling prophecy: the profession is held in such low esteem
that no one wants to enter it.
</P>
<P>
   The number of college students going into teaching dropped
steadily from the 1960s, when thirty percent were likely to teach,
to the 1980s, when 10 percent were. The biggest change came in the
opening of more opportunities for women, who still make up 73
percent of the teaching force. The higher achieving women went into
more lucrative professsions, so teacher colleges, and hence schools
themselves, had no choice but to drop the standards for people they
hired as teachers.
</P>
<P>
   And who would go into teaching, then or now? Almost any
profession was more lucrative, and still is. Teaching offers none
of the comforts and amenities other professionals take for granted
_ such as telephones, voice mail, fax machines, computers, even air
conditioning. It offers high personal rewards, but can also mean
high stress. And the faddishness of education strategies and the
demands of parents who think they know best creates a push-me,
pull-you effect that any teacher, talented or otherwise, would find
wearying. Add to that the social pressures of schools in poorer
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a good teacher in an urban school, you have to give
12-13 hours a day, and those are intense hours,'' says Jesse
Solomon, a 30-year-old MIT graduate who taught in the Boston Public
Schools before moving to City on a Hill Charter School in the
city's Fenway section. ``I don't know anyone who isn't exhausted by
Friday. If schools were places people felt they could carve out
long-term, fulfilling careers, I think you'd attract better
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But even for those who seek the rewards of working with young
people, teacher education remains an obstacle to better teaching.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey of teacher education schools last year might
have presaged the dismal results on the recent Massachusetts tests.
In it, professors by overwhelming margins said the most essential
thing teachers needed to impart to students was to be ``active
learners.'' But few thought it essential to teach the skills most
people would consider essential for the well-educated mind. Only 19
percent felt correct spelling and punctuation was important. Only
33 percent said students should know the names and locations of the
50 states. And just 55 percent said they would require proficiency
in spelling, grammar, and punctuation before receiving a high
school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The survey captured the key problem: teacher education programs
have too often shortchanged content for pedagogy, stressing the how
over the what. In fact, only 500 of the nation's 1200 teacher
education programs are accredited.
</P>
<P>
   The commission on teaching found that teacher education is too
disconnected from actual classroom practice. Yet in most states,
teacher colleges have remained the only game in town for people who
want to teach. Some states, including Massachusetts, have changed
their requirements to demand a liberal arts degree instead of a
teaching degree. Yet superintendents say teacher candidates are
still being hired if they earned education degrees in other states.
And every teacher has to earn a masters within five years of
beginning to teach. In most cases, they take a masters of
education, emphasizing what tends to be worst about teacher
training.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Grab bag of solutions
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With education now emerging as the hottest political issue
across the country, it seems everyone has a strategy for improving
teachers _ the most basic element of any reform.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposes forgiving student loans for talented
students who agree to teach in urban or rural districts, and
shrinking class sizes. Cellucci proposes shrinking class sizes and
testing teachers. Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, perhaps testing
the waters for his own presidential campaign, suggests luring
people from other fields into teaching, without putting them
through the onerous hurdles of teacher education.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is probably D: all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Those who've studied the problems of the nation's teaching force
say alternative programs can be one successful strategy: witness
the popularity of Teach for America, a kind of Peace Corps for
teachers that attracts college graduates into schools in some of
the country's most dangerous neighborhoods. But they fault these
kinds of programs _ now offered in some form in 41 states _ for
providing too little mentoring for teachers, resulting in high
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   And, specialists say, salaries must be raised. Salaries tend to
rise dramatically over a long teaching career. Now, with older
teachers retiring, policy makers say the time is ripe to raise the
salaries at the lower levels as incentive to get in, even if it
means a less dramatic rise in pay over the course of a career.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing alone will work without also raising the esteem of
the profession _ an elusive goal, but one would-be reformers say
ultimately comes from elevating the demands of teacher education.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers call for raising standards at teacher colleges.
States, they say, need to hone alternative programs to tap the
energy of outside candidates, while making sure they get the
mentoring they need. And states need to create other ways for
teachers to become certified. One option is the National Board for
Professional Teaching Standards, a Detroit-based group that puts
teachers through an elaborate year-long series of tests of
everything from their knowledge of the areas they teach to how they
plan lessons and interact with students.
</P>
<P>
   All this, specialists say, will force traditional teacher
education schools to prove they are the most effective method of
training. And it will make the profession something to strive for,
rather than fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this is easy,'' Murnane cautions. ``But given how high
the stakes are, it seems a wise investment.''

EXOTIC ACCUMULATIONS IN MINIATURE SPACES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 16th- and 17th-century Dutch were probably not
the first Westerners to be more interested in this world than the
next, but they pursued that interest with unusual energy, openness
and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Their assured, enterprising curiosity is reflected in their
advances in cartography, navigation, exploration, lens-cutting,
medicine and science, and a bustling sea trade that sustained
Amsterdam as a center of international commerce as well as
learning.
</P>
<P>
   It is also evident in their art, which built upon the
observation and accuracy first formulated by Van Eyck and then
Durer. With an alacrity suggesting that love of the world engenders
love of self, Dutch artists pursued subjects among their immediate
surroundings, painting Dutch men and women, their everyday lives
and the Dutch landscape.
</P>
<P>
   They gave genre painting its first definition and painted so
many depictions of objects that the term ``stilleven'' _ still life
_ was coined.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most vivid reflection of this worldliness _ this
inclusive embrace of knowledge, experience and beauty _ was the
kunstkamer, or art cabinet, the often encyclopedic arrays of art,
artifacts and natural specimens assembled by prosperous Dutch or
Flemish burghers.
</P>
<P>
   So argues ``A Collector's Cabinet,'' a pocket-size show at the
National Gallery of Art. A summer hit now extended to Nov. 1, it
qualifies as a blockbuster in a teapot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Collector's Cabinet,'' organized by Arthur K. Wheelock Jr.,
the museum's curator of northern Baroque painting, loosely
re-creates an eclectic, 17th-century kunstkamer. In all, 180
artworks have been shoehorned into three galleries with a combined
area of less than 800 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The show features walls double- and triple-hung with smallish to
tiny oil paintings, mostly Dutch, Flemish and Italian. Handsome
built-in vitrines brim with table-top sculptures, decorative
objects, Roman coins, jewelry, Chinese lacquers, prints,
illustrated books, exotic shells, botanical and zoological
drawings, musical instruments, the occasional map, an elephant's
tooth and scientific instruments like microscopes, telescopes,
globes and a protractor. The kunstkamer was multicultural and
multimedia before the fact.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The installation gives claustrophobia a good name, or at least
distracts effectively from its anxieties. The slightest shift of
the eyes causes images and objects to group and regroup according
to subject, style, form or material and creates a shifting flow of
thoughts and perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with nature's exotica takes different forms. In
one vitrine, sea coral, highly prized, appears in its natural
state, as an impressive bright-red trident. A nearly identical
sprig commands the center of a beautiful, kunstkamer-like still
life (by Jacques Linard, a French artist) of shells. A third bit of
coral serves as the stem of a finely wrought silver spoon.
</P>
<P>
   In other instances, rare natural forms inspired ostentatious
artifice. With the addition of a gilded silver head, wings and
feet, an ostrich egg becomes a sculpture of the bird itself (also
an ewer). Similarly, a large nautilus becomes a snail when
supplemented with a graceful head, rippling foot and tiny fairy
astride its back. Above these hang images of unaugmented natural
wonders: prints of a rhinoceros and a pig with six legs, both by
Durer.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the juxtapositions of paintings make the most
interesting points, dramatizing the range of realist styles and
subjects. After regarding the quiet precision of Pieter Jansz
Saenredam's pale interior of a vaulting church nave, from around
1632, the eye is drawn across the way to the serenity and radiance
of Jan Olis's ``Interior With Young Men Playing Tric-Trac,'' a
tavern scene in whites and creams from around 1632.
</P>
<P>
   On the intervening wall, Adriaen Brouwer's ``Youth Making a
Face'' (1632-35) gives a grittier picture of tavern life, as does a
tiny gray scene (around 1635) that includes a man relieving
himself, this one by David Teniers the Younger, who was influenced
by Brouwer.
</P>
<P>
   Amid these different realist styles, and flanked in one instance
by two small turbulent Rembrandts, Johannes Vermeer's ``Woman
Holding a Balance'' and ``Girl With a Red Hat'' communicate a
startling modernity _ an economy of form, purity of color and odd
flatness that border on the abstract.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeer seems almost as removed from the painting of his time as
that painting was from the art of the Italian Renaissance, with its
idealized treatments of biblical and classical subjects. When
Roelandt Savery paints his 1624 image of the Holy Family resting on
the Flight Into Egypt, they appear deep in the background of a
scene filled with farmers and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   It seems appropriate that the galleries holding this show aren't
much bigger than a small one-bedroom apartment. For despite its
vivid glimpse of a distant time, place and mind-set, it is not
alien.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch or Flemish kunstkamer may be ground zero for a number
of familiar phenomena: the private art collection, for one. Neither
members of royalty nor the clergy, the Dutch in particular were the
first bourgeois art collectors in the West, habitually displaying
art in less than palatial homes and thereby encouraging the
production of small objects and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   In their ostentation, some of these objects contain hints of
bric-a-brac to come and might even qualify as pre-industrial
kitsch, despite the uniqueness, consummate craft and high
production values.
</P>
<P>
   But the kunstkamer's density also resonates with the
chock-a-block displays found throughout the art world these days.
In a time as modest as ours can sometimes be, young artists often
sneak up on large scale by massing together lots of little things _
small paintings, drawings, photographs, found objects.
</P>
<P>
   Other echoes can be found in some recent high-density museum
exhibitions organized by noncurators looking to take liberties with
the whole exhibition concept. One thinks of the cheek-by-jowl
display of portraits that the painter Chuck Close organized, with
Kirk Varnedoe, in a small gallery at the Museum of Modern Art in
1991; of the sculptor Arman's dense installation of works from his
collection of African art at the Museum of African Art in SoHo last
fall, and of ``A/Drift,'' a wild mix of contemporary art and
artifacts (record albums, rock posters, T-shirts and music videos)
organized in 1996 by the critic Joshua Decter at the Center for
Curatorial Studies at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And at the moment, there's ``Bathroom'' at the Thomas Healy
Gallery in Chelsea, one of many thematic compendiums presented by
New York art galleries every season.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery's exhibition returns to the moment when the
experience of art was, in effect, privatized by successful
commoners with uncommon amounts of disposable income. Their
nonhierarchical collections _ the kunstkamer theory of relativity?
_ made these ensembles machines for seeing, like the lenses and
microscopes they sometimes included, and exemplars of a
multicultural connoisseurship whose relevance endures.

SOCIETY'S WORST CAN STILL HIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a trailer beside an auto body shop, a father raped his own
children and the little girl next door for years. He went to prison
for forcing those boys and girls to have intercourse with each
other and to watch while he raped each of them in turn. He did his
time and is no longer on parole or probation.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Sex Offender Registry Board classified him
among the most dangerous of sexual predators, but because he
appealed, the board is barred by law from notifying the North Shore
community where he is living.
</P>
<P>
   On a roadway at dusk on a June night nine years ago, a large man
in his mid-30s with a long criminal record for rape picked up a
hitchhiker. He drove her to a deserted parking lot where he raped
her and beat her with a tire iron. He did his time and is no longer
on parole or probation.
</P>
<P>
   The Sex Offender Registry Board classified him among the most
dangerous of sexual predators, but because the rapist moved when he
received his classification notice and the law prohibits the
dissemination of his name statewide, the board cannot locate, let
alone notify, the community where he is living.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoons after swimming lessons, an 8-year-old boy
and his sister would go to their father's house to spend the
weekend. Their father raped them both on the dining room floor
weekend after weekend until the boy finally told his mother. The
father did his time and is no longer on probation or parole.
</P>
<P>
   The Sex Offender Registry Board has not yet classified this
rapist. He is one of an estimated 15,000 individuals with one or
more criminal convictions in Massachusetts that would require
registration as a sex offender. To date, the five-member,
part-time, volunteer board has classified only about 1,300 of them.
</P>
<P>
   These cases are only a small sample of the unanticipated
consequences of the legal challenges and legislative inertia
plaguing this state's much-touted sex offender registry law, a
statute designed to alert a crime-weary public to a rapist or child
molester in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declaring
sections of the law dealing with low-risk offenders
unconstitutional has allowed the most high-risk offenders to live
undetected, even by the police, in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   A failure of the Massachusetts Legislature to allocate the
necessary resources to the Sex Offender Registry Board has meant
that the evidentiary hearings are not being held that would satisfy
the high court that the due process rights of sex offenders were
being protected.
</P>
<P>
   Cited by Acting Governor Paul Cellucci as a major achievement of
his administration, the registry law is all but unenforceable.
Those legislators most eager to take credit for its passage are
reluctant to correct its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   The law mandates that anyone convicted of one of 11 sex crimes
since 1981 register with their local police department. The state
is required to categorize each offender according to his likelihood
to commit a similar crime again.
</P>
<P>
   That job falls to the unpaid Sex Offender Registry Board, a
panel that consists of two psychologists, a victims' advocate, a
probation officer, and a lawyer designated by the state's public
safety secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The board meets for a few hours once a week, poring over the
case files of some of the most despicable crimes committed in
Massachusetts. Their Friday morning reviews move at a snail's pace
because the stakes are so high and their resources so low.
Classification as a high-risk offender means that an individual's
photograph will be distributed to his local police department and
his name made available to neighbors who inquire. It is not a task
to be taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
   A little boy is molested in the bathroom of a fast food
restaurant; a little girl is assaulted in the bedroom of her own
home; and this state's politicians bemoan the system's inability to
protect the public from the worst among us.
</P>
<P>
   But while they posture, corrective legislation languishes on
Beacon Hill that would make the Sex Offender Registry Board a
full-time, paid panel with the staff and funds to tackle the
backlog of cases and conduct the necessary hearings.
</P>
<P>
   If that measure, now stuck in the House Ways and Means
Committee, does not move to the floor for a vote before the end of
the session this month, it will be January before lawmakers can
address the problems with the sex offender registry. That's six
more months of the public not knowing the whereabouts of the man
who raped his children in the trailer or the man who raped and beat
the hitchhiker in the parking lot or the man who raped his son and
daughter on the dining room floor.

<P>
   Theater often has less to do with passion, art or even
accomplishment than it does with real estate commitments that, in
turn, help to decide which plays and shows we see and which are
allowed to drift into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the good fortune of Michael Mayer's production of
``Side Man,'' Warren Leight's alternately flip and melancholy,
sometimes brutal memoir about the last years of the Big Band era.
</P>
<P>
   Having received favorable notices and enthusiastic audiences
earlier this year at the Classic Stage Company's Off Broadway
theater, ``Side Man'' has now transferred to the Roundabout
Theater's Stage Right on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the move isn't just another example of how quality
inevitably rises to the top. Chance and the availablity of real
estate have also had a lot to do with it. They're as much a part of
the culture of our theater, non-profit as well as commercial, as
the artists who commit their lives to the theater on spec, that is,
with blind faith and no guarantee of rewards. These are neither
Good Things nor Bad Things, but the way theater is.
</P>
<P>
   At Stage Right, ``Side Man'' is in the larger of the
Roundabout's two spaces, the one most recently occupied by a turgid
revival of Terence Rattigan's 1952 romantic drama, ``The Deep Blue
Sea.'' The long-scheduled opening of the Rattigan play in late
March prompted the transfer of the Roundabout's hit revival of
Arthur Miller's ``View From the Bridge'' to the Neil Simon Theater.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when ``The Deep Blue Sea'' closed that the space
became available for ``Side Man.'' You see how chance operates.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a happy one. It brings a new American play to the
Roundabout, which has built up its large, loyal subscription
audience by concentrating on revivals. Some of these have been
stunning achievements like ``A View From the Bridge'' (also
directed by Michael Mayer) and the Sam Mendes production of
``Cabaret,'' which is at the Gilbert Miller Theater, temporarily
renamed the Kit Kat Klub. Many of their revivals, however, have
been very mixed bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man'' is not only a new play but also something of an
original. It's a recollection of a time now recalled chiefly
through the names of Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw and the other
leaders of the big swing bands, which, before the coming of Elvis
Presley, the Beatles and rock-and-roll, embraced great jazz
musicians and set the musical tastes for the country from the
mid-1930s into the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Leight is not a name-dropper, nor does he deal in the kind of
nostalgia that depends on the easy sentiment evoked by the music
itself. He's not interested in the stars of that era. He's
concerned with the side men, those crazily obsessed, sometimes
gifted musicians who floated from one band to the next earning
peanuts, heedless of their haphazard, messy existences, aware only
of the music by which they connected to one another and to life.
</P>
<P>
   Such a man is Gene (Frank Wood), the quietly remarkable trumpet
player, terrible husband and thoughtless father remembered by his
son Clifford (Robert Sella), the narrator of ``Side Man.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing much wrong with Gene except that he should never
have married and become a father. Certainly he should never have
married a woman as ill-equipped as the emotionally unstable Terry
(Wendy Makkena) to deal with a man who lives only through his
music.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that she probably would never have married him
except that the first time she sat in on one of his gigs, she heard
the genius of Dizzy Gillespie in his horn. She becomes his most
dangerous fan. He probably never would have married her except that
it seemed the the thing to do and, once done, he never gave it
another thought.
</P>
<P>
   Gene drinks and smokes dope but, unlike so many of his pals, he
never becomes a junkie and he doesn't play around. He's simply
remote, disconnected from life as the rest of us know it.
</P>
<P>
   As the years go by, Gene scarcely ages a day. Terry, working as
a waitress, slips into alcoholism and teeters on madness. When she
screams, throws food and threatens suicide, he goes out to move the
car and stays away, sometimes for days or maybe just until he's
sure she's drunk herself to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford is less their child than their keeper, furious with and
saddened by his mother, mesmerized by his glimpses of his father's
secret life.
</P>
<P>
   He beautifully catches the private spirit of his father in a
monologue:
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's up there, blowing, he's totally in touch with
everything that's going on around him. Ziggy bends a note, he
echoes it instantly. A car horn sounds outside, he puts it in his
solo, or harmonizes under it, a second later. I used to wonder how
he could sense everything while he was blowing, and almost nothing
when he wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   At another, earlier point in the play, Clifford remembers when
he permanently evicted his father from their Upper West Side
apartment. After an especially brutal fight between his parents,
Clifford announces that his father has to move out. Gene is
bewildered but he accepts the ruling. Later Clifford reports: ``hat
night, at midnight, I drove him over to Ziggy's. It was like moving
a cat. I don't think he had any idea of what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man'' is an engrossing play without being entirely
satisfatory. One character is missing from this family: Terry as
wife and mother. I'm not sure whether this is a reflection of the
role as written or as played by Ms. Makkena.
</P>
<P>
   When first met, she's a flutist from South Boston, though
nothing more is made of her own interest in music. As the play
progresses, she seems to become increasingly simple-minded in a way
that has nothing to do with alcohol or abandonment. Much of the
time her tirades are just gibberish. She should break your heart.
Instead you wish she would vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Leight has created a fascinating character in Gene, who's
revealed as much by how other people react to him as by what he
does or says. There's something benignly ghostlike about him. Wood
plays him with just the right proportion of dimness to
recognizable, maddening eccentricity.
</P>
<P>
   Sella is good in the schizoid role of narrator-son, meaning that
he must stand outside the events, often jokily commenting on them,
even as he's participating in them as one of the victims. Not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Gene's musician colleagues are sharply, comically defined in the
performances of Joseph Lyle Taylor, Michael Mastro and Kevin Greer.
Anjelica Torn, as a good-hearted club waitress, effectively stands
in for all the women the men meet away from home as the palmy days
of the big bands dwindle down to isolated club dates, private
parties and the occasional job with Lester Lanin.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of ``Side Man,'' that's a fate worse than death,
but it's also a living. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Playing next door to ``Side Man,'' at the Roundabout's smaller
Laura Pels Theater, is Nicholas Martin's revival of George Bernard
Shaw's ``You Never Can Tell.'' The good news: a performance by
Robert Sean Leonard so disciplined, technically assured and
commandingly funny that the impulse is to say that a star is _ if
not exactly born _ then at long last recognized.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, without fuss or hype, Leonard has been learning
his craft in films (``Dead Poet's Society,'' ``Much Ado About
Nothing'') and on the stage (``Philadelphia, Here I Come,''
``Arcadia'').
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears to be pay-off time. As Valentine, whose Shavian
mind amd dashingly romantic soul inhabit the body of a failed
dentist, he has a role that he can run with, which he does with an
almost Olivier-like pleasure, transforming a rather perfuntory Shaw
revival into a farcical delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Never Can Tell'' is not in a league with such great,
characteristically Shavian comedies as ``Pygmalion'' and ``Major
Barbara.'' Its conventions are of the 19th century. Shaw began
writing it in December, 1895, the year of Oscar Wilde's triumph
(the production of ``The Importance of Being Earnest'') and
humiliation (his trials and imprisonment).
</P>
<P>
   Shaw finished it in 1896 and, though he might not have admitted
it, ``You Never Can Tell'' has a lot of Wildean wit in it. Note the
apology of a mannerly waiter to his betters for having raised his
son to become a Queen's Counsel: ``Never mind my being the
gentleman's father, ma'am: it is only the accident of birth after
all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You Never Can Tell'' has a marvelously absurd plot involving
one impossibly enlightened New Woman, whose treatises on
20th-century cooking, creeds, clothing, conduct, children and
parents are the rage in Madeira; her three children, the rich old
husband she abandoned 18 years earlier, and Valentine, the dentist.
The place and time: a Devon seaside resort on a blissful summer's
day.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens at the Roundabout, the casting is uneven,
though Leonard brings the ensemble together. He doesn't stand apart
from the others; instead his energy and enthusiasm have a way of
carrying everyone along with hin.
</P>
<P>
   Two other very good performances to note: Charles Keating, who
plays the august waiter whose only indiscretion is his successful
son, and Jere Shea as that son, who freely acknowledges his father,
without ever forgetting that the man is, after all, a waiter. Alan
Moyer's sets are charming.
</P>
<P>
   Imperfect, perhaps, but still potentially revivifying on a
blistering summer's day or night. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Love's Fire,'' the Acting Company production housed in the
Newman Theater at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, is an engaging
stunt: a program of one-act plays by seven of our major
playwrights, each commissioned to take as inspiration one of
Shakespeare's sonnets or, in the case of John Guare, two sonnets.
</P>
<P>
   The other contributors: Eric Bogosian, Ntozake Shange, Marsha
Norman, Tony Kushner, William Finn and Wendy Wasserstein. The
director is Mark Lamos.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most successful of the lot is Mr. Kushner's
contribution, titled ``Terminating, or Lass Meine Schmerzen Nicht
Verloren Sein, or Ambivalance,'' inspired by Sonnet No. 75. That
title is part of the joke, which is about Esther, an analyst, and
Hendrik, her patient, both gay and both besieged during their
session by the demands of their respective lovers, who won't stop
playing mind games during this crucial 50-minute hour.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Hendrik, hilariously played by Stephen De-Rosa, is so
desperate at being terminated by Esther that he becomes convinced
he wants to sleep with her. Sleep? says Esther. Is that what he
means? It isn't, of course, but words have always been coming
between Hendrik and the rest of the world. They're how he protects
himself from the terror of life and love.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wasserstein's ``Waiting for Philip Glass,'' inspired by No.
94, plays like the first super-bitchy scene in a full-length comedy
about the East Hampton summer colony (which, reportedly, is what it
may turn out to be). Sample line, spoken by an especially chic mom:
``Kids are great. Kip's in Maine and Taylor's at this terrific
summer camp in Cambodia ...'' Ms. Shange's ``Hydraulics Phat Like
Mean'' (No. 128) is an erotic dance piece with dialogue, scored by
Chico Freeman, choreographed by Dyane Harvey and played by Lisa
Tharps and Jason Alan Carvel.
</P>
<P>
   The most elaborate piece is Guare's ``General of Hot Desire''
(Nos. 153 and 154), about the problems of pinning down
Shakespeare's meanings to concoct the play we're seeing.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright apparently worked with the actors in putting the
piece together, and though it goes on too long, as improvisations
sometimes do, it's a beautifully boisterous, unruly way to end a
program that celebrates one of the most severely disciplined of all
literary forms.
</P>
<P>
   A note of reassurance: each of the sonnets is spoken twice in
the course of each play and, if you're brain tires and you lose the
thread before arriving at the final couplet, they're also published
in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love's Fire'' is a serious fun festival all by itself.

BOOK OFFERS WAYS TO CULTIVATE SPIRITUALITY IN CHILDREN'S LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are not easy days for parents. Children are being raised
in a society saturated with violence and cynicism, and often too
little emphasis on ethics.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, parenting has become for many a seemingly
endless marathon of soccer practices, birthday parties, ballet
lessons, and doctor's appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are under increasing pressure to try and raise
``perfect'' children, giving them every advantage, so that they can
grow into sucessful, happy adults.
</P>
<P>
   But too many parents are missing what local author Mimi Doe
believes is a key to childhood _ spirituality. All children have
it, says Doe, co-author of a just-released book, ``10 Principles
for Spiritual Parenting.'' The problem is not enough parents take
steps to cultivate their child's spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much to say about the world we send our kids out
into, but we can control the kind of home we create,'' said Doe,
sitting in the living room of her gray colonial home on a
tree-lined street in Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   She is taking a break from scrolling through the dozens of
e-mails she receives daily from parents seeking spiritual advice.
Doe, who co-wrote the book with her mother, Marsha Walch, a
psychotherapist in Mississippi, is the family spirituality
specialist for the Moms on Line Internet site maintained by America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Doe has her own website (www.pink-bubble.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``All children begin life with an innate sense of wonder about
their world,'' Doe and Walch write. ``God is as real to them as
Mommy and Daddy. We, as parents, can foster this precious state of
being with our words, actions and attention. Where there is wonder,
there is spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Doe, who travels across the country giving workshops on children
and spirituality, says lessons about God or spirituality shouldn't
be relegated to the brief time spent worshiping in a church or a
temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirituality is not the dogma of organized religion, although
organized religion provides a great deal to nurture a child's
soul,'' Doe and Walch write.
</P>
<P>
   Spirituality, Doe argues, is hard to find in television videos,
computer games, the latest battery-operated toy or any of the other
high-tech gizmos with which children are surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it can be found in something as simple as taking ``10
minutes to delight with your toddler on the spider web in the
corner of the room instead of rushing off to the next event,'' said
Doe, 39, who received a master's degree in education from Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 principles suggested by Doe and Walch, detailed with
anecdotes and tips in separate chapters, are:
</P>
<P>
   _Know God cares for you. Help children make connections with
their own personal higher power.
</P>
<P>
   _Trust and teach that all life is connected. Show children that
everything _ from a blade of grass to a skunk _ has a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   _Listen to your child. Children can tell parents things parents
once knew but have forgotten, Doe said.
</P>
<P>
   _Words are important; use them with care. Understand the power
of positive words.
</P>
<P>
   _Allow and encourage dreams, wishes, and hopes. Hopes are a
child's seeds of desire, Doe notes.
</P>
<P>
   _Add magic to the ordinary. Parents should become infused with
their children's natural sense of enchantment.
</P>
<P>
   _Create a flexible structure. Children need structure and
creative freedom to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   _Be a positive mirror for your child.
</P>
<P>
   _Release the struggle. Worries can overwhelm parents trying to
shield their kids from trouble.
</P>
<P>
   _Make each day a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirituality is the base from which grow self-esteem, values,
morals, a sense of belonging,'' Doe and Walch write.
</P>
<P>
   Doe, who has two daughters, Whitney, 10, and Elizabeth, 8, said
a spiritual approach to parenting has enriched her own family's
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just one more project that parents have to take
on,'' Doe said. ``Any parent can adapt whatever feels comfortable
to their lifestyle and incorporate it into their time schedules.
But this really can tap into a child's soul and provide a wonderful
opportunity for being spiritually alive _ for children and for
parents.''

Religion Notes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Lutheran World Federation has added his
voice to the growing list of religious leaders advocating the
cancellation of debt for the world's poorest nations to mark
Christianity's third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Christian Krause said there was a close connection
between God's forgiveness of sins and forgiveness of Third World
debt. The idea of forgiving Third World debt, which Krause
discussed at a recent meeting of the Lutheran World Federation in
Germany, also has been embraced, among others, by the Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   _A group of United Methodists, who boycotted their Nebraska
church after the pastor performed a same-sex union ceremony last
fall, has decided to form its own congregation _ the latest
incident in the dispute over homosexuality that has roiled the 8.5
million member church.
</P>
<P>
   Same-sex ceremonies and the ordination of gays and lesbians will
not be permitted at the new Nebraska church, a spokesman said,
although gays and lesbians would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation voted to formally sever ties with First United
Methodist Church of Omaha in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jimmy Creech made national headlines last September
when he performed a union ceremony of two women. About 450
congregants in the 1,900-member First United Methodist Church
stopped attending the church in protest.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a church trial cleared Creech of breaking
denominational rules. But Nebraska Bishop Joel Martinez decided not
to reappoint Creech as pastor, partly because the minister refused
to promise not to perform any more same-sex unions.

NEW MEXICO VOTES CLEAN AND GREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE -- The election was special, but in today's
mechanized politics, the battle plan is routine. Consultants exhume
a peccadillo about a rival candidate, which they then convert into
a televised, 30-second scare story that out-Herods Herod. They
collect their fees and move on.
</P>
<P>
   This plan, pursued by both Democrats and Republicans, backfired
in the June 23 election to replace Steve Schiff, a much-admired
Republican who died in March. Voters in New Mexico's 1st
Congressional District were appalled, and a hefty number of them _
15 percent _ voted for the Green Party candidate, Bob Anderson, who
spent $3,000 on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Democrats in California rejected a wealthy self-financed
candidate, voters here cast aside Democrat Phil Maloof, who spent
$1.5 million of his family fortune. He lost, with 39 percent, to
Republican Heather Wilson, who won 45 percent, but the buzz
afterward was about the third-party total.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have guessed before the election that the Green would
have got about 3 percent,'' says Fred McCaffrey of Santa Fe, whose
decades-deep knowledge of state politics leads him to conclude that
the Green candidate drew from both parties: ``It was a backlash
against negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   A duel of dirt engulfed Maloof's mother and Wilson's husband in
charges that were as bizarrely irrelevant as they were nasty.
Before the 1970s, when ``reformers'' changed campaign laws, a major
party might shun or discipline rogue candidates whose excesses
could damage the party's reputation. Today, party leaders embrace
and bankroll them.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader,
stumped for Wilson. On the Sunday before the voting, an all-star
Democratic rally boosted Maloof, led by Hillary Clinton, House
minority leader Dick Gephardt, and Representatives Patrick Kennedy
of Rhode Island and Loretta Sanchez of California.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats need 11 more seats to regain control of the House, but
the party's record in special elections is dismal; the last time a
Democrat took over a Republican seat was in 1991, when John Olver
succeeded Silvio Conte in Massachusetts. Since Albuquerque is the
most Democratic of Sun Belt cities and Bill Clinton twice won the
district easily, big bucks and a Beltway attitude dominated the air
waves of a city accustomed to a gentler political pace.
</P>
<P>
   Maloof, the 31-year-old scion of one of the state's wealthiest
families, had ducked earlier debates, and the first televised
encounter explained why. Voters found Wilson's demeanor and resume
more impressive. A native of New Hampshire and a mother of three,
Wilson, 37, was a state official and is a graduate of the Air Force
Academy. She is now the first female veteran ever to serve in
Congress and the first woman to represent New Mexico in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Television and print media covered the race closely, resulting
in a respectable special-election turnout _ 40 percent of
registered voters. The Albuquerque Tribune said that Maloof's
Seattle-based consultant, Tom Hujar, declined to comment
afterwards. The Democratic county chairman said the consultant
``was calling all the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the third loss for a Hujar candidate in the state.
Fewer than 1 percent of the state's voters belong to the Green
Party, but Green Party candidates helped defeat his candidate for
governor in 1994 and a special-election congressional candidate in
the Santa Fe district in 1997. Is there a trend here?
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune, which had endorsed Maloof, editorialized: ``The
bloodiest, most appalling election campaign in recent New Mexico
history is over. Hallelujah.'' Imported, one-size-fits-all cynicism
harangued the Land of Enchantment into a Land of Disgust until
voters rebelled.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's no national trend and maybe other jurisdictions still
have a Pavlovian appetite for mud pies, but Democrats and
Republicans discovered that the only mud that sells in New Mexico
is adobe.

`BUFFALO 66' SHOWS GALLO'S HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BUFFALO 66 
Directed by: Vincent Gallo 
Screenplay by: Alison Bagnall, Gallo 
Starring: Gallo, Christina Ricci, Anjelica Huston, Ben Gazzara,
Kevin Corrigan, Mickey Rourke, Rosanna Arquette, Jan-Michael
Vincent 
Running time: 112 minutes 
Rated: Unrated 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although its limitations are inescapably apparent, ``Buffalo
66'' is nevertheless an impressive showcase for Vincent Gallo, who
evidently was concerned that his flavorful lowlife roles in
``Palookaville'' and ``The Funeral'' didn't give him the chance to
show enough sensitivity and soul. Here he plays a grungy little
nonentity named Billy Brown, who slides back into his native
Buffalo after being released from prison. Looking like an
ambulatory hangnail, filled with rage, and possessed of the social
skills of a fungus, he takes a bus into town, kidnaps a ballet
student and proceeds to peel away layer after layer of curdled
exterior to reveal hitherto unrevealed depths of sweetness and
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   The story hinges on the character of the kidnap victim
convincing us she's not against the chance to break out of her
usual routine. Christina Ricci, looking appropriately bored and
ready for a change, steals the film with her inscrutability while
Gallo digs in and chews on the overwritten and oversentimentalized
role he gave himself, seeming insufficiently aware that he and the
film would have looked better if he had made his victim do more
talking while saying a lot less himself. This might have drawn us
into the mysteries of his character. But Billy, no grabber to begin
with, turns pretty banal pretty fast.
</P>
<P>
   He takes the dancer home with him at gunpoint, although it's
quite plain she's curious enough to go willingly. Gallo reveals a
flair for black humor in his depiction of Billy's parents, whose
response to him runs a narrow gamut from anger to virtual denial of
his existence. As the reasons for his insecurities and troubles
become over-apparent, it's wryly amusing to watch him turn
invisible in the eyes of his fanatical Buffalo Bills football fan
mother (played by a virtually unrecognizable Anjelica Huston), who
still resents the fact that she was pulled away from a playoff game
to give birth to him. Meanwhile, his gruff father, played by Ben
Gazzara, ignores Billy to grope the young woman he's told is his
daughter in law.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo chews on Billy's pain in his airless childhood home, in a
bowling alley where he takes Ricci to revisit his past, and in a
diner where he runs into a slatternly girl (played by Rosanna
Arquette) who was the unrequited love of his life and who barely
remembers him. The question is what, if anything, Billy is going to
do once he threatens to shoot the retired Bills kicker whose missed
field goal led to the lost bet that sent Billy to jail. The trouble
is that our interest in Billy has long since been exhausted and our
interest in Ricci's improbably pliant and complaisant character is
left unsupplied.
</P>
<P>
   He should have allowed Ricci's Layla to talk more. She's a
cipher, who exists solely as a projection of Billy's longing for
uncritical adoration and the infinite patience and attention he
never got as a child. But even though she seems little more than a
male fantasy, with no back story, nobody in her life to wonder what
happened to her, Ricci makes Layla compelling, a tough, overripe
kewpie doll with a complex play of feelings in her eyes that the
screenplay never gets near. Gallo is a talented and energetic new
face, with an ability to estheticize bleakness. But, succumbing to
overindulgence, he shortchanges his film of the most interesting
thing in it.

PESTICIDE COMPANY TO REMOVE ARSENIC AT THREE SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pesticide company accused of contaminating four northeast
Texas sites with massive amounts of arsenic has settled with the
state, ending a series of disputes that spanned almost four
decades, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Bonham, Texas-based Voluntary Purchasing Groups
are not acknowledging responsibility for the contamination, but
they have agreed to pay $2.5 million to the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission, agency spokesman Patrick Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, VPG has agreed to spend up to $800,000 to develop
11.2 acres of freshwater wetlands and another 4.5 acres of
shoreline habitat, Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   VPG officials also agreed to enter the commission's Voluntary
Cleanup Program, in which the company will be required to remove
arsenic at two Bonham sites and one in nearby Ridgeway, Shaughnessy
said. Cleanup in neighboring Commerce, the fourth site, was
completed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   VPG, which blends and distributes pesticides and fertilizers
under the product brand names Hi-Yield and Ferti-Lome, has been
accused of arsenic contamination virtually since it began
operations in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Large doses of arsenic are fatal, and repeated exposure to low
levels of the heavy metal can cause lung, skin, liver, bladder and
kidney cancers, the state Health Department has reported.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of cleaning up the Bonham and Ridgeway sites has not
been determined, Shaughnessy said, but state officials at one time
estimated that it would be about $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   Once commission officials have approved VPG's cleanup of the
sites, documents will be filed with the company's property deeds
stating that future owners will not be held liable by the state for
any problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will settle all claims we have against the company,''
Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which a judge approved Monday after bankruptcy
court negotiations between the company and the Texas attorney
general's office, ``is significant and unusual,'' Shaughnessy said.
The large financial settlement is not a record, but it is uncommon,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   VPG President Bill Turnage was out of town Wednesday and could
not be reached to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham Mayor Bryan Peeler said he was unaware of the settlement,
and never really knew much about the contamination. He said he did
not follow the litigation closely, in part because the company's
current facility is outside Bonham's city limits.
</P>
<P>
   The other Bonham site to be cleaned is near downtown, within the
city limits. Before moving to its current facility outside town,
VPG operated a small plant there. State officials found arsenic
contamination at the site and filed a complaint, which was later
withdrawn because the state was unable to link the contamination to
VPG, which no longer owned the property. However, the company has
agreed to clean up the site.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler said he is pleased that the downtown site will be cleaned
up because it will make the property more marketable.
</P>
<P>
   The town's mayor since last year, Peeler said most Bonham
residents don't know that sites on the company's properties are
contaminated. ``Most folks, if you took a general poll, would be
totally unaware of the lawsuit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   VPG, based in Commerce until 1971, was one of several companies
named by state officials as potentially responsible for arsenic
contamination in the Commerce neighborhood that surrounds the
now-abandoned plant site.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Protection Agency officials finished the cleanup
in Commerce in 1995, including removing contaminated soil from
residents' yards and replacing it with untainted soil. VPG
allocated millions of dollars for the cleanup. Large portions of
the neighborhood around the site were fenced off, with warning
signs posted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, officials with the Texas Agriculture Department and the
conservation commission began investigating allegations that the
company improperly dumped chemical waste on the Bonham site, which
they opened shortly after closing the Commerce plant.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham resident Mary Lankford, whose property adjoined the
plant, had complained that cattle were dropping dead on land
between her house and the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lord, they were lying in the waterways, down the fence
line,'' Lankford said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   The investigation came to a halt in 1993 when VPG officials
declined to allow state officials onto the plant site.
</P>
<P>
   The case lingered until 1995, when company officials settled a
portion of the case, paying $30,000. The rest of the case was
transferred back to the conservation commission.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1996, VPG filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
U.S. District Court in Plano.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy proceedings delayed lawsuits filed by about 1,500
residents who claimed that contamination in Commerce and Bonham
caused deaths, created emotional distress and lowered property
values.
</P>
<P>
   VPG attorneys have said they filed for bankruptcy protection to
end the barrage of lawsuits being filed against them in Tarrant,
Hunt and Dallas counties.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the company's reorganization plan, VPG officials set
aside about $10 million to settle lawsuits filed against them,
primarily by Bonham and Commerce residents, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A committee that includes several attorneys has been formed to
help decide who gets money and how much they will receive.

THE END OF THE WORLD, AGAIN

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ARMAGEDDON 
Directed by: Michael Bay 
Screenplay by: Jonathan Hensleigh 
Starring: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck,
Will Patton, Peter Stormare, Keith David, Steve Buscemi 
Running time: 150 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sci-fi disaster action, sensuality and brief
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' is big and noisy and stupid and shameless and
it's going to be huge at the box office. Never mind what you hear
about the movie's low-tech oil riggers sent into space to blow up a
Texas-sized asteroid before it creams our planet. ``Armageddon''
isn't really about an asteroid attack. It's about a testosterone
attack. Guys whose idea of a good movie consists of watching things
get blown up to an amped-up soundtrack are going to be happy with
this one, even if it seems no more than an attitude-heavy recycling
of ``Deep Impact.'' Just to make sure the frenzy concept stays
upfront, director Michael Bay shakes the camera a lot as the heroes
blast off and favors a rapid-fire cutting style that raises the
question of whether the world is going to be saved by America or by
MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Blast is the operative word here, as it usually is in films
produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the high-energy advocate behind this
one. ``Armageddon'' is a manufactured object that parodies itself
in the image of a big heavy thing about to be dropped on us from a
great height. You probably won't be furrowing your brow wondering
if the heroes do the job. We're still here, right? Still, one sign
of a truly advanced civilization is that in a given summer you can
have a choice of killer comet movies. We now have two, and compared
with ``Armageddon,'' ``Deep Impact'' is the one that seems as
multilayered as ``Ulysses.'' Lest your week be ruined by the idea
of the planet getting off clean, enough pieces of the asteroid make
their way to Earth to let the film have it both ways and dish out
some spectacular destruction, especially to major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, you're tempted to cheer for the asteroid, the only
counterinfluence being Bruckheimer's shrewdness in casting a
screenful of fresh faces and independent-movie mainstays. They take
the sting out of the blatant manipulation and utter predictability
of this film that has to be called escapist, if only because of the
frequency with which you find yourself wanting to escape it. Since
Hollywood is hooked on thinking ever bigger, it won't come as a
surprise that ``Armageddon'' throws a bigger space menace at us
than ``Deep Impact'' does, although in cruder fashion. Think of it
as ``The Dirty Fourteen'' in space suits.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, when you want to save the world, who ya gonna
call? Bruce Willis, of course. As the roughneck oil driller, he
almost charms his way past the trashy material by his ability to
convey the idea that there's always a part of him hanging back, not
taking too seriously anything we see him do. The film also shrewdly
makes him the father of the love interest, not the male end of it.
The boy-girl stuff is left to Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck, whose
youth and intensity make it seem almost alive.
</P>
<P>
   Casting Affleck and Tyler was a smart way to ensure that this
hard-hitting crunchorama will also become a date movie. The urgency
and emotions on the faces of both proclaim that while this may be
each one's first big mass-market broad-brush studio project, it
won't be their last. In fact, if you can ignore the basic dumbness
of the story line and superficiality of the characters, there's a
lot to enjoy, thanks almost entirely to the venturesome casting.
Billy Bob Thornton, for instance, arrives at more than a few
resourceful colorations of the role of the guy fretting back at
mission control, and Steve Buscemi's loose-cannon nervousness
enables him to exchange cliche for entertainment value, too, as a
bosom-fixated genius.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Stormare, the brutal silent killer alongside Buscemi in
``Fargo,'' energizes his role as a Mir-based cosmonaut who's part
of the planet-saving team, finding ways to put fresh spin on the
mad Russian caricature he's been handed. Owen Wilson, of ``Bottle
Rocket'' fame, is another source of freshness, and Will Patton
shades his astronaut's role with rueful facial expressions. Give
them credit; when this umpteenth visit to the planet of the big
bangs is watchable, they're almost always the reason. The
fabricated brand of can-do spirit battling the asteroid is dwarfed
by the can-do spirit the actors muster to get through the movie.

STUDY FORECASTS BEARISH TIMES FOR NEW YORK'S ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN D. ABBEY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wall Street's boom has artificially lifted New
York's economy and masked underlying weak job growth, particularly
in upstate New York, according to a study by a leading private
economic consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   New York state's employment growth will be the slowest in the
nation from 1998 to 2002, at an average of 0.4 percent a year, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI study said.
</P>
<P>
   The government quickly denounced the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely wrong,'' said Stephen Kagann, chief economist
for Gov. George Pataki. ``I'm surprised by it, stunned by it. I
can't believe they put this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagann said the number of new factories and businesses in New
York had soared in the last few years, which means there will be
even more jobs in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnaround in New York's economy is not a temporary
phenomenon,'' Kagann said.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Council of New York State Inc. said the report
failed to recognize the state's gains.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Lexington, Mass.-based Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI
predicted an ``economic slowdown over the next five years'' brought
on by weak population growth and income gains harmed by job cuts in
manufacturing and commercial banking.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the study said, limited demand for goods and
services will curb expansion of retail, service and real estate
markets. Kagann said that the next time the national economy turns
negative, New York will fare better than in the past because of tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that when we have the next national downturn, we will
do much, much better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the recent surge in stock market profits spurred
economic growth in metropolitan New York and boosted personal
income levels by 5.3 percent last year, including a record $10.2
billion in Wall Street bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that improvement led to last year's expansion in
consumer and retail trade, the largest percentage gain in total
employment since 1988 and a $1.8 billion state budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the study said, the advances could be short-lived,
because New York's population is growing by 0.1 percent a year and
personal income growth is expected to be the eighth lowest in the
nation in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial services generates nearly 30 percent of New York's
gross state product,'' said Standard &AMP; Poor's economist Sara
Johnson, ``but the concentration of financial service companies in
New York City and Long Island makes the state uniquely vulnerable
to volatility in the U.S. securities market.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that even though New York has a diverse economy, its
dependence on financial services is risky in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Business Council spokesman Robert Ward said that Wall Street,
while an inherently risky place, is only going to grow in the
future as more money continues to pour into stocks, especially if
Social Security privatizes some of its investments.
</P>
<P>
   But Ward said he agreed with the study's call for further tax
cuts and improvements in the business climate.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the state's high tax rates and uncompetitive
costs are driving out businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is now losing market share in every sector of the
economy,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did praise Pataki's Republican administration for recent
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, state government is addressing the high cost of
doing business by lowering corporate and property taxes,'' she
said. ``These initiatives should have a positive impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The study doesn't provide an unremittingly bleak view of New
York's economy. It says that New York will enjoy another year of
solid employment gains in 1998, about 1.4 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   But it said employment growth will slow in the next few years
because of hits to commercial banking and manufacturing.

RIGHT ON PRINCIPLE, OFF ON THE NEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it came time to be counted, one man stood up for artistic
freedom in America. He is a bit of an odd duck. When not in
Washington, he lives alone in a small town in New Hampshire. His
idea of a hot author is Henry Adams. If you offered him a free
ticket to see performance ``artist'' Karen Finley smear her naked
body with chocolate and alfalfa sprouts to protest the oppression
of women, he would politely decline. His name is David Souter.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Supreme Court handed down its long-awaited ruling
on government funding for the arts. By an 8-1 majority in Finley v.
National Endowment for the Arts, the court upheld a 1990 law
requiring the NEA to observe ``general standards of decency'' when
doling out grants. The dissenter was David Souter.
</P>
<P>
   Couched in legal mumbo jumbo, Supreme Court decisions can be
hard to understand. This one is no exception. Liberals moaned about
the ``chilling effect'' of Finley. Conservatives couldn't figure
out what it meant. Newt Gingrich loved it; Justice Antonin Scalia,
who voted with the majority, hated it.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the court's finger-in-the-wind trimmers diluted
Finley's impact by insisting that the 1990 law was merely
``advisory.'' No guts, no glory; no grants. The court's
pusillanimous center caved in to the far right while ensuring that
a silver-spoon Cambridge ``liberal'' like Steve Breyer will still
get invited to the right cocktail parties on the Vineyard this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the sound of a clear mind at work. Here is the first
paragraph of Justice Souter's lonely dissent: ``The question here
is whether this statute is unconstitutional on its face: It is.''
Although his opinion plumbs the many subtleties of Finley, his
prose remains as clear as Lake Chocorua's waters. After citing
numerous Supreme Court decisions reinforcing the idea ``that the
First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict
expression because of its message,'' he concludes: ``It goes
without saying that artistic expression lies within this First
Amendment protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Now for the kicker. I think Souter is right on form, but wrong
on content. On arts funding, I am a pure Jacobin, meaning a
down-the-line supporter of Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby, who has
written several columns trashing the NEA. Not enough ill can befall
the NEA, which simultaneously craps all over deeply held moral
values and religious beliefs while snaking its surly hand into
taxpayers' pockets.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, conservative commentators have gone too easy on the
NEA. Much of what jokers like have-museum-will-travel David Ross
and the Guggenheim's Thomas Krens call ``art'' is just smoke blown
in the face of rich, ignorant collectors, with the Greek Chorus of
High Art critics/medicine men hooting in the background. When I was
a callow teenager, I used to opine that modern art ended with Piet
Mondrian. Thirty years later, I'm not so sure I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But I digress. Here's Barbara Grossman, who leveraged her
friendship with the Clintons into a nebulous NEA sinecure, assuring
Jacoby that the endowment's days of underwriting Andres Serrano's
``Piss Christ'' and Robert Mapplethorpe's perversions are over.
Wrong! Last year, the NEA sent money to an arts center in Buffalo
to finance the screening of ``We're Talking Vulva,'' a video of
dancing lesbians dressed up as vaginas. Ross's trashy Whitney
Museum featured what one reviewer called a ``perverted Santa's
workshop'' with naked female elves defecating into buckets.
Naturally, the Whitney feasts at the NEA trough. (Ross has since
moved on.) The sooner the endowment is put out of business, the
better.
</P>
<P>
   You think I've forgotten about David Souter? Quite the contrary.
Even though I disagree with him, I realize that Souter knows more
about freedom of expression than any Globe columnist or any
phony-baloney, grant-grubbing ``artist'' will ever know. (And other
freedoms as well. It was Souter who saved Roe v. Wade, you may
remember.) And if he defends Karen Finley and Robert Mapplethorpe,
that's a small price to pay for real freedom. God bless the little
man from New Hampshire.

ANOTHER CLASSIC FOR FENWAY IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball's All-Star Game will be played at Coors Field next
week, and Hub fans already know which Boston ballplayer(s) will
represent the Red Sox. Mo Vaughn, Pedro Martinez, and Tom Gordon
are the Boston representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the big story _ one that has gone largely unnoticed around
here _ is that next summer's All-Star Game will be played at Fenway
Park on Tuesday, July 13. It will be the toughest ticket in the
history of Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation for the Fenway All-Star Game started last August and
next week the Red Sox will send a contingent of more than 25 people
(not counting messrs. Vaughn, Martinez, and Co.) to see how the
Game is run. Boston mayor Thomas Menino and his convention bureau
minions will be among the Fenway fact-finders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big undertaking,'' admits Red Sox vice president Dick
Bresciani, the man in charge of All-Star Fenway '99.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Baseball's midsummer classic has grown into a monstrous
five-day festival which includes a Fanfest (expected to draw
125,000 people, site still unknown), and the popular new home run
contest held on Workout Monday. No doubt thousands of mitt-wielding
souvenir hunters will stake out Lansdowne Street when Mark McGwire
and Co. do the Green Monster Mash.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are a Red Sox season ticket holder or a personal
friend of John Harrington, forget about tickets. Bresciani says all
full-plan Sox season ticket holders will be able to purchase All
Star tickets, but Major League Baseball will gobble the rest.
You'll have an easier time trying to score ducats to the Ryder Cup
at the Country Club in September.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the third time the All-Star game has visited
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway's first All Star game was played on July 9, 1946, and Ted
Williams led the American League to a 12-0 victory, going 4 for 4
with two homers and five RBIs. The Red Sox were en route to their
first American League pennant since 1918 and eight Boston players _
Williams, Dom DiMaggio, Bobby Doerr, Rudy York, Hal Wagner, Dave
Ferriss, Mickey Harris, and Johnny Pesky _ graced the AL roster.
Pesky, Dom DiMaggio, Williams, and Doerr batted 1-2-3-5 in the
American League lineup. Joe DiMaggio got hurt in Philadelphia the
day before the game and begged off _ just like a '90s player.
</P>
<P>
   The Fenway press box could not accommodate 195 writers, so
temporary press seating was built on the roof. These seats
eventually became Fenway's permanent roof boxes, among the best
seats at the old yard.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Feller _ on his way to a 26-win, 348-strikeout season,
started for the American League and pitched three shutout innings.
Williams' first home run, off Brooklyn righty Kirby Higbe, came in
the fourth inning to give the Americans a 3-0 lead. But it was
Ted's second blast that made the '46 All-Star Game memorable.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the eighth inning, with the game hopelessly out
of reach for the National League, manager Charley Grimm called for
Pittsburgh righty Rip Sewell. Sewell's best-known pitch was the
infamous ``eephus'' ball. A half-century before Jerry Seinfeld
turned ``nothing'' into millions, Sewell confused National League
batters with a high, slow parabola which dropped down through the
strike zone as if it has fallen from an overhead blimp. Before the
'46 Classic, Williams asked Sewell if he'd dare throw ``that damned
crazy pitch'' in the All-Star Game, and Sewell promised to throw
one to The Kid.
</P>
<P>
   And so when Ted strode to the plate with the American League
leading, 9-0, and two runners aboard, the time seemed ripe for
Sewell to have a little fun. On his first delivery, Sewell wound up
mightily, then floated an eephus toward home plate. Williams almost
hurt himself with a wicked cut which resulted in a feeble pop, out
of play. The next pitch was another moonball, outside for ball one.
After sneaking a fastball past Williams to run the count to 1-2,
Sewell tried another eephus pitch and Williams literally stepped
into the ball and smacked it into the bullpen. Ted laughed all the
way around the bases. According to Sewell, Williams was the only
man who ever hit an eephus pitch for a home run.
</P>
<P>
   The game drew 34,906 to Fenway and was considered a dress
rehersal for the 1946 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, the All Star Game returned to Fenway on
July 31, 1961. Led by Whitey Ford, player representatives from the
18 big league teams spent the morning at the Statler Hilton
drafting a letter asking owners to eliminate segregated housing at
spring training sites. The West Coast of Florida was cited as a
trouble spot.
</P>
<P>
   The game was televised by NBC (Ch. 4 locally) with Curt Gowdy
and Joe Garigiola behind the mikes. It did not sell out. Tickets
cost $6 and $8 and only 31,851 saw the American and National
Leaguers battle to a 1-1 tie, called at the end of nine innings
because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   There was some grumbling about commissioner Ford Frick's
decision when the skies cleared an hour after Frick sent everyone
home. It's the only tie in All-Star history.
</P>
<P>
   Much slugging was expected at Fenway, but little materialized as
seven hurlers _ Bob Purkey, Art Mahaffey, Sandy Koufax, Stu Miller,
Jim Bunning, Don Schwall, and Camilo Pasqual _ held the All Star
batters to a combined total of two runs and nine hits. This was the
year in which Roger Maris would hit 61 homers and teammate Mickey
Mantle would add 54. They went 0 for 4 at Fenway in the All-Star
Game. The AL run came on a first inning homer into the net by Rocky
Colavito (off a Purkey changeup).
</P>
<P>
   The 1961 National League All Star lineup had Hank Aaron, Eddie
Mathews, Willie Mays, and Ernie Banks, all members of the 500-homer
club, but only Mays managed a hit and it was a single. The '61 game
was the only Fenway appearance for Koufax, Mays, Banks, and Roberto
Clemente. Warren Spahn, then a 298-game winner, was awarded a
standing ovation from the fans who remembered his Boston Braves
days and said ``This is the greatest thing that ever happened to me
in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Musial is the only player who performed in both Fenway
All-Star Games, and the new Sox committee ought to think about
inviting Stan The Man back for Fenway '99.
</P>
<P>
   But Ted gets to throw out the first ball _ just as he did in
'61.

A SOUND INVESTMENT IN ID TAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time a song from one of his music production company's
compact discs is played, Andrew P. Mark hears the sound of money
clinking.
</P>
<P>
   Mark is president of BRG Music Works, a division of Jacor
Communications Inc., which produces background music for 2,000
radio stations nationwide. He has digitally watermarked his songs
with MusiCode, indelibly imprinting a unique identification number
into the soundwaves. When picked up by a decoder, the ID number can
document that Mark's song was played on the radio, entitling his
company to a royalty payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a great payday for us,'' says Mark about MusiCode,
which was created by Aris Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Aris is betting on Mark and other music-industry executives to
turn MusiCode into the worldwide watermarking standard. One of a
dozen or so companies that constitute the infant digital
watermarking industry, Aris depends on MusiCode's market
penetration for success.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the start-up firm, founded in 1995 and privately owned
and financed, has not turned a profit. President and cofounder
Gregory L. Wertheimer esti-mates Aris might pass the break-even
point in about a year. But company officials are already signing up
customers and planning spinoff products modeled on MusiCode.
</P>
<P>
   Digital watermarking is an attempt to solve one of the
fundamental problems of intellectual property: Who owns what?
Unlike books or other printed materials, audio recordings do not
ordinarily include the name of the composer, performer, or
recording company. The music industry needed a way to stamp the
owner's name directly onto the music.
</P>
<P>
   To solve this problem, watermarks like MusiCode imprint a
digital signal within audio recordings, including songs,
advertising jingles, and background music for such features as
radio traffic reports. Once the code is embedded, a decoder can
pick up the signal.
</P>
<P>
   Because the watermark enters the music during the recording
process, it can appear only on new recordings, including rereleases
of old songs. But David E. Leibowitz, vice chairman at Aris,
estimates the majority of songs played on the radio turn over about
once every three years. ``It's a forward-looking technology,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Aris envisions several applications for MusiCode, a patented
technology for which the company recently received a Discover Award
1998, in the sound category, from Discover magazine. &UR;  &LR; The original
idea was to encode music so that drivers could see a song's title
and artist on a display screen in their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was what got me intrigued,'' remembers Wertheimer, who
heard about the idea at a dinner party at his house. ``Then we went
to the (recording) industry, and they said, `That's nice, and we
like that feature, but there are other applications.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most eagerly awaited uses of MusiCode involves
fighting electronic music piracy. The process could embed a
transaction code within the watermark that identifies not only the
artist and record company, but also the name of the person who
purchased the song and the company that sold it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this use becomes widespread, when people know that music
has this information on it, they're going to think twice about
putting it on (computer) bulletin boards or making unauthorized
copies, because it's traced back to them,'' says Leibowitz.
</P>
<P>
   But chief among the uses for watermarking is royalty-payment
enforcement. Every time a song is played publicly, whether on a
jukebox, in a nightclub, or on radio or TV, the copyright owner is
entitled to a royalty payment. Currently, three federally licensed
royalty-collection societies operate in the United States, tracking
the number of times music is played and making sure performers,
composers, and recording companies get their payments.
</P>
<P>
   Without an electronic solution, the royalty societies employ
workers to write down the names of songs broadcast over the radio
and on TV. In the future, a more efficient method, says Aris chief
technology officer Joseph Winograd, would be MusiCode-watermarked
music and a decoder ``in a closet someplace'' within broadcast
reach of every radio station in the country. Aris recently signed a
joint marketing agreement with Lucent Technologies Inc. to market a
watermarking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a continuous 24-hour basis, it monitors the broadcast
audio,'' Winograd says. ``When it sees or hears the watermark, it
records it and sends it to us over a telephone or Internet
connection, and we send (the customer) a log either daily or
weekly.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for MusiCode came from Jack Wolosewicz, Aris's
cofounder and an engineer who sits on the board of directors but no
longer works for the company. He pitched the idea to Wertheimer, an
entrepreneur and financier, who brought together a number of
private investors. Winograd, 30, joined Aris from Boston
University's electrical engineering department, where he had been
researching digital signals.
</P>
<P>
   Aris is building a customer base slowly; BRG Music Works is the
only music production company to have signed on thus far. But
Nashville-based SESAC, the smallest of the royalty agencies, has
signed an agreement and will launch its MusiCode decoders Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   SESAC chose Aris not only because it thought MusiCode was the
best watermarking technology, but also because Aris has connections
to the Recording Industry Association of America, which will play
an important role in deciding which of the competing watermark
firms becomes the de facto standard. The company making the chosen
watermark stands to gain by supplying encoding software and
decoding machines to record companies, consumer electronics
manufacturers, and royalty societies.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Leibowitz comes in. When Aris hired him as vice
chairman, they selected a lawyer whose last job, as executive vice
president and general counsel to Washington-based RIAA, put him at
the heart of the watermark-standard debate.
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz's contacts impressed SESAC president and chief
operating officer Bill Velez. The RIAA is ``going to be an
important body in terms of which company wins and becomes the
standard,'' Velez says.
</P>
<P>
   The task of defining the new watermarking standard rests with
the Muse Project, a committee of the International Federation of
Phonographic Industries, a European trade group. This October, the
Muse judges are expected to release their report, which,
watermarking companies hope, will name one watermark as technically
superior to its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But with the choice of standards still undecided, few watermark
companies in this highly contentious industry have licensed their
technology or lined up customers for their decoders. And the size
of the market itself is undefined.
</P>
<P>
   Because digital watermarking technology is so new, Aris
officials don't know how large the market for MusiCode might be.
``You really can't define it,'' says Wertheimer. ``We're developing
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes that 4.2 billion CDs are sold annually worldwide but
declines to say how much Aris could make if every new song were
watermarked with MusiCode. Competitors similarly say they can't put
an exact figure on the market for watermarks, especially since each
firm has different plans for its technology.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall L. Snyder, executive vice president of Arbitron New
Media, a division of Ceridian Corp. (a Minneapolis company that
makes the competing watermark CBET), says his firm's business model
anticipates a market of $30 million to $50 million per year. But
unlike Aris, Arbitron, an audience-information services company,
plans to use its watermarks to provide music companies with
information on where and how often their songs are being played for
market research purposes. Additional applications could also
increase CBET's potential market beyond what MusiCode could expect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainty over the future of watermarking, Aris
and its competitors are optimistic about the industry's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``In five years, hopefully we'll have computers and consumer
electronics and everything in place'' for fully-integrated digital
watermarking, says David W. Stebbings, senior vice president for
technology at the RIAA. ``Hopefully the marketplace will provide
consumer enjoyment and information of this type.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And supporters of Aris say they're confident MusiCode will
prevail in the watermark-standard contest. Doug A. Wood, president
of Port Washington, N.Y.-based Franklin Douglas Inc., a music
production company, has evaluated Musi-Code and is considering
adopting the watermark for his background-music CDs. When he tested
MusiCode by broadcasting music and then reading the watermark off
the airwaves, the identifying code came through clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like shooting fish in a barrel,'' he says. ``There's a
very good chance we might be using it.''

SAN ANTONIO UPS MONEY OFFER FOR GOP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANITA McDIVITT  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ San Antonio community leaders have quietly
increased their bid for the 2000 Republican National Convention to
$21.5 million after comparing their original proposal to those of
other cities and finding it lacking.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 million increase in proposed private funding was
confirmed Tuesday at a news conference to promote the convention as
a means of helping the GOP attract Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler, co-chairman of the San Antonio
Convention 2000 Host Committee, said the decision to increase San
Antonio's bid came Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have upped the bid from the private sector to $15.235
million to cover all the forseeable costs,'' Loeffler said. By
comparison, New York bid $40 million for the event and Chicago's
package is estimated at $25.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new figure was discussed during a private two-hour
presentation by San Antonio city and business leaders to the site
selection committee, Loeffler said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP officials and members of the site selection committee have
stressed during their three-day visit to the Alamo City that a city
can't buy the convention. Nonetheless, funding is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't the money per se,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of
the Republican National Committee. ``The money is relevant only to
the degree that it's (enough) to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeffler said San Antonio's bid was not increased ``in a sense
of scrambling to outbid someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we reflected upon our bid here in San Antonio, quite
frankly, there was a question of the cost of the stage, which is a
huge cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman with The Freeman Cos., which contracted with the RNC
to build the stages for the past four conventions, said the total
cost for the San Diego convention in 1996 was $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Loeffler said, in comparison with the bids put up by competing
cities for the 2000 convention, ``we felt we had probably
underbid'' the stage construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Eight cities _ San Antonio, Philadelphia, Charlotte, N.C., New
York, New Orleans, Chicago, Indianapolis and Minneapolis _ are
fiercely competing for the Republican mega-event.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is an incalculable amount of national media coverage
for the host city, and an estimated $100 million to $200 million
economic impact from spending by 35,000 conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Loeffler said the extra money for the bid will come from private
donations, not from taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the City Council passed a ``not-to-exceed''
ordinance that limited the city's contribution to $6.3 million,
most of which will come in the form of city services such as
transportation and security for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the GOP site selection committee wrapped up their
visit to San Antonio Tuesday after two days of wining and dining
and a pep rally in the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic officials at Tuesday's news conference said having
the convention in San Antonio would allow the party to showcase a
``different face of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's message of less government, fewer regulations,
educational opportunity and entrepreneurial values makes us a
natural ally to the Hispanic community,'' said Tony Garza of
Brownsville, Texas, a former Texas secretary of state who is
running for state railroad commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, local Republicans believe San Antonio is making a good
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very good about our prospects,'' said U.S. Rep. Henry
Bonilla, R-San Antonio. ``It's still early in the game.''

CALLING INTO QUESTION AT&AMP;T'S ACQUISITION OF TCI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, chairman of AT&AMP;T Corp., says his company's
acquisition of cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. will give
consumers a single source for a panoply of services _ from long
distance to ``broadband services'' like video and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will combine the best name in the (long-distance)
industry with the best broadband company in the industry,'' he said
last week in announcing the $32 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   The logic seems compelling: With TCI and affiliated cable
systems, the New York-based telecommunications company would have a
direct link into about one-third of the nation's homes. Those
customers could generate billions in new revenue from local phone
service, Internet access, and movies-on-demand. Moreover, AT&AMP;T
could avoid some of the billions in fees it pays local carriers for
using their networks to start and finish long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics see it differently.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, they note, AT&AMP;T spent heavily to break
into the $110 billion local phone market, which it was forced to
abandon in 1984 with the court-ordered dismantling of the Bell
System. Four billion dollars later, its effort to bridge the ``last
mile'' _ the gap between AT&AMP;T's long-distance network and homes and
small businesses _ has failed to pay off. The TCI takeover, critics
say, is a pricey and risky ``Plan B.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the obstacles:
</P>
<P>
   TCI's network is not ready for the digital age. Although half of
its cable systems use modern fiber-optic technology, only 30
percent of the lines can handle two-way transmission _ vital to
telephone and Internet access. Upgrading the rest will be
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T will still lack ``last-mile'' coverage to two-thirds of US
households.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how strong demand will be for broadband services
or how much consumers will be willing to pay. For starters, TCI
cable subscribers will need set-top boxes costing $400 to $500 to
get phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Melding the two companies will be difficult, and AT&AMP;T's track
record with big acquisitions is mixed. Its buyout of McCaw Cellular
has been a success, but it stumbled badly _ and lost billions _
when it bought computer maker NCR Corp. (NCR was later spun off to
shareholders.) Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T must digest Teleport Communications
Group Inc., a provider of local and long-distance services to big
businesses that AT&AMP;T agreed to acquire in January for $11.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Early reaction to the TCI deal among investors has been
negative. AT&AMP;T's stock has fallen 12.7 percent since it was
announced, closing Friday at 56 3/4. To be sure, the decline partly
reflects short-term fears about the hit AT&AMP;T will take on its
earnings. But analysts say it also demonstrates skepticism about
whether AT&AMP;T can win its bet on cable.

   ``AT&AMP;T has three things to do, starting with spending about $9
billion to upgrade TCI's cable facilities to be able to deliver the
new services,'' said Howard Anderson, managing director of the
Yankee Group, a Boston market research firm. ``Second, it has to
build a single network for local and long distance, voice and data,
consumer and businesses. ... And finally, protect its base of big
corporate customers through Teleport.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a tall order _ especially at a time when AT&AMP;T must
defend its long-distance turf from rivals like MCI Communications
Corp., Sprint Corp., and the Baby Bells, if, as expected, they get
permission from regulators to enter the business.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has another challenge: improving the image of the
fragmented cable TV industry, which annually comes under state and
federal scrutiny for escalating rates. It also has a reputation for
sloppy service and support.
</P>
<P>
   TCI, for example, does not have the stellar customer
satisfaction ratings that other regional cable companies enjoy,
according to a recent Yankee Group study. Thus, if customers are
unhappy with the quality of their cable TV service, they are less
likely to add AT&AMP;T for telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask any customer of cable and telephone service which is more
reliable and the perception is always that the phone is far better
both in quality and reliability _ issues AT&AMP;T will have to deal
with now,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications analyst based
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   To reach a broader national audience, AT&AMP;T, with 90 million
long-distance customers, must expand geographically and persuade
other cable operators to join it in pursuit of providing customers
with end-to-end communications.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong acknowledges AT&AMP;T cannot buy the other major cable
carriers, some of which have longstanding alliances that could
prevent a takeover frenzy. Time Warner Inc., one of the largest
cable operators, has a partnership with U S West Inc., the
Denver-based regional Bell company.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and others maintain that AT&AMP;T's strategy to provide a
basket of communications services via cable is simply one approach
and that long-distance carriers such as Sprint and the regional
Bell companies will also provide similar services using different
technologies, including fiber optics or wireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Sony Betamax vs. VHS battle, where one will
prevail over the other,'' said Kagan. ``Everyone wants to get to
the same finish line and there are many paths that will take you
there.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if AT&AMP;T is successful, it could gain a higher portion
of spending by packaging, for example, cable television, local
telephone, and Internet access service for one set monthly price,
with cellular service thrown in for free. Such combinations on a
single bill could give AT&AMP;T a major boost over its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will connect personal computers, television sets, phones,
and a whole new generation of interactive devices,'' said John
Malone, chairman of TCI, which is based in Englewood, Colo. ``Would
you like to order Viagra while watching your favorite entertainment
show? Just point and click.''
</P>
<P>
   Importantly, the promise of AT&AMP;T competing aggressively for
local phone service has encouraged regulators frustrated by the
lack of competition since the passage of the Telecommunications Act
of 1996. The bill removed the regulatory barriers separating the
local, long-distance, and cable industries, with the aim of luring
players in each of those markets to expand into the others. In the
last two years, however, most of the action has involved
consolidation within those sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see if AT&AMP;T is committed to investing in advanced
facilities and competing head to head with local phone companies to
provide high-speed voice and data to the home,'' William Kennard,
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said last week.
``That's what makes this deal thinkable.''

WORKING WITHOUT A RETAINER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here today, gone tomorrow. It's happened so many times in Felipe
Alou's tenure as manager of the Expos, he barely feels the pain.
Alou still enjoys his trips to the ballpark. The yearly shuffle of
players and front office people out of town is simply the way of
life in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   You need to know this because the Montreal club that arrived at
Fenway Park last night was replete with names that you'll soon
forget but, a year or two later, will emerge as stars _ on another
team. That is the Expos' history.
</P>
<P>
   Where do you think Tim Raines, Andres Gal-arraga, Marquis
Grissom, Moises Alou, Tim Wallach, Delino DeShields, Wilfredo
Cordero, and Larry Walker came from? They were all Expos, and proud
of it, until they were traded or left as free agents because the
Expos weren't willing to pay out big contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Montreal had an outstanding farm system,
built by Dave Dombrowski, Dan Duquette, Kevin Malone, and Kevin
Kennedy. It supplied the big-league club with enough outstanding
talent to finish second in the National League East in 1992 and
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1994, the Expos astounded the baseball world with a
74-40 record and seemed on their way to the postseason. It never
happened, as a strike cut the season short.
</P>
<P>
   Now Montreal may never see the postseason, at least until the
team owners make the Expos something other than a farm club for the
rest of the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' says Alou, whose own son, Moises, in 1996
became another Montreal star-in-the-making to disappear. ``You
don't like to lose players, but we do all the time. I know this is
not the most glamorous condition for anybody. But I accepted this
job two years ago, when I signed a longterm contract. So why
complain? I love this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou has been in professional baseball for 24 years, the first
17 as a player. ``I belong to a family of baseball players,'' he
said. ``I played with my brothers, Jesus and Matty. I had Moises
for a few years. I've just had a 19-year-old son (Felipe Jr.)
drafted by the Royals. This team is like my family. We are old; we
are young. I see myself as somebody who is responsible for
something. I just don't know what the hell it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou understands that his job as manager is in the dugout and on
the field _ front office politics are beyond his control. The Expos
have the look of an expansion club _ after 30 years in the majors.
No one will ever confuse Montreal with this year's real expansion
clubs, Tampa Bay and Phoenix, whose owners have fat pocketbooks,
made that way by new stadiums with luxury boxes and seat licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, on the other hand, keep seeing attendance shrink _
it's at just over 10,000 fans a game this season. Talk of a new
stadium and a new beginning fills the newspapers and the TV and
radio airwaves. But most Canadians are not reading or listening.
Alou is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got used to it in the minor leagues,'' said Alou, repeating
one of his favorite statements. ``You're given a new team every
year. Like a new class. In the big leagues, you hope you keep the
same team, but it doesn't happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my son left, it was something for which I was prepared.
Other people had left before him. I knew he was vulnerable. But I
knew he would go, too. Especially after Larry Walker was let go. It
was a big thing, a Canadian and being the quality player that he
was. Look at the money he's making. Remember, we're still a small
market.''
</P>
<P>
   With less money to spend on talent, the Expos must rely on other
resources. ``We have to do a lot of things here,'' said Alou. ``And
if we succeed, it's not because we're smart. It's because of hard
work.''
</P>
<P>
   And Alou doesn't miss only his star players. How good could the
Expos be if they had retained the coaches who also went on to
greener pastures?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see,'' he said. ``Joe Kerrigan is with the Red Sox, and
we know about him. Tim Johnson is managing Toronto and Jerry Manuel
the White Sox. Kevin Kennedy left here to manage Texas and then
Boston. We've had some fine people go through here. Sometimes I
think I'm the only one who's sticking with this thing. Of course,
Tommy Harper was here when I arrived. He's a very loyal person and
a hell of a baseball man. I'm glad he stayed with us, teaching the
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou expresses his loyalty by, season after season, getting the
most out of the playing talent he is given by the front office and
farm system. This season he has had to rebuild from a 78-84 club
that lost not only Cy Young Award winner Pedro Martinez but also
Joe Orsulak, David Segui, Henry Rodriguez, Darrin Fletcher, and
Mike Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's team is a very young team,'' said Alou. Evidence
of that: In last night's 7-4 loss to the Red Sox, the young Expos
made four errors. ``This is the most different team I've managed
since I took over. A lot of people still don't understand that we
lost five position players who were regulars on Opening Day. We
also lost Pedro Martinez, and you know how good he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Help may be on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a farm system,'' said Jim Beattie, the Expos'
general manager. ``We didn't make trades just to cut payrolls. We
got some good young talent in return, like a Carl Pavano. You'll
hear from him, as well as several other young players coming
along.''

 &HT;    BOOKS ON DEMAND: A PUBLISHING BREAKTHROUGH?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The book business is turning to a new page:
on-demand printing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it could work in the not-very-distant future. Looking
for a volume of retro rhymes, some bell-bottomed bibliophile will
bop into a local shop and browse menus on the computer screen of an
automatic book machine. Passing a credit card through an electronic
reader, the customer will transmit an order to a digital library,
which will then bounce a signal off a satellite to the book
machine's built-in printer.
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes or so, the book lover will be holding a
fresh paperbound copy of Rod McKuen's ``Listen to the Warm'' _
groovy, but sometimes hard to find, poetry from the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   This emerging technology could resurrect thousands of titles
that have gone out of print and exponentially expand the choices
for book buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have a big impact in terms of customer service,''
said Joyce Meskis, manager of the Tattered Cover Book Store in
Denver, where the first BookMachine(cq) is to be installed by the
end of this year. ``There are so many titles in print that no
bookstore, now matter how large, could stock them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The in-store BookMachine is still being developed by the On
Demand Machine Corp. of St. Louis, but publishers and printers are
already using similar technology to take orders by phone or
Internet to provide next-day service on custom-made books.
</P>
<P>
   Through its Lightning Print Division, for instance, the nation's
largest book wholesaler, Ingram Books, prints books on demand _ as
few as one per order _ in its high-tech facility in LaVergne,
Tenn., and then ships the book or books to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real significance is that a book never has to go out of
print,'' said Larry Brewster, an Ingram vice president and general
manager of Lightning Print. ``In the long run, more books are going
to be available in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The same on-demand principles are being applied to other
elements of the popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, CDnow, a cyberspace record shop, lets customers
create customized CDs by selecting the artists and hits they want
from a Web site catalog of digitalized music. When the order and
credit card authorization are received via the Internet, the
company produces a personalized compact disc and mails it to the
customer. CDnow has licensed 60,000 songs from artists ranging from
Louis Armstrong to Patsy Cline to Bob Marley.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the book business _ burdened by the high costs of
keeping inventory on store shelves and returning unsold volumes _
that foresees quick economic relief from on-demand service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers no longer have to worry about unprofitable print
runs and warehousing costs,'' said Brewster. ``With on-demand
technology, you print to meet your demand _ whether the demand is
one copy or 1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The system reduces publishers' reprint risks for books that sell
slowly or sporadically over a long period. With on-demand printing,
the publisher no longer has to print a minimum run of 1,000 or so
copies and keep the books on shelves until orders hopefully arrive,
or allow books with some, albeit slight, demand to go out of print.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face this issue every month when we have our reprint
meetings,'' said Steven Schragis, publisher of Carol Publishing
Group in New Jersey. ``There are a lot of hard decisions when we're
out of stock on a particular title and fewer than 100 re-orders
come in. This program provides the answer for those books.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Ross, president of On Demand Machine Corp., said the
BookMachine will pay for itself in savings for bookstores. Ross
said $1.64 of the price of every book sold now goes to cover the
costs of shipping, inventory and return of unsold books to the
publisher. The BookMachine will eliminate these expenses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the BookMachine will be leased, rather than sold, to
bookstores in order to ensure quality control. Many authors have
guarantees of print quality written into contracts with publishers,
Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Another major publisher involved in on-demand printing is Simon
&AMP; Shuster, which already has a digital library of 12,000 titles and
is adding 4,000 to 6,000 per year, said Don Seise, assistant vice
president of the company's Demand Production Center in Ramsey, N.J.
Most current on-demand printing is for paperbacks, he said, but
customers will be able to get hardcover books ``very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   While it might cost about $4.32 to print a book in the on-demand
system _ versus $1.85 each using the traditional offset printing
method in a 5,000-book run _ the advantage is obvious if only 200
books sell, Seise pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   The system is especially suited for academic books, where a
college professor might require a class of 50 students to buy a
certain book every semester or where textbooks are frequently
updated, rendering earlier editions obsolete, said Brewster of
Ingram's Lightning Press.
</P>
<P>
   However, on-demand printing will probably not be used for
best-sellers, at least until the technology makes another leap
forward, since traditional printing is cheaper if the books sell
fast and returns are minimal.
</P>
<P>
   So bookstores won't be bookless for a while.

HER GOAL: REACH NEW HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER AND SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The future looks bright for Melissa Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Feinstein, a Weston (Mass.) High graduate who will be
a sophomore at Stanford University, became the US Junior National
champion at the pole vault when she cleared 12 feet, 1 1/2 inches
at the national meet in Edwardsville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was unable to defend her title when she returned
last weekend, she actually vaulted 8 inches higher than last year
for a personal best of 12-9 1/2, good enough for second place and a
trip to France for the World Junior Nationals July 28-Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. ``I was really close at 13-1 1/2,'' she said
in a telephone interview Monday night. ``I was over, but I didn't
lift my elbows enough to clear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boding well for the future, Feinstein cleared that personal-best
vault using a 14-foot pole instead of her usual 13-footer. ``The
bigger the pole, the more risk there is but also the higher you can
jump,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a great year for the 19-year-old, who won the
Pacific-10 title in only her freshman year even as women's pole
vaulting, a relatively new event, is becoming more competitive.
``When I was still jumping at 12-1 1/2, there were 12 girls still
attempting that height, which is amazing,'' said Feinstein of the
junior national field. Last year, only four vaulters were left in a
field of 14, less than half the size of this year's. Samantha
Shepard, a 14-year-old competing for Air Time Athletics of Natick,
Mass., finished fourth at Edwardsville with a jump of that height.
</P>
<P>
   Given the progress Feinstein has made in the past year, she will
likely be in the mix for a spot on the US national team next year
when women's pole vaulting makes its debut at the 1999 World Track
and Field Championships in Seville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot to work on,'' said Feinstein, noting she also
has a lot to look forward to.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Triathlon update
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Gerri Shea listened attentively at the seminar
held by Sally Edwards, as the triathlon guru outlined a six-week
training schedule that she said would guarantee anyone success in
completing a race. Shea will find out Sunday at the Danskin
Triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited, but definitely a little nervous,'' said Shea, who
drove out to Wrentham last week to scout out the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been going well, and I've done back-to-back biking and
running, and swimming and biking, but I haven't put all three
together yet,'' Shea said, who convinced her roommate and a
co-worker to do the race with her.
</P>
<P>
   The plans haven't gone as well for Sue Stockard, who also was at

   Tennis player Elizabeth Freeman-Young, of Newton, Mass.,
recently got word that she'll join three other women in September
to represent the United States in the Young Cup in England in the
Women's 40 division ... The ABL plans to start its third season in
early November, several weeks later than its usual mid-October
kickoff, so its championships won't get lost in the shuffle during
the NCAA Women's Final Four. Meanwhile, the New England Blizzard
has signed its top draft choice, Barbara Farris, to a three-year
contract. Farris is a 6-foot-3-inch center/forward out of Tulane
... Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan shattered Lynn Jennings' 13-year-old
world record for two miles when she ran it in 9 minutes, 19.56
seconds Sunday at a meet in Cork. Amy Rudolph, a Providence College
graduate and 1996 Olympic teammate of Jennings at 5,000 meters,
also broke the old mark in finishing second in 9:21:35, which now
stands as the new American record in the rarely-run distance.
Rudolph also holds the US record in the 5,000.

   Summer is blockbuster season, but still a couple of
entertainment magazines are checking in with the movies'
smarty-pants set. The July  &UR; Movieline &LR;  gets real with David
Duchovny, letting the ``X-Files'' actor exercise his dry wit, spout
some of his Princeton-then-Yale theories, admit to a few personal
failings, and print one of his own poems for all the world to see.
The quips include a wonderful comparison between fame and
Catholicism, ``because you can't do anything without getting
caught,'' and the confessions include his desire to be Mick Jagger
and the obvious fact that David Duchovny thinks an awful lot _
``which is not necessarily an advantage for an actor. Intelligence
and thinking are not what we want from our actors.'' (Maybe that's
why he's turned to his dog for acting tips: ``Just total focus.
Total concentration. Maybe one ear goes back to figure something
out.'')
</P>
<P>
   The poem, however, is surprisingly sophomoric, and not as
inventive as you might expect based on his brainy chitchat. Called
``Cliche Juice,'' it's a pulpy blend of Hallmark sentiments: ``Up
into the wild blue yonder,/ wingless, prayerful that this miracle
of flight/ will not end, just yet. ... Wherever our home may be/
will be/ wherever we happen/ to be.'' Ten minutes with Duchovny is
worlds better than listening to more of Mel Gibson's timeless
wisdom about ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' but, alas, the great Fox Mulder
is no William Shakespeare. &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The July  &UR; GQ &LR;  brings us Ralph Fiennes, another coolly
intelligent actor who once earned a Vanity Fair cover story damning
him for his arrogance. The gentle Brit is not smug anymore, if he
ever was, but he seems to inspire plenty of literary referencing.
Before the piece is over, we've discussed Pushkin's ``Eugene
Onegin,'' Lord Byron, Emily Bronte's Heathcliff, Cormac McCarthy,
Martin Amis, William Faulkner, T.S. Eliot, Ted Hughes, and, of
course, Shakespeare. Fiennes, who ``looks like the kind of man who
might often hear the line `Did anybody ever tell you you look like
Ralph Fiennes?','' is most passionate when talking about ``King
Lear,'' and during his photo shoot, he becomes overwhelmed with
inspiration and recites a bit of Blake for the photographer.
Fiennes, by the way, has bucked the young-actress-older-actor
relationship trend by having a love affair with a woman 17 years
his elder who played Gertrude to his Hamlet, Francesca Annis. &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The July  &UR; Premiere &LR;  takes on Fiennes' costar in ``The
Avengers,'' a forthcoming movie that like ``The X-Files'' thrives
by keeping its main characters in a state of low-key sexual
tension. Uma Thurman, pregnant and married to Ethan Hawke,
apparently expends a lot of energy hiding her fierce intelligence
and her inability to suffer fools. Just don't call her ``The Albert
Einstein of actresses'': ``That's totally insulting!'' she says.
``It's a put-down of all women, certainly all actresses. They say
that about everyone: `And she's smart.' It means underneath it all,
she's not really.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Duchovny shares his forgettable poetry in Movieline, Ethan
Coen gives us a fine short story in  &UR; The New Yorker &LR; . Coen is the
younger half of the Coen Brothers, the filmmaking team that has
given us ``Fargo,'' ``The Big Lebowski,'' and ``Raising Arizona.''
But there is no black humor in ``The Boys,'' which is from Coen's
first collection of stories, ``Gates of Eden,'' due this fall. It's
a fairly depressing snippet of family life, as a father hardly
tolerates a camping trip with his two young sons, who might as well
be aliens. It features a variation of Jack Nicholson's famous diner
scene in ``Five Easy Pieces,'' as the father tries to order an
omelette for his son from a difficult waitress _ but the scene is
tinged with oppression and disappointment, and not rebellion.

   Last September, after Princess Diana was hunted down by a pack
of wild photographers, the world was stricken with remorse and the
paparazzi appeared to realize the dangers of its bloodthirst. But
10 months is forever among the flashbulb set, and already there is
a growing hunger for details regarding the young man who may be
more of a teen fantasy than Leonardo DiCaprio. Prince William is on
the cover of this week's  &UR; People &LR; , a 16-year-old boy who shares his
mother's fair-haired grace and her uneasiness regarding the press.
The story delivers just about every detail you might want to know
about the prince, including small passions like computer games,
fast food, techno music, and water polo, largely thanks to that
wonderful army of knowledgable royals experts. ``William's shoes
are always so shiny, his trousers well-pressed,'' notes one Eton
bookshop owner.

BEST WEAPON IN THE DRUG WAR MAY BE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DONALD G. SMITH  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA, Calif. _ So far the war on drugs has been fought
with law-and-order people. From the cartels down to bottom-rung
street pushers, the drug business has had to worry about the FBI,
the CIA, Coast Guard, drug enforcement agencies and state and local
police. These agencies have been, at best, ineffectual.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, I believe, lies elsewhere _ in the world of federal
regulation. Let us say that the now-illegal drug business is
legalized and brought under the full control of the Washington
bureaucracy. The paperwork alone would surely cripple drug dealers,
but this is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers would have to comply with the built-in quicksand of
affirmative action, which could have sucked down the Titanic before
it hit the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   They would have to prove that half their street salespeople were
women and furnish figures proving they employed representative
numbers of blacks, Latinos, Asians, Eskimos and Irish Protestants.
Failure to comply would result in fines and possible suspension of
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Warehouses and offices would come under the jurisdiction of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which would check
closely on heating, lighting, air conditioning, insulation,
electrical wiring, plumbing and proper posting of safety bulletins.
</P>
<P>
   There would be ongoing inspections of stairways and handrails.
</P>
<P>
   The drug dealers also would have to provide parking spaces,
wheelchair ramps and appropriate lavatory facilities for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The product would, of course, need to be packaged with
appropriate warning labels. Management would have to offer medical
and retirement plans, paid vacations, maternity leave, overtime
pay, insurance, sick leave, child care and minimum-wage laws.
</P>
<P>
   If the drug dealers haven't already been regulated out of
business, bring the Internal Revenue Service into the picture _ and
tax them into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   When laws for criminals fail to work, we can take advantage of
the rules and regulations that have been suffocating honest people
since the days of the Great Society.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the drug traffickers be free from the pressures
brought to bear by organized labor. When the government recognizes
the United Brotherhood of Dope Pushers as the official bargaining
agent of the industry, management will have to deal with this
organization and face it in federal court. It is one thing to
tiptoe past the FBI, but another to confront a labor union with the
federal government looking on.
</P>
<P>
   The Medellin Cartel might find its way around American law
enforcement, but it has never butted heads with bureaucracy. A
government director fighting for next year's budget can crush an
international crime ring as though he were stepping on a snail.

HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY WHOOPING COUGH RESURGENT IN SAN FRANCISCO
AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHERINE SELIGMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It starts with a nagging cough and progresses to
hacking fits that seem endless and can be so severe that it's
impossible to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In infants it can cause the characteristic ``whoop,'' a labored
gasp of breath after a coughing spasm. Whooping cough, a disease
that many people thought went the way of polio, smallpox and
measles, is hitting the San Francisco Bay area particularly hard
this season.
</P>
<P>
   This year it has killed two infants and prompted health
officials to alert schools and health workers to the higher than
normal number of cases. Groups of schoolchildren in Alameda and
Santa Clara counties were advised to take preventive antibiotics
after classmates came down with the illness before the end of the
school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an outbreak in the Bay area and it's going pretty
strong,'' said Cynthia O'Malley, an epidemiologist with the state
Department of Health. ``We always have (whooping cough) but now
we're getting cases and cases and cases. It's really spreading a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Alameda County has had about 25 cases of whooping cough, up from
10 cases last year. In Santa Clara County, there have been 80
cases, compared with 23 all last year. San Francisco has had eight
cases, double the number reported in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers probably represent the tip of the iceberg,'' said
Laura Levin, an epidemiologist with Santa Clara County's health
department. ``A lot of health care providers don't realize it's
around. Some of them don't realize that adults are susceptible to
it or that the vaccine wears off and kids who are vaccinated can
still get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whooping cough _ or pertussis _ can range from an annoyance
that's never diagnosed to weeks of painful coughing in adults and
older children. But it can be deadly to infants. Coughing spasms
may leave babies gasping for air. In some cases, lack of oxygen has
caused brain damage or death.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is endemic in the United States, with cyclical
upsurges, O'Malley said. It has not been eradicated because the
vaccine, given in four doses starting at about 2 months of age, is
not completely effective. It also wears off, leaving teen-agers and
adults vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium that causes whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis,
secretes a toxin that damages airway cells involved in the cough
reflex. Rejuvenating those cells can take weeks or months.
Antibiotics given early in the illness will kill the germ, but may
not stop the coughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to diagnose,'' said Mel Lippmann, disease control
investigator for San Francisco's Health Department. ``Most people
who go to a doctor won't find out it's pertussis. ... So it's
difficult to get the disease out of the community. You can't get
rid of it like you do with polio or smallpox.''
</P>
<P>
   School-age children are required to have pertussis vaccinations
_ usually given with diphtheria and tetanus inoculations _ before
they enroll. But many children get the disease before they're old
enough to be vaccinated, or before they're forced to be by school
regulations. And some parents fear the pertussis vaccination
because of the side effects of a vaccine widely used up to two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That form _ a ``cellular'' vaccine made from the whole cell of
the germ _ caused fever, swelling and other symptoms in many
infants. Some parents were so reluctant to have their babies
vaccinated that the United States experienced its first outbreak of
whooping cough in 40 years in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But two years ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved an
``acellular'' vaccine made from part of the bacterium's cell, which
causes 90 percent fewer side effects.

HOT PARTRIDGE DAVID CASSIDY STILL THRILLS FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By TERESA TALERCIO  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ At 48, David Cassidy still qualifies as a
heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   The former star of ``The Partridge Family'' visited Bellevue's
Fred Meyer this week to promote a new CD and sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of screaming fans _ even teenage girls who discovered
him on Nick at Nite reruns _ lined up outside the store, waiting
hours to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   They brought faded Partridge Family records. They sang ``C'mon,
Get Happy.'' They shared giddy memories of Cassidy in his heyday _
that shaggy brown hair, that devilish smile, those tight
bell-bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Murphy, a 33-year-old accountant, toted a battered
Partridge Family lunchbox from her school days.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, the first person in line, waited six hours to see the
1970s teen idol. She wore a minidress and platform sandals. She
primped her long blond hair, using the store window as a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 4 years old and David Cassidy was my first
`boyfriend,''' she said. ``I've been waiting 30 years to see him,
to ask him to kiss me. I'm so giddy!''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, somewhere deep inside the Fred Meyer, Cassidy was still
wrapping up interviews with Seattle media.
</P>
<P>
   A trim, muscular man, he wore a black, long-sleeved shirt, black
jeans and black boots. He sipped on bottled water and bantered with
reporters. He seemed shorter in person, but his blue eyes still
sparkled.
</P>
<P>
   He was interrupted occasionally by the crackle of a cashier's
voice _ ``Price check, please!'' _ over the store's speaker system.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy rolled his eyes and threw up his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do this,'' he complained. ``I can't do it. I'm really,
really sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Store managers rushed to silence the offending intercom.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy didn't want to talk about the TV show that catapulted
him to fame, even though that's what the hundreds of waiting fans
loved him for best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel blessed to have lived that life,'' he said. ``I loved
`The Partridge Family'. I have fond memories of it. But I was
thrilled when I walked away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he performs in ``EFX,'' a Las Vegas musical. He has also
appeared in Broadway shows such as ``Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat'' and ``Blood Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   His new CD, ``Old Trick New Dog,'' includes remakes of hits such
as ``I Can Feel Your Heartbeat'' and ``I Think I Love You,'' a song
so immortalized in 1970s pop culture that Katie Couric sang it to
him during an NBC ``Today Show'' interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those songs forever changed my recording life and career,'' he
said. ``But it wasn't the whole slice of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he lives in Las Vegas. He is married and has two
children. Cassidy reflected on the intense fame that he experienced
as a 22-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having all that _ the fame and adulation and women and all
that stuff they talk about _ doesn't make you happy,'' he said.
``You have to make yourself happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, fans grew restless. They sang ``C'mon, Get Happy'' at
the tops of their lungs to revive themselves and lure out the
Partridge hunk.
</P>
<P>
   Store managers escorted Cassidy through the Fred Meyer _ past
the shopping carts, the aisles of potato chips, the soda-pop
displays _ to meet his public.
</P>
<P>
   The screaming started as soon as fans caught a glimpse of him
making his way through the jewelry department. ``Oh my GOD!!''
women squealed. ``David!''
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy waved and flashed a dazzling smile.
</P>
<P>
   Rules for meeting the celeb were strict. He would not sign
anything other than his new CD, much to the dismay of fans who
brought old LPs and Tiger Beat magazines.
</P>
<P>
   And, sorry, no kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, the first one to meet Cassidy, seemed dazed after her
brief encounter her old heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks really good,'' she said. ``I wish I had gotten a
kiss, though.''
</P>
<P>

UNDERWEAR OPTIONAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Ever since ``Melrose Place'' star Alyssa Milano
announced on ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' that she wasn't
wearing any underwear, folks have been buzzing about it. Or the
lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   Was she the victim of a heartless panty-raid prank?
</P>
<P>
   Did she miss the lecture about wearing good underwear in case of
a car accident?
</P>
<P>
   Did she take that jeans campaign _ ``Nothing comes between me
and my Calvins'' _ seriously?
</P>
<P>
   And, more importantly, is the young actress' aversion to panties
a singular incident, or part of a growing trend that's sure to
insult the moral majority?
</P>
<P>
   Like, maybe she'd seen ``Basic Instinct'' too many times. You
know, the film in which Sharon Stone silences a room full of jaded
cops by simply uncrossing her ladylike legs and exposing a whole
lot more than Marilyn Monroe did in the ``The Seven Year Itch.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you're wondering, Stone doesn't wear underwear in her
personal life, either. She's said so in numerous interviews.
</P>
<P>
   This obvious refusal to wear underwear can't be a retaliation to
the high prices of lingerie, because underwear sales are up by 9
percent since last year, according to fashion trend watchers at
Fairchild Strategic Information Services.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, it was just an attention-getter, suggests Susan Colman,
president of Jezebel, a leading bra and panty maker. ``I saw the
show. It got my attention,'' she said with a chuckle, referring to
Milano's revealing statement.
</P>
<P>
   Milano, like Stone, didn't actually expose any part of herself _
visually, that is. It was just the thought of a Hollywood star sans
panties that got us all flustered.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't the only ones who crossed the line on panty
lines. Jay Leno also learned actress Tori Spelling doesn't wear
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   And neither does ``Baywatch'' babe Donna D'Errico, who showed up
for a recent fashion layout without panties or bra.
</P>
<P>
   And we thought Madonna was outrageous. At least we knew for a
fact she wore underwear ... even if it was worn as outerwear.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the deal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Comfort,'' says Shari Belafonte. ``I rarely wear underwear ...
but I definitely wear panties with a short skirt,'' Harry's
daughter said over dinner at the opening night gala for the
Hollywood Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Since everybody in the group was talking about the Jay Leno show
(with Alyssa Milano), she mentioned that at least half of the stars
walking down the red carpet on Oscar and Emmy night aren't wearing
underwear, either.
</P>
<P>
   Former runway model Jane Mannfolk, who's now a stylist for
``Leeza'' (yes, Leeza wears underwear) and ``Interior Motives'' on
the Discovery Channel, says the suspected trend really is a trend,
and she thinks it started years ago with fashion models.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mannfolk, ``Traditionally, European runway models
don't wear underwear because designers don't want any lines showing
under the garment. However, it's also for convenience, since models
must change quickly into several ensembles during a show. But this
isn't new. It's just that it's become more obvious due to the
currently sheer and clingy clothing, so it's caught on with anybody
who's proud of their figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sexy to say, `I'm not wearing any underwear.' But just
for the record, it's also very uncomfortable. Why someone would
want to wear tight jeans without panties is beyond me,'' she said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   While Mannfolk takes a liberal view on runway nudity, the
stylist does get upset with the everyday housewives who have been
selected for fashion makeovers on the ``Leeza'' show. Quite a few
actually show up without underwear, so she keeps a supply of
flesh-colored G-strings by Calvin Klein to protect the borrowed
clothes _ and the TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about that G-string trend. Some think it started with Demi
Moore in ``Striptease,'' and others say it kicked off with the
black G-string featuring the Gucci symbol. You may have seen it in
magazine ads, worn as a swimsuit brief or exposed under a
hip-riding skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, g-strings and their slightly more modest cousin _
the thong _ have become popular panty choices for women who don't
like visible panty lines and no longer wear pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   Even mainstream companies such as Jezebel make them, but before
you start wondering what the world is coming to, read on. According
to Colman, most women in America still buy modest white panties.
She adds that her biggest seller is a ``waist-high panty with a
high-cut leg, a cotton liner and good coverage in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Going without underwear isn't a political statement like the
bra-burning era of the '60s, nor is it a sexist remark. Guys do it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Rodney Dangerfield has been known to partake of
undies-optional fashion ... and an entire episode of ``Seinfeld''
had Kramer celebrating new-found freedom when he shed his shorts.
</P>
<P>
   And what about that video artist Nam June Paik? He stood up to
greet President Clinton at a recent White House state dinner for
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, and his pants fell down to his
ankles, revealing ... ``The Full Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget meeting the president. Let's do America a favor and
introduce him to Joe Boxer.

SCHRODER'S ROOKIE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; You'd think after 20 years you'd know a guy.
</P>
<P>
   But just when images of an 8-year-old Ricky Schroder crying in
``The Champ'' and a trust-fund teen-ager in ``Silver Spoons'' are
burned deeply into your subconscious, he is ready to make a
comeback into series television all grown up.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any grown-up, mind you. Schroder will not play some
middle-of-the-road guy in a romantic comedy. He will play a
homicide detective.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any homicide detective, mind you. Schroder beat out
about 40 actors to land the role of Andy Sipowicz's (Dennis Franz)
third partner on ``NYPD Blue,'' the grittiest show the networks
have to offer; a show for which he will have to sign a nudity
clause, making his rear end public property.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, looking to prove himself as a dramatic
actor, Schroder sent his manager and agent out looking for a role
as a police officer, and they hooked him a whopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in shock,'' said Schroder by cellular phone on the
way back from a fishing exposition that netted eight brook and
rainbow trout ready for the barbecue. ``I feel so lucky. I know I'm
going to be under the microscope, but in every profession, it
doesn't matter what the career is _ banking, acting or whatever _
there are moments in life when your destiny is largely in your
control, and I feel like this is one of those moments for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder, 28, is no stranger to life's big moments. He purchased
a giant ranch on the Colorado-Utah border eight years ago, got
married six years ago and has seen the birth of his three children
(Holden, 6, Luke, 4, and Cambrie, 1{).
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time over the past decade, Schroder has compiled an
impressive resume of movies of the week, miniseries and an
occasional feature film. He says that during the last 20 years, the
longest he went without an acting gig was 14 months. But he still
made sure to leave himself plenty of time to work the land and the
livestock on his 15,500-acre ranch in Grand Junction, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his days building fences, riding horses, raising cattle
and putting culverts in streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to get my hands dirty,'' Schroder said. ``When I'm away
from the ranch for two months, I get soft. I lose all of my
callouses and forget what it's like to dig a hole with a shovel.''
</P>
<P>
   Until, as he said, quality material became harder to find,
television movies were the best compromise between life on the farm
and a career as an actor. The audition process was not too
rigorous, the paychecks kept him and his family in chaps, and he
only had to work in short, concentrated intervals of a couple of
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in the feature-film game, you have to go out and hustle.
To be in a series, you have to go out and hustle,'' he said. ``TV
movies are like driving up to McDonald's and ordering a Quarter
Pounder with cheese. They just come.''
</P>
<P>
   But, then, a role worth hustling for fell on his plate.
</P>
<P>
   To win the ``NYPD Blue'' part, which was more like getting a
table at Cafe Bizou on a Saturday night, Schroder had to audition
three times, reading lines opposite the Emmy Award-winning Franz.
Each time, he changed the perception that executive producer Steven
Bochco had of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not really kept up with Rick's most recent work, so I
suppose to some degree I carried the image of a much younger guy in
a half-hour sitcom,'' Bochco said. ``In my mind now, he's a man _
and he's a man of some substance and some complexity. He offers a
wonderful combination of youth and optimism with a certain degree
of experience and savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco would not divulge much about Schroder's new character
other than to say that he will join the show in the sixth or
seventh episode of the season after Jimmy Smits' Bobby Simone exits
_ conveniently coinciding with November sweeps. Schroder will play
a 28-year-old detective. Terms of his contract were not made
available.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bochco unpacked Schroder's professional baggage to see
what was inside, this is the actor's chance to silence the people
who are amazed that Schroder is replacing television's No. 1 hunk _
a cool, confident customer capable of exploding at any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people tune in with a legitimate interest and curiosity
about what kind of character he will play and if he is up to the
task,'' Bochco said. ``And David (Milch, executive producer) and I
are absolutely convinced that he will dispel any doubts about his
ability in about five minutes, because we have a character for him
that is very interesting. You cannot replace Jimmy, and you
shouldn't try to.''
</P>
<P>
   Franz, whose first ``NYPD'' partner was David Caruso, is eager
to begin work with his new co-star.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rick will) be bringing a new character with qualities unlike
any others on the show,'' Franz said. ``I'm looking forward to the
many possible story-line opportunities this character will provide
for the show and existing characters' relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   And Schroder is eager to test his chops with Franz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could fit very well in a show like this,'' he said.
``I had very little doubt that I could handle it _ I just needed
somebody else to believe in me like I believe in myself so I can
start my new adult career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read with Dennis during my audition. What a powerful actor
and what a powerful human being he is. If you don't stand up to
him, you will get crushed. I am very ready to do good work.''
</P>
<P>
   If all three men are right, Schroder will have completed the
transition from child star to actor of substance that has eluded so
many others, from Danny Bonaduce to Erin Moran.
</P>
<P>
   Many kids in the spotlight succumb to pressure and are not able
to shift to life after their big break. But Schroder has kept
control of his career _ and his life.
</P>
<P>
   This steady role on one of television's top dramas will require
some time off from the ranch; Schroder plans on living in Los
Angeles during the week and returning home to Grand Junction on
weekends to keep up those callouses.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of appreciation for the sanctity of the outdoors,
his commitment to a strong family and his tenacious focus on what
he wants to achieve that Schroder credits for his longevity in the
fickle entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Like most others, he also made sacrifices. Schooled by a private
tutor on the set from third to 11th grades, Schroder missed out on
a lot of peer interaction. He eventually transferred to Calabasas
High School for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was uncomfortable,'' he said. ``It wasn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   To fit in, Schroder joined the wrestling team. As the only
person to try out in the 143-pound weight class, he was handed a
spot on the varsity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' he said. ``I got in good shape and got to roll
around on a mat with big ... guys from Chatsworth. I won a couple
of matches, but mostly I got twisted like a pretzel. We'd go to a
wrestling tournament someplace like Reseda, and there would be
these inner-city kids going for scholarships that lived, ate and
breathed wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   He vividly remembers one tournament in which he was the lowest
seed and was pinned by the No. 1 seed within 28 seconds of the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom, dad and sister were there and everyone was cheering me
on,'' Schroder said. ``It was embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Win-loss record notwithstanding, Schroder will have to remember
some wrestling takedowns and holds to help him subdue the perps
corralled in New York's fictional 15th Precinct, 10 p.m. Tuesdays
on KABC (Channel 7). In this arena, it seems he's made all the
right moves.

HOT PARTRIDGE DAVID CASSIDY STILL THRILLS FANS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ At 48, David Cassidy still qualifies as a
heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   The former star of ``The Partridge Family'' visited Bellevue's
Fred Meyer this week to promote a new CD and sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of screaming fans _ even teenage girls who discovered
him on Nick at Nite reruns _ lined up outside the store, waiting
hours to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   They brought faded Partridge Family records. They sang ``C'mon,
Get Happy.'' They shared giddy memories of Cassidy in his heyday _
that shaggy brown hair, that devilish smile, those tight
bell-bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Murphy, a 33-year-old accountant, toted a battered
Partridge Family lunchbox from her school days.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, the first person in line, waited six hours to see the
1970s teen idol. She wore a minidress and platform sandals. She
primped her long blond hair, using the store window as a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 4 years old and David Cassidy was my first
`boyfriend,''' she said. ``I've been waiting 30 years to see him,
to ask him to kiss me. I'm so giddy!''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, somewhere deep inside the Fred Meyer, Cassidy was still
wrapping up interviews with Seattle media.
</P>
<P>
   A trim, muscular man, he wore a black, long-sleeved shirt, black
jeans and black boots. He sipped on bottled water and bantered with
reporters. He seemed shorter in person, but his blue eyes still
sparkled.
</P>
<P>
   He was interrupted occasionally by the crackle of a cashier's
voice _ ``Price check, please!'' _ over the store's speaker system.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy rolled his eyes and threw up his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do this,'' he complained. ``I can't do it. I'm really,
really sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Store managers rushed to silence the offending intercom.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy didn't want to talk about the TV show that catapulted
him to fame, even though that's what the hundreds of waiting fans
loved him for best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel blessed to have lived that life,'' he said. ``I loved
`The Partridge Family'. I have fond memories of it. But I was
thrilled when I walked away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he performs in ``EFX,'' a Las Vegas musical. He has also
appeared in Broadway shows such as ``Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat'' and ``Blood Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   His new CD, ``Old Trick New Dog,'' includes remakes of hits such
as ``I Can Feel Your Heartbeat'' and ``I Think I Love You,'' a song
so immortalized in 1970s pop culture that Katie Couric sang it to
him during an NBC ``Today Show'' interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those songs forever changed my recording life and career,'' he
said. ``But it wasn't the whole slice of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he lives in Las Vegas. He is married and has two
children. Cassidy reflected on the intense fame that he experienced
as a 22-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having all that _ the fame and adulation and women and all
that stuff they talk about _ doesn't make you happy,'' he said.
``You have to make yourself happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, fans grew restless. They sang ``C'mon, Get Happy'' at
the tops of their lungs to revive themselves and lure out the
Partridge hunk.
</P>
<P>
   Store managers escorted Cassidy through the Fred Meyer _ past
the shopping carts, the aisles of potato chips, the soda-pop
displays _ to meet his public.
</P>
<P>
   The screaming started as soon as fans caught a glimpse of him
making his way through the jewelry department. ``Oh my GOD!!''
women squealed. ``David!''
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy waved and flashed a dazzling smile.
</P>
<P>
   Rules for meeting the celeb were strict. He would not sign
anything other than his new CD, much to the dismay of fans who
brought old LPs and Tiger Beat magazines.
</P>
<P>
   And, sorry, no kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, the first one to meet Cassidy, seemed dazed after her
brief encounter her old heartthrob.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks really good,'' she said. ``I wish I had gotten a
kiss, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenn Yeager, 15, and her 13-year-old sister, Crystal, squealed
and trembled and giggled as if they had just met Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   They fell in love with Cassidy after watching ``The Partridge
Family'' reruns on Nick at Nite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hot,'' Jenn Yeager said. ``He's gorgeous and I love his
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Karin Rommel, a 30-year-old human resources representative at
Boeing, beamed as she left the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just loved it,'' she said. ``I congratulated him on all his
new success. I think he deserves it. He's beautiful. He's very
handsome. And he's got a Kodak smile.''

STUDY SAYS POOR AIDS VICTIMS NEGLECT TREATMENT REGIMEN

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Poor San Franciscans who are infected with HIV
receive far too few AIDS-fighting drugs that might prolong their
lives and ease their suffering, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 151 people studied, only 8 percent received protease
inhibitors, which rank high among the heavy hitters of AIDS
medications. Only 28 percent took any anti-HIV drugs at all, the
research team at the University of California at San Francisco
found.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, nearly 90 percent of middle-class San Franciscans
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus received medication
for it, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor people are increasingly the main high-risk group for
HIV,'' said one researcher, Andrew Moss.
</P>
<P>
   The study was directed by Dr. David Bangsberg of the
university's AIDS program at San Francisco General Hospital. It was
presented at the 12th World AIDS Conference in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also discovered a marked discrepancy between the
patients' reported and actual compliance with drug-taking
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to stick to the schedule might cause them to develop
resistance to the medications, leaving them sicker than ever.
</P>
<P>
   To double check patient claims, the scientists installed a
computer chip in the caps of bottles containing AIDS drugs. The
chip recorded each time the bottle was opened.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found the patients were taking an average of
only 80 percent of the pills. The patients claimed to have
swallowed 92 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy is significant: If a patient misses even a small
number of drugs, his or her HIV level can soar.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said the patients ``had to take more than 90 percent of
their medications to have a good chance of decreasing their viral
loads to an undetectable level.''

INTRODUCING THE NEW, SELF-DEPRECATING AL GORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a tireless believer in the value of America's two-party
political system, I must say it was encouraging to watch Texas
Democrats whoop it up at their convention in San Antonio the last
weekend of June.
</P>
<P>
   With no regard at all for polls that show Democratic candidates
in big trouble, party loyalists staged a terrific pep rally in the
Alamodome. They lit up the Alamo City as if they had something to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   It is not entirely clear what previously untapped source of
unbridled optimism might have fueled the delegates' enthusiasm. But
here's a guess: Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'm talking about THAT Al Gore. The vice president of the
United States. The guy whose wooden demeanor has provided six
years' worth of punch lines for Jay Leno, David Letterman and just
about every other comedian who might be prone to taking an
occasional shot at an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   The jokes about what a stiff he is are so commonplace, by now,
that even Gore is telling them. In his speech to Texas Democrats on
the convention's opening day, Gore reprised a joke that Billy
Crystal used when he hosted the Academy Awards in 1997:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows who's gonna go home with the Oscars. The only one
guaranteed of waking up with a statue is Tipper Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Tipper. She wakes up with a statue every day.
</P>
<P>
   But if Al has reinvented himself at home the way he has in
public, Tipper must feel like she's living with Robin Williams.
This new Al is a barrel of laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing as how he was addressing a dome full of Democrats, most
of Gore's jokes in San Antonio were aimed at Republicans. The best
ones, though, were those he aimed at himself.
</P>
<P>
   Which suggests that Gore's game plan for the 2000 presidential
campaign is to make fun of his own image, even as he tries to
redefine it. It's a good idea, because the American people have
always displayed a fondness for politicians and/or entertainers who
are willing to laugh at themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Self-deprecation is a tried-and-true vote-getter in this
country, probably because it suggests a level of humility that is
sadly lacking in too many candidates for public office. Most
politicians are inclined toward self-defeating defensiveness when
they become the target of ridicule or criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Are you listening, Dan Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   Gore's new approach unquestionably serves him well in the
partisan environment of high-energy political functions such as the
Texas convention. But it remains to be seen whether Gore can adapt
his new image to the mass audiences he will encounter in a
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As a candidate for vice president and second banana to Bill
Clinton in the 1992 and '96 elections, Gore didn't have to do much
except trumpet the party line and outshine the likes of Republican
counterparts Quayle and Jack Kemp. His personal appeal was barely
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Gore clearly understands that, which is why he has set out to
establish a new image that makes him seem more human, more dynamic
_ more the sort of person that voters can visualize as commander in
chief.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the new and improved Gore, however, is that
some of his attempts to project charisma seem forced and contrived.
The stiff jokes are funny, but they get old in a hurry. At times,
he seems to be trying so hard to make light of his image that he
ends up reinforcing the image rather than eradicating it.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the vice president's exuberant new speaking style _
has he been taking lessons from Jesse Jackson? _ and the whole deal
can start wearing a little thin.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is absolutely correct in assuming that the American people
prefer presidential candidates who bring enthusiasm and vitality to
the task of campaigning _ and, if they win, to the task of
governing.
</P>
<P>
   But voters also insist that would-be presidents be themselves.
We don't mind electing an actor, but we don't want him to be acting
when he's asking for our votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore might want to give that some thought before totally
transforming himself into a character who may not ring true to the
voters.

   RADICAL-HOUSES (Undated) _ Whatever happened to truly innovative
houses? Houses so radical in concept, so bold in execution and at
the same time so comfortable and appealing that they made people
want to change the way they lived? These days, new houses in
America seem to be more about size than innovation. Architects save

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE-PLANS (Wickford, R.I.) _ Bob Gilbane bought a dream house
by mail for $495. The ready-to-build plan of a charming, elaborate
cottage _ with columns and porches, wavy shingles and oval windows
_ was designed by one of the country's best-known architects,

<P>
   SOLAR-TECH (Undated) _ Solar-powered fiber-optics? Photovoltaic
cell-laminated tensile hyperbolic paraboloids? Today's visionary
gibberish is tomorrow's plain English. The nifty thing about
emerging technologies is the way they sneak up on you, then
transform your life overnight. ``Under the Sun: An Outdoor

<P>
   BROOKLYN-ROWHOUSE (New York) _ When Laurie Miller said goodbye
to the narrow house on Quincy Street, there was still a pull chain
attached to the wooden toilet tank up near the ceiling. There was
still a clawfoot bathtub. The boiler didn't always work. It was
home, though, and had been since she was 10 years old. But her
mother, a nurse, had died of cancer at 51, and the house, in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, was foreclosed upon. Laurie
Miller and her siblings, all in their early 20s, had to move out.
That was in 1981. Ordinarily, that would have been the end of it.
The old rowhouse would have been bought, sold and maybe bought
again, its fortunes dependent on the whims of strangers. But Ms.
Miller is no ordinary woman. And for close to two decades, in her
odyssey around the city, she kept her eye on Quincy Street. By

TOP NEW YORK OFFICIALS RETAIN LAWYERS AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York's top three elected officials _ the
governor, the attorney general and the comptroller _ have hired
defense lawyers in a series of employment-related cases, billing
taxpayers at least $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that despite having about 450 state lawyers at
their disposal:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, hired three Manhattan law
firms to represent him and top aides in two cases alleging wrongful
termination, at a total cost of $550,719.
</P>
<P>
   _ Attorney General Dennis Vacco, also a Republican, hired a
Manhattan firm to represent him in several employment matters,
costing taxpayers at least $507,985.
</P>
<P>
   _ Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, is using a Manhattan
law firm to represent him in two pending employment cases, which
have cost taxpayers $260,284.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 13 lawsuits are pending, meaning that the legal
bills to taxpayers are mounting. In addition, there are dozens of
cases for which outside attorneys have not yet submitted bills.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to all three officials said the use of outside counsel is
justified because of various conflicts, legal and political, that
disqualify the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   New York employs hundreds of lawyers, most of them in Vacco's
office, whose job, in part, is to represent the state and its
officials against lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   However, under Section 17 of the state's Public Officers Law,
officials can hire any lawyer they want in matters where
representation by the attorney general would be ``inappropriate,''
so long as the attorney general signs off on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has signed off on scores of such cases, state records
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a disgrace,'' said former Attorney General G. Oliver
Koppell, a Democrat seeking his party's nomination to challenge
Vacco in November. ``Vacco doesn't have the confidence in his own
office. In essence, he is testifying to his own ineptitude in
appointing counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacco spokesman Chris McKenna accused Koppell of political
grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really sad that ... his campaign is so foundering and
desperate at this point that he will say just about anything to
draw attention to himself,'' McKenna said. ``It is a basic legal
principle that you have to avoid conflicts. Retention of outside
counsel by this office is no different than it was when Oliver
Koppell was attorney general for 11 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Koppell claims he used outside counsel far less frequently than
Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the comptroller's office has paid legal
bills in 13 employment cases, nine of them involving Vacco. In
addition, there are another 19 Vacco cases for which the state
apparently has not yet been billed by the lawyers representing the
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, who ousted about one-third of his legal
staff after taking office in 1995, hired the politically connected
law firm of Snitow &AMP; Pauley to represent him in cases stemming from
those ousters. Approximately one-third of the bills for those
matters, totaling $507,985, have been submitted to the
comptroller's office.
</P>
<P>
   A single case accounts for more than half the total, $265,363,
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Snitow &AMP; Pauley also was involved in a recently concluded case
involving Pataki, billing at least $22,891 for that matter. Another
law firm, Hoguet Newman &AMP; Regal, the lead counsel in the case,
charged at least $159,838 for that case.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's attorneys for a pending whistle-blower suit _ the firm
of Hoguet Newman &AMP; Regal, an expert in employment litigation, and
Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman &AMP; Dicker, a law firm that is also
one of the major lobbyists at the state capital _ have billed at
least $367,990.
</P>
<P>
   McCall hired the law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &AMP;
Garrison to represent him in two pending wrongful termination
cases. The firm has billed at least $256,652 for one of the matters
and $3,631 for the other, at the rate of $260 per hour for lawyers
and $60 per hour for paralegals, according to McCall spokesman
Dennis Tompkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claim is the comptroller acted politically (in firing
employees),'' Tompkins said. ``Inasmuch as the attorney general and
comptroller are of opposite parties, the attorney general, the
comptroller and the courts felt it was in the best interests of
everyone to allow outside counsel.''

   BROOKLYN-ROWHOUSE (New York) _ When Laurie Miller said goodbye

home, though, and had been since she was 10 years old. But her
mother, a nurse, had died of cancer at 51, and the house, in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, was foreclosed upon. Laurie
Miller and her siblings, all in their early 20s, had to move out.
That was in 1981. Ordinarily, that would have been the end of it.

again, its fortunes dependent on the whims of strangers. But Ms.
Miller is no ordinary woman. And for close to two decades, in her

EXCEPTIONAL WILL TO WIN DOMINATES GERMAN SOCCER PERSONALITY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Perhaps the classic image of Germany's extraordinary
soccer team comes from the 1982 World Cup semifinal against France.
With his team trailing 3-1 to France and minutes left to play, the
great striker Karl-Heinz Rummenigge came on as substitute and
immediately removed his shin guards.
</P>
<P>
   By disdainfully hurling away his protection, Rummenigge was
declaring that the real battle, unsoftened and unfettered, had
begun. France, with perhaps its greatest team ever, and one clearly
more skilled than the German, shuddered. Germany surged back to 3-3
and won the game on a penalty shootout.
</P>
<P>
   So it has been countless times in soccer's supreme competition.
When, as now, the final rounds loom, the game moves beyond the
control and distribution of a ball to the realm of psychological
confrontation. Nations unwittingly bear their souls in what amount
to life-and-death struggles for victory.
</P>
<P>
   This is an area in which the German team has excelled, coming
from behind, often in the last minutes, to reach a remarkable six
finals and nine semifinals in thirteen World Cup appearances. It
has won the trophy three times, a record surpassed only by Brazil,
and is once again in the quarterfinals here.
</P>
<P>
   One of those victories came in the 1954 World Cup in
Switzerland. Germany was thrashed 8-3 in an opening game against
Hungary but nonetheless qualified for the knockout rounds. It
reached the final to find itself facing Hungary again. Within
minutes the Hungarians took a 2-0 lead; the match seemed over. But
the Germans, true to form, came back to win 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has his own conception of tactics,'' Jurgen
Klinsmann, the German captain, said here this week. ``For
ourselves, we try to concentrate on our power. That is to say, we
try to build the pressure, increase the pressure, until the
adversary finally cracks and is overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ability counts, but so, too, does the sheer
strength of character and self-belief that alone can keep tide
after tide of attacks coming and turn near-certain defeat into
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Klinsmann, who has played more than 100 times for Germany, was
speaking after Germany had reached the quarterfinals here by
beating Mexico 2-1. It was a textbook German victory against a team
that often seemed more skilled. Two goals in the last 15 minutes,
by Klinsmann and fellow striker Oliver Bierhoff, literally
shattered the Mexicans, who had seemed headed for victory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the tournament, Germany trailed Yugoslavia 2-0 with
20 minutes left and came back to tie, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans are in the final eight yet again, playing Croatia
Saturday, and it seems, more than ever, that sheer force of
character has brought them this far. For this, by any estimate, is
not a great squad. Indeed its midfield has often resembled nothing
so much as a great and gloomy void.
</P>
<P>
   This team has been compared in Germany to the Russian space
station MIR, staggering from mishap to mishap but somehow staying
aloft. Manager Berti Vogts has tried so many players in midfield _
even dropping what looked like the best of them, the 25-year-old
Jens Jeremies _ that attempts to discern his strategy have appeared
a fruitless exercise.
</P>
<P>
   What then keeps the ``Mannschaft'' _ simply, The Team _ as they
are known at home _ going here, urged onward by the 34-year-old
Klinsmann and the 37-year-old sweeper Lothar Matthaus? Where does
this exceptional will to win _ recognized by all of Germany's
opponents _ find its roots?
</P>
<P>
   The expression of national pride has, of course, been a
difficult issue for Germans ever since World War 11. In the soccer
team the nation clearly finds a uniquely powerful symbol for values
of strength, determination and cohesion that cannot readily be
displayed elsewhere. While every country takes pride in its soccer
team, not every country takes pride in the team's moral fiber and
will power above all else.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many players over 30, and so many evident problems
in the team, a fourth World Cup still looks like a long shot,
despite the fine performances of striker Oliver Bierhoff, the best
header of the ball in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the team's repeated last-minute comebacks here,
left-back Christian Ziege said this week, ``It is time we won a
game safely, otherwise our fans will die of heart attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, however, the heart attacks have generally been
suffered by Germany's opponents. France, which will meet Germany in
the semifinal if the teams win against Italy and Croatia
respectively, still bears the scars of that 1982 game which seemed
to many French commentators to reflect an old French inferiority
complex beside its powerful neighbor. France has never won the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   As the French sports columnist Roland Gransart commented
laconically this week of the German side, ``Defeat? Never heard of
it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shelley Day's friends tell her it is no surprise to them that
she is running her own computer game company, Humongous
Entertainment. As a child, she would save up her allowance to buy
the latest board game and then lasso the neighborhood gang into the
basement of her parents' home in Redding, Calif., to help her
puzzle it out.
</P>
<P>
   She was introduced to her first computer game, one of the early
text-based adventures, at a barbecue in the early 80s. As others
frolicked in the pool outside, she remained glued to her chair for
six hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day my boyfriend and I went out and bought a
Commodore 64,'' Ms. Day recalls. A couple of years later, in 1984,
with a degree in television and radio broadcasting from the
University of San Francisco, she joined the game developer
Electronic Arts. Out of 60 producers, she was the only woman.
</P>
<P>
   After working for 10 years as a game producer, she teamed up
with her partner, Ron Gilbert, who handles the creative side of the
business, to form Humongous, based in Woodinville, Wash., a Seattle
suburb, with $100,000 from a private investor and a staff of six.
</P>
<P>
   Today the company, which specializes in children's entertainment
titles, has 320 employees and in July 1996 became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the GT Interactive Software Corp. in a stock swap
worth $76 million that left her as the chief executive officer of
the subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months Ms. Day's company will introduce stuffed
toys, a clothing line, a CD-ROM series based on the hit Nickelodeon
show ``Blue's Clues'' and a Saturday morning cartoon show based on
original Humongous characters including Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish and
Pajama Sam.
</P>
<P>
   For many parents and their children, Humongous games provide the
first introduction to computer software. Most employ a simple
formula: friendly characters accompany players on an interactive
adventure to solve a crime like the theft of Freddi Fish's seashell
or overcome a childhood fear like Pajama Sam's fear of the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Day is well known within the industry for fostering a
relaxed, work environment with low employee turnover. The typical
uniform, even among division managers, is shorts, T-shirt and sport
sandals. Ms. Day, 37, herself favors plum-colored nail polish,
sandals and a gingham shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the weird female in a real male-dominated
workplace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingham shifts notwithstanding, Ms. Day has a reputation for
being a stubborn business partner and fierce protector of her
company's autonomy and the integrity of the Humongous stable of
characters.
</P>
<P>
   GT Interactive's Chairman, Ronald W. Chaimowitz, said that of
the seven software companies GT has acquired, Humongous had
retained far more autonomy, particularly in the marketing area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shelley's been able to develop a very collegial culture
there,'' Chaimowitz said. ``They have a strong entrepreneurial
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurning collaboration offers from heavyweights like Disney and
Warner Brothers, Humongous has concentrated on developing its own
stable of interactive characters, beginning with Putt-Putt, a car
invented by Ms. Day as a bedtime story character for her son,
Travis, now 11.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has paid off. In April, PC Data reported that the
company had the No. 1- and No. 2-selling game titles in the
educational software division, beating out high-powered rivals
including Disney, Broderbund, the Learning Company and Cendant.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of their competitors' characters, Humongous
characters are hand drawn and then digitalized, along with their
watercolor backdrops, providing higher quality animation. Reviewers
also give them high marks for innovative game design and fresh,
witty interactive storytelling. Parents have been known to hang
onto the mouse long after the children have gone to bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start, I wanted humor written at a level the parents
get if they're playing with their child so it's not like if `I see
one more purple dinosaur I'm going to scream,' '' Ms. Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Humongous has chosen carefully among ancillary projects to
preserve their characters' freshness and integrity. ``You won't be
seeing `Putt-Putt on Ice,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of her few management missteps was an attempt to enter the
arena of educational software for 5- and 6-year-olds with the
company's Big Thinkers series, released in October 1997. The titles
bombed, and Humongous has backed off for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Big Thinkers had come out a year earlier, they probably
would have been a runaway success,'' said Warren Buckleitner,
editor of Children's Software Revue magazine, who gave the series
4{ out of a possible 5 stars. He added that they had ``some
breakthrough concepts'' but that they were ``trying to break new
ground at a time when there was a lot of competition out there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Day said, ``It was very hard to compete against those
companies who do strictly education, because they're going to spend
what they need to to protect their core business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the children's segment of the computer games industry
has evolved over the last several years from a quiet niche into a
cutthroat marketplace where price wars, including full-price
rebates for turning in competitors' products, and shelf-space
skirmishes are common.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to match marketing dollars with larger rivals like the
Learning Company and Cendant, Humongous relies heavily on strong
word of mouth and short-term custom pricing arrangements with
retailers to insure good shelf placement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never could have started Humongous Entertainment today,''
said Gilbert, 34. ``It would be virtually impossible now for a new
company to break into the children's market.''
</P>
<P>
   While not exactly a shotgun marriage, the Humongous merger with
GT Interactive was born of just these sorts of competitive
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either build our own distribution division or sell
ourselves to someone who had one,'' Ms. Day said. ``We would have
had a lot of people walking around in coats and ties. Better to
have those guys back in New York.'' Curiously, with all the focus
on creating entertaining games and then marketing them, Ms. Day
admits that scant attention was paid initially to the impact of the
games on children. That came later when letters from parents began
pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   She was surprised to learn how empowering games could be for
young children and how closely children would emulate characters'
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started the company with the goal of creating great bedtime
stories for kids,'' Ms. Day said. ``Except reading a book winds
kids down, this doesn't. But that was the concept. We found out
there was this whole other thing going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Input from parents or educational experts, Ms. Day said, remains
mostly anecdotal. Though there is no real pedagogical foundation
for their games, Humongous does test them on focus groups of
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a frightening absence of research on what's really
happening when children are playing computer games, whether it's
Carmen Sandiego or Putt-Putt,'' said Yasmin Kafai, a professor of
new learning technology at the University of California at Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Kafai echoed many reviewers by praising the
child-friendly game design of Humongous titles as well as the
multiple levels of play, which accommodate the widely varying
developmental needs of children in the target age range, 3 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   While the business reasons for the combination of GT Interactive
and Humongous are clear, it is certainly a case of strange
bedfellows. GT, which specializes in violent, hard-core action
titles, has become something of a whipping boy for what's wrong
with the computer game industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to them about games like `Quake' and `Blood' and
`Doom,' particularly `Blood' which is one I have a problem with,''
Ms. Day said. ``It's not what we're about.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``they've left us completely alone on the
development side.''
</P>
<P>
   Humongous, with financing from GT, in fact, has started its own
adult division, Cavedog Entertainment, which Ms. Day manages. The
first title released last year was a well-received battle strategy
game, ``Total Annihilation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Day and Gilbert face more challenging issues as they move
into television with a Saturday morning show featuring Putt-Putt
and friends expected to make its debut this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Day said Humongous was working closely with a production
company, Lancit Media Entertainment, to insure that the television
versions of their characters remained true to the origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merchandising starts to happen when you have the
television shows; it's a Catch 22,'' Ms. Day said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had the choice between watching television or playing
with the computer, I would rather have my child play with the
computer. But parents are always praising our characters for being
so polite, so helpful. I think the television show can still
deliver that.''

UNDERWEAR OPTIONAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Ever since ``Melrose Place'' star Alyssa Milano
announced on ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' that she wasn't
wearing any underwear, folks have been buzzing about it. Or the
lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   Was she the victim of a heartless panty-raid prank?
</P>
<P>
   Did she miss the lecture about wearing good underwear in case of
a car accident?
</P>
<P>
   Did she take that jeans campaign _ ``Nothing comes between me
and my Calvins'' _ seriously?
</P>
<P>
   And, more importantly, is the young actress' aversion to panties
a singular incident, or part of a growing trend that's sure to
insult the moral majority?
</P>
<P>
   Like, maybe she'd seen ``Basic Instinct'' too many times. You
know, the film in which Sharon Stone silences a room full of jaded
cops by simply uncrossing her ladylike legs and exposing a whole
lot more than Marilyn Monroe did in the ``The Seven Year Itch.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you're wondering, Stone doesn't wear underwear in her
personal life, either. She's said so in numerous interviews.
</P>
<P>
   This obvious refusal to wear underwear can't be a retaliation to
the high prices of lingerie, because underwear sales are up by 9
percent since last year, according to fashion trend watchers at
Fairchild Strategic Information Services.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, it was just an attention-getter, suggests Susan Colman,
president of Jezebel, a leading bra and panty maker. ``I saw the
show. It got my attention,'' she said with a chuckle, referring to
Milano's revealing statement.
</P>
<P>
   Milano, like Stone, didn't actually expose any part of herself _
visually, that is. It was just the thought of a Hollywood star sans
panties that got us all flustered.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't the only ones who crossed the line on panty
lines. Jay Leno also learned actress Tori Spelling doesn't wear
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   And neither does ``Baywatch'' babe Donna D'Errico, who showed up
for a recent fashion layout without panties or bra.
</P>
<P>
   And we thought Madonna was outrageous. At least we knew for a
fact she wore underwear ... even if it was worn as outerwear.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the deal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Comfort,'' says Shari Belafonte. ``I rarely wear underwear ...
but I definitely wear panties with a short skirt,'' Harry's
daughter said over dinner at the opening night gala for the
Hollywood Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Since everybody in the group was talking about the Jay Leno show
(with Alyssa Milano), she mentioned that at least half of the stars
walking down the red carpet on Oscar and Emmy night aren't wearing
underwear, either.
</P>
<P>
   Former runway model Jane Mannfolk, who's now a stylist for
``Leeza'' (yes, Leeza wears underwear) and ``Interior Motives'' on
the Discovery Channel, says the suspected trend really is a trend,
and she thinks it started years ago with fashion models.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mannfolk, ``Traditionally, European runway models
don't wear underwear because designers don't want any lines showing
under the garment. However, it's also for convenience, since models
must change quickly into several ensembles during a show. But this
isn't new. It's just that it's become more obvious due to the
currently sheer and clingy clothing, so it's caught on with anybody
who's proud of their figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sexy to say, `I'm not wearing any underwear.' But just
for the record, it's also very uncomfortable. Why someone would
want to wear tight jeans without panties is beyond me,'' she said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   While Mannfolk takes a liberal view on runway nudity, the
stylist does get upset with the everyday housewives who have been
selected for fashion makeovers on the ``Leeza'' show. Quite a few
actually show up without underwear, so she keeps a supply of
flesh-colored G-strings by Calvin Klein to protect the borrowed
clothes _ and the TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about that G-string trend. Some think it started with Demi
Moore in ``Striptease,'' and others say it kicked off with the
black G-string featuring the Gucci symbol. You may have seen it in
magazine ads, worn as a swimsuit brief or exposed under a
hip-riding skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, g-strings and their slightly more modest cousin _
the thong _ have become popular panty choices for women who don't
like visible panty lines and no longer wear pantyhose.
</P>
<P>
   Even mainstream companies such as Jezebel make them, but before
you start wondering what the world is coming to, read on. According
to Colman, most women in America still buy modest white panties.
She adds that her biggest seller is a ``waist-high panty with a
high-cut leg, a cotton liner and good coverage in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Going without underwear isn't a political statement like the
bra-burning era of the '60s, nor is it a sexist remark. Guys do it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Rodney Dangerfield has been known to partake of
undies-optional fashion ... and an entire episode of ``Seinfeld''
had Kramer celebrating new-found freedom when he shed his shorts.
</P>
<P>
   And what about that video artist Nam June Paik? He stood up to
greet President Clinton at a recent White House state dinner for
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, and his pants fell down to his
ankles, revealing ... ``The Full Monty.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget meeting the president. Let's do America a favor and
introduce him to Joe Boxer.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: TURN 65, SEE YOUR MEDICAL RIGHTS CURBED
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 5
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By all accounts, President Clinton repeatedly urged
his Chinese hosts to relax their tight grip on the lives of their
people. But back home, when it comes to the rights of Medicare
beneficiaries, Clinton seems more comfortable with the Chinese
Communist model.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that, after you turn 65, your doctor can go to jail for
health care fraud if you decide to sidestep the Medicare
bureaucracy and pay his fee directly.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the vast majority of the 38 million Americans under
Medicare would have scant reason to pay for covered health care
services out of their own pockets. In nearly every case, doctors
accept Medicare reimbursements as payment in full for their
services.
</P>
<P>
   But some seniors might desire, from time to time, to bypass the
system, perhaps to protect their privacy or to be treated by a
specialist in high demand who is otherwise unavailable to them.
While Congress or the courts may yet return matters to they way
they were when Medicare was enacted in 1965, such choices have been
barred since January.
</P>
<P>
   When Medicare officials, acting on their own, put the squeeze on
doctors who billed their Medicare patients directly for services
delivered outside the government-paid insurance plan, Congress
stepped in. The Senate voted 64-35 to uphold such private
contracts, provided safeguards against double billing were in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that some doctors would fill their appointment books
with high-paying seniors at the expense of Medicare beneficiaries,
Clinton reacted by threatening to veto the entire federal budget
unless the proviso was excised.
</P>
<P>
   Thereupon, Congress enacted a so-called compromise that obliges
physicians to opt out of Medicare entirely for two years in order
to enter into even one private patient agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-year exclusion presents your doctor with a very
difficult choice,'' Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., said. ``He can either
treat you, his patient of, say, 30 years on a private contract
basis and dump all of his other Medicare patients or refuse to
treat you in favor of his current Medicare patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Since about 96 percent of doctors accept Medicare patients, few
would likely be willing to impose such a hardship on their current
senior rosters. So, as Kyl sees it, the two-year option amounts to
``an almost meaningless choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Tex., are leading the effort to
change the law. Noting that there aren't any such limits under
Medicaid or the health plans that cover federal workers, including
members of Congress, 51 senators have backed a resolution upholding
the right of seniors to contract privately for care.
</P>
<P>
   For doctors who would treat well-off seniors in this way, such
an arrangement would parallel the cost-shifting that is seen in
hospital bills. By accepting higher fees from some seniors, the
doctors could afford to expand the number of lower-fee Medicare
patients they see.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, so far as we know, White House has no plans
ask Congress to bar private markets that accept food stamps from
also selling their goods to shoppers at listed prices. Perhaps that
will make the Chinese leaders take more heed of the blessings that
our free system has to offer.

IT'S A VIDEO GAME, IT'S TV, AND YOU'RE THE STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On television, a montage of hockey footage unfurls against the
ESPN National Hockey Night musical theme, leading into Dan Patrick
and Kenny Mayne making fun of themselves in one of those
self-mocking Sports Center commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Then you see a screenful of ESPN graphics about the matchup, an
exhibition game between the Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado
Avalanche. Cut to Joe Louis Arena, with all the ambient hoopla of a
sold-out crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The camera pans over the rink from high above as the National
Hockey Night anchors, Gary Thorne and Steve Levy, recall a vicious
brawl between the teams in the 1996 playoffs. This is a bad-blood
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche do not like
each other,'' Thorne says. ``Tonight, that battle continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting lineups flash onto the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're ready to drop the puck to start the first period.''
</P>
<P>
   Minor jostling ensues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, what a hit!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Painkillers, please!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have gotten away with one there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary, if the referee doesn't start calling some of this stuff,
things are going to get out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a television broadcast. It's a video game, one of
three developed by Radical Entertainment under the aegis of ESPN
Digital Games. Scheduled for release this fall, National Hockey
Night, NBA Tonight and X-Games Pro Boarder are the first
installments in a series of what ESPN is calling ``playable
broadcasts.''
</P>
<P>
   National Hockey Night, for instance, plays like any hockey game
for the personal computer or Playstation, except you see everything
from signature ESPN camera angles like the fisheye goalie cam with
an overlay of ESPN broadcast graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you do is accompanied by color commentary by Thorne
and Levy. When you score a big goal or slam dunk, there are ESPN
instant replays from multiple points of view to cap the moment. On
the PC version, you can see those replays on the Jumbotron, a video
screen framed by a television broadcast and viewed on a computer
monitor (paging Marshall McLuhan...).
</P>
<P>
   The visual elements, the pacing, the commentary, the graphic
design, the crowd response _ all of it conveys the look and feel of
a live television event. Except in this case, you can do more than
sit there and yell at Shaquille O'Neal for missing a shot because
you're the one who's playing.
</P>
<P>
   It's your team. You're the star. You shoot. You score. The crowd
goes wild, and ESPN has something to say about it.
</P>
<P>
   The object here is to blur the line between television and
interactive media. And it works. Because unlike other sorts of
television (sitcoms, movies, music videos), a sports event does not
have to be translated into a game.
</P>
<P>
   It is already a game. It has players. It has rules. It has
winners and losers. It's already interactive. All you have to do is
reassign the players. Extract the kernel, intact, from one medium
and wrap it in another, preferably with a bright, prominently
displayed brand logo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a packaging job. And television is great packaging for
sports. The commentary, the on-screen scorecards and statistics,
and the camera angles provide a context for the action. That's the
value added by a network. It's not just a window. It's a frame. It
makes everything inside seem more significant and dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   In the newspaper or on the radio or in a fully equipped home
theater, hockey is hockey is hockey. Context defines the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN is a context for understanding sports. By the same token,
ESPN Digital Games is a context for understanding simulated sports.
After you have played for a week in season mode, the computer will
create a 30-second Plays of the Week segment, a cross-section of
highlights from the league, including a few of your most
spectacular plays and memorable flubs (the thrill of victory, the
agony of defeat).
</P>
<P>
   So it really seems as though your games are part of a pro
season. It puts your wins and losses in context.
</P>
<P>
   At 28 minutes and 58 minutes after the hour, the ESPN sports
ticker unfurls across the screen with updates about games in
progress. If you're playing on a Playstation, those updates are
hypothetical. But if you're playing on a PC hooked up to the
Internet, that sports ticker can stream information directly from
ESPN's Web site, customized according to your preferences.
</P>
<P>
   So while your favorite overpaid athletes face off on a simulated
ball court, the sports feed from the real world is updated on a
continual basis _ the off-line world is delivered intravenously,
courtesy of your cable sports network.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of next year, ESPN Digital Games tickers will also
download statistical data on players and teams _ wins, losses,
injuries, suspensions, arrests for drug possession _ throughout the
season, so the game world will accurately reflect its televised
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   All of this creates a strange sort of parallel universe for
sports fans, a replica of the sports world that lets you branch off
at any point. Can you do a better job managing the New York Yankees
than Joe Torre? Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of an ESPN baseball game, you'll be able to
stream Yankee stats down the ticker and synchronize the real league
with the simulation _ or not.
</P>
<P>
   And just to venture into the realm of paranoia for a moment, if
that ticker can download team rosters, scores and statistics, it
can probably download other sorts of information as well.
</P>
<P>
   Say you're a registered member of ESPN Sports Zone. You're a
26-year-old man in Phoenix who likes basketball and snowboarding.
Who says the sponsor banners in your virtual stadium have to be the
same as everyone else's? How long will it be until ESPN Digital
Games is selling demographically tuned advertisements on the
virtual Jumbotron?
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned, sports fans.

 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the first time someone went on line and thought to type in
a question like ``What are you wearing?'' to an unseen stranger in
cyberspace, computer chat has had a somewhat shady reputation.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, chat has been a way to waste time, the equivalent
of being a teen-ager on the telephone but with a dozen chums at
once. At worst, chat has been about cybersex, and lots of chat
rooms have been seedy locations, virtual back alleys where
pedophiles and sexual predators lurked.
</P>
<P>
   But chat is changing, maturing, diversifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, chat was something my aunt used to talk to her
friends about making doll-house clothing,'' said Marty Focazio,
director of strategic services at Spiral Media, an Internet
development company based in New York. ``But I use it basically for
fast, tactical communication, whether I'm in or out of the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Chat is being used in business, education and consumer service.
It is turning out to be a way to promote television and movie stars
and to provide a forum for authors to talk to their readers. It is
also being renamed ``real-time customer interaction'' and labeled
an ``Internet collaboration tool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, chat is the easiest and most reliable way to
communicate over the Internet in real time,'' said James P. Tito,
president and chief executive of Eshare Technologies, a major
provider of chat technology to companies like Merrill Lynch,
1-800-Flowers, Mail Boxes Etc. and AT&AMP;T Worldnet Services.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Commack, N.Y., also provides chat services
to 100 universities, including Yale and Cornell, so they can
stretch physical classrooms into virtual ones by offering distance
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way that most people can use the Internet,'' Tito.
``You don't need any specific equipment or special browser or
special plug-ins.''
</P>
<P>
   Tito estimates that of the 107 million people who use the
Internet worldwide, at least 40 million to 50 million of them use
chat in some fashion, including the more recent innovations of
one-on-one chat pioneered by America Online's Buddy List and
Instant Message systems.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, which, with 12 million users, is the largest online service
in the United States, recently found that its users spent 19
percent of their time in online chat rooms, 2 percentage points
more than the time they spent combing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hirsch, a senior producer with Yahoo (www.yahoo.com),
described chat as a ubiquitous ``everyman's tool'' that ``can be
used in any way anyone would want to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yahoo alone, an Internet media company schedules at least 100
chat events a month, Hirsch said. At The Globe (www.theglobe.com),
an Internet site that encourages its users to build online
communities, about 30 percent of its more than five million users
chatted on line, said Stephan Paternot, the company's president and
co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   Not that chat has gone completely sober and serious. Consider
this recent exchange with Gena Lee Nolin, the actress who plays the
``Baywatch'' bad gal Neely Capshaw.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Dandeanie asks: Does it scare you knowing that people
out there on the Net obsess over you?
</P>
<P>
   Nolin: Do they obsess over me? Oh, that flatters me! I didn't
know they obsessed over me, though. Wow.
</P>
<P>
   CoolKiss84 asks: I want to be an actress. How do I get an agent
and a manager?
</P>
<P>
   Nolin: Well, where do you live? If you live in L.A. or N.Y. (you
should be based there) you need to get photos taken and have some
sort of acting experience.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was made possible by Big Star Entertainment
(www.bigstar. com), an online movie store that arranges regularly
scheduled chats in a partnership with Yahoo. Ms. Nolin only had to
talk on the telephone from her home in Los Angeles while Big Star's
staff read questions to her and had her answers typed and
dispatched into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 5,500 questions buzzed across the Internet to Ms.
Nolin in the 30 minutes before the chat officially began and during
the hour it lasted. She answered as many as she could, or cared to
(she ignored questions about whether her figure had been surgically
enhanced).
</P>
<P>
   Computer chat, practically born with the Internet almost 30
years ago, is a simple, sometimes bumpy, means of immediate online
communication in which people type live messages over computer
networks. People can chat one on one or in groups. The responses
are live also, so a conversation among several people can make
about as much sense as the babble when a group of people in a room
all talk at once.
</P>
<P>
   One way to talk on line is to enter a chat room, or forum, by
following the directions on America Online or Microsoft Networks to
one of their chat rooms or by logging on directly to a chat site on
a World Wide Web page like Big Star's or the one offered by
Ivillage: The Women's Network. Conversations are wide-ranging,
touching on topics like health, careers, relationships and rearing
children (www.ivillage.com).
</P>
<P>
   Another way to chat is through instant messages. AOL members
have long been able to send instant messages to other members that
flash on the screen no matter what the other person is doing. And
other programs like Ding make it possible to send instant messages
on the Web. As with many other aspects of the Internet, what was
once a means for people to connect with each other has become a
commercial tool.
</P>
<P>
   Chat is certainly a natural way to promote entertainment
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is doing chat now,'' said Jerry Shandrew, the
publicist for Ms. Nolin and a number of other stars and supermodels
he has nudged to chat on line. ``It's the Internet, so you can
reach an audience all over the world, and you can put people
directly in touch with someone. That's exciting and personal.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for America Online, Wendy Goldberg, agreed, noting
that a chat in May with some of the stars of ABC's popular Friday
night sitcoms had drawn 117,000 people, AOL's largest chat
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But chat is by no means limited to Hollywood. Almost at the same
time as the chat with ABC stars, a collection of international
scientists and business leaders met in a chat forum to discuss
biotechnology and its implications.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a California computer game maker is starting a chat
room for toddlers, while all sorts of groups, like computer
manufacturers and the Internal Revenue Service, are exploring chat
as a way to improve customer service while lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear a lot of times that people don't communicate
anymore,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ``But people are communicating a lot
more now.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her 78-year-old aunt and her mother, who lives in
Massachusetts, frequently used AOL's Instant Message service, which
opens a chat window between two computers linked to AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Ms. Goldberg said with a chuckle, her mother will go
on line and notice that Ms. Goldberg is on line and working late in
AOL's corporate office in Reston, Va. Using chat technology, Ms.
Goldberg's mother sends her daughter instant messages that urge her
not to work so hard and to get to bed.
</P>
<P>
   David Phipps, a lawyer in a Los Angeles suburb who is a
volunteer host for a technology chat room on the Microsoft Network,
said chat helped make sense out of the chaos that often rules the
Internet. Computer chat makes communicating with many people almost
as easy as communicating with one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people can't talk and listen at the same time because our
own voices drown out all others,'' Phipps said. ``In an Internet
chat room, many people can talk at once. The computer sorts it all
out and displays everyone's statements in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, most of the time. While the speed of computers and
Internet connections have surged in recent years, some longtime
computer users like Laura Balsam, a computer consultant in New
York, are not overly impressed with chat technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general,'' she said, ``chat rooms are so slow. You type
something and five minutes later, someone responds to you.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ms. Balsam said she liked instant chat, those
message windows that, unlike open chat rooms, link only those who
know one each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like walking down the street and sometimes running into a
friend,'' she said. ``It's a spontaneous kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely that kind of comfort with chat that Richard Dym,
vice president of marketing for Tribal Voice of Scotts Valley,
Calif., is counting on as he tries to broaden chat's reach into
more homes, offices and classrooms with Pow Wow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pow Wow, he explained, is a software program that lets users
create their own chat rooms. Room can be entered only with keys,
which can be given to up to 800 people, far extending the usual
chat-room limit of 25. The program, like Ding by Activerse of
Austin, Texas, offers instant messaging and the ability for users
to see quickly if users in the lists they create are actually on
line.
</P>
<P>
   Pow Wow and Ding also offer Internet telephony, the ability to
transmit instant voice messages over the Internet. In fact, Dym
said, just as chat is expanding, its end may be in sight. He said
full Internet telephony would overtake and mostly replace
text-based chat in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Many disagree with Dym's forecast, especially online chatters
who say they enjoy a level of anonymity that text-only chat
provides them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Text-based chat is probably always going to be there in some
shape or form,'' said Tito, Eshare Technologies' president. ``No
matter what you do, it is very difficult for 50 people to actually
talk all at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Randal Vaughn, a professor of information systems at Baylor
University in Waco, Texas, said he used Pow Wow's chat system _
without telephony _ to extend his reach to his students, who are
extremely computer literate.
</P>
<P>
   He said his three undergraduate classes tended to be large, each
with about 50 students. Vaughn said computer chat had helped him
reach more students, extending his office hours by allowing him to
meet with many of them on line.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how one of his students had recently encountered a
problem while working as a Web developer 10 miles off campus. By
using chat, the student and the professor found a solution
together.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of chat, Vaughn said, is that students using a
crowded computer laboratory can confer with him in his office
without leaving their seats and losing their turns with the
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all voluntary,'' he said, adding that his classroom chats
were also popular.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses are also turning to chat. Eshare Technology is
setting up chat-based customer service for 1-800-Flowers that is
expected to begin later this month. Tito said it would permit
people to use their Internet connections to not only communicate in
real time with a company representative but also to see and choose
flower arrangements on line.
</P>
<P>
   On the lighter side, many Internet multiplayer game services use
chat rooms as meeting places for players to choose sides, discuss
strategies or simply brag about their prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Multitude, a computer game company in Burlingame, Calif., is
testing Fire Team, an Internet collaborative game that is played in
squads in which players are linked through voice chat so they can
speak and listen to one another through headsets as they coordinate
their play.
</P>
<P>
   And this month, Gizmo Gypsies, a children's computer game
company in Santa Clara, Calif., is starting The Little Wizard
Activity Center, which features an Internet chat room for children
3 to 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The baby chatters will appear as cartoon bugs with their names
attached to them. The child simply clicks on a picture of a gesture
along the screen's lower edge and their bug, for instance, waves,
jumps, dances or squawks in bugspeak.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, the kids just go into rooms and experience
other bugs and the kids,'' said Mike Hayes, the company's chief
executive. ``We also want to provide them with the opportunity to
maybe get into a room with a grandparent or mom or dad.''
</P>

   Hayes said the bug chat room, called Bugville, would break new
ground and help children prepare for communicating on the Internet.

   ``They are getting the benefit of starting to understand that
there are other people in this world,'' Hayes said. ``And that they

PUTTING THE STARS WITHIN REACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Marshall L. McCall is a professor of astronomy at York University
in Toronto.  
 By MARSHALL L. McCALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 3:24 a.m. in New York City on Saturday, Sept. 12, 1998.
You are returning home after a long night of partying. Looking high
in the east, you see a half-moon.
</P>
<P>
   You notice what appears to be a reddish star right next to the
moon, near the imaginary line that divides the light and dark
parts. Suddenly, the star disappears. Yet there are no clouds in
the sky, and the moon remains crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be the beginning of the end? Have you caught an
invading alien vessel in the act of cloaking? Have you had too many
drinks? Or is there an astronomical explanation for this alarming
phenomenon?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that the only way of answering the last
question was to consult your neighborhood astronomer. But where do
you find one at 3:30 in the morning, even in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, you have just installed a desktop planetarium on
your home computer. Firing it up, you tell it your location and the
time. Suddenly, a myriad of stars appears on your screen. The
computer displays a view toward the north, so you scroll around to
the east.
</P>
<P>
   There you see the moon among the stars. You click on the moon,
and it becomes centered on the screen. No bright star is
immediately obvious. Investigating further, you turn your
planetarium into a time machine, telling it to step back two
minutes in time every second.
</P>
<P>
   Now you see the moon move with respect to the stars. Suddenly, a
bright star emerges. Clicking on it, you are told that it is
Aldebaran, a true star that is one of the brightest in the sky.
Mystery solved!
</P>
<P>
   Now you reverse time to move into the future. The moon passes in
front of Aldebaran as it moves on its orbital journey around Earth.
At 3:47 a.m. by your planetarium's clock, the star emerges from the
dark half of the moon's disk. Running outside, you indeed see that
the subject of your concern is back in the sky, but on the other
side of the moon. You can sleep soundly knowing that the world is
safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, many software tools have become available
to bring astronomy down to earth. One of them, Astronomy Village,
is an interactive disk that makes it possible to act out the life
of a professional astronomer. Another one, Real Sky CD, brings to
the masses the actual survey images of the sky used by professional
astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular programs are desktop planetariums, five of
which are reviewed here. Unlike Real Sky CD, desktop planetariums,
for the most part, simulate the view of the sky seen from any
location on Earth at any time, day or night, in the past or the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Although they may allow you access to real images of the
heavens, scenes are normally constructed by plotting the locations
of celestial bodies, using information recorded in vast catalogs.
In this way, they are very much like traditional atlases of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   What makes them special is that they allow you to see how things
change over time at a pace you choose. And many can let you look at
the heavens from the perspective of another world.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, most do not require you to be an expert. If you
simply want to learn about astronomy, a good desktop planetarium is
the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you have a fast computer, though; a lot of number
crunching is done with every tick of the clock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASTRONOMY VILLAGE: INVESTIGATING THE UNIVERSE, VERSION 1.0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (NASA Central Operation of Resources for Educators; $5;
Macintosh. Requires Apple Hypercard 2.2 or later.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, educators at Wheeling Jesuit University in
Wheeling, W.Va., have developed role-playing multimedia software
that acquaints students with the practice of modern professional
astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is designed for the ninth grade, it can be used by
anyone with at least that level of education to learn about the
universe and feel like a professional while doing it. Best of all,
it costs next to nothing, although you have to buy Apple's
Hypercard to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy Village opens with the sky darkening over a
mountaintop village, with a large telescope dome in the center.
Besides the observatory, there is an orientation center, a
conference center, a library, a computer laboratory, a hands-on
laboratory, an auditorium and a cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on any of the buildings takes you inside. To learn the
skills needed to navigate through the village, it is first
necessary to visit the orientation center. Research is begun at the
conference center, where a topic of interest is selected.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the Middle East's impossible issues, Jerusalem, it has
long been argued, is best left to the last: once everything else is
sorted out, the irreconcilable may perhaps be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, there is no questioning the rider to the
proposition: that high-handed unilateral action to determine the
future of a city that both Israel and the Palestinians claim as
their capital could well destroy any hope of a peace agreement.
Yet, Israel, seemingly deaf to this logic, is once again embarked
on such action.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides promised, when they signed the Oslo peace
agreement in 1993, that the status of Jerusalem would stay
unchanged until they negotiated its future as part of a final
settlement. Strictly speaking, its political status has not
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Israel has used demography. The peace talks were frozen
16 months ago when Israel began building a large Jewish settlement,
Har Homa, in an Arab area.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as the Americans struggled to unfreeze the talks,
the Israeli cabinet gave initial approval to a plan that expands
Jerusalem's municipal borders, partly by including (though not
annexing) two Jewish settlements east and north of the city and the
West Bank land between them and the city.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any ``peace process'' still left to save? Making that
question yet more vexed, the Israeli government is considering a
non-binding referendum on America's proposal for a small, staged
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The charitable view of this poll is that Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel's prime minister, is seeking popular support to squeeze
acceptance out of his hard-line cabinet. But the American plan,
crucial as it is to getting talks restarted, deals only with one of
the three interim ``redeployments'' that were supposed, under Oslo,
to precede the final-settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   If a slow-motion referendum has to hold matters up at this
stage, the hopes of pushing on to a realistic, worthwhile
settlement are dim indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the principle that possession is nine-tenths of the
law, Netanyahu appears to bank on the Palestinians, unequal
partners in the peace process, having no option but to wait quietly
for whatever crumbs the squabbling Israeli government may be
prepared to drop. And they will not get even the crumbs unless they
ensure that no dissident or desperate Palestinian attacks an
Israeli citizen.
</P>
<P>
   This security pledge is intrinsic to the original land-for-peace
bargain. But with limited power over small enclaves of land that
are often cut off from one another, let alone from the outside
world, by Israel's summary border controls, the Palestinians are
growing ever more dissident and desperate.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the IMF's Middle Eastern Department reveals
how cruelly economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza have
deteriorated since peace broke out: by the beginning of last year,
the unemployment rate was 15 percent higher than in 1993, and
income per head 20 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   These are sour rewards for peace. Yet they would be endurable if
there were genuine hope of better, more independent and more
honorable, times to come. Unfortunately, nothing that the Netanyahu
government has yet offered justifies such hope.
</P>
<P>
   So where will the Palestinians turn? Weaklings compared with the
Israelis, they have two possible forms of pressure. One is force,
albeit suicidal _ in all senses of the word.
</P>
<P>
   They ponder a reprise of the intifada, the uprising in the late
1980s that eventually helped to bring the Israelis to the
negotiating table. A new intifada, it is acknowledged, would be a
grimmer affair: men with arms, not boys with stones.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could turn to world opinion, nearly all of it critical
of Israel, which buttresses, or should buttress, their weakness as
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Without America's influence, the Palestinians might already have
been repulsed from the table. But this influence does not extend to
pressing the Israeli government to break a pattern that is steadily
pushing a Middle East peace out of sight. Until it does, the
descent to violence seems ineluctable. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   An astronomer acts as your mentor and leads you through your
investigation. A separate research path diagram guides you through
the various stages of background research and data collection,
analysis and interpretation, and the presentation of findings.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, you are interested in learning about the
structure of galaxies. Your mentor first directs you to the library
to do some background work. Once that is completed, you go up to
the observatory to use an electronic camera to get images of
galaxies in a cluster.
</P>
<P>
   A quick nighttime trip to the cafeteria allows you to satisfy
your appetite and talk to other astronomers on the mountain about
their experiences. When you have finished observing, you go to the
computer room to make some measurements, then to the hands-on
laboratory to study how a galaxy's environment might affect how it
evolves.
</P>
<P>
   Another trip to the computer room allows you to simulate galaxy
interactions. Finally, your moment of glory comes: you present your
results at a press conference. Of course, you have to be prepared
to cope with questions from the news media throng.
</P>
<P>
   At each step of the way, the mentor appears to explain where you
should go next and what you should do. Some instructions come by
e-mail (of course, you have to go to the computer laboratory to
read those messages).
</P>
<P>
   Although additional teaching materials are available, the
Astronomy Village CD-ROM is easy enough for anyone to master. It is
worth getting to learn about astronomy while learning how
astronomers learn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REAL SKY CD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Astronomical Society of the Pacific; $250 for each of Northern
or Southern sky, $450 for both; Windows 3.1, 95 and NT, and
Macintosh.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, professional astronomers have been poring over
photographic atlases of the sky constructed painstakingly by
special telescopes in California, Australia and Chile. The pictures
reveal stars a million times as faint as the eye can see. The
dimmest extremities of nebulae and galaxies can be seen with
exquisite detail.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the materials have been confined to back rooms of
observatories and universities, essentially inaccessible to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Hubble Space Telescope came along. To point the
telescope accurately, it was necessary to create a database of
stellar positions that included even very faint stars. That was
accomplished by scanning and digitizing the entire collection of
photographic images.
</P>
<P>
   One outcome was the Hubble Guide Star Catalog, a massive index
of stars that has been added to many desktop planetariums,
including three reviewed here (The Sky, Voyager and Starry Night).
</P>
<P>
   Another was Real Sky CD, in which the actual digitized images
have been compressed by a factor of 100 to fit on 18 CD-ROMs. It is
a marvel of modern technology that allows anyone to see the sky as
the professionals do, much as the Landsat project has allowed us to
view Earth in all its splendor. To view the images, a program
called Real Sky View is included.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there are some significant hitches. Unless you
want to look at one of a predefined set of obscurely named objects,
Real Sky View requires you to identify the astronomical coordinates
of a field of interest to be able to look at it. That requires
advance knowledge, perhaps gained through a book or desktop
planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows you to zoom in on specific locations, but
zooming in too much reveals imperfections in the images caused by
their compression. A smoothing tool is provided to make things look
nicer.
</P>
<P>
   In a practical sense, the main strength of Real Sky CD is that
it allows you to measure a precise position for anything you see.
The software can also be used to create ``finding charts'' to help
locate faint objects with a telescope, but you have to take the
trouble to determine the scale yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy Real Sky CD to learn about astronomy. It should be
regarded as a resource that augments the capabilities of the
serious amateur. Those with occasional needs can probably get by
with the link to the online version of the Digitized Sky Survey at
the Space Telescope Science Institute. &QL;

   REDSHIFT 3, VERSION 3.0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Piranha Interactive Publishing; $49.95; Windows 95 and 98,
Macintosh will be available in July.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some people want to observe the heavens, and others want to go
there. Redshift is the Desktop Planetarium that comes closest to
satisfying both camps. For the would-be astronaut, it beautifully
integrates detailed planetary landscapes into its regular functions
by employing sophisticated 3-D rendering software: features of a
planet change as you move around it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can simulate a trip around Saturn by placing
yourself on one of its natural satellites or on a satellite of your
own creation. Or you can beam up to an imaginary platform high
above the surface and command Redshift to take you on a journey
around the planet. The changing view of the rings and their shadows
is breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Standing back on Earth, it is possible to magnify the moon to
make it appear up to 10,000 times as large without loss of
resolution, in steps small enough and at a rate fast enough that
you feel as though you are traveling there.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the Middle East's impossible issues, Jerusalem, it has
long been argued, is best left to the last: once everything else is
sorted out, the irreconcilable may perhaps be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, there is no questioning the rider to the
proposition: that high-handed unilateral action to determine the
future of a city that both Israel and the Palestinians claim as
their capital could well destroy any hope of a peace agreement.
Yet, Israel, seemingly deaf to this logic, is once again embarked
on such action.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides promised, when they signed the Oslo peace
agreement in 1993, that the status of Jerusalem would stay
unchanged until they negotiated its future as part of a final
settlement. Strictly speaking, its political status has not
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Israel has used demography. The peace talks were frozen
16 months ago when Israel began building a large Jewish settlement,
Har Homa, in an Arab area.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as the Americans struggled to unfreeze the talks,
the Israeli cabinet gave initial approval to a plan that expands
Jerusalem's municipal borders, partly by including (though not
annexing) two Jewish settlements east and north of the city and the
West Bank land between them and the city.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any ``peace process'' still left to save? Making that
question yet more vexed, the Israeli government is considering a
non-binding referendum on America's proposal for a small, staged
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The charitable view of this poll is that Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel's prime minister, is seeking popular support to squeeze
acceptance out of his hard-line cabinet. But the American plan,
crucial as it is to getting talks restarted, deals only with one of
the three interim ``redeployments'' that were supposed, under Oslo,
to precede the final-settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   If a slow-motion referendum has to hold matters up at this
stage, the hopes of pushing on to a realistic, worthwhile
settlement are dim indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the principle that possession is nine-tenths of the
law, Netanyahu appears to bank on the Palestinians, unequal
partners in the peace process, having no option but to wait quietly
for whatever crumbs the squabbling Israeli government may be
prepared to drop. And they will not get even the crumbs unless they
ensure that no dissident or desperate Palestinian attacks an
Israeli citizen.
</P>
<P>
   This security pledge is intrinsic to the original land-for-peace
bargain. But with limited power over small enclaves of land that
are often cut off from one another, let alone from the outside
world, by Israel's summary border controls, the Palestinians are
growing ever more dissident and desperate.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the IMF's Middle Eastern Department reveals
how cruelly economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza have
deteriorated since peace broke out: by the beginning of last year,
the unemployment rate was 15 percent higher than in 1993, and
income per head 20 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   These are sour rewards for peace. Yet they would be endurable if
there were genuine hope of better, more independent and more
honorable, times to come. Unfortunately, nothing that the Netanyahu
government has yet offered justifies such hope.
</P>
<P>
   So where will the Palestinians turn? Weaklings compared with the
Israelis, they have two possible forms of pressure. One is force,
albeit suicidal _ in all senses of the word.
</P>
<P>
   They ponder a reprise of the intifada, the uprising in the late
1980s that eventually helped to bring the Israelis to the
negotiating table. A new intifada, it is acknowledged, would be a
grimmer affair: men with arms, not boys with stones.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could turn to world opinion, nearly all of it critical
of Israel, which buttresses, or should buttress, their weakness as
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Without America's influence, the Palestinians might already have
been repulsed from the table. But this influence does not extend to
pressing the Israeli government to break a pattern that is steadily
pushing a Middle East peace out of sight. Until it does, the
descent to violence seems ineluctable. &QL;

 UNDATED: traveling there.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Redshift is an outstanding instrument for learning. It is the
only desktop planetarium with a full-featured astronomical
dictionary on line (The Penguin Dictionary of Astronomy). And
multimedia is used to introduce many fundamental astronomical
concepts, like the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   Redshift is a masterpiece of multimedia engineering. If you need
to fly, Redshift will get you there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STARRY NIGHT DELUXE VERSION 2.1.3 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Sienna Software; $89.95; Windows 95 and NT, and Macintosh.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are few experiences as invigorating as being out in the
countryside standing under a canopy of stars on a still night.
Starry Night conveys that feeling better than any other desktop
planetarium.
</P>
<P>
   As the Sun sets, shadows of trees both move and lengthen.
Through twilight, the blue of the sky deepens and stars begin to
appear. Finally, night arrives, and the glory of the heavens is
revealed. The brightness and colors of the stars are rendered so
well that it is hard to believe that you are indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Starry Night also does a very good job of integrating planetary
landscapes. When you visit a planet, you can see your feet: a pair
of sneakers on Earth or a spacesuit if you are in a more
inhospitable environment.
</P>
<P>
   Starry Night is a beautifully constructed desktop planetarium
that is easy to learn. If you cannot get out of the city, this is
the next best thing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SKY, LEVEL IV &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Software Bisque; $249; Windows 3.1, 95 and NT. A version for
Macintosh and Windows 95 and 98 will be available in August.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amateur astronomers around the world examine the sky regularly,
usually with binoculars or telescopes. In the past, they had to
wrestle with flashlights and charts. An unfiltered flashlight would
blind night vision for minutes. Charts would flap in the breeze.
Now a PC with the right desktop planetarium can make observations a
lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   The Sky excels as a field companion. It is unique in providing a
Night Vision Option that converts the display to red on black. It
is also able to show how the heavens should look through your
telescope. It is the only desktop planetarium that can link
directly to Real Sky CD.
</P>
<P>
   More serious amateurs can use The Sky to control many
commercially available computer-driven telescopes. The Sky falls
short in not allowing the user to view the heavens from other
virtual vantage points in the solar system. But it is hard to find
a better friend in the field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VOYAGER II &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Carina Software; $159.50; Macintosh.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When using a desktop planetarium, it is easy to lose sight of
the forest while examining the trees. Voyager excels at revealing
order on grand scales.
</P>
<P>
   Although Voyager lacks the gloss of Redshift or Starry Night, it
excels at displaying celestial systems. Suppose, for example, a new
asteroid is discovered. As with other desktop planetariums, it is a
simple matter to enter its orbital parameters (readily accessible
on the Web).
</P>
<P>
   With Voyager, it is easy to go to a convenient vantage point in
space and track the rock's motion relative to the other planets. An
impending catastrophe can become painfully obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Voyager can show the entire sky at once. Particular objects can
be turned on or off to reveal their locations with respect to the
Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   One deficiency of Voyager is that there is no online help, but
the manual is excellent. An add-on called Sky Pilot can be
purchased to enable you to use Voyager to control a telescope. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DANCE OF THE PLANETS, STANDARD EDITION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (ARC Science Simulations; $95; DOS 5.0 or later.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Desktop planetariums rely upon mathematical descriptions of the
locations and motions of planets, satellites, asteroids and comets
to track their positions through space and time. That works well as
long as the bodies do not come too close to a strong source of
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The only desktop planetarium that automatically accommodates
perturbations to all orbits caused by the gravitational influence
of bodies other than the Sun is Dance of the Planets. The only
other one capable of dealing with gravitational perturbations is
Redshift, but it can do so for only one body at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Dance of the Planets excels at tracking objects in the solar
system. It is dated and hard to use, but if you really need to know
how hazardous those pesky PHAs (potentially hazardous asteroids)
might be, Dance of the Planets is for you.

NOT-SO-GREAT EXPECTATIONS: WELCOME TO CHINA, MR. CLINTON

<P>
   Can a summit that brings together the leader of the world's most
powerful country and the head of the world's biggest emerging power
be anything less than a world-shaping event?
</P>
<P>
   After China's president, Jiang Zemin, visited America last
October, the two sides talked of building a new ``strategic
partnership.'' The backdrop to Bill Clinton's return visit to China
this week would seem to underscore the need for something to
restore stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Last month India and Pakistan shook the world with their nuclear
tests. Elsewhere, from Indonesia to Japan, governments are
struggling to fend off ever worse financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this, China seems to some to be an island of stability,
perhaps a new economic leader in the region, worthy of a seat at
the G7's top financial table.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing much world-shaping, or even Asia-shaping, will
result from Clinton's trip to China. Not least because China is not
up to it.
</P>
<P>
   China is certainly a growing power to be reckoned with in Asia,
and Clinton's visit is an acknowledgment of that. Yet it would be
dangerous to confuse China's sheer size or even its past military
strong-arm tactics _ grabbing reefs in the South China Sea, lobbing
missiles into the sea lanes near Taiwan _ with real influence over
Asia's current problems.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense for Clinton to engage China where possible: there
are plenty of issues, from weapons proliferation to trade or
environmental problems, that can usefully be discussed at this
summit.
</P>
<P>
   But talk of strategic partnership misrepresents China's attitude
to its role in the world. In many respects, it has yet to decide
whether it will go on being part of the problem or work with others
to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   That said, China is changing rapidly. Most ordinary Chinese are
freer now than at any time since Mao launched his communist
revolution _ though admittedly that is not saying much.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party, nominally in charge of China's economic
reforms, is itself straining to keep pace with the social and
political changes the reforms have brought about.
</P>
<P>
   More and more Chinese can now buy their own apartments, run
their own businesses and, in a few instances (and despite an
overall human-rights record that remains poor), defend themselves
against overweening officials through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet China is still a hugely fragile place, with wrenching
economic changes ahead. If it seems more stable today than
Indonesia or South Korea, that is because it has yet to push
through the tough reforms _ to its debt-ridden banks and moribund
state enterprises _ that are needed to ensure continuing rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
   As these reforms bite, unemployment, already rising, will get
worse. As social tensions and regional rivalries intensify, the
government may yet lose its nerve and crack down hard, as it did in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just China's internal strains that prevent it
playing partner to America, or indeed anyone else, in Asia. China
is still a revisionist power, unhappy with the territorial status
quo, and often reluctant to accept international rules that in its
years of Mao-led seclusion it did not help to write.
</P>
<P>
   For example, China still considers Taiwan a mere renegade
province. Its missile firings and military maneuvers near the
island two years ago were a brutal attempt to intimidate voters
before Taiwan's first fully free presidential election. It backed
off only when America sent two aircraft carriers to extend a
protective arm to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone so close to the brink of conflict, rather as America
and the Soviet Union did after the Cuban missile crisis of 1962,
America and China sensibly declared a truce and set out to
stabilize their relations. But their differences run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, China has recently been mending fences in Southeast
Asia, where its earlier reef grabs had caused widespread alarm. Yet
it has not given up its claim to vast tracts of ocean there _ and
the resources that are presumed to lie under them.
</P>
<P>
   China did make a welcome, if modest, contribution to the rescue
packages put together by the IMF to help cope with the first bout
of financial turbulence in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It has since made much of its refusal to devalue the yuan (which
might set off another damaging round of currency instability in the
region, harming China too), contrasting its ``restraint'' with
Japan's delay in boosting its economy to take some of the strain
off its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, arguably, China's earlier devaluation contributed to last
year's problems for the region's smaller economies. For all its
foot-dragging over domestic reform, Japan has done, and will be
doing in future, far more than China ever could to keep its
troubled neighbors afloat.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that China and America cannot do business together,
just that the nature of the business they can usefully do is still
limited. China wants to join the World Trade Organization, so as to
defend itself against protectionist measures taken by others, yet
is unwilling so far to drop enough of its own restrictions on
foreign business activity in China.
</P>
<P>
   Getting China into the WTO is a worthwhile goal, but, as America
and others point out, only on sensible terms.
</P>
<P>
   China wants respect as a great power, yet has been slow to take
on the responsibilities that go with the rank. Through its contacts
with North Korea, it has helped to stabilize the Korean peninsula
(having earlier opposed sanctions on North Korea for breaking the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty).
</P>
<P>
   China itself signed the NPT only in 1992. More recently, it
tightened regulations on the sale of nuclear technology abroad. Yet
Chinese firms do not always obey these rules. And anyway much
damage to the non-proliferation cause had by then been done, some
of it by helping Pakistan's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, China has
cooperated diplomatically with America and others in calling for a
cap on the arms race that is now likely to follow. Yet China is
loth to take the initiative in building confidence by being more
open about its own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it continues to provide missile technology to unstable
parts of the world, including the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   So, for all the talk of partnership, there is much that divides
America from China, and indeed China from most of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Occasions like this week's summit offer a good chance to talk
over such differences _ not least because for many years yet a
rising China will have a greater capacity to do harm in Asia,
rather than good. But do not expect miracles. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a summit that brings together the leader of the world's most
powerful country and the head of the world's biggest emerging power
be anything less than a world-shaping event?
</P>
<P>
   After China's president, Jiang Zemin, visited America last
October, the two sides talked of building a new ``strategic
partnership.'' The backdrop to Bill Clinton's return visit to China
this week would seem to underscore the need for something to
restore stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Last month India and Pakistan shook the world with their nuclear
tests. Elsewhere, from Indonesia to Japan, governments are
struggling to fend off ever worse financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this, China seems to some to be an island of stability,
perhaps a new economic leader in the region, worthy of a seat at
the G7's top financial table.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing much world-shaping, or even Asia-shaping, will
result from Clinton's trip to China. Not least because China is not
up to it.
</P>
<P>
   China is certainly a growing power to be reckoned with in Asia,
and Clinton's visit is an acknowledgment of that. Yet it would be
dangerous to confuse China's sheer size or even its past military
strong-arm tactics _ grabbing reefs in the South China Sea, lobbing
missiles into the sea lanes near Taiwan _ with real influence over
Asia's current problems.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense for Clinton to engage China where possible: there
are plenty of issues, from weapons proliferation to trade or
environmental problems, that can usefully be discussed at this
summit.
</P>
<P>
   But talk of strategic partnership misrepresents China's attitude
to its role in the world. In many respects, it has yet to decide
whether it will go on being part of the problem or work with others
to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   That said, China is changing rapidly. Most ordinary Chinese are
freer now than at any time since Mao launched his communist
revolution _ though admittedly that is not saying much.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party, nominally in charge of China's economic
reforms, is itself straining to keep pace with the social and
political changes the reforms have brought about.
</P>
<P>
   More and more Chinese can now buy their own apartments, run
their own businesses and, in a few instances (and despite an
overall human-rights record that remains poor), defend themselves
against overweening officials through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet China is still a hugely fragile place, with wrenching
economic changes ahead. If it seems more stable today than
Indonesia or South Korea, that is because it has yet to push
through the tough reforms _ to its debt-ridden banks and moribund
state enterprises _ that are needed to ensure continuing rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
   As these reforms bite, unemployment, already rising, will get
worse. As social tensions and regional rivalries intensify, the
government may yet lose its nerve and crack down hard, as it did in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just China's internal strains that prevent it
playing partner to America, or indeed anyone else, in Asia. China
is still a revisionist power, unhappy with the territorial status
quo, and often reluctant to accept international rules that in its
years of Mao-led seclusion it did not help to write.
</P>
<P>
   For example, China still considers Taiwan a mere renegade
province. Its missile firings and military maneuvers near the
island two years ago were a brutal attempt to intimidate voters
before Taiwan's first fully free presidential election. It backed
off only when America sent two aircraft carriers to extend a
protective arm to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone so close to the brink of conflict, rather as America
and the Soviet Union did after the Cuban missile crisis of 1962,
America and China sensibly declared a truce and set out to
stabilize their relations. But their differences run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, China has recently been mending fences in Southeast
Asia, where its earlier reef grabs had caused widespread alarm. Yet
it has not given up its claim to vast tracts of ocean there _ and
the resources that are presumed to lie under them.
</P>
<P>
   China did make a welcome, if modest, contribution to the rescue
packages put together by the IMF to help cope with the first bout
of financial turbulence in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It has since made much of its refusal to devalue the yuan (which
might set off another damaging round of currency instability in the
region, harming China too), contrasting its ``restraint'' with
Japan's delay in boosting its economy to take some of the strain
off its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, arguably, China's earlier devaluation contributed to last
year's problems for the region's smaller economies. For all its
foot-dragging over domestic reform, Japan has done, and will be
doing in future, far more than China ever could to keep its
troubled neighbors afloat.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that China and America cannot do business together,
just that the nature of the business they can usefully do is still
limited. China wants to join the World Trade Organization, so as to
defend itself against protectionist measures taken by others, yet
is unwilling so far to drop enough of its own restrictions on
foreign business activity in China.
</P>
<P>
   Getting China into the WTO is a worthwhile goal, but, as America
and others point out, only on sensible terms.
</P>
<P>
   China wants respect as a great power, yet has been slow to take
on the responsibilities that go with the rank. Through its contacts
with North Korea, it has helped to stabilize the Korean peninsula
(having earlier opposed sanctions on North Korea for breaking the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty).
</P>
<P>
   China itself signed the NPT only in 1992. More recently, it
tightened regulations on the sale of nuclear technology abroad. Yet
Chinese firms do not always obey these rules. And anyway much
damage to the non-proliferation cause had by then been done, some
of it by helping Pakistan's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, China has
cooperated diplomatically with America and others in calling for a
cap on the arms race that is now likely to follow. Yet China is
loth to take the initiative in building confidence by being more
open about its own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it continues to provide missile technology to unstable
parts of the world, including the Middle East.

America from China, and indeed China from most of its neighbors.

   BORDELONVILLE, LA. _ In the rain-thirsty cotton fields of
central Louisiana, a series of green plastic cones, hoisted on
poles, stand among this season's newly planted shoots.
</P>
<P>
   They are traps, marking the sites where state officials check
the progress of their latest pest-control program: a chemical
massacre of the boll weevil.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the traps will also mark the end of an era:
the final defeat of the mightiest insect around.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to destruction, nothing compares to the weevil,
which hopped from Mexico to Texas in 1892, and into Louisiana soon
after that. With its protruding snout and stunted wings, the boll
weevil looks part beetle, part aardvark, and has no natural enemies
in the American South.
</P>
<P>
   As it worked its way slowly across the region, ravaging cotton
fields and ruining cotton farmers, it radically changed the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It brought a diversification of crops, helped the study of
pesticides, and speeded the northward migration of black farm
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, though hurt, survived: it is still one of Louisiana's
chief agricultural products, second in value only to timber. But
many farmers long ago converted their fields to safer, less
lucrative crops, such as soybeans and corn.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks to the weevil, the 5,000 state farmers who still
produce cotton must drench their fields with chemicals up to 20
times each year.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the federal government has studied the boll weevil,
hoping to destroy it. In the late 1970s, researchers unveiled a
five-year program that actually seems to work.
</P>
<P>
   It has the ambitious title of Boll Weevil Eradication. Its
weapon is a chemical called malathion, which must be sprayed on
every cotton plant, on every cotton field, in a given cotton
region.
</P>
<P>
   Every farmer in the region must agree to take part and to share
the cost, about $150 per acre. That price has been the program's
chief stumbling block, in Louisiana and elsewhere, says Frank
Carter, head of pest management at the National Cotton Council.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, though, other states have done it _ nine in all,
most in the Southeast. The first few got help from the federal
government, Carter explains. But then the federal money ran out.
</P>
<P>
   When Louisiana's farm leaders tried to start a statewide program
a few years ago, only the wealthiest farmers, from the western and
central parts of the state, joined in.
</P>
<P>
   Their program, now in its second year, covers 10 percent of the
state's cotton crop, and blends old-fashioned crop-dusting with
space-age technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, satellites tracked the crop-dusting aircraft,
ensuring that the malathion was evenly spread. This spring,
scanning machines recorded the number of weevils in traps, to
decide where more spraying will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the results are astounding: the traps show no weevils
in places where before there would have been hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   But there are lots of cotton farmers in the northeast of
Louisiana. If they do not destroy the bug, they soon will not be
able to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Weevil-free states can now produce cotton more easily and
cheaply: from 1987 to 1995, Georgia's cotton production grew from
250,000 to 1.5 million acres. And the neighboring states depend on
Louisiana's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Boll weevils easily cross state lines, so Arkansas and northern
Mississippi cannot have eradication programs until Louisiana's is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, state officials sought a way to subsidize the
program. Their idea was to cut the cost to farmers in half by
financing boll-weevil destruction with gambling money.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-boll-weevil operation was put into a bill to set up
slot machines at some horse-racing tracks. The backlash against
gambling's expansion killed that measure, but it stood a chance: in
Louisiana, Bible country is also cotton country, and many righteous
lawmakers were willing to put their convictions aside for the
farmers' sake.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the boll-weevil money was found from other bills. If
farmers approve the plan, eradication will start next autumn. And,
in a few years, the once-potent bug will be reduced to a curiosity,
a piece of state history, folklore and song.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana's Senate ended its session this year by playing a
boll-weevil song by Fats Domino, a native of Louisiana. The
senators danced and bounced around, some rejoicing in a victory
over gambling, some bidding adieu to the insect invaders. Either
way, it was a jubilant goodbye. &QL;

<P>
   There are few things that Californians like to boast about more
than their state's diversity: you can hear more than 70 languages
spoken in California's schools; you can see more than 600 religions
practiced in its churches and temples; and you find such exotic
mixtures as spaghetti and curry or pizza and sushi served in its
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to choosing candidates for the state's
governorship, on June 2, Californians seem to have shown about as
much appetite for diversity as the people of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lungren, the Republican candidate, and Gray Davis, his
Democratic rival, are the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   They are both lawyers-turned-politicians, both in their 50s and
both Roman Catholics. They were both touched deeply by the war in
Vietnam _ Lungren as an armchair hawk and Davis as a decorated
officer.
</P>
<P>
   They are both hard-liners on such emotive issues as
flag-burning, the three-strikes law and the death penalty. They
have both had plenty of experience as legislators and executives.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Lungren is California's attorney-general, which
makes him both its chief policeman and its chief lawyer. Davis, on
the other hand, is currently the state's lieutenant-governor, which
is rather like being a neutered version of the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   All of which ought to be good news for the Republicans, who have
held the governorship for the past 16 years. The economy is as
successful as it has been in a generation, with the state's gross
annual product passing the trillion-dollar mark and its treasury
brimming with a $4 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Serious crime has fallen by a third on Lungren's watch. Add to
this the fact that Lungren was all but unopposed for his party's
nomination, whereas Davis had to slog it out with two free-spending
rivals, and you have a strong case for sticking with Tweedledum
rather than risking Tweedledee.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Lungren is far from being a shoo-in for the
governorship. The Democrats have long had more registered voters
than the Republicans (currently 47 percent of the electorate
compared with 35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In the past four elections they have squandered this advantage
by choosing candidates who were either too exotic or too
inexperienced to win over the suburbs; but Davis's very
Tweedledeeness could play well there.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are also much exercised by their poor showing
among Latinos, who now make up 12 percent of the state's voters, up
from 7 percent six years ago. This is indeed dismal: Bob Dole
managed to get a mere 6 percent of the Latino vote, compared with
Ronald Reagan's 45 percent in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger problem for Lungren will be his ability to
sell his hard-edged brand of conservatism to the broad middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   California is a relatively moderate state, free from the
strident moralizing that flourishes in the South. (Bureaucratic
moralizing is another matter: witness the state's absurd ban on
smoking in bars.)
</P>
<P>
   Reagan combined his enthusiasm for the free market with a
laissez-faire attitude to personal morality. Pete Wilson, the
current governor, is one of the Republican Party's leading
advocates of abortion choice.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Riordan, the popular Republican (and Catholic) mayor of
normally Democratic Los Angeles, has preserved an impeccably
liberal stance on what Californians like to call ``lifestyle
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lungren is an altogether more ideological figure, a close
ally of Newt Gingrich, a leading author of the ``Contract with
America,'' a supporter of school vouchers and an outspoken opponent
of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He spent three years, and much soul-searching, before deciding
to join 37 other states in suing the tobacco companies. He has
repeatedly been accused of blunting the impact of the state's ban
on assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Davis thus has plenty of material for portraying his rival as a
Newt Gingrich in Tweedledum's clothing. On the abortion issue in
particular, he will be able both to unite his own fissiparous party
and drive a wedge between fiscal and social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has done much to soften his image in recent months,
particularly among Latinos. He won 17 percent of the Latino vote in
the primary, and has taken to advertising on Spanish-language
television _ a first for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed the proposition that killed bilingual education,
joined the Democrat-driven suit against Microsoft and now
emphasizes that, as governor, he will be able to do little about
abortion. He has done as much to distance himself from Wilson as he
can without risking a public rift.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances are still high that the Democrats will be able
to demonize Lungren in the run-up to November, not least because,
in his heart of hearts, he is a conviction politician.
</P>
<P>
   This could well be bad news for California. For all his social
conservatism, Lungren is an advocate of a lot of things _ notably
school vouchers _ that could help to galvanize California's
moribund public sector, whereas Davis is little more than a
cat's-paw of the trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the presence of a Republican governor has acted as a
valuable check on the ambitions of the Democratic legislature. The
state's Chamber of Commerce calculates that dozens of
``job-destroying'' bills have never got past the mere threat of
Wilson's veto.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's defeat, should it come to that, will be even more of a
blow to the Republican Party, both locally and nationally. The next
governor will play a leading role in redrawing the boundaries of
California's 50-plus congressional seats, a process that could
decide the balance of power in Washington for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   And Lungren is the most impressive Republican the state has
produced since Reagan: a man with deep roots in the party (his
father was Richard Nixon's campaign physician) but with a nice
populist touch (his performances as the lead singer in his rock
band, Elvis and the Lawmen, are reported to be impressive).
</P>
<P>
   If he cannot sell today's brand of radical Republicanism to the
country's largest state, then nobody can. &QL;

<P>
   There are few things that Californians like to boast about more
than their state's diversity: you can hear more than 70 languages
spoken in California's schools; you can see more than 600 religions
practiced in its churches and temples; and you find such exotic
mixtures as spaghetti and curry or pizza and sushi served in its
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to choosing candidates for the state's
governorship, on June 2, Californians seem to have shown about as
much appetite for diversity as the people of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lungren, the Republican candidate, and Gray Davis, his
Democratic rival, are the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   They are both lawyers-turned-politicians, both in their 50s and
both Roman Catholics. They were both touched deeply by the war in
Vietnam _ Lungren as an armchair hawk and Davis as a decorated
officer.
</P>
<P>
   They are both hard-liners on such emotive issues as
flag-burning, the three-strikes law and the death penalty. They
have both had plenty of experience as legislators and executives.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Lungren is California's attorney-general, which
makes him both its chief policeman and its chief lawyer. Davis, on
the other hand, is currently the state's lieutenant-governor, which
is rather like being a neutered version of the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   All of which ought to be good news for the Republicans, who have
held the governorship for the past 16 years. The economy is as
successful as it has been in a generation, with the state's gross
annual product passing the trillion-dollar mark and its treasury
brimming with a $4 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Serious crime has fallen by a third on Lungren's watch. Add to
this the fact that Lungren was all but unopposed for his party's
nomination, whereas Davis had to slog it out with two free-spending
rivals, and you have a strong case for sticking with Tweedledum
rather than risking Tweedledee.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Lungren is far from being a shoo-in for the
governorship. The Democrats have long had more registered voters
than the Republicans (currently 47 percent of the electorate
compared with 35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In the past four elections they have squandered this advantage

<P>
   SEATTLE _ America's drug problems are not all on its southern
border. In the past two years the amount of marijuana coming into
the United States from Canada, calculated from the amount captured
by customs and drug agents, has more than quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 United States customs agents in Blaine, Wash. _ a
popular smugglers' crossing point _ had ten marijuana-related
cases. In the current year (which for customs agents began in
October), 79 cases have been reported, according to Brian Rockom,
an agent in Blaine.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: British Columbian pot has become the
champagne of cannabis.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff that makes pot appealing is a chemical known as THC _
short for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Most American baby-boomers,
in their misspent youth, smoked pot with a THC content of maybe 2
percent. Later, Hawaiian grass labeled ``Maui Wowie'' offered an
impressive 10 percent or 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, British Columbia-based growers, using carefully bred seeds
and sophisticated indoor hydroponic gardens, sometimes produce
marijuana with a mind-blowing THC content of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are willing to pay hefty amounts for this wonder weed:
as much as $6,000-7,000 a pound ($2,700-3,200 a kilo) by the time
the stuff wends its way down from British Columbia to Los Angeles,
or ten times as much as they will pay for the average pound of
Mexican marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Why British Columbia? History and politics, says Marc Emery, a
loquacious Vancouver-based hemp entrepreneur who is the publisher
of Cannabis Canada magazine.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, he says, Vancouver's San Francisco-like style
drew droves of Vietnam draft-resisters, many of whom brought with
them packets of marijuana seeds. In time they adapted those seeds
for fast growth in the province's relatively chilly climate, and
for potency.
</P>
<P>
   As word got out about Canadian marijuana, and as the profits
grew, what had been a hobby became an increasingly lucrative
business. It remains an easy business to get into, says Emery.
</P>
<P>
   Pot is easy to grow _ ``all it takes is some seed and cow dung''
_ and it is largely tolerated, if not exactly legal, in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Emery estimates that 10 percent of British Columbia's 3.5
million residents either smoke or grow the stuff. Big pot-growers,
when caught, often escape prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the growing intolerance of drugs puts pot
in the same league as cocaine and heroin, with 500,000 pot-related
arrests each year. That crackdown has made cannabis riskier to grow
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Hence ``BC Bud,'' the brand name for the several hundred
different strains of marijuana that grow in British Columbia and
pack a big punch.
</P>
<P>
   Emery estimates that the crop is now worth $4 billion _ a figure
which, if true, would put it close to tourism and ahead of mining
and farming in the province's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the United States and Canada put the figure rather
lower, but still at more than $2 billion. More than 3,000
commercial pot-growing operations now cultivate as many as 2,400
plants at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Working hard to nab their output is a force of United States
customs agents stationed in Blaine. But the 158 agents have 50
miles of border to patrol between the coast and the inland
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The border is unfenced, as befits two friendly countries, and
much of it is conveniently equipped for smugglers with roads on
either side. ``Sometimes,'' says Rockom, ``they just throw the
stuff across.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-smuggling operation is being expanded, but border
officials say that, at best, they catch only 10 percent of the weed
that is heading south.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many holes in the net to plug them all; and,
despite increasing Canadian efforts, there is still too little
reason not to grow the stuff. Moreover, pretty well anyone can be a
smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   In one famous case, officials arrested a 77-year-old man and a
71-year-old woman. They had 42 pounds of pot in their car. &QL;

   SEATTLE _ America's drug problems are not all on its southern
border. In the past two years the amount of marijuana coming into
the United States from Canada, calculated from the amount captured
by customs and drug agents, has more than quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 United States customs agents in Blaine, Wash. _ a
popular smugglers' crossing point _ had ten marijuana-related
cases. In the current year (which for customs agents began in
October), 79 cases have been reported, according to Brian Rockom,
an agent in Blaine.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: British Columbian pot has become the
champagne of cannabis.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff that makes pot appealing is a chemical known as THC _
short for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Most American baby-boomers,
in their misspent youth, smoked pot with a THC content of maybe 2
percent. Later, Hawaiian grass labeled ``Maui Wowie'' offered an
impressive 10 percent or 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, British Columbia-based growers, using carefully bred seeds
and sophisticated indoor hydroponic gardens, sometimes produce
marijuana with a mind-blowing THC content of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are willing to pay hefty amounts for this wonder weed:
as much as $6,000-7,000 a pound ($2,700-3,200 a kilo) by the time
the stuff wends its way down from British Columbia to Los Angeles,
or ten times as much as they will pay for the average pound of
Mexican marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Why British Columbia? History and politics, says Marc Emery, a
loquacious Vancouver-based hemp entrepreneur who is the publisher
of Cannabis Canada magazine.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, he says, Vancouver's San Francisco-like style
drew droves of Vietnam draft-resisters, many of whom brought with
them packets of marijuana seeds. In time they adapted those seeds
for fast growth in the province's relatively chilly climate, and
for potency.
</P>
<P>
   As word got out about Canadian marijuana, and as the profits
grew, what had been a hobby became an increasingly lucrative
business. It remains an easy business to get into, says Emery.
</P>
<P>
   Pot is easy to grow _ ``all it takes is some seed and cow dung''
_ and it is largely tolerated, if not exactly legal, in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Emery estimates that 10 percent of British Columbia's 3.5
million residents either smoke or grow the stuff. Big pot-growers,
when caught, often escape prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the growing intolerance of drugs puts pot
in the same league as cocaine and heroin, with 500,000 pot-related
arrests each year. That crackdown has made cannabis riskier to grow
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Hence ``BC Bud,'' the brand name for the several hundred
different strains of marijuana that grow in British Columbia and
pack a big punch.
</P>
<P>
   Emery estimates that the crop is now worth $4 billion _ a figure
which, if true, would put it close to tourism and ahead of mining
and farming in the province's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the United States and Canada put the figure rather
lower, but still at more than $2 billion. More than 3,000
commercial pot-growing operations now cultivate as many as 2,400
plants at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Working hard to nab their output is a force of United States
customs agents stationed in Blaine. But the 158 agents have 50
miles of border to patrol between the coast and the inland
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The border is unfenced, as befits two friendly countries, and
much of it is conveniently equipped for smugglers with roads on
either side. ``Sometimes,'' says Rockom, ``they just throw the
stuff across.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-smuggling operation is being expanded, but border
officials say that, at best, they catch only 10 percent of the weed
that is heading south.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many holes in the net to plug them all; and,
despite increasing Canadian efforts, there is still too little
reason not to grow the stuff. Moreover, pretty well anyone can be a
smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   In one famous case, officials arrested a 77-year-old man and a
71-year-old woman. They had 42 pounds of pot in their car. &QL;

   Adobo:
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Steaks:
</P>
<P>
   4 bottom round steaks (about 6 to 8 ounces each) cut 1/2-inch
thick (no thicker, or the steaks will be tough)
</P>
<P>
   2 large onions, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the adobo. Combine first 4 ingredients in mortar and
grind to a paste with the pestle. Work in lime juice and oil to
form a smooth paste. Alternatively, place all ingredients in a
blender and process to a smooth puree. Correct seasoning, adding
salt and pepper as necessary; the mixture should be highly
seasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat grill to high.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to cook, oil the grill grate. Brush onion slices with
the oil and arrange on hot grate. Brush the steaks with the adobo
mixture and place on hot grate with the onion. Grill steaks to
taste, 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare, basting with adobo
and rotating 90 degrees after 1 minute to create an attractive
crosshatch of grill marks. Always use tongs when moving or turning
the steak. Grill onions until nicely charred, 3 to 4 minutes per
side, seasoning with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer steak to plates or a platter and brush one final time
with the adobo. Let stand for 3 minutes, then serve with the
grilled onion on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Note: To give the steaks a richer garlic, cumin and lime flavor,
marinate them in the adobo in a nonreactive baking dish for 10
minutes before grilling.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is Michael J. Fox worth $10,000, while Tommy Lee Jones is
worth only $3,500? Kathie Lee Gifford goes for $7,500, three times
the rate for Zsa Zsa Gabor. Meanwhile, Bill Gates is available for
$1 million, which is pocket change if one happens to have access to
Gates' pockets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By those standards, Peter Lewis, measured in the amount of money
it would cost to own peterlewis.com, is a bargain at $850. Still,
that puts me in the same price range as Janet Reno, Barbara Bush,
Billy Graham, Chelsea Clinton, George Brett and Marlon Brando. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, nearly every conceivable celebrity name has
been registered in the commercial (.com) top-level Internet domain,
including those of business leaders, sports stars, politicians and
other luminaries. But the people and companies registering these
names are not the stars or politicians themselves, but others
hoping to turn a quick dollar by selling the names back to their
rightful owners _ or the highest bidders. It's called domain name
poaching, and it's a thriving business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prices are negotiable. ``I would give up VannaWhite.com for a
shot on `Wheel of Fortune,''' said Vern Barke, owner of many
celebrity names. ``I would give up WoodyAllen.com for a cameo
appearance in Woody's next movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Barke, in an e-mail message, said that as of July 1 all of his
celebrity names are redirected to sex-related sites on the Web.
``Sex sells,'' he noted. Now these celebrities know how Bill
Clinton feels; his name was until recently used to sell sex toys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Friend to Friend Foundation, a Christian ministries service
in Kansas that registered peterlewis.com, is outraged that this is
happening. It just sent me a 15-page letter decrying the horrible
situation, noting four major causes for concern.
</P>
<P>
   First, unscrupulous entrepreneurs are using the names of
well-known people as access points to pornography. Second, these
poachers are seeking to sell celebrity names to the highest bidder.
Third, some of the names are being offered to the public for use as
e-mail addresses or access points for astrology or dating services.
And fourth, the letter said, some names, like Brad Pitt's, are
being sold to Arabs, who, for some reason, the foundation sees fit
to group with pornographers and astrologers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, the foundation has been holding my name and several hundred
others including Steve Wozniak, Ray Bradbury, Peter Drucker, Anita
Bryant, Arthur Treacher and even Manhattannewyorkcity _ and by
doing so has kept them from falling into the hands of dating
services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Friend to Friend Foundation wrote that I can show my
gratitude and claim peterlewis.com for a minimum donation of $850,
as long as I promise not to display pornography on my Web site. The
foundation will keep $350, and $500 will go to one of 11 charities
it supports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I had already found a domain of my own, lewis.cx, on
remote Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. A peek into the zone
file of the London-based computer that serves as host for the
Christmas Island domain revealed that I had only 18 virtual
neighbors. Two companies _ the Intel Corp. and Federal Express _
together owned at least half of the virtual real estate on the
island's domain roster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Intel had already staked out Christmas Island addresses for
celeron.cx, intel.cx, intel-inside.cx, intercast.cx, mmx.cx,
pentium.cx and proshare.cx, basically carpet-bombing the tiny
island with subdomains. Federal Express had already registered
fdxcorp.cx, federalexpress.cx, fedex.cx and _ could it be? _
ups.cx. Perhaps they made a typo and meant to type ``oops.cx.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   None of this answers why michaeljfox.com is worth $10,000, of
course, or why ladydiana.com is reportedly being offered for
$250,000. Except, perhaps, that michaeljfox.net and michaeljfox.org
are both still available, whereas princessdiana.com is owned by
someone in Oregon, princessdiana.net by someone in California, and
princessdiana.org by someone in Haifa, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Princessdi.net and princessdi.org reside in Pennsylvania.
Someone in Jerusalem owns dianaprincessofwales.com, a New Yorker
has dianaprincessofwales.org, and dianaprincessofwales.net belongs
to someone with the e-mail address MakeOffer(AT)DomainClub.com.

<P>
   WASHINGTON AND BEIJING _ The American president who once accused
his predecessor of ``kowtowing'' to China himself departed to the
Middle Kingdom on June 24, taking with him five cabinet members,
six congressmen, 200 journalists, 500 staff, ten limousines, the
First Lady and his daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton will be assured of a warm reception from President
Jiang Zemin, who looks back fondly on his own visit to the United
States last autumn. Yet back in Washington, Clinton leaves a storm.
</P>
<P>
   This visit, the first by an American president since the
massacre around Tiananmen Square nine years ago, has attracted
controversy. Opposition comes on one side from a hawkish Republican
right, and on the other from leftish Democrats concerned about
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition view, Henry Kissinger wrote recently in Newsweek,
``is more compatible with confrontation than with stabilizing, much
less improving, the relationship with the world's most populous
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition makes for good politics back home at the moment. A
small band of right-wingers has long sought to demonize China as a
Stalinist, brutal, internationally destabilizing regime in the
mould of the old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   They have even found a sympathetic audience among moderate
Republican congressmen. Midterm elections take place in November,
and attacking Clinton over China is a good way for Republicans to
try to keep their shaky hold over the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton is attacked for allowing waivers for two
American companies, Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes
Electronics, to launch their satellites on China's Long March
rockets _ never mind that similar waivers were issued during George
Bush's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And, since Pakistan last month conducted nuclear tests in
response to India's, the administration has come in for attack for
not doing enough to stop China from exporting missile and nuclear
technology to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wingers find common ground with the left on China's
human-rights record. Babies, Americans have heard, are ripped
callously out of wombs in pursuit of China's one-child policy.
Hollywood's radical chic promote a picture of a Tibet bloodily
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights groups see the recent dispatch of two of China's
best-known dissidents, Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, to America on
``medical parole'' as cynical exercises in public relations. The
freedom to worship is restricted.
</P>
<P>
   All these charges are true, up to a point. But they take into
account neither the ways in which China is changing for the better,
albeit rather messily, nor the ways in which America might be able
to nudge such change along.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier, instead, to demonize President Clinton for
agreeing to be welcomed by Jiang in the Great Hall of the People,
next to Tiananmen Square _ that ``infamous killing field,'' as one
congressman puts it.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has thrown the administration on the defensive.
The release of Wei and Wang, says one of Clinton's officials,
``doesn't check the box and get (China) off the hook on
human-rights issues.'' This is where China remains on ``the wrong
side of history,'' says Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's economic troubles, he argues, might have real
consequences for America's Main Street if China were not open,
stable and secure. And that requires American engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have common geographical concerns: for instance, the
future of Taiwan, stability in the Korean peninsula and calm
between India and Pakistan, as well as a desire to combat
international crime and tackle China's overwhelming environmental
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American views of Clinton's trip, which includes a visit to
Hong Kong, are likely to change as the notoriously insensate White
House press pack sniffs a new direction _ the warm reception the
president will get from ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The pack will learn that few Chinese, not even former Tiananmen
protesters, are dismayed at Clinton's attendance at the square. Nor
will they miss the significance if the president is allowed to
speak live on Chinese television about human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Chinese do not need a strong attachment to American
notions of democracy to appreciate that Clinton's visit is, in a
way, a confirmation of what (for at least the fourth time this
century) is called the New China.
</P>
<P>
   It might better be called the ``blue'' China: coastal,
outward-looking, cosmopolitan, tolerant and increasingly
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the old, ``brown'' China still exists, embodied in
much of the Communist Party: inward-looking, suspicious of markets,
authoritarian or corrupt, and generally dirt-poor.
</P>
<P>
   Dispassionate observers must pick among both to get a clear
picture, but there is no doubt that blue China is nowadays in the
ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, China's top leaders, for the moment, are blues.
They are committed to binding China by the rules of the
international economy. They have made progress checking the
proliferation of weapons technology, of which China, up until at
least 1992, was a notorious exporter. They have acted with
sophistication and restraint throughout Asia's financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Jiang said China would sign the United Nations
covenant on civil and political rights this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   All this serves China's interests well: few nations are better
practiced in realpolitik. Yet China's leaders long for
respectability on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   The ``constructive strategic partnership'' that both sides tout
may well contain a lot of hot air. Substantive agreements from
Clinton's trip may be few. But to have refused to go to Beijing
would have put President Clinton firmly on the wrong side of
history. &QL;

his predecessor of ``kowtowing'' to China himself departed to the
Middle Kingdom on June 24, taking with him five cabinet members,
six congressmen, 200 journalists, 500 staff, ten limousines, the
First Lady and his daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton will be assured of a warm reception from President
Jiang Zemin, who looks back fondly on his own visit to the United
States last autumn. Yet back in Washington, Clinton leaves a storm.
</P>
<P>
   This visit, the first by an American president since the
massacre around Tiananmen Square nine years ago, has attracted
controversy. Opposition comes on one side from a hawkish Republican
right, and on the other from leftish Democrats concerned about
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition view, Henry Kissinger wrote recently in Newsweek,
``is more compatible with confrontation than with stabilizing, much
less improving, the relationship with the world's most populous
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition makes for good politics back home at the moment. A
small band of right-wingers has long sought to demonize China as a
Stalinist, brutal, internationally destabilizing regime in the
mould of the old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   They have even found a sympathetic audience among moderate
Republican congressmen. Midterm elections take place in November,
and attacking Clinton over China is a good way for Republicans to
try to keep their shaky hold over the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton is attacked for allowing waivers for two
American companies, Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes
Electronics, to launch their satellites on China's Long March
rockets _ never mind that similar waivers were issued during George
Bush's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And, since Pakistan last month conducted nuclear tests in
response to India's, the administration has come in for attack for
not doing enough to stop China from exporting missile and nuclear
technology to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wingers find common ground with the left on China's
human-rights record. Babies, Americans have heard, are ripped
callously out of wombs in pursuit of China's one-child policy.
Hollywood's radical chic promote a picture of a Tibet bloodily
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights groups see the recent dispatch of two of China's
best-known dissidents, Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, to America on
``medical parole'' as cynical exercises in public relations. The
freedom to worship is restricted.
</P>
<P>
   All these charges are true, up to a point. But they take into
account neither the ways in which China is changing for the better,
albeit rather messily, nor the ways in which America might be able
to nudge such change along.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier, instead, to demonize President Clinton for
agreeing to be welcomed by Jiang in the Great Hall of the People,
next to Tiananmen Square _ that ``infamous killing field,'' as one
congressman puts it.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has thrown the administration on the defensive.
The release of Wei and Wang, says one of Clinton's officials,
``doesn't check the box and get (China) off the hook on
human-rights issues.'' This is where China remains on ``the wrong
side of history,'' says Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's economic troubles, he argues, might have real
consequences for America's Main Street if China were not open,
stable and secure. And that requires American engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have common geographical concerns: for instance, the
future of Taiwan, stability in the Korean peninsula and calm
between India and Pakistan, as well as a desire to combat
international crime and tackle China's overwhelming environmental
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American views of Clinton's trip, which includes a visit to
Hong Kong, are likely to change as the notoriously insensate White
House press pack sniffs a new direction _ the warm reception the
president will get from ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The pack will learn that few Chinese, not even former Tiananmen
protesters, are dismayed at Clinton's attendance at the square. Nor
will they miss the significance if the president is allowed to
speak live on Chinese television about human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Chinese do not need a strong attachment to American
notions of democracy to appreciate that Clinton's visit is, in a
way, a confirmation of what (for at least the fourth time this
century) is called the New China.
</P>
<P>
   It might better be called the ``blue'' China: coastal,
outward-looking, cosmopolitan, tolerant and increasingly
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the old, ``brown'' China still exists, embodied in
much of the Communist Party: inward-looking, suspicious of markets,
authoritarian or corrupt, and generally dirt-poor.
</P>
<P>
   Dispassionate observers must pick among both to get a clear
picture, but there is no doubt that blue China is nowadays in the
ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, China's top leaders, for the moment, are blues.
They are committed to binding China by the rules of the
international economy. They have made progress checking the
proliferation of weapons technology, of which China, up until at
least 1992, was a notorious exporter. They have acted with
sophistication and restraint throughout Asia's financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Jiang said China would sign the United Nations
covenant on civil and political rights this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   All this serves China's interests well: few nations are better
practiced in realpolitik. Yet China's leaders long for
respectability on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   The ``constructive strategic partnership'' that both sides tout
may well contain a lot of hot air. Substantive agreements from
Clinton's trip may be few. But to have refused to go to Beijing
would have put President Clinton firmly on the wrong side of
history. &QL;

THE DEFINITIVE `BARBECUE BIBLE' EXPLORES OUR FASCINATION WITH
SEARED MEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was fire, and it was good. It was so
good that it spread throughout the world where nations and peoples
gathered and ate.
</P>
<P>
   It was 125,000 years ago that our forebears brought the magic of
the flame to cooking, most likely through a happy accident. Perhaps
a hapless woolly mammoth who stumbled into a campfire, emerging as
a glorious rack of juicy ribs, pointed the way and lit the pilot
that would become a Weber empire.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, that mammoth begot the tandoori of India, which
begot the kebabs of the Middle East, which begot the jerk of
Jamaica, which begot the brisket of Texas. It's all one big old
barbecue belt.
</P>
<P>
   And now it's all been put in a neat bundle in ``The Barbecue!
Bible'' by Steven Raichlen (Workman, $18.95). Raichlen, who has won
awards for his previous books, including ``Miami Spice,'' will
certainly win more for this comprehensive look at grilling around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Raichlen's book may well become the St. James version for the
international barbecue crowd, with his more than 500 recipes for
everything from madeira beef and bay leaf kebabs to grilled
eggplant with miso barbecue sauce. If you want the word on what
people grill anywhere in the world, ``The Barbecue! Bible'' is the
gospel.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   THE 10 COMMANDMENTS OF RIGHTEOUS BARBECUE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Be organized: Have everything _ food, marinade, basting
sauce, seasonings and tools _ on hand by the grill before
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gauge your fuel: When using charcoal, light enough to form a
bed of glowing coals 3 inches wider on all sides than the surface
area of the food you're planning to cook. (A 22 1/2-inch grill
needs one lighting chimney's worth of coals.) When cooking on a gas
grill, make sure the tank is at least one-third full.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat the grill to the right temperature: Remember,
grilling is a high-heat cooking method. Temperature should be at
least 500 degrees. When using charcoal, let it burn until it is
covered with a thin coat of gray ash. Hold your hand about 6 inches
above the grate. After 3 seconds, the force of the heat should
force you to snatch your hand away. When using a gas grill, preheat
to high (at least 500 degrees); this takes 10-15 minutes. When
indirect grilling, preheat grill to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   4. Keep it clean: Clean the grate twice: once after you've
preheated the grill and again when you've finished cooking. The
first cleaning will remove any bits of food you missed after your
last grilling session. Use the edge of a metal spatula to scrape
off large bits of food, a stiff wire brush to finish scrubbing the
grate.
</P>
<P>
   5. Keep it lubricated: Oil grate just before placing the food on
top. Spray it with oil (away from the flames), use a folded paper
towel soaked in oil, or rub it with a piece of fatty bacon, beef
fat or chicken skin.
</P>
<P>
   6. Turn, don't stab: The proper way to turn meat on a grill is
with tongs or a spatula. Never stab the meat with a carving fork _
unless you want to drain the flavor-rich juices onto the coals.
</P>
<P>
   7. Know when to baste: Oil-and-vinegar, citrus-, and
yogurt-based bastes and marinades can be brushed on the meat
throughout the cooking time. (If you baste with a marinade that you
used for raw meat or seafood, don't apply it during the last 3
minutes of cooking.) When using a sugar-based barbecue sauce, apply
it toward the end of cooking time. The sugar in these sauces burns
easily and shouldn't be exposed to prolonged heat.
</P>
<P>
   8. Keep it covered: When cooking large cuts of meat and poultry,
such as a whole chicken, leg of lamb or prime rib, use the indirect
method of grilling or barbecuing. Keep the grill tightly covered
and resist the temptation to peek. Every time you lift the lid, you
add 5 to 10 minutes to the cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   9. Give it a rest: Beef, steak, chicken _ almost anything you
grill _ tastes better if you let it stand on the cutting board for
a few minutes before serving. This allows the meat juices, which
have been driven to the center of a roast or steak by the searing
heat, to return to the surface. The result is a juicier, tastier
piece of meat.
</P>
<P>
   10. Never desert your post: Grilling is an easy cooking method,
but it demands constant attention. Once you put something on the
grill (especially when using the direct method), stay with it until
it's cooked. This is not the time to answer the phone, make the
salad dressing or mix up a batch of your famous margaritas.

 &HT;    CLINTON HEADING SOUTH FOR SCENIC ECO-TOUR, FLYING HOME FOR JULY
4
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    EDS: Clinton will fly from Shanghai to Guilin, arriving around
10 p.m. EDT. We expect to jump the dateline to Guilin and update
accordingly after Clinton's arrival.
 &HT;    With CHINA-HISTBOX 
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ President Clinton headed 800 miles south on Thursday
for an eco-tour of the mist-shrouded mountains and winding rivers
that many Chinese consider the most beautiful spot in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Floating in a riverboat along the Li River, the president and
his entourage were expected to celebrate China's gains toward
cleaning up the fouled waters of one of China's most poetic tourist
spots.
</P>
<P>
   With American TV cameras rolling, Clinton was due to discuss
global warming with Chinese environmental specialists, then board
the boat to visit carefully chosen villagers along the river route
that has inspired legions of Chinese poets.
</P>
<P>
   If image-conscious Chinese authorities have their way, Clinton
will press the flesh with peasant optimists _ people like Gao
Quanghong, 50, who told the official Chinese news agency Xinhua 10
days ago: ``With the river getting cleaner, many fish are coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Chinese and Clinton, who has openly criticized human
rights conditions in his host country, were determined to close out
his trip without generating new controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The White House confirmed that the guest list for Clinton's
meeting in Guilin with prominent Chinese environmental specialists
will not include the author Dai Qing, the country's best-known
environmental critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get everyone into this (meeting), but certainly we
are in contact with her,'' White House deputy national security
adviser James Steinberg told a briefing for the traveling White
House press.
</P>
<P>
   Dai, a longtime critic of the government plans to build the
Three Gorges Dam, was jailed for some months for her environmental
writings after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. When finished
in 2003, the Three Gorges project along the Yangtze River will be
the most powerful hydroelectric dam in the world. But the dam will
result in 66,700 acres of farmland being covered with water, and
almost 1.9 million people will be displaced.
</P>
<P>
   If the Li River boat trip goes off as scripted, Clinton will
hear how scores of polluting factories sprang up along the
riverside during and after Mao Tse-tung's 1958 ``Great Leap
Forward'' campaign to spread industrialization across the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But since Mao's death in 1976, provincial ``reform'' communist
leaders have closed 49 of the worst water polluters along the Li.
They have also built sewage plants that already treat 40 percent of
Guilin's waste water, according to an official Chinese tally.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's theme for his eight day in China was that ``the
Chinese must be a part of any solution to global environmental
problems,'' as briefer Steinberg put it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to expand on an idea he first enunciated in
his Monday speech at Beijing University: ``In the near future, if
present energy use patterns persist, China will overtake the United
States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases which are
the principal causes of global warming.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his daytrip to Guilin, Clinton was scheduled to wind
up his China visit in Hong Kong on Friday. On Friday night, he is
due to board Air Force One for the trans-Pacific flight that will
bring him to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington in time to
watch the dawning of the American Fourth of July on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign that the White House staff is already thinking forward
to American controversies, Press Secretary Mike McCurry allowed
himself the first riposte on Chinese soil about the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   When a correspondent asked at a briefing about Linda Tripp's
grand jury testimony, McCurry cracked: ``The president has been
concentrated on one trip, and it's China, not Linda.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry also announced an ambitious month-long round of Clinton
travel in America, taking him from the heartland to celebrityland.
It starts with a July 9 day-trip to Atlanta and Miami, then
continues with trips to Little Rock, New Orleans and Norfolk. His
last two announced trips are to Aspen, Colo., on July 25, and to
New York's Hamptons on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was taking steps to make Clinton's day in Hong
Kong Friday as bland and non-controversial as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Though the president was due to meet pro-democracy legislators
who are considered the opposition in Hong Kong, the White House
refused requests by CNN and other networks to let television
cameras record all or part of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In the most sensitive encounter, Clinton was scheduled to meet
Martin Lee, Hong Kong's leading democratic politician. Then he will
meet with a larger group of pro-democracy figures who seek to
protect the freedoms left by Britain when it handed Hong Kong back
to China one year ago after 156 years of British control.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting opposition leaders privately, without cameras ``is more
or less our standard practice,'' insisted briefer Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was among the 20 members of the Hong Kong Legislative
Council who were selected in democratic elections this spring.
Although democrats swept the elections, only one-third of the total
council members are elected. The majority are appointed by
pro-Beijing professional and social organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Shanghai, Clinton steered his way through one
more lengthy appearance on mainland Chinese television, this one a
low-key performance that was taped for airing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made several vague references to freedom and democratic
principles, but he didn't repeat last Saturday's sharp critique of
the 1989 Chinese crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole democratic process, in my view, is very,
very important to make society work when things are changing as
quickly as they are now,'' Clinton said at one point.
</P>
<P>
   When queried on America's role in the world, Clinton said that
one of his most difficult tasks is handling the nation's post-Cold
War power role ``which is temporary _ it won't last forever _ as
the only superpower in the world.''

HOW A TCU COED INVENTED A FAT-FREE FRENCH FRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a 26-year-old with a mathematics degree supposed to do?
Cook, of course.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what you do if you're Candace Vanice.
</P>
<P>
   The petite Gen Xer may still look the part of the Texas
Christian University coed that she once was (she later graduated
from the University of Kansas), but she drops words like
``co-pack'' and ``patents.''
</P>
<P>
   She began experimenting with food while she was still in
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was when everyone was becoming aware of low-fat food,''
Vanice said. ``I love french fries, so I tried to make some myself
that would be healthful. First I just sliced potatoes and baked
them on cookie sheets. Then I tried coating them in mayonnaise and
vinegar to get some flavor and some crunch. Then I remembered that
when I'd bake bread with my grandmother, she'd brush the top with
egg whites to make it brown and crusty.''
</P>
<P>
   So with some experimenting, Vanice came up with a method of
coating crinkle-cut fries with diluted egg whites and spices,
resulting in a fat-free fry (that is actually baked). But how to
take a great idea to the masses wanting a fat-free fry?
</P>
<P>
   With a patent pending on her process, Vanice approached the big
boys, Ore-Ida and Inland Valley, about her idea of mass marketing
frozen fat-free fries. The big boys weren't interested.
</P>
<P>
   By now a college graduate with a day job as a consultant with an
actuarial firm in Kansas City, Mo., Vanice was not to be deterred.
</P>
<P>
   She found little Mr. Dell Foods of Kearney, Mo., a manufacturer
of hash browns. That company agreed to produce her fries, now named
8th Wonder Fat Free Fries. And an advertising company came up with
packaging. (''I wanted something that looked new and light, not the
orange and brown that was on the packages out there,'' she said.)
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City and Des Moines, Iowa, markets for a year, 8th
Wonder Fries are now moving into five Texas markets, including Fort
Worth. Look for the fries in the frozen-potato sections of
Albertson's and Tom Thumb stores.
</P>
<P>
   And like every hip, happenin' firm today, 8th Wonder Fat Free
Fries offers information on the Web, at www.fatfreefries.com.

   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played
side by side with sons of the affluent. (slugged:

Shahin confesses, he doesn't have any tips. In fact, he doesn't
pack his bags. His wife does. This arrangement, he believes, is
quite common: Women pack the suitcases, men take pride in
methodically fitting them in the car trunk. (slugged:

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
_ can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
 &UR; SOLAR MENACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 By PAULA GANZI LICATA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone
advertisement.
 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right
not to be asked if I've been ill all summer or trapped in a dark
cave for the past few months.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REUNION ETIQUETTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.
</P>
<P>
   7. Parents shall not use intimate details of their kids' lives
as conversational fodder. Boasts of children's accomplishments are
acceptable, but parents shall be discreet in their phrasing and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Thou shalt not reveal devastating family secrets about
thyself or others unless thou hast arranged therapeutic support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   9. Thou shalt not publicly criticize the manners or behavior of
any child not thine own.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thou shalt flatter thy kinfolk _ falsely or not. All nieces
tap dance divinely, all babies are beautiful and all aunts look as
wonderful as ever.

 &HT;    CHINA FACING TRUTH OF DEVELOPMENT'S CONSEQUENCES: POLLUTION
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON .
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In just a half century, China has doubled its
population, multiplied its factories and vastly increased its
pollution. Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   1949 _ Backward Is Beautiful. When communists take over in 1949,
China is an impoverished, crowded country. Only one-tenth of the
540 million inhabitants live in towns and cities. Many waterways
are polluted with human wastes, but the air is clean. Beijing is
famous for its azure blue sky.
</P>
<P>
   Late 1953 _ Modernization. Communist leader Mao Tse-tung
launches China's first Five Year Plan, aiming to yank hina up into
the industrial age using Stalin's model. China's coal mining is
ordered to double by 1957, cement manufacturing to triple, internal
combustion engines to increase tenfold. The plan succeeds in
kick-starting economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-Fifties _ Soviet Aid. Huge inefficient coal-fired factories
sprout on the edges of every Chinese city, most designed by Soviet
engineers. Smog and water pollution increase around Chinese cities,
but the measurements are secret. Among the biggest and dirtiest
factories is the massive Capital Iron and Steel works in Beijing's
western suburbs, which three decades later would cause up to half
the city's smog.
</P>
<P>
   1958 _ Great Leap. Mao Tse-tung launches the ``Great Leap
Forward,'' a revolutionary scheme to multiply China's industrial
and moral strength by spreading small-scale mines, mills and
factories throughout the countryside. One result: a jump in water
and air pollution from the poorly made factories. Another: a
disastrous fall in food production, causing a mass famine in which
20 million Chinese die.
</P>
<P>
   Late 50s-mid 60s _ Baby Boom. China's population surges to
nearly 750 million _ up by almost 40 percent in the 15 years since
Mao's takeover. One-sixth of Chinese now live in towns and cities,
up from one-tenth in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   1974 _ Cold War. Warnings from Western demographers about a
Chinese ``population explosion'' are dismissed in Beijing as
anti-communist propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   1979 _ Village Industries. Leader Deng Xiaoping loosens economic
shackles, encouraging villagers to build rural factories and power
plants. While allowing millions to escape poverty, the small-scale
factories and dirty power plants multiply pollution of the Yangtze
and other rivers. Smog, already pervasive in cities, soon becomes
noticeable in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   September 1980 _ One Child. Premier Hua Guofeng announces that
each Chinese family must strive to bear just one child. China soon
revises its marriage law to ban teenagers from marrying. But
population keeps rising.
</P>
<P>
   1982 _ One Billion. China's most accurate census shows that the
population has crept over 1 billion. Life expectancy has increased
dramatically, and there are now 265 million women of child-bearing
age. The government toughens population control measures, ordering
compulsory IUD insertion for women with one child. Sterilization is
compulsory for either husband or wife after the birth of a second
child. Some women who get pregnant without permission of their work
units are forced to have abortions.
</P>
<P>
   1990s _ Acid Rain. China's cheap, abundant coal produces 70
percent of her energy. China's coal has a high sulfur content and
less than one fifth of Chinese coal is de-sulfurized before smoke
goes up the stack. By mid-decade, China consumes 1.3 billion tons
of coal annually, one-third of all coal burned worldwide. And China
is the world's largest sulfur-dioxide emitter. Resulting acid rain
erodes China's soil, kills trees and damages wetlands and
grasslands. Japanese scientists also find effects of Chinese acid
rain.
</P>
<P>
   1996 _ Realization. China appeals to the World Bank for help in
arresting environmental degradation. In a startling
acknowledgement, China's top environmental official Xie Zhenhua
says the country's ecosystem is in ``grave'' condition. He predicts
China will have to spend $50 billion in five years to control air
and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   End of 1996 _ China's population reaches 1.236 billion and is
increasing by at least 13 million every year.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-1997 _ Car Threat. China's increasingly wealthy middle class
is just starting to acquire private cars. Most buy Chinese-made
cars that yield 10 to 15 times as much pollution as cars sold in
Europe or America. With the number of cars on Chinese roads
increasing by 10 percent a year, China bans the sale of leaded
gasoline in Beijing and Shanghai. But few cars sold in China are
equipped with catalytic converters because unleaded gasoline is
sold only in a few cities.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 28, 1998 - Secrecy Pierced. Beijing, along with 38 other
Chinese cities, begins issuing weekly air quality statistics that
have hitherto been state secrets. China's state-controlled press
and TV blossom with articles highlighting the long-range risks of
pollution.

`NO COOK' PASTA SAUCES ARE STIRRING NEWS FOR SAPPED SUMMER CHEFS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A book that includes ``No Cook'' in the title is guaranteed to
catch my eye during a Texas July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joie Warner's No-Cook Pasta Sauce'' (Chronicle, $17.95) is one
sure-fire attention getter. The book's 75 recipes combine room
temperature sauces with a pot of cooked pasta to create delicious
meals for cooks wrung out from a simple trip to the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes range from a simple butter and Parmesan sauce to a
budget-busting lobster tarragon sauce. But in between are recipes
using the season's lush tomatoes, herbs such as rosemary and basil,
and pantry items such as canned black beans and canned clams.

<P>
   Let's face it, if the printed book had just been invented, it
would probably get three stars out of five in reviews from the
computer magazines. A review of Paper Book 1.0 might conclude with
the following summary:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pros: Lightweight, portable, inexpensive, high resolution,
practically unbreakable, available in multiple languages, easily
annotated with write-only stylus, requires no batteries. Can be
read while sitting in the smallest room of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cons: Pages are static rather than dynamic (they cannot be
updated once printed); fonts and type sizes are fixed; lack of
backlighting makes it difficult to read at night without an
external light source; topic selection is limited; paper is
inefficient, bulky and subject to mildew and yellowing; paper
production is environmentally unfriendly, and content is vulnerable
to rampant copyright violations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In subsequent versions,'' the electronic reviewers might
write, ``we would like to see the Paper Book add interactivity,
hyperlinking, a built-in dictionary, animated illustrations, online
connections to content repositories, encryption to protect the
publisher's copyright and other features we take for granted in
electronic books.''
</P>
<P>
   Printed books have been popular for five centuries, of course,
and have enjoyed great success despite the aforementioned
shortcomings. But that hasn't stopped recent generations of science
fiction authors, futurists, entrepreneurs and even politicians from
fantasizing about electronic and digital books.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich told an audience last month that replacing
printed textbooks with computers should be a goal of the federal
government. ``I would hope within five years they would have no
more textbooks,'' Gingrich said. In Texas, the chairman of the
State Board of Education has proposed spending billions of dollars
in coming years to replace printed books with laptop computers and
electronic books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a comet on some weird, loopy orbit, this idea comes
around every 10 years or so,'' said Paul Saffo, a director of the
Institute for the Future, a research group based in Menlo Park,
Calif. ``Each time we get a closer approximation.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, at least three digital approximations of books
are scheduled to be introduced, beginning in the fall. You would
casually entrust none of them to a fifth grader and would not, for
that matter, take any of them to the beach in a bag filled with
sand and tanning lotion. All are essentially portable computers
with touch-activated screens and special modifications for
retrieving, storing and displaying digital versions of printed
material.
</P>
<P>
   The first scheduled to arrive is the midsize Softbook, a sleek
tablet with a supple leather cover. The Softbook weighs about three
pounds and has a screen not quite big enough to display a single
page of a hardcover book.
</P>
<P>
   The Softbook is expected to cost $299 when it goes on sale in
September, but the buyer will also be required to pay a monthly
subscription fee of $9.95 for a package of services that will
include local telephone access to the Softbook Press library and a
bundle of public domain and special publications.
</P>
<P>
   Additional fees will be charged for downloading copyrighted
books and publications. A $19.95 monthly plan for more active
readers will also be available.
</P>
<P>
   To load the Softbook with ``content,'' as writing is known these
days, the user will simply plug any standard phone line into the
Softbook's built-in modem port and tap a connection icon on the
screen, and the Softbook will do the rest. No desktop computer will
be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime before the end of the year, the Rocketbook will be on
the market. The smallest of the three electronic books, the
Rocketbook can be easily held in one hand; it weighs about half as
much as the Softbook (the Rocketbook's designer also designed the
Palm Pilot).
</P>
<P>
   Nuvomedia, the Rocketbook's creator, has financial backing from
the investment arm of the global publishing giant Bertelsmann AG
and from Barnes and Noble. Both companies apparently see a
potential cost advantage in not having to print, ship, stock and
store paper-based books.
</P>
<P>
   No subscription fee will be required for the Rocketbook, but the
device will cost about $500 when it reaches the market, about the
time when winter weather sets in and people are thinking of curling
up in front of a fireplace with a good book.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Softbook, the Rocketbook will have to be inserted
into a special ``cradle'' connected to an personal computer with
Internet access. The user will shop at any online bookstore but the
book ordered will not be sent by mail; the words will stream into
the Rocketbook instead.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Softbook and Rocketbook companies contend that they
have struck agreements with almost all of the world's great book
publishing and information companies and that current best-sellers
as well as specialized publications will be available when they
open for business.
</P>
<P>
   The only one of the three new models that actually resembles a
book is the EB Dedicated Reader, which is being developed by
Everybook Inc. of Middletown, Pa. Now in the prototype stage, the
Reader is not expected to reach the market until next year.
</P>
<P>
   When it does arrive, it is expected to cost $1,400 to $1,600, a
rich vessel indeed for bodice-ripping romance novels but perhaps
reasonable for a twin-screened book that can display two full-size,
facing pages at once, in the exact format of the printed-on-paper
version, with color and the ability to show engineering diagrams
and mathematical formulas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single-screen device is not a book _ it's a tablet,'' said
the Reader's inventor, Dan Munyan, who says that his product will
be the first true electronic book. ``The last person to read and
enjoy a tablet was Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the two other contenders, the Reader is designed to use
the Portable Document Format (.pdf) files that recreate a paper
document's layout and type styles on any computer screen. Munyan
said he expected the Reader to appeal mainly to customers on the
high end of the professional reference-book market, those who spend
a thousand or more tax-deductible dollars on reference works a
year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even the inventors of these first models stress that they are
not intended to replace the paperback novel. ``You can't beat
paperbacks,'' Munyan said. ``Paperback books are too cheap.''
Instead, all are trying to win customers among professionals like
doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers and others who need to
keep reading updated journals and reference works.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there will be room in the digital book's memory for a
guilty pleasure or two _ the smallest digital book can hold the
equivalent of 10 trashy novels _ but realistically, the economics
of it will make sense mainly for getting instant access to
professional texts.
</P>
<P>
   A digital book would have some undeniable advantages. Students
would not be bent under bulging backpacks filled with heavy
textbooks. Children would not have to read by flashlight under the
covers after curfew at night because a button turns on the
illumination for the book's display screen (and shuts it off
quickly when footsteps approach).
</P>
<P>
   The children's parents could dispense with unstylish reading
glasses because another button would instantly swell the book's
text to a larger size.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, an online bookstore could have hundreds of thousands
of book titles ready for instant delivery. There would no longer be
any such thing as an out-of-print book because once a title was
digitized, there would be no cost to ``print'' another copy, even
for one customer.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, though, very few books today exist in digital form,
so publishers or distributors would have to pay several hundred
dollars each to have older books retyped or scanned into a
computer. Establishing electronic royalties for authors and
illustrators would be a legal morass.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, because the publisher has no paper, printing
and distribution costs, one could expect the cost of a digitally
delivered book to be less than that of one tattooed onto dried
paste made from dead trees. Then again, one would have thought that
audio CDs would cost less than vinyl LPs.
</P>
<P>
   For teachers and students, the digital books hold the promise of
never being outdated. Unfamiliar words and concepts would be
defined with a quick tap on the screen, calling up a dictionary
entry or supplementary text, all through hyperlinks.
</P>
<P>
   For professionals, things like medical journal articles, changes
in the tax code, court rulings and other timely material would be a
click away.
</P>
<P>
   As CD-ROM encyclopedias have shown, digital books can be
enhanced with sound, video, animation, hyperlinking, automatic
updating and interactive story lines.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, paper books don't crash, run out of battery power
over Nebraska, spew error messages, demand periodic upgrades,
require technical support, attract professional thieves, entice the
purchase of expensive upgrades or go to the repair shop for days at
a time _ all issues that Gingrich and the Texas schoolbook
officials apparently believe won't apply to digital books.
</P>
<P>
   And experience suggests that even if people own expensive,
high-resolution desktop displays, they typically prefer to send
long blocks of text to a printer rather than read them on a
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   But digital books seem inevitable, as an alternative, not a
replacement, for paper books. Microprocessors are getting smaller,
more powerful and cheaper as displays are getting bigger, thinner
and cheaper; memory capacity is getting bigger and cheaper;
Internet access is becoming ubiquitous and cheaper, and book
production and distribution costs are getting more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   And in the even more distant future, the line between paper and
electronic books may blur. In Cambridge, Mass., Professor Joe
Jacobson of the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is trying to create an ``ink'' sensitive to electronic
fields that, when printed on thin plastic, fabric or even paper,
will lead to a book that can publish itself.
</P>
<P>
   The ink is actually microscopic particles embedded in the paper,
inside tiny capsules, that flip over in response to changes in an
electric field. When they are flipped one way, they appear black;
when they flop the other way, they are white. Electrical signals
originating in the spine of the book tell the particles how to line
up, creating text that can be rewritten over and over.
</P>
<P>
   A book printed with so-called electronic ink could very closely
approximate a traditional printed book, including paper pages. But
depending on what the user wanted to read, the book could erase and
redraw itself with new text and illustrations.
</P>
<P>
   A digital book with electronic ink is years, if not decades,
away. But Jacobson has formed a private company, E Ink, to find
commercial uses for electronic ink in the near term, in products
like clothing and wallpaper that could change patterns and display
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspaper, magazine, advertising and electronics
companies have poured millions of dollars into the research this
year.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Jacobson thinks that it might soon be possible to
print logic circuits, transistors and other computational devices
on paper, cloth or plastic, creating, in effect, a two-dimensional
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   If his group of physicists, chemists and engineers is
successful, someday people won't have to carry books or computers _
they can simply wear them.

CILANTRO: DON'T GO ETHNIC WITHOUT IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL NUCKOLS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABCs: Cilantro is an annual, a native of the eastern
Mediterranean and southern Europe but widely cultivated elsewhere.
It reaches 24 inches in height. Leaves have a distinctive, pungent
flavor. ``Cilantro'' is the term for the leaves; ``coriander''
refers to the seeds of the same plant.
</P>
<P>
   Growing conditions: Plant in full sun from seed, or transplant
after last frost or in fall. Cilantro can't take heat. Apply a
little fish emulsion when the plant is small; occasionally apply
compost.
</P>
<P>
   Food pairings: Tomatoes, squash, eggplant, meats, cheeses _
especially in Mexican, Chinese, Southeast Asian and Indian
cuisines.
</P>
<P>
   Caveats: Avoid planting near fennel and other members of the
Apiaceae family.

WEB OFFERS WIDE MENU FOR SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)   (af)  
 By VICTOR MATHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the days before the Web, few fans of baseball or football
felt as if they were missing anything. After all, newspapers,
magazines and television provided ample coverage of their favorite
sports.
</P>
<P>
   But fans of rowing, swimming, cycling and other less popular
sports had to make do with the occasional paragraph, if they were
lucky, or maybe just a monthly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the biggest American sports have certainly benefited
from the explosion of information provided by the Web. But it has
probably made the greatest difference to enthusiasts of
lesser-known sports. Now even devotees of billiards, rounders and
korfball can find something for themselves on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Korfball? More on that later.
</P>
<P>
   Surely one of the less extensively covered sporting events is
the World's Strongest Man competition. An event seen on ESPN and
ESPN2 late at night, it features burly Icelanders and others
lifting barrels and dragging anchors in races against the clock.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Henderson, 18, a college student in Ewing, N.J.,
posted some information about the competition on his personal Web
site, he had no idea what was in store. Soon he was deluged with
mail from other enthusiasts and, later on, from some of the
entrants themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually ESPN and Transworld International, which televises
the competition in Europe, recognized the page as the event's
official site.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said his Web site (www.strongestman.com/magnus. html)
filled a void. The site includes results dating from the first
competition in 1977, profiles of the competitors and photographs.
One highlight is the extensive collection of sound files, enabling
the curious browser to hear the American strongman O.D. Wilson
boast: ``There is nobody stronger than me, nobody. I'm the
strongest man on this planet,'' or John Pall Sigmarsson of Iceland
declare, ``I am a Viking.''
</P>
<P>
   The site gets about 1,300 hits a week, and Henderson, who
answers questions about the competition on a site bulletin board,
gets 50 to 70 e-mails a week from fellow fans.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, bicycle racing, especially each summer's Tour
de France, has attracted more press attention. Die-hard fans
subscribe to Velonews, a 50,000-circulation magazine, for more
complete results year-round. Now Velonews has a Web site with daily
reports from races around the world
(www.greatoutdoors.com/velonews/index.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Most people think of tug-of-war as a friendly pastime at a
picnic or fair. But there is also international competition in the
sport, which used to be an Olympic event. In addition to world
championship results, www.tugofwar.org devotes much of its space to
the rules: the eight pullers on each team are allowed to apply
resin on their hands only, and spikes and nails in the shoes are
not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Once every four years, Olympic viewers watch men and women slide
down a refrigerated chute on their backs. The rest of the time,
luge fans can turn to www.luge.com for results of non-Olympic
competitions, world rankings and tips on technique.
</P>
<P>
   Bandy is a winter sport with a profile even lower than luge's.
Essentially it is hockey played on ice the size of a soccer field
with a ball rather than a puck. Although most popular in Europe, it
has a North American following, as well.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian site, www.escape.ca/gbgre, is realistic about the
sport's popularity. The page begins, helpfully, by answering the
question ``What is bandy?'' It offers links to other bandy sites,
including the results of the 1997 world championships (won by
Sweden) and a history of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   For a good all-in-one site, there is www.sportcal.co.uk, with
schedules of events and links for 180 sports like dragon boat
racing, Canadian five-pin bowling, underwater rugby (there was a
competition June 20 in Slovakia) and, yes, korfball.
</P>
<P>
   Korfball, a nearly 100-year-old sport, is a form of basketball
with teams of four men and four women. ``Korf'' is Dutch for
basket, and the Netherlands won the European championship in April.
The Dutch also win the prize for best korfball Web site:

   BANGKOK _ One year after igniting Asia's financial crisis,
Thailand has been learning the painful lessons of taking on the
forces of global financial markets without proper preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai private debt crisis, rooted in a profligate and
unprofessional finance and banking sector, was not unprecedented. A
similar disaster had convulsed the country in the early 1980s when
a string of finance companies and wobbly banks had to be taken
over.
</P>
<P>
   The major differences in 1997 were: an open capital account
allowing free movement of foreign money; the unsuccessful attempt
by the Bank of Thailand, the central bank, to defend the overvalued
baht, instead of devaluing it as in 1981 and 1984; and collusion by
senior central bank officials with a group of unscrupulous
commercial bankers and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that the central bank's mismanagement of one
medium-sized commercial bank that was insolvent led to a systemic
financial collapse, sparking a regional panic.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's protected and largely family-controlled banking and
finance industry contained many structural weaknesses. These were
quickly exposed. Controlling a large chunk of the country's wealth,
Thai banks and finance companies had long engaged in unsound
lending to relatives, friends and associates.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforced by shoddy accounting and auditing standards, such
practices were based on personal connections, rather than on
business merits.
</P>
<P>
   They were perpetuated by a pattern of social relationships that
tended to create and keep wealth inside the elite at the expense of
the majority of the Thai population of 60 million who live outside
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the ever widening income disparity between rich and poor,
and between Bangkok and the countryside, in the previous decade of
rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   There would not have been such glaring inequality in income
distribution if the government had been more adept at handling the
newfound wealth. But tax codes and collection were defective. Tax
evasion was rampant. Few paid attention to the problem because
state revenues were increasing steadily as the economy expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was that laws and regulations were either
inadequate or ineffectively enforced. The police, public
prosecutors and the judiciary did not always act independently.
</P>
<P>
   Graft and inertia in the bureaucracy siphoned off, or slowed,
public spending on national development projects. Political leaders
played a role in this vicious circle, taking money from public
contracts to pay for reelection expenses and advance their vested
interests.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a crisis to change such an entrenched, deeply flawed
system. Without the shock of economic adversity of the scale that
has hit Thailand, the country's finances would not have been
reformed to meet the demands of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Two lessons are to be drawn from the crisis. Developing
countries elsewhere should streamline and strengthen their
financial systems voluntarily before a crisis forces them to do it
in difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   And the IMF and developed countries need to reconsider their
policy of pushing for a free flow of capital in and out of
developing nations. They need to balance the pace of liberalization
with the readiness of local financial systems.
</P>
<P>
   Unfettered capital flows may be beneficial to international
bankers and fund managers. But, as the East Asian experience now
shows, when financial systems implode, the adverse consequences can
be felt around the world. &QL;

TEEN-AGER SENTENCED FOR BEATING YOUNGER BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EVE MITCHELL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MATEO, Calif. _ Calling it the most difficult case in her
two-decade judicial career, a judge has sentenced a teen-age boy to
detention for hitting another youth in the head with a baseball
bat.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum sentence of up to seven years in a California Youth
Authority facility was handed down by San Mateo County Juvenile
Court Judge Margaret Kemp. The boy, 15, has been in custody since
his arrest May 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as difficult a case as has been presented to me in
those 20 years,'' said Kemp, who called it an ``enormous tragedy''
for both the victim and his attacker.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager sentenced Tuesday and a second boy, also 15, were
arrested just hours after the May 24 attack in the parking lot of a
Foster City shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has alleged the two teen-agers went out looking
for someone to attack after viewing ``Menace II Society.'' The boys
watched the 1993 movie, which tells the story of a teen-age gang
member trying to turn his life around, the night before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the entertainment media is poisoning our
children,'' Kemp said. The boys ``armed themselves, and they went
out to hurt somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim, a 14-year-old from Foster City who is undergoing
therapy for a severe head injury, said outside court, ``I think
it's good he got the maximum punishment. I also think it was unfair
for me to go through this and for him to go through it himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy sentenced Tuesday, whose name is not being disclosed
because he is a juvenile, will be eligible for parole in 2 1/2
years.
</P>
<P>
   His mother gasped, then cried out, when the judge announced the
sentence after a two-hour hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the boy admitted to an assault charge in exchange
for dismissal of an attempted murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   At his sentencing hearing, the boy said he and the other youth
had only meant to use the bat to scare somebody but that he had
ended up hitting the victim instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive myself for what I
did,'' he said. ``There's no excuse for what I've done. It hurts a
lot to see my sister and my mom to have to go through this pain I
bring to them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A task force of engineers and team leaders who were
trying hard to complete a highly competitive electronics contract
were startled to see French job inspectors abruptly appear in their
midst shortly after 7 o'clock one evening early this year.
</P>
<P>
   What are your names and why are you working late? the inspectors
wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring protests about their intrusion, several inspectors
insisted on putting the same questions to corporate executives who
were meeting with a potential customer in nearby offices, according
to an anonymous pamphlet that circulated after the raid on the
headquarters in suburban Paris of Alcatel-TITN Answare, a
subsidiary of Alcatel, France's giant telecommunications
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several prominent French companies that have been
raided by job inspectors bent on stopping executives and
top-salaried specialists from working longer hours than the
official 39-hour workweek _ in effect, doing unpaid overtime as
executives.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to snap inspections, investigators have staked out
plants' parking lots to photograph license plates and document that
the cars' owners are spending too much time in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered business as usual, the practice among
managerial-rank employees of working long hours if needed to get
the job done has become a violation of French labor law.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the hottest front in the long-running wars of the
35-hour workweek decreed by France's Socialist-led government.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the idea is bitterly opposed by business, the
government has expanded the plan for shorter hours beyond factory
and white-collar wage-earners to include salaried employees known
in French as cadres.
</P>
<P>
   This category, often loosely assimilated with ``manager,''
actually embraces almost a quarter of France's nearly 15
million-person work force, including not just top executives but
also nearly all skilled professionals employed in big companies.
</P>
<P>
   What cadres have in common is not their managerial rank but a
quasi-executive social status _ and a tradition of working long,
often irregular hours without claiming overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Jobs and Solidarity Minister Martine Aubry, the
government has decided to end this practice as part of its campaign
to force companies to shorten hours and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing the change on cadres has turned out to be a
controversial idea in France, partly with cadres themselves and
above all with businesses. They complain that accommodating the
need for shorter hours for cadres will disrupt their performance
and make French companies less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and elsewhere, rival companies have more
flexibility because of less-rigid labor regulations and more
individual contracts with skilled personnel, which are not dictated
by French-style industry-wide negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishing in France has on occasion attained tragicomic
proportions, with French chief executives dropping public hints
that they have rented hotel rooms for their executives to work
clandestinely.
</P>
<P>
   As a riposte, job inspectors have sought to monitor executives'
personal computers to detect whether they have been used for
company business at home to circumvent the ban.
</P>
<P>
   In the current climate, a workaholic executive risks a reprimand
because his boss fears that a trade union official _ or even a
disgruntled fellow executive _ will inform on the company, inviting
unwelcome attention from job inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, executives interviewed for this article
declined to discuss their own companies by name.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, inspectors are known to have successfully charged
Alcatel, Thomson-CSF, the big defense electronics firm that is
being privatized, Carrefour, the country's largest supermarket
chain, and Credit Local de France, a bank with branches throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   All these companies have complied with the new government
demands, which were aimed mainly at high-tech industries heavy in
nonmanagerial cadres.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the list, Francette Aubert, spokesman at the Ministry
of Jobs and Solidarity, said that the inspectors had issued
thousands of notices of violations targeted at ``a few big
enterprises to clarify the legal status of cadres,'' which
currently is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A corporate head had a blunter interpretation: ``The big test
cases were intimidation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Political bargaining is just getting under way about a bill on
cadres, which is due next year as the final act of legislation that
started in May on the 35-hour week. But French big business has
already started negotiating with employees about a workweek for
cadres.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the raids have been suspended for several weeks and
may not resume. Few employers have any remaining appetite for
tangling with the job inspectors, a nationwide corps of 420 persons
who come under the Ministry of Jobs and Solidarity but enjoy
considerable autonomy in tracking down abuses of labor laws, often
in close collaboration with unionized employees.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors' militancy can be unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   A test of wills at Thomson Radars and Countermeasures, a
subsidiary of Thomson-CSF, involved charges this spring of 1,500
violations, according to sources in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Top management, facing personal fines in excess of $100,000 and
the threat of jail, finally agreed to shut the main corporate
facility every day at 7 P.M.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the conflict is the perception of many French
cadres that the government wants to take away their status.
</P>
<P>
   Technically a payroll category, the title of cadre carries some
fringe benefits, but for many it is also a social badge, separating
quasi-professional people from other workers in a business and
giving them status as part of a middle class whose work is somehow
associated with incentives rather than with union-negotiated
sectorial pay raises. &QL;

<P>
   PARIS _ A task force of engineers and team leaders who were
trying hard to complete a highly competitive electronics contract
were startled to see French job inspectors abruptly appear in their
midst shortly after 7 o'clock one evening early this year.
</P>
<P>
   What are your names and why are you working late? the inspectors
wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring protests about their intrusion, several inspectors
insisted on putting the same questions to corporate executives who
were meeting with a potential customer in nearby offices, according
to an anonymous pamphlet that circulated after the raid on the
headquarters in suburban Paris of Alcatel-TITN Answare, a
subsidiary of Alcatel, France's giant telecommunications
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several prominent French companies that have been
raided by job inspectors bent on stopping executives and
top-salaried specialists from working longer hours than the
official 39-hour workweek _ in effect, doing unpaid overtime as
executives.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to snap inspections, investigators have staked out
plants' parking lots to photograph license plates and document that
the cars' owners are spending too much time in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered business as usual, the practice among
managerial-rank employees of working long hours if needed to get
the job done has become a violation of French labor law.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the hottest front in the long-running wars of the
35-hour workweek decreed by France's Socialist-led government.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the idea is bitterly opposed by business, the
government has expanded the plan for shorter hours beyond factory
and white-collar wage-earners to include salaried employees known
in French as cadres.
</P>
<P>
   This category, often loosely assimilated with ``manager,''
actually embraces almost a quarter of France's nearly 15
million-person work force, including not just top executives but
also nearly all skilled professionals employed in big companies.
</P>
<P>
   What cadres have in common is not their managerial rank but a
quasi-executive social status _ and a tradition of working long,
often irregular hours without claiming overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Jobs and Solidarity Minister Martine Aubry, the
government has decided to end this practice as part of its campaign
to force companies to shorten hours and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing the change on cadres has turned out to be a
controversial idea in France, partly with cadres themselves and
above all with businesses. They complain that accommodating the
need for shorter hours for cadres will disrupt their performance
and make French companies less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and elsewhere, rival companies have more
flexibility because of less-rigid labor regulations and more
individual contracts with skilled personnel, which are not dictated
by French-style industry-wide negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishing in France has on occasion attained tragicomic
proportions, with French chief executives dropping public hints
that they have rented hotel rooms for their executives to work
clandestinely.
</P>
<P>
   As a riposte, job inspectors have sought to monitor executives'
personal computers to detect whether they have been used for
company business at home to circumvent the ban.
</P>
<P>
   In the current climate, a workaholic executive risks a reprimand
because his boss fears that a trade union official _ or even a
disgruntled fellow executive _ will inform on the company, inviting
unwelcome attention from job inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, executives interviewed for this article
declined to discuss their own companies by name.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, inspectors are known to have successfully charged
Alcatel, Thomson-CSF, the big defense electronics firm that is
being privatized, Carrefour, the country's largest supermarket
chain, and Credit Local de France, a bank with branches throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   All these companies have complied with the new government
demands, which were aimed mainly at high-tech industries heavy in
nonmanagerial cadres.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the list, Francette Aubert, spokesman at the Ministry
of Jobs and Solidarity, said that the inspectors had issued
thousands of notices of violations targeted at ``a few big
enterprises to clarify the legal status of cadres,'' which
currently is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A corporate head had a blunter interpretation: ``The big test
cases were intimidation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Political bargaining is just getting under way about a bill on
cadres, which is due next year as the final act of legislation that
started in May on the 35-hour week. But French big business has
already started negotiating with employees about a workweek for
cadres.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the raids have been suspended for several weeks and
may not resume. Few employers have any remaining appetite for
tangling with the job inspectors, a nationwide corps of 420 persons
who come under the Ministry of Jobs and Solidarity but enjoy
considerable autonomy in tracking down abuses of labor laws, often
in close collaboration with unionized employees.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors' militancy can be unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   A test of wills at Thomson Radars and Countermeasures, a
subsidiary of Thomson-CSF, involved charges this spring of 1,500
violations, according to sources in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Top management, facing personal fines in excess of $100,000 and
the threat of jail, finally agreed to shut the main corporate
facility every day at 7 P.M.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the conflict is the perception of many French
cadres that the government wants to take away their status.
</P>
<P>
   Technically a payroll category, the title of cadre carries some
fringe benefits, but for many it is also a social badge, separating
quasi-professional people from other workers in a business and
giving them status as part of a middle class whose work is somehow
associated with incentives rather than with union-negotiated
sectorial pay raises. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Solar-powered fiber optics? Photovoltaic
cell-laminated tensile hyperbolic paraboloids? Today's visionary
gibberish is tomorrow's plain English. The nifty thing about
emerging technologies is the way they sneak up on you, then
transform your life overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Sun: An Outdoor Exhibition of Light,'' a garden
installation inside the wrought-iron fence of the Cooper-Hewitt
National Design Museum in Manhattan until Oct. 25, explains how
solar technology has been sneaking up on civilization in the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   As for the transformation of daily life _ the one foretold in
the 1970s, when solar-energy zealots worshiped clunky black panels
and declared independence from fossil fuels _ it is once again in
sight. This time around, the show declares, the design
possibilities are endless. So are the global perks (cleaner air,
fewer oil wars). No, really.
</P>
<P>
   Solar power as a source of electricity was discovered in 1839,
refined for satellites in the 1950s and lately has been engineered
into glass panels for the rising office tower at Four Times Square
designed by Fox &AMP; Fowle Architects with Kiss &AMP; Cathcart Architects.
</P>
<P>
   But only over the last few years have scientists figured out how
to make photovoltaic material _ now a thin black film that can be
attached to other materials _ turn sunlight into electricity
affordably. The Energy Department and BP Solar (a subsidiary of
British Petroleum, and a manufacturer of photovoltaics) helped
sponsor this traveling exhibition to spread the news: This is not
your father's solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   It is not your father's old museum fare either. Lucy Fellowes,
who shaped the exhibition over four years, did more than the
standard curatorial sweep. Yes, Ms. Fellowes, the museum's curator
for special projects, created a time line of solar history, and
collected solar-powered products and prototypes (lawn mower,
lantern, call box, computer, lights and so on). But there is plenty
of innovation, too.
</P>
<P>
   She commissioned two forward-looking New York architects to
design the exhibition and to create two original structures using
photovoltaics in new ways. Early on, the exhibition and its message
became a collaborative mission.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Goldsmith, of FTL Happold Architects and Engineers,
designed the garden's most imposing structure: a 30-foot-high solar
tensile pavilion, a fabric tent laminated with photovoltaic film
five-thousandths of an inch thick. At night the film electrifies a
display of red lights.
</P>
<P>
   The show's timing is fortuitous. At the apex of a stock market
that has financed a cavalcade of giant gas guzzlers and small
electronic consumables, ``Under the Sun'' offers a change of
perspective. Refreshingly, it involves no recycled garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Its wonders may be arriving just in time. After a decade of
techno-ennui _ the fatigue of being startled by an onslaught of
PCs, laptops, cell phones, satellites, lasers _ users are jaded.
Cash-machine cards in hand, they stand ready to be wowed, then
bored, then wowed again by the next barrage of personal gadgets in
black or taupe. Is that all there is?
</P>
<P>
   What is missing is awe. It takes something like this exhibition
to show off the poetry of solar energy. When designers express the
link between earth and sky, between the sun and our insatiable need
for power, the trick can be downright thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the Himawari, an intricate silver pod with a transparent
dome tucked under one of the Cooper-Hewitt's windows. It is a solar
lighting system making its first American appearance. Invented and
produced in Japan, the Himawari (sunflower) tracks the sun with 36
moving lenses that gather energy into light-conducting
(fiber-optic) glass strands. The light is transported indoors to
six lamps that illuminate, poetically enough, some solar souvenirs,
like a German pocket sundial of 1748. The room reflects the mood of
the sky outside; clouds change the intensity of the lighting.
</P>
<P>
   In midgarden is a self-powered solar glass pavilion invented by
Gregory Kiss and Goldsmith. The pavilion is made of
photovoltaic-laminated glass panels that do triple work: structure,
enclosure and electrical generator. Inside, visitors are cooled by
a fan and lighted by fluorescent lights in the glowing glass floor.
``We want to make energy production palpable,'' Kiss said. ``We're
trying to do sensual design.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology that warms the soul as it cools the body? Maybe there
is such a thing as progress after all.

EUROPEANIZATION OF SOCCER APPARENT AT 1998 WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, this story subsumes material originally skedded at
SOC-WORLDCUP-FRANCE)  
 (JT)  
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The world's finest teams have played 56 soccer matches
over three weeks. Their players have scored with feet, knees,
heads, chests, shoulders, and, in the unfortunate case of
goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta of Spain, with a hand.
</P>
<P>
   The gaffes and heroics have kept fans up late in Asia and gotten
them up early in South America. But when one examines the list of
World Cup quarterfinalists, what is striking is that this
quadrennial flurry of very well-documented activity has done very
little to change the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   The teams that have had the most success in this competition
since it was launched in 1930 _ Brazil, Germany, Italy and
Argentina _ are all among the final eight. So is the host nation,
France, and three other representatives from Europe _ the
Netherlands, Croatia and Denmark _ which simply reaffirms that,
despite globalization, the old world remains firmly at the center
of the soccer universe.
</P>
<P>
   There were six European quarterfinalists in 1990, seven in 1994
and six this year. Even if a South American team does manage to win
a World Cup on European soil for the first time since Brazil in
1958, it bears remembering that the contemporary South American
stars spend more time in this climate and this time zone than they
do in their own. All 11 of the Argentinians who started against
England on Tuesday play for European clubs, and of the 11
Brazilians who started against Chile, seven are under contract with
European employers. Ronaldo has seen a lot more of Eindhoven,
Barcelona and Milan in the last four years than he has of sunny Rio
de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon is hardly new. Argentine coach Daniel Passarella,
to cite just one example, spent many seasons playing on this
continent, but the Europeanization of soccer has continued to
gather speed and Europe's influence arguably has never been so
complete since the English began exporting the game via their
colonies in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The best Africans play in Europe, and increasingly they are also
educated and trained in Europe, which was why many were expecting
what the French term ``mountains and marvels'' from Nigeria, but
the World Cup is not just an athletic exercise. It is also an
administrative exercise, and multiple coaching changes, financial
squabbles, intramural bickering and political pressure ultimately
could not have helped the Nigerian cause _ a fact striker Victor
Ikpeba readily admitted after his team's convincing loss to Denmark
in the second round. It is telling that of the African teams,
Morocco, which had both coaching continuity and means at its
disposal, came closest to fulfilling its potential in France.
</P>
<P>
   But that is last month's news. This month, it is time to see
which of the perennials will fulfill its potential, and if there
have been disappointingly few surprises until now, that only makes
these predictable quarterfinal matchups more enticing. A look at
Friday's and Saturday's games:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; France vs. Italy, Friday &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Italian coach Cesare Maldini jokingly called this a match
between two Italian teams with a few foreigners thrown in for good
measure. That is because 11 of the 22 French have played or are
still playing in the Italian first division. The most prominent is
Zinedine Zidane, the playmaker for Juventus of Turin who missed
France's last two games because of a red card. He is back in the
lineup, which means that Youri Djorkaeff can stop frenetically
attempting to make something out of nothing and concentrate on
scoring. The French surprisingly have as many goals (10) as the
Brazilians, but they have yet to prove they can score consistently
against the world's finest teams and the probable absence of speedy
and injured striker Thierry Henry won't make a tricky task easier.
</P>
<P>
   On paper and on grass, Italy has a more formidable attack with
the relentlessly opportunistic Christian Vieri and either
Alessandro Del Piero, who has yet to show his full panoply of
tricks in France, or Roberto Baggio. They are backed up by a fine
defense that after a shaky start against Chile has begun to look
very Italian despite losing top goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi to an
injury before the World Cup and losing defender Alessandro Nesta to
an injury last week. The French defense, led by Lilian Thuram and
Marcel Desailly, is arguably even better, which means that anybody
expecting the first half of Italy-France to resemble the first half
of Argentina-England is a hopeless romantic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Brazil vs. Denmark, Friday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians temporarily silenced their nation's chattering
classes with their 4-1 trouncing of Chile. Since then, there has
been considerable hand- wringing over the state of Ronaldo's left
knee and waistline. The fact that he missed practice on Tuesday
launched a thousand headlines at home, but Ronaldo, who suffers
from recurring tendinitis in the knee, said it would have no effect
on him Friday and that he weighed just as much _ 83.4 kilograms _
as he did at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brazil-Nigeria would unquestionably have been more fun to
watch in the quarterfinals, the Danes have gotten this far for the
first time for a reason. They were able to capitalize on defensive
errors from Nigeria and put their experience to good use _ the
Danish team's average age of 29 is second only to the Germans.
Veteran goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel should get ample opportunity to
display his talents against Brazil. But it is much less certain
that the Laudrup brothers and Peter Moller will give Brazilian
goalkeeper Taffarel the same chance to shine: even with Brazil's
uneven central defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Netherlands vs. Argentina, Saturday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Potentially the most spectacular of the quarterfinals, and the
second straight match for Argentina in which they have history on
their side. The Argentines already had beaten the English in the
1986 World Cup, and they defeated the Dutch in the 1978 final in
Buenos Aires. They have not played each other again in a World Cup
until now. Both teams have multiple strengths and world-class
strikers: Gabriel Batistuta for Argentina and Dennis Bergkamp for
the Netherlands. Bergkamp is more versatile: a player capable of
creating his own chances while Batistuta is more adept at seizing
those presented to him. While the Argentinians rely on a playmaker,
Ariel Ortega, the Dutch have a less predictable attacking flow.
Unfortunately for them, they also have been less predictable on
defense, surrendering a very late goal to Mexico. The Argentine
defense _ Michael Owen's unforgettable run excepted _ have been
exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Germany vs. Croatia, Saturday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   These are the first World Cup finals for Croatia, but this is
already a rivalry because the Germans defeated the Croatians 2-1 in
the quarterfinals of the 1996 European Championships. The Germans
went on to win that title, but they have yet to play like World Cup
favorites in France. What they have done is play like Germans late
in the second half: rallying to draw with Yugoslavia in group play
and to defeat Mexico in the second round. Oliver Bierhoff has used
his head superbly, but the problem has been the transition from
defense to offense: a role Andreas Moller plays quite well for his
club Borussia Dortmund but not nearly as well for his nation.
Goalkeeper Andreas Kopke also has looked shaky, but the oldest man
on the oldest team, 37-year-old Lothar Mathaus, has been a rock. If
Germany is to improve on its disappointing 1994 World Cup, when it
lost in the quarterfinals, it will need to be more precise against
an emotional team with an in-form striker: Davor Suker.

GARDEN Q&AMP;A 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LESLIE LAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHAT'S RED WITH BLACK DOTS?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am attempting to grow lilies in my perennial garden for the
first time. Along the main stem where each leaf begins, the plants
have a small, round, hard ``something'' on them. It is brown, but
if it were red with black dots it would resemble a lady bug. What
can you tell me about this?
</P>
<P>
   A. Since alien-looking growths on plants are seldom good news,
I'm happy to be able to tell you that in this case the
``somethings'' are not hostile invaders but natural progeny. They
are baby lily bulbs, called bulbils, designed by nature to fall to
the ground and make new plants.
</P>
<P>
   Each bulbil sends out an exploratory root, usually right around
the time it lands on terra firma. The root seeks a bit of
penetrable soil, bores in, gets a grip, then pulls the bulbil in
after it.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty neat _ until you realize that your perennial bed is full
of incipient lilies that have to be weeded out.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't say what kind of lilies you have, but if you've got
bulbils they are likely to be either tiger lilies (Lilium tigrinum,
aka L. lancifolium) or a hybrid with a lot of tiger lily in it.
</P>
<P>
   Before you let whatever it is spread itself around, you should
know that although the hybrids are unlikely to cause problems, L.
tigrinum itself is lily non grata to many experts. It can be a host
to numerous viruses that do nothing to the tigers but wreak havoc
among more susceptible types.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to plant delicate species lilies like L. canadense
and still keep your spotted friends, you should be sure they are
separated by at least 100 feet.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't happen to have that kind of space to play with,
plant the ones that need protecting downwind of the tigers. Most
viruses are spread by aphids and leafhoppers, and both of these
insects can travel on the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe I'm jumping to conclusions in assuming that your
lilies are L. tigrinum.
</P>
<P>
   Bulbils are also formed by a few other, far less common species,
including one called the Bulbil lily (L. bulbiferum).
</P>
<P>
   It has a strong growth habit and a great many rather
undistinguished red or orange flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, it seldom has bulbils, unless it has been damaged,
in which case it throws off baby bulbifera galore.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   WHEN IT'S BEST TO PINCH
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can I pinch the end of the cypress vine to encourage side
shoots to develop? I am growing it on a tent-shaped form in a large
pot and the vine has reached the top, but it has not filled in the
spaces below. I also want to know the same thing about a morning
glory that I grow on a fence. Should I pinch it to encourage side
shoots?
</P>
<P>
   A. The cypress vine (Ipomoea quamoclit) and the common morning
glory (I. tricolor) are cousins. Both are vigorous climbers that
shoot up before they start filling out, and they often remain
rather skimpy at the base even when the tops are lush.
</P>
<P>
   Pinching the tips to encourage side branches works best when the
plants are still quite small. Once they get going, they'll branch
heavily all by themselves _ forget pinching and think more about
applying a machete _ but most of those branches will start a couple
of feet from the ground. You could bend down some of the side
branches and fasten them to the base, but their urge to grow up is
so strong that this seldom works as well as it seems it should.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the easiest way to get fullness at the base of
your tent-arrangement is to plant a second crop in among the
growing vines. If you soak the seeds overnight to loosen their
tough coating, Ipomoeas sprout and grow quickly in hot weather.
Pinch out the tips of the new plants when they've got about four or
five leaves, then pinch out their first branches the same way.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   MONSTER BUGS
</P>
<P>
   Q. My strawberry plants have lots of berries, but there's
something wrong with them. They're small and sort of lumpy looking
and a lot of them have hard spots. They taste OK, but the texture
isn't as good as it should be because of the hard spots. The plants
look fine. I have been weeding and fertilizing, and there has been
plenty of rain. Why is this happening?
</P>
<P>
   A. You could be having pollination problems; rainy weather at
blossom time can cut down on bee activity. It's more likely,
however, that what you have is tarnished plant bugs, which nothing
seems to cut down except heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Tarnished plant bugs (Lygus rugulipennis) are true bugs, members
of the order Hemiptera, related to squash bugs and stink bugs. As
the name implies, they have the color of tarnished metal, greenish
tan, with mottlings of black, gold, and silver. They're about a
quarter-inch long, faintly oval and, at least compared to beetles,
fairly soft-bodied. They feed by sucking, inserting their beaks
into the tissues of a wide variety of flowers, including asters,
hollyhocks, snapdragons, nasturtiums and strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   This deforms the flower, naturally, and in the case of
strawberries it deforms the berry, too, because the damaged flower
parts cannot develop properly.
</P>
<P>
   Tarnished plant bugs can sometimes be controlled with hand
picking _ go out early in the morning, when they are still sluggish
_ or insecticidal soap, but if the infestation is heavy you may
have to resort to a pyrethrin-based insecticide. In the old days,
they used DDT, which gives you an idea of what you're up against.

   It will help to keep the area around the strawberry bed free of
plant debris and tall weeds, both favored hiding places for the
bugs when they're not eating your strawberry flowers. This is also
where they overwinter, so thorough garden cleanup in the fall and
good maintenance in spring will cut down on next summer's problems.

MYSTERY MEAT IN HOT DOGS? MYSTERY SOLVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With July Fourth, fireworks, watermelon and overeating on the
calendar, the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council has mounted a
campaign to clean up the image of its food.
</P>
<P>
   July is National Hot Dog Month.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the council believes there really isn't anything to
clean up, other than a few misconceptions. It would like, for
instance, for people to stop saying that hot dogs are made of beef,
pork, chicken, turkey and mysterious miscellaneous body parts.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not so, the council says. ``In fact, hot dogs are made
from the same fresh meat and poultry in the grocer's case,'' it
says. ``When variety meats like hearts are used to make hot dogs,
the package clearly states `with variety meats.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That should make us feel better. Apparently, the labeling would
also cover tongues, livers, gizzards, combs and feathers.
</P>
<P>
   To make wieners, the council explains, the meats are chopped in
a gigantic chopping bowl and blended with ice chips, spices, salt
and curing ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the glop is forced through a funnel into a casing of some
sort, smoked, then packaged in neat little rows. Those rows should
never equal the number of buns in a package.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, I never doubted the purity of hot dogs. I never cared.
I've heard all those stories about missing gangsters and lost pets,
but I figured that was covered under ``spices.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times when you just want a hot dog. Some people have
to have their tripe, some long for their menudo, some crave their
headcheese.
</P>
<P>
   I once heard a Cajun friend denounce his own father because the
man stopped putting liver in his boudin.
</P>
<P>
   I don't worry much about what's in my hot dog, as long there's
mustard and onions to go on top.
</P>
<P>
   Which, by the way, brings on another revelation.
</P>
<P>
   What you put on your hot dog appears to be regional. The council
says Chicago dogs are served with yellow mustard, dark green
relish, chopped raw onion and tomato slices and topped with a dash
of celery salt on a poppy seed bun.
</P>
<P>
   New York City dogs are served with steamed onions and a pale
yellow mustard sauce; Southerners eat ``Slaw dogs'' topped with
coleslaw.
</P>
<P>
   The council claims Kansas City dogs are served with sauerkraut
and melted Swiss cheese on a sesame seed bun. I grew up in Kansas
City, and I don't remember Swiss cheese on anything. I never saw a
sesame seed hot dog bun.
</P>
<P>
   Easterners, by the way, eat more all-beef hot dogs than people
in any other region; Westerners eat more poultry dogs. Or so says
the council.
</P>
<P>
   The hot dog probably started out as a frankfurter back in
Frankfurt, Germany. Some say it was created as a sausage there in
1652. They were advanced in the United States around 1904, the
council says, when a concessionaire at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition sold them as plain sausages.
</P>
<P>
   To help his customers eat them, he supplied white gloves, but at
the end of the day, he was out of gloves. He then quickly consulted
a baker, who came up with buns to protect the fingers of the
eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Another story claims that wieners got their name back in 1901,
when concessionaires sold their ``dachshund sausages'' from hot
water tanks on the New York Polo Ground, shouting: ``They're red
hot! Get your dachshund sausages while they are red hot!''
</P>
<P>
   And they wonder how rumors get started?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, a cartoonist sketched the vendors selling their sausages
and since he didn't know how to spell dachshund, he simply wrote
beneath his sketch, ``Hot Dog!''
</P>
<P>
   There is an etiquette to eating hot dogs, the council explains.
You should never put toppings between the hot dog and the bun.
Always ``dress the dog,'' not the bun.
</P>
<P>
   Never, never use cloth napkins; always paper. Paper plates are
best as well. Don't take more than five bites to finish a hot dog.
For a foot-long wiener, seven is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been invited to a hot dog cookout, never bring wine,
don't put ketchup on your dog if you're older than 18, and for
crying out loud, don't send a thank you note.
</P>

   CHINA-CLINTON (Shanghai) _ President Clinton, in his last
address to a mass audience in China, said Wednesday that he would
continue to speak out on behalf of democracy and individual
liberty, but that the United States did not seek to dictate to
China the path of its development. In an interview with China's
main government-run television network, Clinton said that China's
current course of economic liberalization and greater personal
freedom is ``morally right,'' and that the status of the United
States as the world's lone superpower did not give it the right to
use its economic and military right to impose its values on China
or any other nation. The interview with China Central Television is
to be broadcast on Thursday. By John M. Broder.

   IRAN-KHATAMI (Tehran, Iran) _ President Mohammed Khatami of Iran
Wednesday lauded the Clinton administration for softening its
rhetoric toward his country, but added that a concrete change in
American policy toward Iran was necessary. Until now, Khatami had
made no public comment either on a speech by Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright last month in which she called on Iran to
help create a ``road map'' to normal relations between the two
countries or on the conciliatory words by President Clinton that
followed. By Elaine Sciolino.

   GAMBLING-ELDERLY (Cedar Rapids, Iowa) For Milford Hartz, the
adrenaline started to flow right about the time that the
teal-colored deluxe motor coach bus pulled into the parking lot in
front of the Wal-Mart store, located right behind the Royal Fork
Buffet restaurant. It was 8:30 a.m. and the bus was soon loaded
with over 30 elderly adults, most of whom had spent a lifetime of
early morning hours toiling on the surrounding farms and in nearby
factories. With hundreds of casinos scattered throughout 26 states,
and a growing population of seniors looking for places where they
can socialize, find companionship and be a part of something that
is lively and new, casino gambling has become a favorite pastime
for older Americans. By Brett Pulley.

   ALA-ELECT-ASSESS (Montgomery, Ala.) _ As a battle for the soul
of Southern Republicanism, the Alabama primary that Gov. Fob James
Jr. won so convincingly on Tuesday reinforced a number of political
truths about the party and the region. Religious conservatives
still wield immense influence. Strong stands against taxes still
sell. Race still matters. And even as Southerners take a leading
role in national politics, they still resent federal intrusion.

Smurfit Corp., which makes the ingredients of corrugated shipping
boxes, shut a big mill in Jacksonville, Fla., for 40 days because
of slumping exports to Asia. The production slowdown may help
explain why the Federal Reserve chose yesterday at its latest
policy meeting to leave interest unchanged, although labor
shortages and robust economic growth in recent months have
suggested in some quarters that the Fed should raise rates to slow
the economy and prevent a higher inflation rate. By Louis
Uchitelle.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Laurie Miller said goodbye to the narrow house
on Quincy Street, there was still a pull chain attached to the
wooden toilet tank up near the ceiling. There was still a claw foot
bathtub. The boiler didn't always work.
</P>
<P>
   It was home, though, and had been since she was 10 years old,
when she often ran the five blocks to the previous owner's house
with the mortgage payments, grabbing a hastily drawn receipt for
the cash her mother had handed her.
</P>
<P>
   But her mother, a nurse, had died of cervical cancer at 51, and
the house, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, was
foreclosed upon. Laurie Miller and her siblings, all in their early
20s, had to move out. That was in 1981. ``We just kind of went our
separate ways,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, that would have been the end of it. The old row
house would have been bought, sold and maybe bought again, its
fortunes dependent on the whims of strangers. But Ms. Miller is no
ordinary woman. And for close to two decades, in her travels around
the city, she kept her eye on Quincy Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mom died, I had had my own daughter, and she was,
like, 2 years old,'' said Ms. Miller, who is now 37. ``I went on
public assistance, and I found a cheap apartment out in East
Flatbush near my cousin. Then I was just apartment hunting every
year to find a new place.
</P>
<P>
   ``On May 13, 1985 _ they called and told me on Mother's Day _ I
was laid off my job as a veterinary assistant,'' she said.
``There's been a lot of ups and downs,'' she concluded, her voice
trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, while visiting childhood friends, Ms. Miller
learned that there were vacant apartments in a city-owned building
on the same block of Quincy Street where her mother's old house
was, between Nostrand and Marcy Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I squatted in a back apartment in that building,'' she said.
When the housing department found out, they ordered her out. But
Ms. Miller visited the city officials and wound up renting the
apartment for $227 a month. She ended up staying there 12 years,
giving birth to a son, Anderson, who is now 7. Her daughter, Adina,
is about to turn 19.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Miller's fortunes improved, she watched her mother's
little beige and chocolate-brown house, hoping she could someday
get it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the changes it was going through,'' she recalled. ``When
the original owner passed away, the house was taken by the city. A
lot of drugs were brought to the block and then sold out of the
house. There were fires, negative stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the building was stoppered with cinder blocks. Three
years later, Ms. Miller got up the courage to start asking
questions. Eventually, she tracked down an office of the New York
City Department of Housing Preservation and Development; workers
there told her to call the Enterprise Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Enterprise is a nonprofit group that buys derelict houses from
the city, then selects architects and contractors to fix them up
and, eventually, sells them. The money for construction comes from
a consortium of banks that lends in distressed areas. The
difference between the development costs and the market value of
the house is picked up by the city. The new owner moves into a
totally rehabilitated home, with unglamorous but workable kitchens
and tiled baths. The program is called City Homes.
</P>
<P>
   The group told Ms. Miller that, yes, the Quincy Street house was
scheduled for reconstruction but that the project wouldn't get off
the ground until the next year. To her dismay, they merely took her
name and told her they'd be in touch. She didn't expect much.
</P>
<P>
   A year later almost to the day, they sent her an application.
``I sent them a $50 money order, the application fee, and I
waited,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, City Homes houses _ because they include a
Sheetrock-to-the-rafters renovation _ are in great demand. In a
lottery to choose buyers for 21 houses, Ms. Miller drew No. 22.
Others opted out, though, or were disqualified after credit checks.
When her own credit was checked, there were student-loan payments
outstanding, and an old gas bill. She paid them off.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, she signed a contract to buy the house. That was
when her long-lost father showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad called and wanted to move in with me in the place down
the block,'' she said. ``He was elderly. He'd retired from the
Transit Authority and had moved to Florida. I made the living room
into a bedroom, and he moved in with us.''
</P>
<P>
   He was doing all right, Ms. Miller said, ``but then he died, and
he didn't have any money.'' Mr. Miller, it turned out, was a
frequent patron of the Offtrack Betting office. ``I mean, I knew,''
Ms. Miller said, noting that he bet only his own money.
</P>
<P>
   But the funeral cost $5,000, and there went her down payment for
the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had followed that house,'' she said, rocking side to side,
remembering how tough things looked back then. ``I saw it when it
was gutted, the roof to the basement. I saw when they brought the
new beams in. I saw when they put in the staircase and the room
dividers. I saw it come together.''
</P>
<P>
   She was desolate. She called the City Homes directors to
persuade them to give her time to save the money she needed. After
all, she pointed out, she had a good job now: a branch manager for
New York City Partnership, another nonprofit housing program. She
was also working toward her college degree.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the City Homes directors agreed to stop work on the
Quincy Street house and turn their efforts to the 20 other houses
they were rehabilitating. This March, she bought the house _ and
brought her pastor over to bless it.
</P>
<P>
   On an early summer's day, the block is full of friends, old and
new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Will,'' she called, as she ran out of the house to move
her big red '78 Chevrolet sedan. ``Taking the day off?'' She
chuckled and jumped into the car. (``It's sturdy and it runs,'' she
said.)
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the house, Ms. Miller conducted a tour of the six
rooms she and her family live in: the first-floor living room and
kitchen; the second-floor front bedroom for her daughter and a
family room with a sports-bar-size television, and the top floor
for her and her son.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The City Homes program allows low- and moderate-income men and
women to buy row houses in neighborhoods all over the city. It
starts with an abandoned house that has been taken over by the
city, usually for nonpayment of taxes. The house is bought for $1
by a local subsidiary of the Enterprise Foundation, a national
nonprofit housing group. Enterprise, with backing from banks and
the city, renovates the house, then oversees the choice of a new
owner. The owner pays the market value of the house; the city picks
up any extra renovation costs.
</P>
<P>
   LOCATIONS : Hundreds of houses are scheduled for renovation in
East Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan; in Morrisania and
Crotona Park in the South Bronx, and in Bedford-Stuyvesant,
Saratoga Square, East New York, Oceanhill-Brownsville and Bushwick
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   INCOME LIMITS : An applicant's combined household income cannot
be more than $70,900 a year, before taxes.
</P>
<P>
   MORTGAGES : Participating banks offer below-market interest
rates. For more information: (212) 262-9575, ext. 23.

IN A SITCOM FOR ITS TIME, TEEN-AGERS KNEW BEST  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5)
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering the general flood of television programming, it's
startling to realize that at the height of its popularity in the
1980s, ``Family Ties'' ranked as one of the most-watched shows not
just of the moment but in the history of television.
</P>
<P>
   Watching four episodes just released on videocassette by
Columbia House, one might wonder why, but there is no doubt how
well a top sitcom can serve its era before passing on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Ties,'' which ran until 1989 and then disappeared as if
on cue, was perfectly geared to its decade. When the show began in
1982, Ronald Reagan had been in office for almost two years and the
country was turning sharply conservative, getting down to raging
materialism and becoming acquainted with a species called the
yuppie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Ties,'' in fact, went on to become Reagan's favorite
show. As written by Gary David Goldberg, its creator and producer,
the story involved two hippie refugees from the '60s, Elyse and
Steve Keaton (Meredith Baxter-Birney and Michael Gross), and their
three children, who were quintessentially of the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Most famously, of course, there was one Alex Keaton, a
baby-faced half-pint of a 17-year-old with a political rudder stuck
hard right and greed that flowed like sap. In perhaps the decade's
most fortunate bit of casting, Alex was portrayed by Michael J.
Fox, a young man of angelic looks and the beautifully realized
manner of a middle-aged country-club board member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think he was switched at birth and the Rockefellers
have our kid?'' Steve asks Elyse in the pilot, by far the strongest
episode on the cassette. Not to overstate the case, but Fox, star
of ``Spin City,'' Goldberg's current comedy, was the major reason
for the show's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   In its concerns with parental authority, teen-age insecurities
and the like, ``Family Ties'' had all the familiar ingredients. But
as it evolved, the show took the family sitcom on a radical course
correction.
</P>
<P>
   For laughs there were topical chuckle points: The Wall Street
Journal alarmingly turning up under Alex's bed, the pop wine quiz
at dinner. Deeper things were going on, however. Suddenly in the
person of Alex, and to a lesser extent his siblings, the balance of
power shifted from omnipotent parents of sitcoms past to bright,
more mature offspring who stood up for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Family Ties,'' in fact, it often seemed that the children
had taken control from Elyse and Steve, who in the permissive
traditions of their own era restrained themselves from cracking
down the way parents had back in the sitcom days when Father knew
best. On ``Family Ties'' the children loved and honored their
parents in most of the ways Americans want to see in family shows.
But childhood was never the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, I need to talk to you,'' Alex sternly tells his father
after the elder Keaton has let his emotions and '60s sensibilities
get away from him. Storming a country club in protest over its
racist membership policies, Steve accosts Alex (bunny-hopping on
the dance floor with the blond and elitist Kimberly Blanton), vents
some spleen and tries to drag his son away.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, Alex, embarrassed and furious, makes no bones about
his displeasure at what he considers the childish actions of his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, I'm 17,'' he says. ``When I see Kimberly Blanton in a
strapless gown, I don't look past her for the Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve sheepishly explains himself, or tries to, and apologizes.
In a little episode wrap-up, father and son reconcile. ``We're both
getting older,'' Steve says. ``One of us is bound to grow up sooner
or later.'' Better get working on it, Steve. &QL;

kebabs of the Middle East, which begot the jerk of Jamaica, which
begot the brisket of Texas. It's all one big old barbecue belt. And

SUMMERING AGAIN AT HOTEL MOM AND DAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBORAH SOLOMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm thinking of renting a summer house. Actually, I've been
thinking of renting a summer house for about 20 years now, and I
can't say that I have made enormous progress. The problem is that
every time I say to myself, ``You must rent a summer house this
year,'' my palms grow sweaty and I am overcome with a desire to lie
down.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains why I happen to spend my summer weekends
at Hotel Mom and Dad. Here's a place that is so exclusive it's not
listed in any guidebook and only I can get in. On weekends I ride
from Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal up to the suburbs, to
Scarsdale, N.Y., where my parents live in a white-shingled house
that I've come to think of as my country place _ my home not far
enough away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the joys of summer! Swimming, sunning, barbecues . . .
regression.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is the season when I rediscover my vanished adolescence,
a delicate and complicated process requiring me to lie on a lounge
chair on my parents' patio and feign deafness as they recount the
times I used their Jeep and forgot to pull down the garage door. My
parents harbor a morbid fear of strangers seeing into their garage.
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness, who could blame them for feeling overextended?
I arrive accompanied by my own brood: my husband and two young
sons, whose idea of a summer sport consists of consuming
frozen-yogurt pops at 30-minute intervals and dripping them on the
kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   My mother is a stylish, dark-haired woman _ in my youth I
secretly believed she was Jackie Kennedy, slipping off to the White
House after dropping me at school _ but these days she seems a
little frazzled. On weekends, she mops until she drops, while my
father takes refuge in the den, sitting with the lights off and
watching the original, 1933 version of ``King Kong,'' a movie shown
on television in the area with a mysterious round-the-clock
frequency.
</P>
<P>
   How old am I? And what am I doing here? Maybe it's just a matter
of economics. It's nice to escape the city on weekends, and staying
at my parents' house is relatively cost efficient (namely, free).
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the laziness factor. It takes effort to set up
a home, and why should I bother when my parents' manse comes
equipped with a staff of two to run the household according to my
own impeccable standards? There's mom to do the laundry and lug
oversize jugs of Diet Coke home from the supermarket. There's dad
to take the Jeep to the car wash and fill up the tank.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, the social life at my parents' house is not
exactly glittering. Truth be told, the opportunities for celebrity
sightings are slim. Henry Kissinger or Donna Karan have yet to drop
by for a backyard barbecue, though I wonder if they realize how
much fun they are missing. I can't begin to count the times my
father has held us spellbound over dinner with his musings _ on
``King Kong,'' for instance.
</P>
<P>
   My mother is full of fascinating stories, all of them concerning
new strains of food-borne bacteria. First it was hamburgers. Now
it's lettuce. ``You can't wash the lettuce too carefully,'' she
likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I myself can claim to have contributed a wealth of mots
to mealtime conversations. One advantage of summering with your
parents is that you need not be on good-guest behavior. This
includes not having to prove one's skill at conversation. Astute
observations? Witty repartee? Not at our house!
</P>
<P>
   Am I proud of this situation? Hardly. On the other hand, it
gives me great comfort to know that I am by no means the only
Manhattanite over the age of 22 to summer chez mom and dad. Many of
my friends and acquaintances happen to do the same thing. This
means either that a) it's a trend or b) I deliberately form
friendships with people who summer at their parents' house because
it lessens my feelings of deviancy.
</P>
<P>
   Take my friend Daphne Merkin, an author and movie critic. She
leads a sophisticated, big-city sort of life _ film screenings,
parties and all that, not to mention those excitement-packed
weekends at her parents' place in Atlantic Beach, N.Y. As she says,
``On weekends I lie in the sun and think, `Ugh, I'm back where I
started.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the novelist Cathleen Schine, who has few rivals as
a daughter-cum-guest. The shocking truth is that she and her
children descend on her mother's house in Westport, Conn., not just
for weekends, but for the entire summer. ``It's sort of my last
stand as a child,'' she explains. ``My mother tells me to make my
bed, and when I go out she asks where I'm going. And I'm almost
50!''
</P>
<P>
   In hope of gaining some professional insight into this
situation, I contacted Carolyn Douglas, a 44-year-old psychiatrist
and associate professor at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she's a model of autonomy; she, her husband and their
children spend their weekends at her mother's place in
Bridgehampton.
</P>
<P>
   Why do people do it? ``The motivations range from strictly
practical considerations,'' she said, ``to more complex issues of
separation anxiety on the child's part _ children may have guilt
about leaving behind their parents _ or dependency issues on the
part of the parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. That's pretty Freudian. Can't one just say that summering
at one's parents' house represents a celebration of family
togetherness?
</P>
<P>
   It certainly does at our place. Thanks to my visits, my parents
have the chance to slip back to a time when they were slimmer and
brisker and their children's less attractive behavior _ tying up
the phone, smoking pot, blasting Carole King records _ led them to
wonder how they raised such Neanderthals. My weekend visits allow
my parents to relive those precious moments. It keeps them young.
</P>
<P>
   It also enables them to pretend that their eldest daughter is in
need of their guidance. Recently, for instance, I was in the
kitchen snacking on salt-free potato chips when my mother
interrupted her mopping and joined me at the table. I prepared
myself for a poignant heart-to-heart, but my mother just stared at
my nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are those new glasses?'' she wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' I said, ``I really like them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' she replied, looking pained. ``I think I like your old
glasses better.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what you get for going home: constructive or
not-so-constructive maternal criticism. But am I complaining? Not
at all.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, I suspect that somewhere deep in my freeloading
soul floats a hidden, sentimental truth, one having to do with a
desire to linger with my parents, to keep our lives forever
entwined. Who's to say where mooching leaves off and love begins?
</P>
<P>
   Or so I wondered on a recent Sunday, sitting at the patio table
as my parents busily got dinner ready. It was one of those rare,
golden, picture-perfect moments. Dad was tending to the barbecue,
his shirt drenched in a Niagara of sweat, as Mom ferried a 10-ton
tray laden with plates, wineglasses and silverware to the table.
Watching them, I was overcome with a sense of good fortune. I
decided that for once I would do the adult thing: I would thank my
parents _ my hosts par excellence _ for their years of unstinting
hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   When they sat down at the table, I gazed at them tenderly and
prepared to deliver my toast. But before I got the chance, my
mother turned to me and said, ``Your hair could use a trim.''
</P>
<P>
   My father piped in, ``Maybe she just needs to comb it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, I swear, I'm renting a summer house.

NEW TEST SHOWS CALIFORNIA STUDENTS BELOW NATIONAL AVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE and ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California public school children scored below
the national average in reading, math and science and lagged far
behind in spelling, according to results of a new statewide exam.
</P>
<P>
   Students in all grades managed to exceed national averages in
only 12 of 43 grade-and-subject combinations, according to results
released Tuesday by the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   In writing, students scored above the national average in grades
2 and 4 through 9.
</P>
<P>
   The scores, of nearly 3 million English-fluent students in
grades 2 through 11, offer the first look at student performance
since 1994 and compare most of California's students to their peers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a judge's order last week, the state was prohibited
from releasing the Statewide Testing and Reporting Program scores
of 1 million students classified as having limited English skills.
</P>
<P>
   The scores, neither utterly grim nor uplifting, confirm a
nagging perception that California _ one of the wealthiest and most
innovative states in the country _ is doing a mediocre job of
teaching its children.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson said the ``disappointing but not surprising''
scores were the byproduct of years of failed attempts at reforms,
coupled with weak policies on promoting failing students and
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 43 (grade and subject levels) reporting and only 12
reporting scores at or above the national average, that means that
more than two-thirds of California's grade-level performance is
below the national average, and that is clearly not acceptable,''
the Republican governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Delaine Eastin, the superintendent of public instruction, put a
more positive spin on the results, saying they were better than
``the doomsayers predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For those crepe hangers who thought today would be a day of
sackcloth and ashes, I would just say today is the day when we
began to move ahead in California,'' Eastin said. ``Yes, we can do
a lot better, but please give us the resources to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastin said the scores showed California schools were doing a
better job of educating children than in 1994 and 1996, when the
state's students ranked among the lowest of the low on the National
Assessment of Educational Progress, given every two years to a
sampling of students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're within striking distance'' of the national average,
Eastin said. ``Given the fact that we were dead last in NAEP when I
came to office ... that we were at the bottom in so many of the
indicators of student achievement, these results are much better
than anyone would have a right to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest areas by grade were 11th-grade social studies,
where students ranked in the 61st percentile, and in writing, where
seventh-graders ranked in the 57th percentile. In writing, students
exceeded national averages in seven of 10 grades tested.
</P>
<P>
   California students did the worst in 10th-grade reading, where
California ranked in the 36th percentile, and eighth-grade
spelling, where students were in the 38th percentile.
</P>
<P>
   On that scale, 99 is best, 1 is worst and 50 is the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Eastin said poor showing in spelling stemmed from an era in
which the state was experimenting with educational fads. The state
has adopted a more back-to-basics approach, with an emphasis on
phonics.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson signed the testing mandate into law in October 1997,
requiring that all students _ regardless of language ability _ take
the English-only exam. Students in grades 2 through 8 are tested in
reading, writing, spelling and math. Students in grades 9 through
11 are tested in reading, math, writing, science and social
sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and the state Board of Education believe the test is
useful as a benchmark for future comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson assailed legal challenges against the test brought by
school districts in Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This test is providing us with a baseline from which we can in
the future measure progress or lack of progress and make necessary
changes.''

THE MOUSE PADS IN ON LITTLE ROUND FEET

<P>
   MOUSE-PAD HUNT
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Web sites for collectibles, the one that makes the
most sense is Adriaan van der Hek's First Virtual Mouse Pad Museum
(www.expa.hvu.nl/ajvdhek).
</P>
<P>
   Hey, they're more practical to hoard than keyboards, monitors or
motherboards.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Utrecht, the Netherlands, van der Hek created the
site after scarfing up 45 free mouse pads at a trade show. On a
friend's suggestion, he first used them as wallpaper, but he found
them more practical as collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people from all over the world send me mouse pads or
make virtual donations'' via a scanned image, said van der Hek, who
has received more than 400 pads from France, Japan, Germany, Spain,
the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Hek's site includes a gallery of his collection,
documentation of the first patented mouse pad and a look at what he
calls the best mouse pad.

<P>
   If copycat cook Todd Wilbur were to order at Al Yeganeh's Soup
Kitchen International in Manhattan, he'd likely get the dreaded
``NO SOUP FOR YOU!''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur, author of several books that duplicate brand-name
recipes, has apparently cracked the soup recipes made by Yeganeh,
the New York restaurateur who was immortalized on ``Seinfeld'' as
the ``Soup Nazi.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wilbur's Top Secret Recipes site (www.topsecretrecipes.com),

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask fitness buffs how they know just how hard to push it, and
you're likely to hear about the doneburn in the muscles or the
feeling of being spent. Rebecca Ray will furnish you a flow chart
full of numbers and optimal training zones.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Ms. Ray, 31, was 30 pounds overweight and at a
crossroads. In an effort to lose weight, she started working out at
the San Francisco YMCA's Embarcadero health club up to five times a
week, but she found little success and thought she was wasting her
time.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Ms. Ray says, she started working with a wireless heart
monitor, and earlier this month she competed in Northern
California's Vineman Triathlon, her fifth such event.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ray, a graduate student in research psychology at San
Francisco State University, has also dropped 20 pounds. She learned
how to use a heart-rate monitor from Mischa Kubancik, a trainer at
the YMCA, and she subsequently joined a triathlon training squad
coached by Ms. Kubancik.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ray says one of her greatest problems in getting fit was her
inability to regulate herself. ``Some people might know their
bodies well, but I don't,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Heart-rate monitors are an increasingly popular tool and a part
of a nationwide boom in fitness-equipment sales, which reached $3
billion last year. In 1998 heart-rate monitor sales in the United
States will top $40 million, up 15 percent from 1997, says Corey
Cornacchio, director of marketing at Polar Electro, a company that
claims 80 percent of the worldwide market.
</P>
<P>
   These monitors are a step up from simple wrist or finger pulse
meters. They use a transmitter equipped with electrodes strapped to
the chest to record the heart's electrical impulses and radio
precise measurements of the heart rate to a receiver worn on the
wrist. Using this basic information _ how many times a heart beats
each minute _ trainers or exercisers themselves can structure
productive routines and workouts.
</P>
<P>
   For someone like Ms. Ray, this means that she can train in
various heart-rate zones to achieve various results, like improving
cardiovascular fitness, strengthening, increasing endurance or
losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing to regulate, and the most powerful way to
improve fitness, is intensity,'' says Dr. Carl Foster, director of
clinical physiology at the Milwaukee Heart Institute and director
of sport science for United States Speedskating, the national
governing body for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Heart-rate monitors provide feedback about what is really
happening to an exercise participant; consequently there is less
chance that a workout will be too easy or too hard _ what some call
junk workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Heart-rate monitors are the best means to proper exercise,
according to a growing number of exercise physiologists, coaches
and personal trainers. Perhaps the most ardent supporter is Sally
Edwards, a 15-time Ironman triathlon competitor who first began
using the device in 1984 during Olympic running trials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards calls the monitors ``windows to the heart'' that can
unite mind and body. She says they are being used in stress
management, psychotherapy and cardiac rehabilitation, as well as
sports.
</P>
<P>
   But most people who use the monitors are recreational athletes,
people who might be training for a first marathon. This is a group
that Foster calls ``aging yuppies who have resources, are
technologically literate and like to do things that they can do
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The monitors range from basic models that simply provide a
continuous readout to more complex mechanisms that store times
spent in various zones and can download data to a PC.
</P>
<P>
   To use the monitor effectively you have to spend some time
understanding the features and commands and then learning how to
interpret data and alter behavior. But with a little work and some
patience you can use a monitor to remake yourself into a living
science experiment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to the American College of Sports Medicine, the heart
rate training zone is calculated by subtracting your age from 220
to find a maximum heart rate. Moderate-intensity training is done
at 60 percent to 80 percent of this maximum figure. For example, if
you are healthy and 35 years old, your training zone is between 111
and 148 beats per minute.
</P>
<P>
   But this way of calculating maximum heart rate is seen by many
in the field as imperfect. Foster says these rates are rough
estimates, not exact for all people or all sports. Many experts
recommend consulting a doctor before undertaking any new exercise
regimen. Also, determining which zones to train in depends on your
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless heart-rate monitor was developed in 1983 by Seppo
Saynajakangas, a Finnish researcher who recognized the importance
of measuring heart rate during exercise. He had started Polar
Electro in Finland in 1977, in an effort to improve the standard
pulse measurement done with the fingertips and to create an
ambulatory device. In 1986 Polar introduced its first consumer
device.
</P>
<P>
   The price of a heart-rate monitor has dropped from a high of
$500 to $59 for basic models, and the user base has swelled as a
result. According to Polar, there are over three million of the
monitors in use in the United States. Health clubs and gyms are
increasingly using them to train members.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kevin Steele, the vice president of health services
and education at the 180-club, 1.5-million-member 24 Hour Fitness
clubs, about 40 percent of the clubs' members use heart-rate
monitoring, both transmitters and devices that are built into
exercise equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Jackson, a head trainer at a San Francisco Bay area Club
One gym, designated last May as healthy heart month. During the
month more than 100 members began to use heart-rate monitors and
recorded the time they spent in their target training zones.
Jackson says a monitor helps him assess how hard a member is
working. ``It is much clearer than perceived exertion,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And many people who use heart-rate monitors gain a new level of
self understanding. ``Some people need to feel totally spent at the
end of the workout, as if they were hit by a bus,'' says Ms.
Kubancik, the YMCA trainer. ``That is not the best way to use
fitness.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a Heart Rate Monitor &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are four levels of heart-rate monitors, according to Sally
Edwards, an author and 15-time Ironman triathlon competitor. The
simplest models, which cost less than $100, are the easiest to
operate. They display only the heart rate in beats per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Devices at the next level, which cost up to $120, include time
functions and can also be programmed to note specific target zones
and beep when a user falls out of the zone. At the third level, as
much as $200, monitors include a memory function and can provide
extensive feedback, like average heart rate and time spent in,
above and below a target zone.
</P>
<P>
   Some models can calculate calories burned. The fourth-level
models, above $200, allow data to be transferred to a PC, where the
information can be analyzed and stored. Software and interfaces are
sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   The following mid-range heart-rate monitors have basic watch
functions and include a chest transmitter and a wrist receiver.
</P>
<P>
   FREESTYLE CIRCUIT 5 By Sports Instruments, $149. This has a
light and memory, and can register upper and lower ranges. The
display is easy to read and the buttons are large. Information:
(800) 949-1563.
</P>
<P>
   POLAR SMART EDGE Polar Electro, $199. This model includes a
calorie-counting function in addition to upper- and lower-limit
alarms and extensive memory functions. (800) 227-1314.
</P>
<P>
   SENSOR DYNAMICS PRO SPORT 2 $119. Has target zone settings with
audio and visual alarms and dual display. (800) 764-4327.
</P>
<P>
   PRECISE ACUMEN 330 Precise International, $159. Includes target
heart rate memory functions. (800) 431-2996.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Two Amish guys were arrested for buying and selling cocaine.
The arresting officers read them their rights: Thou hast the right
to remain silent...'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Police became suspicious of these two guys because they were
driving around Amish country in a $75,000 buggy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of Amish guys are busted for buying and selling
cocaine. And you say to yourself, what is the world coming to? The
officers became suspicious because these guys were charging $4,000
a slice for their shoe-fly pie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something wacky is going on in that part of the country,
because earlier today, out there in Lancaster, Pa., Robert Downey
Jr. woke up in an Amish barn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday of course was the summer solstice -- that's the
longest day of the year, especially if you're an American soccer
team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big game in the World Cup between the United
States and Iran, and Iran won the big contest 2-to-1...It's very
exciting to be in Iran right now. They went crazy. Yesterday,
people were up all night partying at the big, very popular
nightclub there, Planet Khomeini.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That Iranian soccer team is so good, they're talking about
moving it to New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday (in World Cup soccer), Brazil was defeated by Norway
2-to-1. Well, there's $10,000 I'll never see again!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear about the newly released tapes from Monica
Lewinsky? Monica Lewinsky now says that she was very upset because
she only got to see President Clinton the last time for 60
seconds...Well, yeah, fine, but in his defense, he had 12 other
interns to see that day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you excited about President Clinton going to China?...He's
very nervous about the trip, he's very, very, very apprehensive,
because the last time he traveled overseas, I believe the baggage
handlers lost an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton took off at about noon today. That's a long trip,
that's an 18-hour flight...Roughly, he's been in the air about 12
hours now, so I guess he should be just about on his third flight
attendant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton lands over there in China, gets off Air
Force One. Kind of a touching ceremony -- a little girl comes out
to meet him and hands him a bouquet of flowers and a subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is in China now and he says maybe now he can
meet with political prisoners. If you think about it, the last time

when was the last time he talked to Susan McDougal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is over there in China. He's got an
arrangement, he's got a deal with the head of China, Jiang Zemin.

   ``Are you folks aware of the fact that we're, this summer, we're
celebrating the centennial of the great city of New York?...The
city is going all out to celebrate itself...In Central Park, they

tonight they're planning a parade of 50 topless dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, two dozen lawyers get together at the Drake Hotel
over there on Park Avenue, and they're having some kind of big
lawyer luncheon. And they had the food catered in and they got
sick...Two dozen attorneys came down with food poisoning and had to
be taken to the hospital. Gosh, I wonder if they have any plans to

   &UR; TV going down a blind 'Ally' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Charles Memminger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I was watching `Ally McBeal,` the quirky television show about a
ditzy lawyer and the dysfunctional law firm that employs her, when
I suddenly broke the code as to what is powering TV programming
these days.
</P>
<P>
   If you like Ally McBeal, you might not want to read further
because once I tell you the secret to that show's success, it just
might ruin it for you. And it's not the computerized dancing baby.
As strange as this might sound, to understand why `Ally McBeal` is
a success, you have to look at `South Park.`
</P>
<P>
   If you've been living in a cave (or under Beavis and Butthead's
couch) for the past year, `South Park` is the shockingly vulgar
`cartoon` where kids say the darndest things. In fact, if `South
Park` kids were on Art Linkletter's `Kids Say The Darndest Things`
show, Art would have committed the darndest homicides. Art would
have, in fact, killed Kenny, the little `South Park` chap who
actually does get killed on every episode. AND as shocking as
having a kid knocked off weekly may seem, that has become one of
the tamer parts of `South Park.` They do and say things on `South
Park` that I would be fired for if I put them in this column.
(Editors have the darndest hang-ups.)
</P>
<P>
   In short, the kids on `South Park` make Beavis and Butthead look
like the spawn of Ozzie and Harriet. While Beavis and Butthead may
have set the profane tone for future adult-themed `cartoons,`
`South Park` has claimed the far ground of tastelessness, busting
societal taboos faster than you, well, faster than you can come up
with new taboos. Without being too graphic, I think I can safely
say that the only taboos left for `South Park` are necrophilia and
cannibalism. I'm not a regular watcher of `South Park,` so they
might have already zoomed right past those subjects and gone to
Kenny-knows-where.
</P>
<P>
   What does `South Park` have to do with `Ally McBeal,` a show
full of grown-ups trying to cope with the rigors of professional
life, sex and large Latin phrases? Everything See, aside from the
adult situations that are addressed on `Ally,` all the characters
actually are written as if they are children. The writers simply
think of each character as being about 5 or 6 years old and write
their lines and reactions accordingly. The characters are actually
legal rugrats practicing sandbox law.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, in one episode, when a guy Ally likes says he never
kisses girls on the first date, Ally says she always kisses
everyone on the first date. Then they can get right to the breaking
up. How many times have you seen some kid in a sandbox trying to
kiss all the girls (or boys.) This leads to the `Ally` characters'
peculiar innocence.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the cardboard cut-out kids of `South Park`
talk and act like adults. But because they are cartoons, they get
away with it. If any of the adults on `Ally McBeal` said half the
things the kids say on `South Park,` they'd be jailed.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the secret to programming these days. You have
cartoons like `South Park,` `Rugrats` and `Beavis and Butthead,`
where the kids talk like adults. And you have adult dramas where
the characters are actually children.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure where all this is going to lead. `South Park` has
got to hit the ultimate taboo wall eventually. And `Ally` viewers
are going to wise up to the trick behind the clever writing. As it
is, Ally does everything but say `goo-goo, gah-gah` when faced with
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect because of the circular nature of TV programming,
we'll soon be back to prime time game shows and talking horses. I
just hope Mr. Ed doesn't feel compelled to kill Wilbur each week.

adult situations that are addressed on `Ally,` all the characters
actually are written as if they are children. The writers simply
think of each character as being about 5 or 6 years old and write
their lines and reactions accordingly. The characters are actually
legal rugrats practicing sandbox law.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, in one episode, when a guy Ally likes says he never
kisses girls on the first date, Ally says she always kisses
everyone on the first date. Then they can get right to the breaking
up. How many times have you seen some kid in a sandbox trying to
kiss all the girls (or boys.) This leads to the `Ally` characters'
peculiar innocence.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the cardboard cut-out kids of `South Park`
talk and act like adults. But because they are cartoons, they get
away with it. If any of the adults on `Ally McBeal` said half the
things the kids say on `South Park,` they'd be jailed.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the secret to programming these days. You have
cartoons like `South Park,` `Rugrats` and `Beavis and Butthead,`
where the kids talk like adults. And you have adult dramas where
the characters are actually children.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure where all this is going to lead. `South Park` has
got to hit the ultimate taboo wall eventually. And `Ally` viewers
are going to wise up to the trick behind the clever writing. As it
is, Ally does everything but say `goo-goo, gah-gah` when faced with
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect because of the circular nature of TV programming,
we'll soon be back to prime time game shows and talking horses. I
just hope Mr. Ed doesn't feel compelled to kill Wilbur each week.

to remain silent...'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Police became suspicious of these two guys because they were
driving around Amish country in a $75,000 buggy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of Amish guys are busted for buying and selling
cocaine. And you say to yourself, what is the world coming to? The
officers became suspicious because these guys were charging $4,000
a slice for their shoe-fly pie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something wacky is going on in that part of the country,
because earlier today, out there in Lancaster, Pa., Robert Downey
Jr. woke up in an Amish barn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday of course was the summer solstice -- that's the
longest day of the year, especially if you're an American soccer
team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big game in the World Cup between the United
States and Iran, and Iran won the big contest 2-to-1...It's very
exciting to be in Iran right now. They went crazy. Yesterday,
people were up all night partying at the big, very popular
nightclub there, Planet Khomeini.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That Iranian soccer team is so good, they're talking about
moving it to New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday (in World Cup soccer), Brazil was defeated by Norway
2-to-1. Well, there's $10,000 I'll never see again!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear about the newly released tapes from Monica
Lewinsky? Monica Lewinsky now says that she was very upset because
she only got to see President Clinton the last time for 60
seconds...Well, yeah, fine, but in his defense, he had 12 other
interns to see that day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you excited about President Clinton going to China?...He's
very nervous about the trip, he's very, very, very apprehensive,
because the last time he traveled overseas, I believe the baggage
handlers lost an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton took off at about noon today. That's a long trip,
that's an 18-hour flight...Roughly, he's been in the air about 12
hours now, so I guess he should be just about on his third flight
attendant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton lands over there in China, gets off Air
Force One. Kind of a touching ceremony -- a little girl comes out
to meet him and hands him a bouquet of flowers and a subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is in China now and he says maybe now he can
meet with political prisoners. If you think about it, the last time
I think President Clinton met with a political prisoner was --well,
when was the last time he talked to Susan McDougal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is over there in China. He's got an
arrangement, he's got a deal with the head of China, Jiang Zemin.
They have an agreement -- President Clinton will not mention

   ``Are you folks aware of the fact that we're, this summer, we're
celebrating the centennial of the great city of New York?...The
city is going all out to celebrate itself...In Central Park, they
released 100 doves. Yesterday, they had a 100-gun salute. I think
tonight they're planning a parade of 50 topless dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, two dozen lawyers get together at the Drake Hotel
over there on Park Avenue, and they're having some kind of big
lawyer luncheon. And they had the food catered in and they got
sick...Two dozen attorneys came down with food poisoning and had to
be taken to the hospital. Gosh, I wonder if they have any plans to

   &UR; TV going down a blind 'Ally' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Charles Memminger &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I was watching `Ally McBeal,` the quirky television show about a
ditzy lawyer and the dysfunctional law firm that employs her, when
I suddenly broke the code as to what is powering TV programming
these days.
</P>
<P>
   If you like Ally McBeal, you might not want to read further
because once I tell you the secret to that show's success, it just
might ruin it for you. And it's not the computerized dancing baby.
As strange as this might sound, to understand why `Ally McBeal` is
a success, you have to look at `South Park.`
</P>
<P>
   If you've been living in a cave (or under Beavis and Butthead's
couch) for the past year, `South Park` is the shockingly vulgar
`cartoon` where kids say the darndest things. In fact, if `South
Park` kids were on Art Linkletter's `Kids Say The Darndest Things`
show, Art would have committed the darndest homicides. Art would
have, in fact, killed Kenny, the little `South Park` chap who
actually does get killed on every episode. AND as shocking as
having a kid knocked off weekly may seem, that has become one of
the tamer parts of `South Park.` They do and say things on `South
Park` that I would be fired for if I put them in this column.
(Editors have the darndest hang-ups.)
</P>
<P>
   In short, the kids on `South Park` make Beavis and Butthead look
like the spawn of Ozzie and Harriet. While Beavis and Butthead may
have set the profane tone for future adult-themed `cartoons,`
`South Park` has claimed the far ground of tastelessness, busting
societal taboos faster than you, well, faster than you can come up
with new taboos. Without being too graphic, I think I can safely
say that the only taboos left for `South Park` are necrophilia and
cannibalism. I'm not a regular watcher of `South Park,` so they
might have already zoomed right past those subjects and gone to
Kenny-knows-where.
</P>
<P>
   What does `South Park` have to do with `Ally McBeal,` a show
full of grown-ups trying to cope with the rigors of professional
life, sex and large Latin phrases? Everything See, aside from the
adult situations that are addressed on `Ally,` all the characters
actually are written as if they are children. The writers simply
think of each character as being about 5 or 6 years old and write
their lines and reactions accordingly. The characters are actually
legal rugrats practicing sandbox law.
</P>

   That's why, in one episode, when a guy Ally likes says he never
kisses girls on the first date, Ally says she always kisses
everyone on the first date. Then they can get right to the breaking
up. How many times have you seen some kid in a sandbox trying to
kiss all the girls (or boys.) This leads to the `Ally` characters'

</P>
<P>

   And that's the secret to programming these days. You have

where the kids talk like adults. And you have adult dramas where
the characters are actually children.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure where all this is going to lead. `South Park` has
got to hit the ultimate taboo wall eventually. And `Ally` viewers
are going to wise up to the trick behind the clever writing. As it
is, Ally does everything but say `goo-goo, gah-gah` when faced with
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect because of the circular nature of TV programming,
we'll soon be back to prime time game shows and talking horses. I
just hope Mr. Ed doesn't feel compelled to kill Wilbur each week.

HOME CLINIC: TIPS FOR OUTDOOR WORK IN THE HEAT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer is the time when many homeowners tackle outdoor projects
like painting, masonry, roof repairs, and deck or fence
construction. While the warm temperatures and bright sunshine make
it convenient and even enjoyable for outdoor work, too much of a
good thing can be dangerous. Overexposure to the sun can result in
severe sunburn, heat exhaustion or heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Strenuous work outdoors on a hot, humid day can quickly take its
toll on the body. In addition to the heat absorbed from the sun,
muscles will generate heat as they flex. This added heat will help
raise the body's temperature even higher. Unless the excess heat
can be released in some way, the body's thermoregulation mechanism
will shut down and induce heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   You take can some precautions to protect yourself from the
hazards of heat and sun when working outdoors. First, it's
important to condition yourself to the rigors of outdoor work in
the summer sun. It takes about 15 days for the average person to
become acclimated to the hot weather. Don't launch into a long
strenuous project on the first hot, humid day of summer; start with
smaller jobs for brief periods early in the season, then work up to
larger tasks.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to wear the right clothes. It's tempting to
wear shorts and a T-shirt, but long pants and a long-sleeved shirt
will protect your arms and legs from the sun's intense rays. A
wide-brimmed hat is essential because it can protect your face and
neck from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   It can also help you in another way. The head is the body's heat
regulator. More than 50 percent of the body's heat is absorbed or
dissipated through the head. The hat can shield your head from the
sun and keep you from soaking up too much heat.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton fabrics are usually cooler than synthetics because they
allow more air to circulate between the fibers. Some synthetics,
however, have a wicking action that pulls perspiration away from
your body and keeps you cool.
</P>
<P>
   Dark fabrics block the sun's rays better than light ones, but
they also absorb more heat. So it's better to wear light-colored
clothes and apply a sunscreen (essential if you are wearing thin
fabrics because the sun can penetrate them). Apply a good sunscreen
with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher at least 30
minutes before you start working outdoors. Apply more every two
hours. Along with its skin-protection properties, sunscreen can
also cool the skin as it evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   Dehydration, the loss of body fluid, is another danger because
it can cause heat exhaustion as well as heatstroke. Heat exhaustion
starts with extreme thirst, then progresses into nausea, dizziness,
vomiting, headaches and heat cramps. If unchecked, it will lead to
heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid dehydration by drinking extra liquid, about 16 ounces, two
hours before starting work. Then continue to drink as you feel
thirsty. While water is fine, sports drinks or fruit juices are
better because they replace natural body salts and help you retain
the fluids you consume. Avoid drinking ice-cold fluids when you are
hot; they can shock the stomach muscles and cause heat cramps.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to listen to your body. Know the symptoms of heat
exhaustion and heatstroke, and be ready to quit working if they
arise. If possible, enlist help. This will make the workload
lighter, and you will be able to monitor each other for the warning
signs of heat exhaustion. Often, another person can be a better
judge of your condition than you are and can stop you before you
overwork yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule your project so you do most of the work when it is
cool. Start in the early morning and work until noon. As the day
begins to heat up, pause for a long lunch and take an additional
rest. This break will allow you to get out of the sun and cool off.
Resume in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With some jobs, like exterior painting, you may be able to work
behind the sun. Start on a side of the house that the sun has left.
Continue around behind the sun as the day progress.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all these precautions, on hot days you may have to
lower your expectations and do less work than originally planned.
You cannot accomplish as much because the body's heart rate is
elevated on a hot day, so fatigue is apt to occur sooner than you
might expect. When the temperature and humidity climb to high
levels, it may be better to put off your projects and wait for
cooler days.

RETURN TO INNOVATION IN A HOUSE THAT DARES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever happened to truly innovative houses? Houses so radical
in concept, so bold in execution and at the same time so
comfortable and appealing that they made people want to change the
way they lived?
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater (1935) was one: its rooms
flowed as smoothly into each other as the river running under the
house. The Maison de Verre, built in 1928 in Paris, revolutionized
the way people thought about using glass as a residential material.
An entire wall of glass block admitted light while maintaining
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days when houses were considered the seedbed for
architects' brave notions. In postwar America, architects focused
on mass production as the way to make better houses not just for
the wealthy but for everyone. While they were at it, they redefined
what was formal, what was informal; what was inside, what was out,
and how rooms without walls could reflect a more casual living
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   These days, new houses in America seem to be more about size
than innovation. Architects save their inspiration for museums,
libraries and performing arts centers. (Even Frank Gehry, who used
unheard-of materials like chain link in his own Los Angeles home in
1978, has eschewed houses in favor of designing cultural
institutions.) As a result, developers are the ones who decide how
everyone should live, and how many Palladian windows to install.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to see how house-making could be different with
Margaret Nomentana's place in Maine, designed by Scogin, Elam &AMP;
Bray of Atlanta. Part Zermatt, part ``Three Little Bears,'' this
3,600-square-foot house only looks as if it zoomed in from another
dimension. It is a direct descendant of the houses that cast off
tradition only to make a richer experience of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house is the great experiment in American architecture,''
said Mack Scogin, an architect and former chairman of the
architecture department at Harvard University's Graduate School of
Design, who designed the house with his partner and wife, Merrill
Elam. ``Not just because it represents the great American dream of
owning your own house and individualizing it, but because the
reality is so achievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nomentana's fantasy was simple: to build a house on a lake
carved out of nature just for her and her three dogs. And it should
have an edge as abstract as the contemporary artwork she admires.
``My parents had commissioned a house back in the '50s in the days
when people thought architecture could solve all the problems in
the world,'' she said. ``My parents bought into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like them, she wanted a house that dared to be different. Unlike
them, she didn't expect it to solve the problems of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nomentana, 53, is a petite dynamo of a woman (just back from
kayaking off the coast of Turkey), a trained interior designer and
a painter who likes her canvases to be at least twice as tall as
she is.
</P>
<P>
   Her architects did not present her with an abstract sculpture
spun out of their own intellectual interests, the kind of
avant-garde derring-do that people have good reason to dread.
That's not Scogin and Elam's design style.
</P>
<P>
   The drama and excitement in their work is generated by the
belief that the personal experience of home _ the owner's
ambitions, as well as her daily chores _ ought to dictate the
design.
</P>
<P>
   From the materials used in the house to the way the layout
accommodated her dogs, the architects strove to let their client's
ideas guide their hand. When Ms. Nomentana told them of her
interest in the minimal beauty of Japanese architecture,
specifically the work of Tadao Ando, they chose a cement-based
fiberboard (a common, highly durable siding material usually
disguised to look like clapboard) that would imitate the look _ but
not the cost _ of Ando's concrete houses. The window frames are
wood, but painted black to have the more abstract look of steel.
</P>
<P>
   When their client told them that the dogs needed space, they
designed a room and positioned it across from her bedroom because
they knew where the dogs really slept. ``The last thing we wanted
to do was to put Margaret in a box,'' Ms. Elam said. ``The house we
did is the opposite of what you'd expect from a house on the lake
with a big room and a plate-glass window looking out at the view.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking through Ms. Nomentana's house _ built on girder-stilts
that anchor the house to its steep slope going down to the lake _
is an exploration turned revelation. Touring the house is like
scaling some unfamiliar peak. On a first visit, leaving crumbs
seems advisable.
</P>
<P>
   A short arc of bridge springs from a black metal walk to the
pre-weathered zinc door. The bridge handrail looks as elegantly
telegraphic as Japanese script. Once through the door, visitors
stand inside a three-story cube, walls lined with books. It's the
library, and there's a staircase at its center that winds around a
glass-enclosed outdoor well, a shaft of nature, which the
architects call the impluvium.
</P>
<P>
   At top it opens to the sky, and at bottom it's filled with
smooth rocks. To get anywhere, it's necessary to circumnavigate the
impluvium, but there are no clues as to which way will take you
where you're going.
</P>
<P>
   The experience is disorienting, and thrilling. Toto, we're not
in Maine anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Scogin said that visitors are supposed to feel a sense of
traveling through and discovering new places _ not arriving at a
specific room. ``All the spaces are equally privileged, and every
one of them has something of interest to offer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even the main hall, a kind of spine, is busy with things
to look at: views of the lake and other parts of the house through
slots of windows; a perilous suspended bridge overhead; paths to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   In one direction is the kitchen, dining room, eating porch and
living room, which at 350 square feet feels small, even
coccoonlike, due to a massive fireplace and a grouping of
caterpillar-ribbed orange furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret specified that she didn't want it to be particularly
large,'' Ms. Elam said. ``She just wanted lots of glass.'' Two
solid walls are nothing but.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the living room's intimacy, a porch explodes,
releasing you into nature. Its exuberant design sheers off part of
a support wall, veering off at a vertiginous angle. (The sheered
wall was the result of a builder's mathematical error, which
created a gap that everyone liked so much that they kept it.)

</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the house, the main corridor makes a sharp
left, tracks up a few stairs _ past an office alcove _ and ascends
a few more steps to a private wing.
</P>
<P>
   Within this part of the house is Ms. Nomentana's bedroom with a
massive fireplace, her private sleeping porch (``I'm a bed
person,'' she said. ``I could spend all day in bed reading.'') and
a separate room for her Champagne-colored poodles: Avalon,
Glastonbury and Cornwall, with a doggy door and ramp to their yard.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, the guest bedroom is larger than the master suite. To
get to Ms. Nomentana's studio, one must climb a tower, traversing
the suspended bridge over the main corridor, with a sheer drop to
each side.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nomentana bought the 2.8-acre plot of Maine forest (a
two-hour drive west of Portland) when it was under four feet of
snow. (``That's really hard for a Southerner to understand,'' Ms.
Elam said.) Ms. Nomentana was determined to move from Los Angeles
after the earthquake of 1994. She chose Maine because that's where
she had spent childhood summers.
</P>
<P>
   From the start her architects were aware that a person alone in
the woods might feel lonely. No other house is within view _ even
in winter. So, they gave the sprawling house a companionable
feeling ``like a village,'' Ms. Elam said, ``so that when she
looked out the window, she'd always be looking at another part of
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort it takes to negotiate the place is its most exciting
innovation. Unlike most modern houses, key rooms are strung out far
from each other to make travel time through the house as prolonged,
even complicated, as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margaret was clear about wanting to be challenged,'' Scogin
said. He laments that modern conveniences have sapped the vitality
from many houses, making them too easy, too boring, to inhabit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nomentana _ who as an adult took her last name from the Via
Nomentana in Rome _ wanted surprises. When the floor plan showed a
kitchen nowhere near the garage (making grocery-portage a long
haul), she never blinked.
</P>
<P>
   This is a difficult house to understand at a glance. The house
as journey of discovery defies the Kodak moment. It becomes
familiar only with time, like a person with depth, and there are
always a few secrets in reserve. More important, it shows that the
American tradition of reinventing how to live is still a vital
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process was so much fun, I'd do another house in a
second,'' Ms. Nomentana said. ``Except that there's no reason to
ever move again.'' &QL;

SCARLETT AND FRIENDS GO ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frankly, my dear, the ``Gone With the Wind'' online exhibit is
darn good.
</P>
<P>
   Other than an address
(www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/HRC/HRHRC/DOS/GWTW/GWTW.html) that's as
long as the movie is epic, the online exhibit is an entertaining
visit while the 1939 film is in its remastered re-release.
</P>
<P>
   The ``GWTW'' online exhibit was launched in October by the Harry
Ransom Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas at
Austin, using resources from the David O. Selznick Archive.
Selznick produced the movie.
</P>
<P>
   By tapping into Selznick's archive, site creator Steve Wilson
was able to post video of screen tests, transcriptions of memos and
letters, and dozens of photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit is divided into three sections: The Search for
Scarlett, Costumes and Makeup, and The Book Purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlett section uses multimedia to detail how Selznick and
his staff cast Scarlett. Included are photographs of many of the
top contenders and videos from the screen tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Costumes and Makeup section includes video of the famous
Curtain Dress, the outfit Scarlett made from the green velvet
curtains of her Tara plantation.
</P>
<P>
   The Book Purchase section displays memos, telegrams, teletypes
and letters that tell the story of how Selznick and Katherine
Brown, his New York story editor, acquired the film rights to
Margaret Mitchell's novel.
</P>
<P>
   Selznick's archives are also available online. Materials gleaned
from documents in more than 5,000 boxes from the center chronicle
Selznick's career from 1916 to 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Future sections have been considered, but no plans have been
made, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a lot to do in the future,'' he said. _ Tommy

DIGITAL BREAD CRUMBS THROUGH THE FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a long time, I thought that it was my fault that I could
never find the information I wanted on the Web. My search method _
typing one or two words hastily into a query box _ rarely yielded
worthwhile results.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine my relief to learn that my approach is typical. A
recently published study of 1 million queries conducted in a single
day in 1997 on the Excite search site found that only one in nine
users embrace the nuances of Boolean logic to concoct sophisticated
queries. The rest of us ``are basically entering one or two search
terms in the query box,'' said Amanda Spink, one of the study's
authors and an assistant professor in the School of Library and
Information Sciences at the University of North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no evidence that users can be persuaded to
change, search sites have begun to mold their tools to fit our
habits. The challenge is to improve the search results even if
users do not improve their search techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The Excite search site has been the most innovative so far,
taking the first steps toward what Chris Charron, an analyst at
Forrester Research, describes as ``adding real intelligence to the
search function.''
</P>
<P>
   What Excite (www.excite.com) has done is try to guess what a
user is seeking _ the specific bit of information the user wants to
know even when typing a general query _ and then to use that
assumption as a starting point for search results.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how it works: If you type a single keyword in the query
box on the Excite home page _ try ``orioles,'' for example _ you
will see that Excite's staff has made the assumption (based on
users' past patterns) that you want information about the Baltimore
Orioles baseball team. The search results will be about the team
but will not be limited to relevant Web pages from Excite's index.
You will also get information culled from other databases _
including those of current publications, for example _ giving you
game scores, the team's schedule and recent news articles. All that
information will appear on the first screen of the search results.
</P>
<P>
   Excite's co-founder Joe Kraus describes this approach as
creating ``channels'' of information. It also takes into
consideration the fact that some users who type ``orioles'' will
not be looking for information about the sports team. For them, the
search results page displays a prominent link to sites relevant to
other meanings of the word.
</P>
<P>
   Excite has organized information about public companies into
channels, as well. So if you type ``Microsoft'' in the query box,
the search results will display the information that past users
have sought most frequently: the company's phone number and
address, as well as recent news articles, culled from 350
publications, and the stock price (updated every 20 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   When I tried out Excite's system, searching suddenly seemed fun.
Not since the long-ago day when I finally mastered the intricacies
of the Dewey Decimal System had I felt so empowered by the giddy
knowledge that vast troves of valuable facts were mine for the
asking. I felt, for a moment, as if the Web could live up to the
so-far-mythical promise of organizing the world's information in a
coherent and accessible fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Here was proof of the value of such a dynamic medium, where
facts are in flux _ things like sports scores and stock prices
change from minute to minute _ and the latest bits of data are just
a click away.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to get spoiled, but reality brought me up short. It
turns out that Excite has so far organized only a fraction of its
available information into channels. So if you are searching for
something other than information about a sports team or a public
company, no channels for you. Back to the old search results, lists
of Web sites that might or might not be relevant to the query.
</P>
<P>
   That frustrated me at first. Why was Excite discriminating
against users who wanted to search for ``applesauce recipes'' or
``Chesapeake Bay retrievers''? Were we not entitled to, say, the
most recent articles published on those topics?
</P>
<P>
   But Kraus calmed me with the news that Excite will expand the
scope of its intelligent search function, with plans in the next
few months to create a number of other channels on topics like
health, cities and celebrities. These channels are likely to appeal
to a broad cross-section of users; Ms. Spink's analysis found that
users often searched for information about a specific person or
place.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it is impossible to organize all information into
channels, Kraus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to know something very specific _ say, the effects
of sleep deprivation on heart disease in men on the East Coast _ we
won't ever be able to program a channel to answer that query,'' he
said. ``That's what we call a needle-in-a-haystack query.''
</P>
<P>
   To increase the success rate for those kinds of searches, some
sites have borrowed a technique that off-line information retrieval
systems have been using for decades: improving the relevance of
search results.
</P>
<P>
   Infoseek (www.infoseek.com), for instance, determined from
search patterns that when most users searched for ``airlines,''
they wanted search results that included the home pages of major
airlines. So search results now include those pages.
</P>
<P>
   Another search site, Cnet's Snap (www.snap.com), uses a recipe
for finding relevant results to make searches more successful. When
a user types a keyword query, the site's software automatically
assesses the potential relevance of all the sites in its index,
assigning a weight to each site's Web address, description and
content, then using those weights to rank sites.
</P>
<P>
   To supplement its method, Snap has human editors assign keywords
to specific documents to give them added weight. ``We can quickly
improve relevancy by responding to seasonal trends, news and
current events,'' said Katharine English, the site's executive
producer.
</P>
<P>
   How relevant are the results? In my own unscientific
experiments, I conducted searches on both sites to try to answer my
7-year-old daughter's question about the average life span of a
house cat, and the results indicated that the technology still has
a long way to go. It took me about 10 minutes of clicking on
unlikely search results to learn that the answer is probably 15
years (according to a source who identified herself only as Cat
Lady in a message she posted on the cat health bulletin board of
Acme Pet).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the search results suggested that I might also find
the answer at a link called ``Stupid (threatened) Snakes Don't
Deserve to Live.'' But at least I no longer think that's my fault.

CONFESSIONS OF A MONOPOLIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday July 3)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer vacation has begun, which means it's time for the
traditional Grimes family Monopoly tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Call me a sentimentalist, but to me nothing says ``family
values'' like slowly bankrupting a spouse or conning a small child
into a one-sided real estate deal that costs him the game.
</P>
<P>
   The way their little shoulders slump ... the way their lower lip
quivers and their eyes well up with tears ... I don't know, you
just can't put a price on that kind of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for some strange reason, I detected something less than
unbridled joy on the faces of my wife and son when I dragged out
the Monopoly game and began herding them toward the dining room
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing,'' said my wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about it, Dad,'' said the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it had something to do with last year's tournament,
which I won thanks to a cagey investment strategy and a shrewd real
estate deal where I promised the boy he could go without brushing
his teeth for a week if he would trade me Park Place for Oriental
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   That lost him the game, of course, plus I made him brush his
teeth twice as often for making such a dumb trade. Boy, I'll tell
you, parenting doesn't get any better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game chatter'' is a big part of Monopoly's appeal and is
certainly what brings us closest together as a family. When, for
example, an opponent lands on a property you own, such as Illinois
Avenue, the correct way to call for the rent is to shout, ``THAT'S
MINE!! That'll be $20, lady, and I want it NOW!!''
</P>
<P>
   This tells everyone that you are a real ``player'' and not
someone to be trifled with or, for that matter, entrusted with
sharp objects.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to publicize, in as loud a voice as
possible, any financial difficulties your opponents may be having,
such as: ``Whatsamatter, kid? A little light on cash? Tell you
what, I'll give you 30 bucks for Pennsylvania Avenue and I'll even
throw in this Get Out of Jail Free card 'cause I like your face.
Whaddya say? Deal? Huh? Deal? Huh? Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   This is called ``keeping the pressure on'' and it always
succeeds in rattling an opponent, sometimes to the point that he or
she will whip a soft drink bottle at your head, so you've got to
stay alert.
</P>
<P>
   Since the object of Monopoly is to reduce your opponent to a
whimpering, quaking, bankrupt blob of goo, it is important that you
don't get ``soft'' with an opponent just because he or she is a
spouse or a small child who has not yet mastered addition and
subtraction, let alone the finer points of mortgaging.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I know some people who think Monopoly is more
``fun'' if everyone owns a block because then everyone is ``in the
game'' and has a chance to win and yadda yadda ya. This, of course,
is sheer nonsense and the kind of behavior that should draw the
attention of the House Un-American Activities Committee, assuming
such a committee still exists.
</P>
<P>
   To me, the perfect Monopoly game would be me and three
opponents. One opponent would own Mediterranean Avenue, another
would own Vermont Avenue and the third would own St. Charles Place.
I'd own everything else. The reds, the yellows, the greens,
everything. Plus all the railroads and both utilities.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a beautiful thing, the kind of moment you'd like to
share with your family, if they'd only give you a chance.
</P>

KANSAS WHEAT IS RIPENING AT QUICK PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA SIZEMORE LONG  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The wheat harvest is racing across Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Department of Agriculture reported 68 percent of the
harvest complete as of Sunday. A year earlier, the harvest was only
5 percent complete on the same date.
</P>
<P>
   This year's pace is the quickest since 1994, when the harvest
was 86 percent complete by the end of June. An average year would
see the harvest about 28 percent complete by now.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is the leading producer of hard red winter wheat, which
is used for making bread and similar products such as hamburger
buns. Hard red winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Hand, an agricultural statistician with the Kansas
Department of Agriculture, said the rapid pace of this year's
harvest was due to hot, dry weather about a month ago that allowed
wheat in many areas to ripen faster than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a cool, wet spring helped wheat plants recover from an
early spring freeze but slowed ripening and delayed the start of
harvest, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent heavy rains in many Kansas wheat areas did not slow down
the harvest as much as had been expected, state officials said.
Much of the land was so dry the ground soaked up the rain and
remained firm for field work.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has rated 21 percent of the season's
wheat crop as excellent, 53 percent as good and 20 percent fair.
Five percent of the crop was rated poor and 2 percent very poor.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas farmers are expected to harvest 393.9 million bushels of
wheat this year, based on June 1 conditions. The estimate is up
from the 377.4 million estimated as of May 1. The next official
estimate will be July 10 and will be based on conditions as of
today.
</P>
<P>
   This year's projected hard red winter wheat output is down from
last year's record 506 million bushels. Farmers seeded fewer acres
this year to hard red winter wheat compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expected lower output, this year's crop still is a
decent one. But with exports down and prices low, many farmers will
be putting their crops into storage.
</P>
<P>
   Many will opt to put their crops under government loan programs,
predicted Kansas farmer Ray Crumbaker, who is president of the
Kansas Association of Wheat Growers.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat can be placed under loan for nine months, during which the
farmer can watch for higher prices, sell the wheat and repay the
loan. If prices do not rise to acceptable levels, the farmer can
choose to forfeit the wheat pledged for the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign demand has slowed in the wake of the Asian economic
crisis. Asia is the second-largest buyer of hard red winter wheat,
after the Middle East, said Doug Ohlemeier, marketing specialist
for the Kansas Wheat Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kansas farmers produce more wheat than can be used
domestically, the export market is vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to help,'' Ohlemeier said of the Asian economic
crisis. ``Asia is an important market.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently said U.S. wheat
farmers might forfeit as much as 10 million bushels of wheat to the
government this summer under government price support loans.
</P>
<P>
   Low wheat prices are prompting producers to forfeit stocks for
the first time in several years. Farmers already have forfeited
about 2.5 million bushels of wheat in recent weeks rather than
repay their 1997 loans.
</P>
<P>
   Prices that farmers receive for wheat under loan vary from
county to county and depend on storage rates, among other things.
Currently Kansas farmers are getting between $2.46 and $2.97 a
bushel for wheat under loan, very near current cash prices, said
John Drach, program specialist in Manhattan with the Farm Service
Agency, which helps with government loans. The national average
loan price is $2.58 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   For Kansas farmers, the decision to put wheat under government
loan usually is made in July or August after the harvest is
complete, Crumbaker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By March or April of 1999, there should be some rise in prices
where farmers will be better off selling wheat and paying off the
loan,'' he said.

A WHOLE SUMMER TO SHOW THE COLORS

  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeing red, white and blue this weekend? Take off the
color blinders for the rest of the summer. After the parades pass,
refresh the table with garden settings: new green majolica plates,
silk poppy napkin rings and bright orange and pink napkins. Or with
new reproductions of American classics like a glass hobnail
pitcher. They're perfectly patriotic.
</P>
<P>

SUMMER HEAT WAVES DISPLAY NEED FOR MORE POWER GENERATION CAPACITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The story hasn't attracted much mainstream
media attention yet, but if the already hot summer gets hotter, a
prolonged heat wave could underscore a largely unnoticed need for
more power-generation capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas of the Midwest already have been hit with power
interruptions and if shortages spread, an electricity squeeze has
the potential to put a serious damper on economic growth during the
third quarter. The industry's shrinking reserve capacity has been
mostly ignored because it hasn't threatened to hamper normal
activity yet.
</P>
<P>
   One of the constants of economic growth, however, is an
accompanying rise in demand for electric power. The economic
expansion that began in the early '90s entered its eighth year this
spring, and demand for electricity has been rising steadily during
a period when the industry hasn't added appreciably to its
generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as fate would have it, the early signs are pointing to
a hotter-than-usual summer in many parts of the country even as an
unusually large number of nuclear plants have been shut down for
repairs throughout North America.
</P>
<P>
   The good news hereabouts is Kansas City appears to be in
reasonably good shape, for now at least. After Mother Nature turned
up the heat last week, a Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co.
representative said the company currently saw no need to request
usage reductions but would continue to monitor the situation
closely.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of America, though, it's a different story, as
some Midwest factories have been forced to shut down temporarily. A
Ford assembly plant energy manager in Chicago told The Wall Street
Journal after three shutdowns that the utility industry ``seemed
very ill-prepared'' for the recent heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   The story also said New England companies were alerting
customers to the possibility of power shortages and were expecting
possible service interruptions for large industrial customers in
July and August.
</P>
<P>
   If a crisis develops, it will further prove how the blessings of
electrical power are too much taken for granted. Utilities
regularly advise that more capacity will be needed, but consumers
and their regulatory watchdogs usually pooh-pooh such warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuffs are effective because the cost of new generating
capacity must be factored into the rate base to finance the
investment. Neither residential nor corporate customers are eager
to pay for something not immediately needed, so construction is put
off until the crunch comes.
</P>
<P>
   This time, The Wall Street Journal reported, any significant
shortfall is likely to be exacerbated by inadequate investment in
transmission lines in recent years. This is hindering the
industry's ability to transmit power from surplus areas to
power-short areas.
</P>
<P>
   Those with surpluses, however, are reaping big rewards.
Companies with power to spare reportedly have received as much as
$7,000 per megawatt hour, compared to the usual $50 to $100 cost
during normal summer conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, that Americans will luck out. The
early hot spell may moderate and life may go on without much
hot-weather hassle for individuals and corporations alike.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans do dodge a bullet, however, it still won't
eliminate the need to be mindful of how prosperity fuels demand for
electricity and that prosperity isn't sustainable without adequate
supplies of power.

JUDGES MAKE THEIR ASSET LISTS MORE READILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE
PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE STEPHENS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jackson County judges are following the lead
of their colleagues on the federal bench by making lists of their
assets available directly to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The decision short-circuits a longstanding rule requiring the
public to travel to Jefferson City, Mo., to see the reports, which
are used to identify potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not as readily and freely available as we thought
they ought to be,'' said Judge Jay A. Daugherty.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County judges voted last week to begin filing duplicates
of the reports at the court administrator's office in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The decision follows a series in The Kansas City Star that
described how federal judges make it uncommonly difficult to review
the disclosure reports they file in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In response, federal judges in the Western District of Missouri
voted last month to make their reports available locally. Now,
federal judges nationwide are considering the system.
</P>
<P>
   The series also prompted Jackson County judges to review the
Missouri Supreme Court's disclosure rules, which cover all state
courts. That's when they discovered the court would not mail copies
to the public but forced them to travel to the capital to collect
them.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County judges decided that was unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missouri historically has been one of the leaders in the
country when it comes to judicial ethics and judicial openness,''
Daugherty said. ``We felt we could be more accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports list stocks worth $10,000 or more, corporate offices
held, gifts and honoraria, sources of income and relatives employed
by Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty said it made little sense for judges to complete the
reports, then file them where no one would see them. ``It was a
kind of no-brainer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Local lawyers applauded the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more of that type of disclosure in the system we can get,
the better,'' said attorney Dennis Egan. ``Fairness in the system
is indispensable. I think it's great.''

HOW TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing anyone who wants to connect to the Internet has
to realize is that the Net is not a single entity _ it is a
collection of networks joined by a set of standard ways to exchange
data.
</P>
<P>
   The name Internet even implies that it links networks. This
means that almost any system for carrying data _ wires, radio,
fiber optics or even smoke signals _ can be hooked into the
Internet if it can send that data in the format known as the
Internet Protocol, or IP.
</P>
<P>
   The good (or bad) news about this open standard for a network is
that there are many options for getting connected to the Web. The
most popular way is to use the telephone, but new options using the
cable system or the cellular phone system are expanding rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all choices are available in all areas. Some of
the fanciest systems are just being introduced in tests around the
country. Others are offered by companies that serve only small
regions. With the array of choices available, it is difficult to
give straightforward advice that applies to most people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is one general rule: Faster is better. That sounds
like a simple standard to apply, but it's surprisingly complex.
Some systems can provide great speed consistently. Others offer it
only in bursts. Some require you to share the road with your
neighbors, which means that service will be slower when people are
home and faster when everyone is asleep.
</P>
<P>
   On others, information moves at different speeds when it travels
in different directions. You might be able to download, or receive,
large volumes of data quickly, but the time to upload, or send,
information could be much slower.
</P>
<P>
   The problem becomes even more complicated because a fast
connection between you and your service provider does not guarantee
that information will arrive quickly. Data will often travel
through more than 20 connections between your machine and a distant
Web site. The weakest link limits the speed at which your computer
will get the data.
</P>
<P>
   Another important detail is service. Some people are comfortable
working with computers, while others want someone else to worry
about the details. Some of the biggest brands in the online
business got there by concentrating on making their connecting
process as simple and bulletproof as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ways of connecting require not only special hardware and
software but also a relationship with an Internet service provider,
known as an ISP. Look before you leap, and add up all the costs and
benefits. This is only a general guide; specifics vary considerably
from place to place and from company to company.
</P>
<P>
   So, with that said, here's a thumbnail guide to the sometimes
bewildering world of connecting to the Internet. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phone Lines
</P>
<P>
   While the telephone system is the most common way for people to
connect to the Internet from home, it was engineered to carry
voices, not data, over the lines. Modems to carry data were
developed as afterthoughts, and the phone companies are fond of
saying that they do not guarantee that modems will work.
</P>
<P>
   Many glitches people report with modems, like sudden
disconnections, are in some ways the result of trying to carry data
by turning it into high-pitched squeaks through a modem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, connecting with the phone system is relatively
easy, and phone service is almost ubiquitous. Most ISPs offer
CD-ROMs or floppy disks with all the necessary software to connect
through a modem. These are usually programmed with the standard
settings for most major computers and modems, but problems still
occur occasionally. The ISPs also offer some hand-holding advice if
things go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest headaches for some ISPs is providing enough
phone lines. They get charged for each line coming in to their
headquarters, so they try to minimize the number of lines.
</P>
<P>
   Also, growth can swamp an ISP (Remember when America Online
gained so many customers so fast that many had problems
connecting?) Companies are still trying to find the right balance
of prices and service for a sustainable ISP business.
</P>
<P>
   A recent problem has arisen from the slightly confusing
transition to 56 K modems. They are supposed to move data at the
rate of 56,000 bits (or 56 kilobits) per second, roughly
equivalent, depending on the technology, to 1,000 to 2,000 words
per second.
</P>
<P>
   Often phone systems cannot support high speeds, and these modems
are forced to work a little more slowly. Two companies tried to
corner the market in the modem business by introducing competing
standards that could not interact. A compromise standard, called
V.90, has been designed, but it is not widely available, which
means that your modem may not communicate well with your ISPs
modem, and the glitches can be maddening because they can seem
random. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ISDN and ADSL
</P>
<P>
   Faster digital telephone lines are available from phone
companies in some parts of the country. The services are called
ISDN, for integrated services digital network, and ADSL, for
asymmetric digital subscriber line.
</P>
<P>
   ISDN is older and slower (up to about 128 kilobits per second)
than ADSL, but it is available in more areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ISDN, the first major attempt by the phone companies to move
toward a digital system, allows people with the service to get both
voice and data calls on the same line. That is why the system is
called integrated.
</P>
<P>
   ADSL is much faster (between 128 kilobits per second and 1.5
megabits per second), but it is available only to lucky people
living in the right neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies are experimenting with many different variations
of this system and tagging them with similar names. For this
reason, some people use the term xDSL to refer to the entire batch;
the ``x'' stands for any one of the possible acronyms.
</P>
<P>
   The prices for these services can be confusing because each
phone company has persuaded the tariff board regulating it to allow
different rates. The result is that the cost of ISDN can be
reasonable in some parts of the country ($40 per month), but a
luxury ($200 per month or more) in others.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem is the lack of widespread expertise with the
technology. You have to buy a different type of modem to use either
ADSL or ISDN. You might also need a new phone line or two.
</P>
<P>
   People are usually happy with the fast connections _ once they
get them working. In many cases, the local phone company will sell
a package that includes installation, but the amount of support
varies. And you will still need an ISP in addition to your phone
line. That makes the hardware and service pretty pricey, but some
people think that it's worth it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cable Modems
</P>
<P>
   The cable television companies realized long ago that their
shielded wires, which are protected against electromagnetic
interference, could carry much more information than the largely
unshielded wires used by the telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that many homes in the same neighborhood, known
as the local loop, share the same cable wire, much like a telephone
party line in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The first adopters of cable-modem Internet links speak lovingly
of their high-speed connections, but it is unclear whether
performance will suffer in the long term if everyone in the
neighborhood starts downloading big files at the same time. No one
knows how usage patterns and service commitments from the cable
companies will evolve over time.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, cable access to the Internet requires a special modem
that is usually installed by a technician from the cable company.
The technician will also check your system to insure that the
proper security provisions are in place. That is important because
the party-line nature of the technology makes it easier for
neighbors to poke into your business.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Access to cable-modem service is limited by economics. The cable
companies are rolling out new service in some areas, like Baltimore
County and parts of New Jersey, as a test.
</P>
<P>
   Each company decides where to offer service based on how much
money it thinks it can make in an area, so it helps to live in a
place filled with other Internet addicts. Comcast, the cable
company serving Baltimore County, is spending heavily to offer the
service in that suburban area, while the company serving the city
of Baltimore, TCI, has been taking its time. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leased Lines
</P>
<P>
   Businesses with local networks often get on the Internet by
leasing from the phone company high-speed lines that link directly
to major ISPs. All the traffic from an office network is then
shipped out on one of these high-speed lines. It is much more
reliable and efficient than putting a modem on each desk.
</P>
<P>
   These leased lines, which include T-1 lines, come in a variety
of sizes, and the price often depends on the distance to the local
switching center. It is hard to generalize about these prices, but
lower-capacity lines often run between $300 and $1,000 a month just
for the telephone company's fees; T-1s can cost $1,000 to $2,000 a
month or more. There are additional costs from the ISP that handles
the job of shipping the data to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of sharing leased lines is becoming popular in
apartment complexes. Sometimes a group of neighbors will form a
cooperative to share the costs. In other cases, a real-estate
developer will provide the service as an incentive for home-based
businesses and other small companies that cannot afford their own
technology staff. And many luxury apartment buildings are starting
to offer such lines to attract tenants. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cellular-Based Wireless Service
</P>
<P>
   Many cellular phone companies are offering wireless Internet
service, which is integrated with the system that provides cellular
calls. The Internet service requires a special type of modem with
an antenna. The quality of the service, of course, depends upon how
well radio signals travel in your neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Tall buildings can be a problem, and signals will sometimes not
penetrate deeply inside other buildings. The quality of the service
can also depend on the distance between the modem's antenna and the
nearest cellular system antenna.
</P>
<P>
   The radio modem often works well with laptops. That kind of
tetherless freedom is its biggest selling point. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other Radio-Based Service
</P>
<P>
   A wide variety of radio modems are offered by companies that do
not sell phone service over their networks. These are often used by
businesses like package-delivery companies and cab companies to
keep track of their fleets and dispatch them. Still, some offer
service that can be used by the average consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of these networks varies. In some cases, there are
thousands of small antennas attached to lampposts throughout the
city. Metricom is one example of a company using this solution, but
it does that in only three major metropolitan areas _ the San
Francisco Bay area, Seattle and Washington. In other cases,
companies use satellites to broadcast information to reach all of
North America. That is popular with trucking companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other wireless companies use methods similar to those used by
the cellular phone industry, with towers every mile or two. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast Service
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing ways to get information from the Web
is just emerging. Some companies are sending information hidden in
the corners of radio and television signals. Users with television
cards in their PCs can program their computers to grab this
information and store it locally.
</P>
<P>
   These methods are great if you want access to sophisticated and
popular information without waiting. It may take too long to
download a film clip through a modem, but a news company could
broadcast the same clip to people throughout the country
simultaneously. The next time you turned to your machine, the
entire clip could be stored on your hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   But this approach has several limitations. You can get only what
the broadcaster wants to send you, so only the major services with
broad appeal, like CNN.com, will arrive this way.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you cannot send data through your card. Most people will
want to maintain a standard dial-up service to handle e-mail and
Web data that the broadcasters do not offer. Still, if you
regularly check the weather, headlines, sports news or other
popular services, broadcast service has plenty of appeal. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Satellite Hybrids
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same companies that make the digital satellite
dishes used for television reception are offering Internet service
through the same system. The good news is that the bandwidth from
the satellite to your house is high. The Web pages you request
travel down a channel that can easily handle 500 kilobits per
second or more.
</P>
<P>
   There are two caveats: First, the channel is a party line shared
by all users in the country and, second, the bandwidth out of your
house is more conventional because it travels over phone lines
using a modem. If your Internet usage involves lots of short
requests for big blocks of data, then the imbalance is not a
problem. But if you want to ship out as much data as you pull in,
this service is not the best solution. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Low-Earth-Orbit Satellites
</P>
<P>
   Among the most interesting systems on the drawing boards or
operating today are the constellations of satellites in low Earth
orbit. These fly only 500 to 1,000 miles above Earth to minimize
the time a radio signal spends in transit. A large number of
satellites (66 in one system and 288 in another) are needed to
insure that one satellite is always overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these systems are already well along, but getting one in
operation isn't easy. The companies that want to offer satellite
service must negotiate licenses for radio frequencies from many
governments and deal with local service problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also, leaves and trees block some of the signal from the
antennas on the fast-moving satellites and on the ground. And
simply launching 288 satellites is no small feat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these satellite systems promise to change the equation
around the globe. If they are successful, it will suddenly be easy
to get the same level of service in Kansas, the African veld or
Silicon Valley, and that could have significant political effects.

SUPREME COURT DEMONSTRATES THAT IT IS A DYNAMIC FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 4)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once again, the Supreme Court has spoken with
authority on matters reaching directly into the American home and
workplace as well as into congressional chambers and the Oval
Office. In doing so, it has demonstrated that it remains a dynamic
Force in the splendid government triad created by the founding
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Washington often gives the impression that almost all government
activity is the province of Congress and the executive branch, the
noisy and most publicized two thirds of the triad.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, the Supreme Court, whose process of reaching
monumental decisions is secret and mysterious, is the most
intriguing wing of government. It provides a constant example of
the influence a single individual can have in a democracy since
many of its rulings that transform America's social and political
behavior are decided by votes of five to four.
</P>
<P>
   We may disagree vehemently with some actions taken by the
justices, but we should understand that each, in his or her way, is
engaged in the vital task of upholding the Constitution and
defining its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the court's sacred mission since 1801 when the
great John Marshall became chief justice and, according to court
historian Henry J. Abraham, ``raised the court from its lowly if
not discredited position to a level of equality with the
legislative and executive branches _ perhaps even one of dominance
during the heyday of his chief justiceship.''
</P>
<P>
   During its 12 years of existence before Marshall's appointment,
the court, according the first chief justice, John Jay, lacked
``energy, weight and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   That began to change when Marshall in 1803 decreed in the
landmark Marbury v. Madison case that the Constitution is supreme
and that the high court has the authority to declare laws passed by
Congress and signed by the president unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the high court found the line-item veto, which
permitted the president to kill individual appropriations,
unconstitutional and ruled that individuals suffering from HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, are protected by the federal law that bars
discrimination against the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   It also established procedures under which individuals can sue
businesses in cases of sexual harassment. The court likewise ruled
that the National Endowment for the Arts may consider general
standards of decency in deciding what projects should receive
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The same court that a few months ago refused to delay Paula
Jones`s suit against President Clinton until he has left the White
House, decided that the attorney-client privilege protects
communications between the late White House Deputy Counsel Vincent
Foster, a close friend of the Clintons, and his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   When people oppose the actions of Congress and the president,
they have highly visible targets for their protest. That is less
true with the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The seven men and two women who currently make up the Supreme
Court work, as did their predecessors, in isolated splendor behind
marble walls and great columns. Few Americans, even those who damn
the justices, can recite their names.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court decisions may not be molded in concrete, but they
are difficult to repeal or circumvent.
</P>
<P>
   For years, people who claim to be advocates of ``strict
constructionism'' have sought to reverse Supreme Court rulings on
such controversial issues as school prayer, abortion and flag
burning. But they have not succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The genius and the frustration of our Constitution is that its
meaning can be interpreted in different ways by different people.
The shift of a single seat on the current court from a bona fide
conservative such as Chief Justice William Rehnquist or Justices
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas to a more moderate jurist could
change the philosophical coloration of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Such a justice _ by joining John Paul Stevens, David Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer _ could point the court in a
less conservative direction.
</P>
<P>
   Were John Marshall alive today, he might take issue with
activist justices because he believed that ``courts are the mere
instruments of the law and can will nothing.'' But he would
recognize that the court must keep pace with the times. The
Constitution, he said, was ``intended to endure for ages to come
...''
</P>
<P>
   With their lifetime appointments, justices are supposed to the
immune to political pressure. But they know what is happening in
our society, and many of them view the Constitution as a living
document that must be, as Marshall also said, ``adapted to the
various crises of human affairs.''

Oil sketches at the DMA shimmer with artists' compressed vision 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Several North Texas art museums are pitching
exhibitions as vicarious getaways this typically sizzling summer.
But none as explicitly as the Dallas Museum of Art, where curator
Eleanor Jones Harvey has placed a big picture of a snowy mountain
at the entrance to ``The Painted Sketch: Impressions From Nature,
1830-1880.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvey's witty pandering to our desperate need for a respite
is only one _ and not the primary _ reason for viewing ``The
Painted Sketch.'' For starters, it is historic: This DMA
presentation is the first survey of 19th-century painting devoted
exclusively to the oil sketch. Then there is the scholarly
incentive: ``The Painted Sketch'' adds an engaging chapter to our
knowledge of American painting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the exhibition sheds light on the well-known work
of Frederic Edwin Church, whose views of exotic places were
rendered on a scale that, in the mid-19th century, was the
painterly equivalent of CinemaScope. At the same time, it
introduces viewers to the relatively unknown Sanford Robinson
Gifford, whose work will probably be looked at more closely as a
result of this show.
</P>
<P>
   But best of all is the pleasure of viewing dozens of luscious
little paintings, composed and executed with irresistible bravura.
Many of them inspire covetousness, which is the most selfish and
truest compliment we can pay any exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists represented include Worthington Whittredge, Albert
Bierstadt, John F. Kensett and Jasper Cropsey. Artists whom many of
us would expect to be included are not because they didn't fit
Harvey's criteria. Thomas Moran, for example, worked in watercolor
instead of oil and would have diluted the exhibition effect.
</P>
<P>
   A bonus: The book for ``The Painted Sketch'' features crisply
written essays and a logically organized, fully illustrated color
catalog of all works on view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Painted Sketch: American Impressions From Nature,
1830-1880''
</P>
<P>
   Through Sept. 20: 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Tuesday-Friday, 11 a.m.-5 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday, also 4-9 p.m. Thursday at the Dallas Museum of
Art, 1717 N. Harwood St., Dallas. Tickets: $1-$5. Information:

   Forget about that American Film Institute list of the 100
greatest American films of all time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, forget about great movies altogether. On this
Independence Day weekend, I salute ``Independence Day'' _ and 49
other turkeys _ as the worst movies I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``ID4'' was a monster hit, but try to sit through that
piece of drek again if you consider yourself a fan. It's riddled
with more sappy cliches than a boxed-set video of the Jerry Lewis
Telethon.
</P>
<P>
   After perusing countless film guides and soliciting suggestions
from dozens of film-loving friends, I've compiled a list of 50
movies so bad they make your teeth hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Why 50? Because a list of 100 would make your head hurt, and
besides, it wouldn't fit in this space.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria: No cheapie slasher flicks, no low-budget bombs, no
straight-to-video duds. When these movies were released, they were
not thought of as camp classics or interesting failures; they were
supposed to be mainstream hits, but they missed.
</P>
<P>
   By a mile.

FEDERAL SAFETY OFFICIALS WARN OF DANGERS OF FIREWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With help from mannequins and exploding
watermelons, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission on
Wednesday issued its annual July 4th warning about the dangers of
playing with fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Brown, CPSC chairman, warned that even legal fireworks are
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``No firework is 100 percent safe. Sparklers which burn at 2000
degrees Fahrenheit are especially dangerous for unsuspecting
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her warning came as CPSC staffers demonstrated how a sparkler _
a firework often viewed as harmless _ quickly burned through a
doll's dress.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying explosives in your pocket can also be dangerous. Safety
officials showed how a bottle rocket _ a firework allowed by the
CPSC and by some state laws _ burned a hole through a pair of
trousers when it was placed in a mannequin's pants.
</P>
<P>
   The safety exhibition included such hazardous fireworks as the
M-80 and the M-1000 explosives, both banned by the CFSC.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brown, children and adults have lost fingers and
hands in M-80 explosions. At the CPSC demonstration, a mannequin
holding an M-80 lost a hand when the device exploded.
</P>
<P>
   CPSC staffers also blew up watermelons with M-1000s.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a sampling of injuries in hospital emergency rooms
across the nation in 1997, the CPSC estimated that 8,723 people
were hurt by fireworks last year, with approximately half of the
injuries sustained by children under the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
   Burns accounted for over half of the injuries, but there also
were more serious injuries such as amputations, fractures and
lacerations, the CPSC reported.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Burns, 12, of Chicago was blinded in one eye by a faulty
firework, lit in celebration of the Chicago Bulls' basketball
championship in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to his father, Joe Burns, his son was watching an
adult set off a rocket in his friend's backyard, but the firework
exploded without warning. Pieces of shrapnel shattered the boy's
cheekbones, and he lost his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adult thought he knew how to handle these fireworks ...
but the danger zone for fireworks is not a mere 10 feet,'' Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said his son will never have more than 20/50 vision with
corrective lenses in his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   Burns urged parents to watch professional fireworks instead of
allowing their children to use fireworks in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not become a July 4th statistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned
holiday travelers that federal law prohibits carrying fireworks on
airplanes, either in carry-on luggage or in checked bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fireworks of all shapes and sizes _ from roman candles to the
smallest poppers and sparklers _ are strictly prohibited from
passengers' bags,'' Cathal Flynn, associate FAA administrator,
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only would you be risking fines, or even criminal
prosecution by carrying fireworks on board a passenger plane, but
you would endanger yourself and everyone else on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil penalties of up to $27,500 per violation are in effect for
both domestic and international flights.

LAWYERS URGE RELEASE OF REPORT ON UNABOMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMELYN CRUZ LAT  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The public is entitled to know more about the
Unabomber, his crimes and how the criminal justice system worked in
his case, a lawyer told a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for release of a 47-page report detailing Theodore
Kaczynski's mental state, attorney Roger Myers told the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco that disclosure was
necessary for the public to understand ``the entire workings of the
criminal justice system in this case and understand the Unabomber
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The report will help explain how decisions were made in the
case, including the finding that Kaczynski was competent to stand
trial and the subsequent plea agreement in January that abruptly
ended the trial, said Myers, who represents the San Francisco
Examiner, CBS News and the Sacramento Bee.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski, 55, pleaded guilty to killing three people and
wounding dozens of others in a 17-year bombing spree. He was
sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without the
possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Despite skeptical questioning from at least two judges,
Kaczynski attorney Quin Denvir maintained that the confessed
Unabomber still had a right to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you have committed a criminal act doesn't open up
your mind to the public and the media,'' said Denvir, a federal
public defender.
</P>
<P>
   Denvir also argued that disclosure of the report based on 19
hours of interviews with Kaczynski would have a chilling effect on
defendants' willingness to divulge personal information in future
cases.
</P>
<P>
   However, during the hour-long hearing, at least two judges
indicated release of the report, which concluded Kaczynski was a
paranoid schizophrenic but nevertheless was competent to stand
trial, would perhaps contribute to the public's understanding of
how the courts operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get as much (public) information as possible about
what goes on in the judicial system,'' Judge Stephen Reinhardt
said. ``We try to let the public know how the system operates.''
</P>
<P>
   The court, which delayed a trial judge's order releasing an
edited version of the report, did not immediately issue a ruling
and postponed any decision until after July 7.
</P>
<P>
   The report by federal prison psychiatrist Dr. Sally Johnson was
submitted in January.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Myers said that Kaczynski, who is
shopping around for a proposal for a book he intends to write about
himself and his case, wasn't interested in preserving his privacy
but rather sought ``to control what facts are reported to the
public, who gets to publicize them and the manner of their
presentation.''

CIRCUITS Q&AMP;A: SURGE SUPPRESSORS FOR PHONE LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is it true that your telephone line should be plugged into a
surge suppressor before being attached to the computer? I have been
told that a power surge could go through the phone and hurt the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   A. Using a high-quality surge suppressor that includes a jack
for your modem line is definitely a good idea, as Mother Nature
does not stand in awe of technology. Sudden, enormous power surges
from lightning strikes can travel through your telephone line and
power cords. External modems are often at risk for a double whammy,
as they generally plug into both the telephone jack and an
electrical outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Some types of internal modems are equipped with relay switches
that will trip if the power surges and prevent further damage to
your computer's components. That is not a certainty, of course, as
anything can happen when it comes to nature.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in an area that with frequent storms, unplug the
power and telephone cords from your computer when you are not using
it, or invest in a surge suppressor that protects both kinds of
cables. Don't trust your expensive equipment to a cheap suppressor
that is little more than an extension cord.
</P>
<P>
   A computer-grade surge suppressor should have an on-off switch
to control all devices, a telephone-line jack and a status light to
indicate that the suppressor is working. It should carry a label
from Underwriters Laboratories, which tests products for electrical
safety.
</P>
<P>
   A good surge suppressor, which will clamp down on excess voltage
before it can fry your components, can be found at electronics and
computer stores. It may cost you $50 or more, but it is still far
cheaper than replacing all your sensitive hardware.

FEAR AND LOVING IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You simply cannot comprehend the expression, ``fear gripped
me,'' until you have been truly terrified for minutes that seem
like hours.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than that haunted house, fake blood kind of scared,
or the cheap shower curtain rod falling down in the bathroom
because someone hung a towel on it. I'm referring to that
heart-pounding, fist-clenching, teeth-grinding, pressure-rising
terror that only bullets and babies can bring.
</P>
<P>
   No, I have not been to war and crouched in a foxhole as bullets
whizzed overhead. I did drive through a rough neighborhood in
Amarillo late one night some years ago, but no one was out except
an old gray cat with no tail and just three legs.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I know fear.
</P>
<P>
   While in school, I worked at a fast-food joint as a cashier.
Late one night, three coked-out masked men robbed us at gunpoint.
Miraculously, my pants did not get wet. However, as frightening as
it was, that incident ranks No. 2 on my list of most terrifying
experiences. My No. 1 happened just a few weeks ago at the mall.
No, no one refused my credit card. That was the day I lost my son.
</P>
<P>
   I had bribed Junior into shopping with me by promising him a
toy. The toy store was right across from my favorite place in the
world, a bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son,'' I said, ``let's just stop in B. Dalton's a minute, and
then we'll get your toy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, he followed me into the store. I headed for the New
Fiction section, and when I glanced back to tell him something, he
was gone, suddenly vanished into thin air.
</P>
<P>
   I searched all over the bookstore and then the toy store. He
wasn't in either place.
</P>
<P>
   I checked the plaza, then the food court and the arcade. There
was no sign of him anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Fear gripped me.
</P>
<P>
   In a panic, I found a security guard and begged him to help me
find my boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was he wearing?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea. My mind was like a river of white water; things
were going by so fast that I couldn't hang onto a single thought.
</P>
<P>
   I kept babbling until the guard finally asked for a picture of
my son, and that set the search in motion. A million horrifying
thoughts and images filled my head as I tried to ``stay put'' as
I'd been instructed. But I couldn't just sit there as precious
minutes passed by.
</P>
<P>
   I started running through the mall, calling my son's name.
Miraculously, I soon spotted him standing near the escalators with
a mask of bravado disguising his fright. When he saw me, he said:
``Mom, where have you been? I've been looking everywhere for you!''
</P>
<P>
   With relief, I chose a smile and a bear hug over the screaming
lecture that I'd planned. For once, he let me hug him in public
without protesting.
</P>
<P>
   I lifted him up, and love lifted me. Only then did fear let me
go.

FIRST LADY PUSHES ISSUE OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS DURING SHANGHAI SPEECH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Standing prim in pink before an auditorium
filled with the Shanghai Women's Federation, Hillary Rodham Clinton
echoed a Chinese maxim: Women hold up half the sky.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where sons are prized and daughters neglected, she
made her case on the need to value women, to educate them, to
provide legal rights, to stop violence and abuse in their homes,
and to allow them the freedom to plan their own families _ a quiet
reference to forced abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women can only hold up half the sky when their feet are
planted firmly on the soil of freedom and equal justice,'' she told
the 450 Chinese women gathered at the Shanghai Library auditorium.
Her daughter, Chelsea, and her mother, Dorothy, also were in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Here and on her travels through the world, Hillary Clinton has
used symbols and substance to carve a new role in foreign policy
for a first lady, pushing the issue of women's rights onto the
administration's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great privileges of my position is to travel on
behalf of my country. Wherever I go, I speak with women and
girls,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said that no matter what nation we live in, we face the
same challenges, and dream the same dreams. We all hope for the day
when no woman is a victim of domestic abuse and other forms of
violence. When no woman is the victim of economic discrimination.
When no woman is denied the basic rights of health care and
education.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a message the first lady has taken to Argentina, where she
spoke in favor of reproductive rights to the loud cheers of women
opposed to that nation's restrictive abortion laws. In Africa, she
voiced support for women's efforts to stop the custom of female
genital mutilation. And she has urged families to stop selling
their daughters into prostitution in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are issues that are included in our foreign policy.
These are not marginal issues. These are very central issues. What
she does is validate the good that is going on,'' said Melanne
Verveer, the first lady's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   A White House aide said the best example of the first lady's
influence on foreign policy was the president's 11-day journey to
Africa, in which he retraced many of her stops from the previous
year. It was at the first lady's behest that the president visited
small villages where women operate microcredit programs that
provide small loans to women to set up their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And Hillary Clinton's remarks occasionally have a stronger
reverberation in a country than the president's.
</P>
<P>
   Last October in Buenos Aires, she told several hundred
applauding women that ``access to quality health care _ especially
family planning and reproductive health services _ is crucial to
advancing the progress of women.'' The comment was considered
especially daring in Argentina, which is 90 percent Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of that speech, Hillary, who was not well known,
became very popular,'' said Ana Baron, a journalist with the
Argentina newspaper Clarin.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, there also was a demand from women who wanted to
see the first lady. ``Everybody wanted to see her. They all
recognize her talents,'' said Julie Prado, a Chinese-born U.S.
citizen helping with the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai Women's Federation is an association of about 1,000
professional women who sat quietly throughout Hillary Clinton's
address. The first lady also has visited a girls school, a
children's medical center and a women's retraining facility for
those needing new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In China, the first lady also has been paired with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in meeting with women lawyers and
professors at Peking University in Beijing and touring a restored
synagogue in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, called the pairing a
``happy coincidence.'' But the joint appearances also present a
powerful symbol for women in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   But even overseas, where she draws huge crowds, her bitterness
at scandal and criticism in Washington, D.C., comes through. When
she and the president had a discussion session with Shanghai
community leaders she was asked about the restrictions on her
personal life because of her public role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often refer to my life before the White House when I was a
`real person' because then we are in a position like this, people,
particularly all these people with their pencils and their cameras,
try to record everything you do and then they try to put meaning
into it _ whether you intend the meaning or not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That jab at the U.S. media struck some as inappropriate
considering the Chinese Communist government refuses to allow
freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many women it is a constant challenge to claim your own
identity and your own position and to make clear who you are, as
opposed to society's expectations as to who you should be because
you hold a position of woman novelist, woman law professor, first
lady, or any of the other positions that women hold in any
society,'' she added.

   ``Lucifer's Hammer''
</P>
<P>
   By Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle
</P>
<P>
   Del Ray, 629 pages, $14
</P>
<P>
   THE AUTHORS: Niven and Pournelle are part of sci-fi's old guard,
with an obsession for scientific detail and a loooooong cast of
characters.
</P>
<P>
   THE RELEVANCE: Lucifer's Hammer is about what happens when a
comet hits the Earth. Pretty prescient stuff, considering two of
summer's biggest movies (Deep Impact and Armageddon) are on the
same theme _ and this book was written in 1977. An updated version
published last year notes that, in 20 years, your chances of being
killed by a meteor have risen from 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so what happens when a comet hits the Earth? Tidal waves,
earthquakes, volcanic explosions, floods, another ice age.
California finally falls off; Florida becomes an island. (This
being the '70s, the Russians also launch some nukes in the middle
of all this, just to keep things interesting.)
</P>
<P>
   THE PLOT: Trashy fun in the tradition of other '70s disaster
epics like The Towering Inferno. The surviving scientists, led by
an iron-willed senator, set about rebuilding a sliver of society.
Not always easy: They wind up defending a nuclear power plant
against an army of cannibals.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOVIE PITCH: Imagine if Tom Clancy wrote sci-fi _ and sex
scenes.
</P>

`BURN RATE': INVESTING IN INTERNET AS CURE FOR OPTIMISM

<P>
   ``Burn Rate,'' the title of Michael Wolff's caustically comic
report on the new-media business, refers to ``the money a company
spends each month exceeding its revenues,'' or the rate at which it
is headed for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Subtitled ``How I Survived the Gold Rush Years on the
Internet,'' the book tells how Wolff developed a burn rate so
incendiary that, paradoxically, he almost became rich beyond the
dreams of avarice.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   A writer by profession (``White Kids'' and, with Peter Rutten
and Chip Bayers, ``Where We Stand: Can America Make It in the
Global Race for Wealth, Health and Happiness''), Wolff in 1990
started a business to develop ideas for books, magazines and
television.
</P>
<P>
   Then two things happened. He re-encountered Louis Rossetto, a
haunted expatriate visionary who believed that computers were going
to change the whole idea of what print is and who thought that his
magazine, eventually to be called Wired, would do for technology
what Rolling Stone had done for rock music and Playboy for sex.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Internet came into existence, promising to
become as revolutionary a new medium as radio and television were
in their time.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by both these developments, Wolff came to believe that
however this new medium developed, it was going to demand content.
So he created guides to the Internet and the Web sites called Your
Personal Clock and Netclock. His company grew so fast that
expenditures began to outpace profits, creating his so-called burn
rate.
</P>
<P>
   But his Internet business was hot in another sense as well. A
Wall Street Journal feature on Wolff attracted Robert Machinist, an
investment banker he had known in college, who now told him, ``I'm
willing to share with you my personal goal, which is to do a public
offering north of $200 million.''
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of the wheeling and dealing that followed, Machinist
further said to Wolff, ``I want you to give a building to the
college.'' He added, ``We can call it the Wolff Center for New
Media.''
</P>
<P>
   How these sand castles turned into mud is the subject of Wolff's
satirical narrative, based on notes he took in board meetings and
fired by his determination to write what he calls ``a sort of
anti-press release'' to counteract the natural tendency of a new
industry to spin itself optimistically.
</P>
<P>
   As things fell apart, as the ``poetry of money in motion''
turned into angry recriminations, Wolff felt himself becoming a
potential meal in a business where everything happened so fast
people believed, ``If you eat lunch, you are lunch.'' Gradually he
descended to a depth where, he said, ``I saw my circle in hell. I
would never be able to stop negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than the story of his struggle for survival, Wolff's
account is about how the Internet beguiled everyone who failed to
understand it: how, Wolff writes, Time Warner plunged ``so
precipitously into a business it knew nothing about'' that the word
``spread quickly up and down the Silicon Valley peninsula that
there was a new dumbest in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   How CMP Media, a Long Island publisher of computer magazines,
all but bought the Brooklyn Bridge from the author. And how America
Online, which he calls ``the most dysfunctional company in
America,'' succeeded in becoming mighty despite itself, mainly
because, Wolff argues, it was a place where people could engage one
another sexually in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sex stuff is, really, new,'' he writes, ``a paradigm
shift. For one thing, you have ordinary people, millions of
ordinary people, engaged in a narrative enterprise. Writing
dialogue, crafting descriptions, setting scenes, developing
characters. You have real dramatic engagements. It's a new form of
story, of the written word, of the way we communicate fantasies,
desires, aspirations. I'm serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Wolff wore out and began to have doubts about the
future of the Internet. He defines it in dynamic terms: ``It was a
speeded up version of culture itself, a series of fads and trends
mixing with social and historical and economic forces and
technological advances and roiled by constant upheaval and sudden
reversals.'' But he wonders if it is truly a medium of
communication in the sense that radio and television are.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe businesses trying to master the Internet were wasting
their time. After all, he writes, ``I'm not sure any two people
came away from the Net having had anything close to similar
experiences; that is, gotten the same message.'' He continues,
``Much like the telephone, the Internet was an instrument through
which we were all finding we could exercise a highly individual and
idiosyncratic control over the messages we were getting.''
</P>
<P>
   You got them when you wanted to get them, not when someone
wanted to serve them up to you. ``And lastly, and most importantly,
you could, if you wanted, make your voice as powerful as any other.
You could send your own message. Good for you. God save us.''
</P>
<P>
   The time had come for him to get out of what he was beginning to
see as a losing game. Still, the field remains wide open. ``Nobody
knows what's going on. The technology people don't know. The
content people don't know. The money people don't know. Whatever we
agree on today will be disputed tomorrow. Whoever is leading today,
I can say with absolute certainty, will be adrift or transformed
some number of months from now.'' He concludes: ``It's a kind of
anarchy. A strangely level playing field. The Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   And if his amusing book is a fair reflection, civilization has
not yet even begun to arrive.

   ``The Kingdom of the Cults''
</P>
<P>
   By Walter Martin
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Hank Hanegraaff
</P>
<P>
   Bethany House, $29.99
</P>
<P>
   Even the sturdiest structures need occasional repair and
renovation, and major books on controversial topics are no
different _ thus, the updated and expanded edition of Walter
Martin's classic ``The Kingdom of the Cults.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who died in 1989, sees a ``cult'' as a religious group
that differs significantly from those regarded as normative in a
culture and, more important, as one gathered around a particular
misinterpretation of the Bible. About one-third of this massive
volume criticizes the theology of Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons and
Christian Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism and Islam are discussed as world religions rather than
cults per se. Other topics are ``mind control,'' apocalyptic groups
such as the Branch Davidians, and the Word Faith movement
(represented in Tarrant County by Kenneth Copeland, who is quoted
as saying that God is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 200
pounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kingdom of the Cults'' is a frequently blunt but heavily
researched examination of out-of-the-mainstream theology. The
revised edition (complete with a CD-ROM) brings new and worthwhile
material to light.

   ``Love Is an Action Word''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   CGI Records
</P>
<P>
   Witness is Laeh Page, Lisa Brooks, Ayana Thomas and Candice
Smith, a well-regarded Detroit group that for the past 12 years has
fused light urban pop, a hint of mellow jazz and direct gospel
messages into something strong and subtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Is an Action Word'' is the group's first CD in two years,
and it is a worthy follow-up. The overall sound _ frothy, easygoing
pop/gospel _ always goes down easy, but this is one of the
quartet's best selections of songs. Working again with
producer/writer Michael Brooks (a former member of Commissioned),
the four have fashioned a CD chock-full of cool harmonies, a few
nods to the gentler side of '70s funk (check the drifting guitar on
``I'll Reign),'' and bright, full harmonies. And saxophonist David
McMurray adds some breezy touches, most notably on the easygoing
``Justified by Faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the group does a laudable job of balancing pop and
forthright messages of devotion to God. ``Never Let Go, Faith'' and
``Resting in Him,'' among others, have a light touch but a firm
grasp on conveying messages of persistence and trust in God. Mellow
but never sappy or slight, ``Love Is an Action Word'' is a solid,
consistently pleasant effort.

 By CLAIRE POOLE, with GREG BROWN in Santiago, BRENDAN M. CASE in
Mexico City, MERY GALANTERNICK in Rio de Janeiro and ANDREA
MANDELL-CAMPBELL in Buenos Aires 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    For evidence that Latin America's banking industry is less than
exuberant, consider the case of Chilean Gonzalo Marin. A
26-year-old computer executive, Marin recently decided to buy a
US$60,000 apartment in Santiago. In the past, he had little trouble
getting credit to buy two new cars, so he thought getting a
mortgage would be a snap.
 &HT;    Not exactly. His lender, Citibank, told him it would take a
month to get a mortgage. The process ended up taking three months.
While he was waiting, interest rates went up. By the time the
mortgage went through, Marin's initial payment had quintupled from
$660 to almost $3,300. ``Part of it's bad luck _ the market went
down. But part of the problem was in their delay,'' Marin says.
``It left a bad taste in my mouth.''
 &HT;    Compared with some of his neighbors in other countries, Marin
was lucky to get a mortgage at all. While the availability of
credit has improved a little since the 1994 Mexico peso devaluation
sent interest rates sky high and sapped consumer spending across
the region, Latin America's banks are still keeping a tight hold on
their purse strings. That's actually a good thing in this
topsy-turvy region, which seems to go from boom to bust every
couple of years. But if these countries have learned anything, it's
that the weaker the banking system, the harder a country will fall
when an economic crisis strikes. ``If the banking system is strong,
the crisis is very, very mild,'' says Jose Garcia-Cantera, a
respected Latin America bank analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New
York. ``It only becomes a crisis if the banking system becomes the
weakest link in the chain.'' Most of the region's banking systems
are trying to reinforce their links. They're tightening their
belts, strengthening their balance sheets and adopting new
technologies. They're also beginning to diversify into
higher-margin financial services, such as insurance and asset
management.
 &HT;    Some of the impetus has come from competition _ namely, from
foreign banks that continue to invade Latin America's banking
systems. Spanish banks like Banco Santander, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
(BBV) and Banco Central Hispano (BCH) have been the most
aggressive. But U.K.-based Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
(HSBC) has also moved in, as has Holland's ABN-Amro Bank and
Canada's Bank of Montreal. Only a few U.S. banks have tested the
waters, primarily Citibank, BankBoston and Chase Manhattan.
 &HT;    Conservative Chile. In the early 1980s, a financial collapse
similar to Mexico's 1994 currency crisis drove control of Chile's
banks into the hands of its central bank.
 &HT;    A few issues remain, but most of Chile's banks have recovered _
or were swallowed up in mergers. They are now aggressively delving
into consumer credit markets to regain public trust and dependable
bottom lines.
 &HT;    Today there are 31 banking-sector entities, 17 of which are
foreign-owned commercial banks, among them Banco Santander and
Citibank. Chilean banks are well-disciplined compared with most in
Latin America and are comparable to U.S. institutions in terms of
safeguards for investors and depositors. In part, the discipline
springs from strict regulations imposed during the military
government after the 1982-1983 collapse. This makes Chile's banks
safe but extremely conservative in an otherwise freewheeling
economy. Despite recent passage of a new law that allows commercial
banks to diversify into insurance, factoring and foreign lending,
most banks have taken a wait-and-see attitude.
 &HT;    Conservatism, however, has its virtues. Bad loans totaled only
about 1 percent of all loans, while loan growth has registered 11.6
percent per year over the 1990s, according to a study by Chilean
think tank Sociedad de Fomento Fabril (Sofofa). Return on equity
rose by 18.3 percent per year between 1990 and 1995.
 &HT;    Chile's bank regulator, the Association of Banks and Financial
Institutions, reports total bank loans rose almost 60 percent
between 1994 and 1997 to $45 billion. Earnings, meanwhile, have
been less stellar, but steady, increasing nearly 37 percent to $3
billion over the same period. Initially, Chile's banks were hit
hard by the Asian crisis. But they recovered quickly, leading to
first-quarter 1998 results that surpassed analysts' expectations.
 &HT;    Underbanked Argentina: Conditions are a little more tense in
Argentina's banking sector. Scenes of irate customers and
out-of-work employees protesting before the closed doors of the
defunct Banco Patricios are all too familiar to Argentines, who
have experienced first hand the turbulent past of the country's
banking sector. It's one of the main reasons Argentina remains the
most ``underbanked'' countries in Latin America, with a
deposits-to-gross-domestic-product ratio of a meager 22 percent.
 &HT;    Since August, Argentina's central bank has suspended three banks
over insolvency and fraud issues. Financial problems within the
Spanish-Swiss investment group, Socimer, led to the closure of its
two banks: Medefin-UNB in February and Banco Patricios in March.
Added to the scandal-ridden closure of the Banco de Credito
Provincial de la Plata, some $791 million in deposits and an
estimated 300,000 accounts have been affected.
 &HT;    Yet, despite the bad apples, the sector remains one of the most
dynamic and open in the Argentine economy, according to a recent
report by brokerage firm Santander Investment. ``This is not an
indication of the health of the system,'' says Carlos Gomez Lopez,
an analyst for CS First Boston in New York. ``The central bank is
keeping a watchful eye and the big banks are very, very solid.''
The sector has become increasingly sound under the tutelage of
foreign investors, whose deep pockets have managed to scoop up most
of the country's major banks in the last year and a half. The
Spanish have led the way, with BBV acquiring and merging Banco
Frances with Bnco de Credito Argentino, while arch rival Banco
Santander picked up Banco Rio de la Plata.
 &HT;    As a result, the number of Argentine banks has dropped from 205
in December 1994 to 139 currently. The foreign invasion _ and the
flight to quality after the 1994 Mexican peso devaluation _ has
resulted in 20 of the top banks controlling 75 percent of the
market. The consolidation is expected to continue. According to the
central bank, 15 banks merged or were liquidated in the last two
years. More are expected to come by 2000. Analysts predict the
sector will be pared down to about 50 banks. As for the rest, ``I'd
be surprised if they survive the next five years,'' says Malcolm
Gibson, an analyst at HSBC Roberts Capital Markets in Buenos Aires.
Investors are encouraged by promising growth prospects in
Argentina's retail banking sector. Since 1990, deposits have jumped
from $11 billion to $71.4 billion, or an accumulated annual rate of
25.6 percent, while loans have increased by 17.5 percent a year.
Since last November, an estimated 1.9 million new accounts have
been created due to a new government regulation making it mandatory
for companies with 100 or more employees to issue paychecks through
ATMs. In a bid to capture this dynamic growth, banks have embarked
on an aggressive expansion plan. Over the next two to four years,
the number of bank branches in Argentina is expected to nearly
double from 4,000 _ one of the lowest in the world _ to almost
8,000. Last year alone, the central bank received a record 600
applications to open new branches, while between 250 and 300 ATMs
are opening every month. Among the most ambitious are the
Spaniards, with BBV planning to double its branches from 200 to
400. Banco Rio has signed a deal with the country's leading oil
company, YPF, to open 100 branches in gas stations.
 &HT;    The focus on the retail sector and the growing competition have
made banks increasingly accessible to the population, according to
CS First Boston's Gomez Lopez. Interest rates on loans, for
example, which reached 85.8 percent in 1990, now average around 8.6
percent. In fact, private-sector loans now amount to $61.5 billion,
representing 20 percent of GDP. Mortgage rates have come down, too,
from 17 percent before the Mexican economic crisis to below 11
percent. ``The central bank is particularly keen on increasing
bancarization [expansion of the retail banking sector],'' he says.
While banks boosted the peso prime lending rate by as much as 60
percent during the Asian crisis, those rates have rapidly returned
to normal, Gomez Lopez says. ``It's almost as if the crisis didn't
happen. The sector is healthy, it's growing, it's liquid, it has an
enormous potential for expansion and it's very interesting.'' The
industry is now waiting for the proposed privatization of
Argentina's biggest bank, Banco de la Nacion, which is expected to
bring in anywhere between $3 billion and $4 billion when it's sold
off next year or the year after. While the banking sector welcomes
the move, many point out that the institution provides
government-subsidized loans to agricultural producers and small
companies that would not otherwise qualify for financial
assistance. Those would probably stop under private ownership.
 &HT;    Brazil bounces back. Brazil's banking sector has also had a
rough ride. In 1994, Brazilian banks had it made. With inflation
running around 2,000 percent in 1994, earning money on what came in
and what went out was a piece of cake.
 &HT;    But after President Fernando Henrique Cardoso tightened Brazil's
monetary policy through the Real Plan, banks lost their ability to
make money on inflation spreads. So many had to relearn basic
banking skills, such as how to squeeze profits out of lending and
deposit-taking. It soon became survival of the fittest. Between
1995 and 1997, nearly 100 financial institutions, including 50
banks, disappeared, either because of bad management, corruption or
fraud. The cost of private bank failures to the government amounted
to $21 billion. State banks were also affected. Due to years of
losses, Brazil's central bank took over two of the biggest
state-owned banks. Rio de Janeiro-based Banerj was eventually
restructured and sold to Itau Bank in 1997 for $300 million. In
1994, Sao Paulo-based Banespa was transferred to federal control as
part of an agreement to restructure the Sao Paulo state debt. It is
now being readied for privatization, which is scheduled to take
place later this year. Last year, foreign banks began to invade.
HSBC bought the banking assets of Banco Bamerindus do Brasil S.A.,
Brazil's fifth-largest private bank, for $1 billion. The
announcement marked a turning point in the consolidation of
Brazil's banking industry. It also showed the government's new
willingness to allow foreign investors to take a prominent role in
the country's banking sector. After that, a series of acquisitions
were announced in 1997, including a 50 percent acquisition of
investment bank Multiplic by Lloyd's TSB for $600 million and 51
percent of Banco Geral do Comercio by Banco Santander for $100
million.
 &HT;    And in late April this year, BBV announced the $450 million
acquisition of 55 percent of Banco Excel Economico. The number of
foreign bank branches authorized by the central bank jumped from
200 in 1995 to 2000 in 1998 and the volume of foreign groups'
assets increased from 10 percent to 16 percent of the country's
banking assets.
 &HT;    After four years of dramatic restructuring, Brazil's banking
industry is about to gain momentum. But the strength of foreign
banks is posing a sticky problem to local banks. How to face this
fierce competition?
 &HT;    The biggest private-sector banks have already adjusted by
adopting conservative lending policies, investing in technology,
reducing costs through layoffs and charging for previously free
services. Service fees, freed from central bank control in 1996,
are an increasingly important part of their income. Despite the
discomfort, Brazil's banking sector is now better off.
 &HT;    ``Competition is very healthy because it will force banks to
offer better services at lower costs,'' says Mario Coelho, director
of Austin Asis, a Sao Paulo-based consulting firm that specializes
in risk analysis.
 &HT;    Watch for more banks to disappear, be acquired or merge.
According to three different banking analysts, there are still too
many banks in Brazil _ more than 200 at last count. Smaller banks
are expected to be swallowed up by bigger banks. These new
alliances will offer a wider range of financial products, from cash
management to securities trading to underwriting.
 &HT;    The Asian crisis last October forced the government to take
harsh measures to protect its currency. Among those measures,
interest rates were doubled to nearly 40 percent. As a result,
neither low-paid workers nor small businessmen dared to borrow from
banks. The worry was needless. The government gradually reduced
rates again, from 34 percent to 28 percent and to 23.25 percent at
press time. But Brazilians' memories run deep. ``[In 1997] I
borrowed $250 to buy a vacuum cleaner. After 12 installments, I
realized I had paid back $490,'' says Ana Maria de Andrade, a
29-year-old Rio de Janeiro housekeeper. ``Never more in my life
[do] I want to go through such an experience.''
 &HT;    Mexico moving again. Mexico's banks have also been to hell and
back. But they've still got a long way to go. Mexican Finance
Minister Jose Angel Gurria is known for his suave, smooth-talking
style. But when it comes to banks, he does not mince words. The
banking system, he said in recent testimony to Congress, is the
``weakest link in the economic development of Mexico.'' Actually,
compared with any time since the economic crisis of 1995, Mexico's
battered commercial banks are in relatively good shape. Thanks to a
massive government bailout program and huge capital injections by
foreign banks, which have taken stakes in some Mexican banks and
bought others outright, capitalization levels are up and
non-performing loan rates are down.
 &HT;    Credit is still scarce and expensive, with consumer credit
carrying interest rates of about 35 percent _ compared with
expected 1998 inflation ofabout 13 percent _ and commercial loans
carrying interest rates of around 20 percent. But lending to the
non-financial sector is widely expected to grow in real terms this
year for the first time since the crisis. Carlos Gomez y Gomez,
director general of Santander Mexicano and new president of the
Mexican Bankers Association, says real lending could grow by 4
percent or 5 percent this year. Some private-sector analysts are
even more optimistic. Rafael Bello, at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York, reckons lending could grow as much as 10 percent this
year. But such lending is only a small improvement from a very
small base, and banks have become a marginal force in promoting
economic growth.
 &HT;    Nearly all GDP growth since 1994 has come from exports and
investment, with recent improvements in consumption. But large
Mexican exporters and foreign multinationals, which have accounted
for the lion's share of exportsand investment, have access to
cheaper financing abroad. The nascent consumer recovery is based
almost entirely on pent-up demand and savings, not consumer credit,
according to consumer goods analysts.
 &HT;    The lack of competitive domestic financing is already
threatening to upset Mexico's balance of payments, as large
companies have realized they can get better financing terms from
foreign banks or debt markets. Of the $34 billion in Mexican
foreign debt that matures this year, about $18 billion is thought
to be held by the private sector. U.S. rating firm Standard &AMP;
Poor's estimates that the private sector's foreign debt reached
about 40 percent of exports last year, roughly similar to what it
was before the crisis.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, taxpayers will be paying for banks' mistakes for
years. The cost of the bailout was recently raised to about $65
billion. Of the $60 billion in bad loans held by government agency
Fobaproa, Finance Ministry officials think about 30 percent might
be recoverable. Private-sector analysts are less sanguine. No
short-term banking fix seems to be available. But the government is
in the midst of implementing several policies that will promote a
far-reaching restructuring in the banking sector. In a recent
package of reform proposals sent to Congress, the government
proposed lifting the restrictions on foreign ownership of banks.
Foreign banks were allowed to own most Mexican banks before, but
not the three biggest, because each accounts for more than 6
percent of the total capitalization of Mexico's banking system. If
the legislation is passed (which is expected by September 1),
foreigners will legally be able to own the three biggest banks and
will no longer need special permission to own smaller banks.
 &HT;    ``Without a doubt, these are measures that have to do with the
globalization of the Mexican financial system,'' says Gomez y
Gomez. ``They will give more flexibility to Mexican and foreign
investors in the search for solid, profitable financial
institutions.'' Foreign institutions have already picked up stakes
in smaller banks, led by the Spanish. BBV acquired Cremi, Oriente,
Credito and Probursa, Santander bought 51 percent of Banco Mexicano
and BCH owns 20 percent of Bital. Last August, Citibank jumped on
the bandwagon, announcing it would buy Confia for $45 million. Bank
of Nova Scotia owns 10 percent of Inverlat with an option to
acquire 55 percent more. In the meantime, Mexican banks have been
consolidating like crazy. After President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
reprivatized Mexico's banking industry in the early 1990s, bankers
blanketed the country with branches. But after the economic crisis
hit in late 1994, pushing up interest rates and pushing down
purchasing power, demand for financial services fell dramatically.
As a result, Mexico became one of the most ``overbanked'' countries
in the region.
 &HT;    So Mexican banks have been pairing off to achieve economies of
scale. Late last year, GBM Atlantico announced it was being
acquired by Grupo Financiero Bital, creating the fourth-largest
financial institution in Mexico with nearly $14 billion in total
assets. More mergers and acquisitions are expected later this year,
possibly involving a foreign purchase of BanCrecer. Andean
countries. Banking conditions are improving in other parts of Latin
America.
 &HT;    In Peru, loan growth and profitability declined slightly last
year. But past-due loans decreased from 6.7 percent at the end of
1996 to 5.3 percent at the end of 1997. Coverage of past-due loans
has also increased, reaching 88.4 percent, versus 84.9 percent a
year ago. Despite its political problems, Colombia has one of the
strongest banking sectors in Latin America. Last year, the industry
showed loan growth of 33.2 percent, 11.8 percent of which came in
the fourth quarter. However, liquidity declined slightly from 8.8
percent to 9.2 percent and net interest margins narrowed from 7.7
percent to 6.1 percent.
 &HT;    Venezuela is the hot new banking market. [Latin Trade, May
1998]. While the recent decline in oil prices may affect asset
quality, the Venezuelan banking industry is much stronger and
healthier than it was in 1994. For instance, its coverage of
nonperforming loans as of the end of 1997 was 124 percent.
 &HT;    While foreign banks throughout Latin America have brought in
fresh capital, they've also kept Latin American bankers on their
toes, all the better for these countries' fragile economies _ and
their consumers. ``The entrance of foreign institutions is really
going to make a difference,'' Salomon's Garcia-Cantera says. ``At
the end of the day, the whole system is going to be much more
efficient.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    For evidence that Latin America's banking industry is less than
exuberant, consider the case of Chilean Gonzalo Marin. A
26-year-old computer executive, Marin recently decided to buy a
US$60,000 apartment in Santiago. In the past, he had little trouble
getting credit to buy two new cars, so he thought getting a
mortgage would be a snap.
 &HT;    Not exactly. His lender, Citibank, told him it would take a
month to get a mortgage. The process ended up taking three months.
While he was waiting, interest rates went up. By the time the
mortgage went through, Marin's initial payment had quintupled from
$660 to almost $3,300. ``Part of it's bad luck _ the market went
down. But part of the problem was in their delay,'' Marin says.
``It left a bad taste in my mouth.''
 &HT;    Compared with some of his neighbors in other countries, Marin
was lucky to get a mortgage at all. While the availability of
credit has improved a little since the 1994 Mexico peso devaluation
sent interest rates sky high and sapped consumer spending across
the region, Latin America's banks are still keeping a tight hold on
their purse strings. That's actually a good thing in this
topsy-turvy region, which seems to go from boom to bust every
couple of years. But if these countries have learned anything, it's
that the weaker the banking system, the harder a country will fall
when an economic crisis strikes. ``If the banking system is strong,
the crisis is very, very mild,'' says Jose Garcia-Cantera, a
respected Latin America bank analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New
York. ``It only becomes a crisis if the banking system becomes the
weakest link in the chain.'' Most of the region's banking systems
are trying to reinforce their links. They're tightening their
belts, strengthening their balance sheets and adopting new
technologies. They're also beginning to diversify into
higher-margin financial services, such as insurance and asset
management.
 &HT;    Some of the impetus has come from competition _ namely, from
foreign banks that continue to invade Latin America's banking
systems. Spanish banks like Banco Santander, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
(BBV) and Banco Central Hispano (BCH) have been the most
aggressive. But U.K.-based Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp.
(HSBC) has also moved in, as has Holland's ABN-Amro Bank and
Canada's Bank of Montreal. Only a few U.S. banks have tested the
waters, primarily Citibank, BankBoston and Chase Manhattan.
 &HT;    Conservative Chile. In the early 1980s, a financial collapse
similar to Mexico's 1994 currency crisis drove control of Chile's
banks into the hands of its central bank.
 &HT;    A few issues remain, but most of Chile's banks have recovered _
or were swallowed up in mergers. They are now aggressively delving
into consumer credit markets to regain public trust and dependable
bottom lines.
 &HT;    Today there are 31 banking-sector entities, 17 of which are
foreign-owned commercial banks, among them Banco Santander and
Citibank. Chilean banks are well-disciplined compared with most in
Latin America and are comparable to U.S. institutions in terms of

rose by 18.3 percent per year between 1990 and 1995.

between 1994 and 1997 to $45 billion. Earnings, meanwhile, have

Added to the scandal-ridden closure of the Banco de Credito

Investors are encouraged by promising growth prospects in
Argentina's retail banking sector. Since 1990, deposits have jumped
from $11 billion to $71.4 billion, or an accumulated annual rate of
25.6 percent, while loans have increased by 17.5 percent a year.
Since last November, an estimated 1.9 million new accounts have
been created due to a new government regulation making it mandatory
for companies with 100 or more employees to issue paychecks through
ATMs. In a bid to capture this dynamic growth, banks have embarked
on an aggressive expansion plan. Over the next two to four years,
the number of bank branches in Argentina is expected to nearly
double from 4,000 _ one of the lowest in the world _ to almost
8,000. Last year alone, the central bank received a record 600
applications to open new branches, while between 250 and 300 ATMs
are opening every month. Among the most ambitious are the
Spaniards, with BBV planning to double its branches from 200 to
400. Banco Rio has signed a deal with the country's leading oil
company, YPF, to open 100 branches in gas stations.
 &HT;    The focus on the retail sector and the growing competition have
made banks increasingly accessible to the population, according to

example, which reached 85.8 percent in 1990, now average around 8.6

representing 20 percent of GDP. Mortgage rates have come down, too,
from 17 percent before the Mexican economic crisis to below 11

bancarization [expansion of the retail banking sector],'' he says.
While banks boosted the peso prime lending rate by as much as 60

enormous potential for expansion and it's very interesting.'' The
industry is now waiting for the proposed privatization of
Argentina's biggest bank, Banco de la Nacion, which is expected to

off next year or the year after. While the banking sector welcomes
the move, many point out that the institution provides
government-subsidized loans to agricultural producers and small
companies that would not otherwise qualify for financial
assistance. Those would probably stop under private ownership.
 &HT;    Brazil bounces back. Brazil's banking sector has also had a

 &HT;    And in late April this year, BBV announced the $450 million
acquisition of 55 percent of Banco Excel Economico. The number of
foreign bank branches authorized by the central bank jumped from
200 in 1995 to 2000 in 1998 and the volume of foreign groups'
assets increased from 10 percent to 16 percent of the country's
banking assets.
 &HT;    After four years of dramatic restructuring, Brazil's banking
industry is about to gain momentum. But the strength of foreign
banks is posing a sticky problem to local banks. How to face this
fierce competition?
 &HT;    The biggest private-sector banks have already adjusted by
adopting conservative lending policies, investing in technology,
reducing costs through layoffs and charging for previously free
services. Service fees, freed from central bank control in 1996,
are an increasingly important part of their income. Despite the
discomfort, Brazil's banking sector is now better off.
 &HT;    ``Competition is very healthy because it will force banks to
offer better services at lower costs,'' says Mario Coelho, director
of Austin Asis, a Sao Paulo-based consulting firm that specializes
in risk analysis.
 &HT;    Watch for more banks to disappear, be acquired or merge.
According to three different banking analysts, there are still too
many banks in Brazil _ more than 200 at last count. Smaller banks
are expected to be swallowed up by bigger banks. These new
alliances will offer a wider range of financial products, from cash
management to securities trading to underwriting.
 &HT;    The Asian crisis last October forced the government to take
harsh measures to protect its currency. Among those measures,
interest rates were doubled to nearly 40 percent. As a result,
neither low-paid workers nor small businessmen dared to borrow from
banks. The worry was needless. The government gradually reduced
rates again, from 34 percent to 28 percent and to 23.25 percent at
press time. But Brazilians' memories run deep. ``[In 1997] I
borrowed $250 to buy a vacuum cleaner. After 12 installments, I
realized I had paid back $490,'' says Ana Maria de Andrade, a
29-year-old Rio de Janeiro housekeeper. ``Never more in my life
[do] I want to go through such an experience.''
 &HT;    Mexico moving again. Mexico's banks have also been to hell and
back. But they've still got a long way to go. Mexican Finance
Minister Jose Angel Gurria is known for his suave, smooth-talking
style. But when it comes to banks, he does not mince words. The
banking system, he said in recent testimony to Congress, is the
``weakest link in the economic development of Mexico.'' Actually,
compared with any time since the economic crisis of 1995, Mexico's
battered commercial banks are in relatively good shape. Thanks to a
massive government bailout program and huge capital injections by
foreign banks, which have taken stakes in some Mexican banks and
bought others outright, capitalization levels are up and
non-performing loan rates are down.
 &HT;    Credit is still scarce and expensive, with consumer credit
carrying interest rates of about 35 percent _ compared with
expected 1998 inflation ofabout 13 percent _ and commercial loans
carrying interest rates of around 20 percent. But lending to the
non-financial sector is widely expected to grow in real terms this
year for the first time since the crisis. Carlos Gomez y Gomez,
director general of Santander Mexicano and new president of the
Mexican Bankers Association, says real lending could grow by 4
percent or 5 percent this year. Some private-sector analysts are
even more optimistic. Rafael Bello, at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York, reckons lending could grow as much as 10 percent this
year. But such lending is only a small improvement from a very
small base, and banks have become a marginal force in promoting
economic growth.
 &HT;    Nearly all GDP growth since 1994 has come from exports and
investment, with recent improvements in consumption. But large
Mexican exporters and foreign multinationals, which have accounted
for the lion's share of exportsand investment, have access to
cheaper financing abroad. The nascent consumer recovery is based
almost entirely on pent-up demand and savings, not consumer credit,
according to consumer goods analysts.
 &HT;    The lack of competitive domestic financing is already
threatening to upset Mexico's balance of payments, as large
companies have realized they can get better financing terms from
foreign banks or debt markets. Of the $34 billion in Mexican
foreign debt that matures this year, about $18 billion is thought
to be held by the private sector. U.S. rating firm Standard &AMP;
Poor's estimates that the private sector's foreign debt reached
about 40 percent of exports last year, roughly similar to what it
was before the crisis.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, taxpayers will be paying for banks' mistakes for
years. The cost of the bailout was recently raised to about $65
billion. Of the $60 billion in bad loans held by government agency
Fobaproa, Finance Ministry officials think about 30 percent might
be recoverable. Private-sector analysts are less sanguine. No
short-term banking fix seems to be available. But the government is
in the midst of implementing several policies that will promote a
far-reaching restructuring in the banking sector. In a recent
package of reform proposals sent to Congress, the government
proposed lifting the restrictions on foreign ownership of banks.
Foreign banks were allowed to own most Mexican banks before, but
not the three biggest, because each accounts for more than 6
percent of the total capitalization of Mexico's banking system. If
the legislation is passed (which is expected by September 1),
foreigners will legally be able to own the three biggest banks and
will no longer need special permission to own smaller banks.
 &HT;    ``Without a doubt, these are measures that have to do with the
globalization of the Mexican financial system,'' says Gomez y
Gomez. ``They will give more flexibility to Mexican and foreign
investors in the search for solid, profitable financial
institutions.'' Foreign institutions have already picked up stakes
in smaller banks, led by the Spanish. BBV acquired Cremi, Oriente,
Credito and Probursa, Santander bought 51 percent of Banco Mexicano
and BCH owns 20 percent of Bital. Last August, Citibank jumped on
the bandwagon, announcing it would buy Confia for $45 million. Bank
of Nova Scotia owns 10 percent of Inverlat with an option to
acquire 55 percent more. In the meantime, Mexican banks have been
consolidating like crazy. After President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
reprivatized Mexico's banking industry in the early 1990s, bankers
blanketed the country with branches. But after the economic crisis
hit in late 1994, pushing up interest rates and pushing down
purchasing power, demand for financial services fell dramatically.
As a result, Mexico became one of the most ``overbanked'' countries
in the region.
 &HT;    So Mexican banks have been pairing off to achieve economies of
scale. Late last year, GBM Atlantico announced it was being
acquired by Grupo Financiero Bital, creating the fourth-largest
financial institution in Mexico with nearly $14 billion in total
assets. More mergers and acquisitions are expected later this year,
possibly involving a foreign purchase of BanCrecer. Andean
countries. Banking conditions are improving in other parts of Latin
America.
 &HT;    In Peru, loan growth and profitability declined slightly last
year. But past-due loans decreased from 6.7 percent at the end of
1996 to 5.3 percent at the end of 1997. Coverage of past-due loans
has also increased, reaching 88.4 percent, versus 84.9 percent a
year ago. Despite its political problems, Colombia has one of the
strongest banking sectors in Latin America. Last year, the industry
showed loan growth of 33.2 percent, 11.8 percent of which came in
the fourth quarter. However, liquidity declined slightly from 8.8
percent to 9.2 percent and net interest margins narrowed from 7.7
percent to 6.1 percent.
 &HT;    Venezuela is the hot new banking market. [Latin Trade, May
1998]. While the recent decline in oil prices may affect asset
quality, the Venezuelan banking industry is much stronger and
healthier than it was in 1994. For instance, its coverage of
nonperforming loans as of the end of 1997 was 124 percent.
 &HT;    While foreign banks throughout Latin America have brought in
fresh capital, they've also kept Latin American bankers on their
toes, all the better for these countries' fragile economies _ and
their consumers. ``The entrance of foreign institutions is really
going to make a difference,'' Salomon's Garcia-Cantera says. ``At
the end of the day, the whole system is going to be much more
efficient.''

 &HT;    AIDS is hard to treat if patients stop taking their medication
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geneva _ The failure of HIV patients to correctly and
consistently take their medication is the greatest obstacle in
curing AIDS with drugs, leading AIDS researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies presented at the 12th World AIDS Conference show
that people with HIV who don't adhere to their prescribed drug
regimens often become resistant to the drugs, creating tough new
strains of the virus that then become very difficult to treat.
</P>
<P>
   And once patients become resistant to a particular drug, other
drugs in the same class also tend to be ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite clear that incomplete adherence represents the
single most important challenge to long-term effectiveness of
currently available regimens,'' Dr. Julio Montaner of Vancouver
said Wednesday. Montaner heads AIDS research at St. Paul's
Hospital/University of British Columbia.''Overwhelmingly, the
patient's ability to take the drugs dictates the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports emerged as the first known case of a patient being
infected with a strain of HIV resistant to the most powerful new
anti-viral drugs was reported by San Francisco AIDS specialists.
Scientists at the conference in Geneva said the case could mark an
ominous new turn in the global epidemic that has already claimed
more than 10 million lives.
</P>
<P>
   The mutated strain of the AIDS virus, seemingly impervious to
protease inhibitors and older anti-virals now in use, was found in
a newly infected patient at San Francisco General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be seeing an emerging and dangerous edge to the
epidemic,'' said Dr. Frederick Hecht of the University of
California at San Francisco, who delivered the report on the
disheartening case.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted by researchers at the University of Geneva
found similar drug-resistant strains of HIV in six of 57 male
patients, who, like the San Francisco patient, contracted the virus
through unprotected sex. A report on those cases was presented by
Dr. Sabine Yerly of the university's virology laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Montaner said treatment regimens and schedules must be made
easier and more tolerable for patients to protect the potency of
existing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Those taking three-drug combinations with protease inhibitors,
the most powerful class of anti-HIV drugs, must take pills up to
five times a day and must schedule their meals so they can take
some pills with food and some without. Skipping a dose or taking it
incorrectly could decrease the level of drug in the patients blood,
and in turn would give HIV an opportunity to develop resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The protease inhibitor saquinavir, for instance, must be taken
three times a day, six pills per dose, soon after a full meal, or
the body won't absorb as much as it should. Another protease
inhibitor, indinavir, must also be taken three times daily but two
pills at a time, and at least one hour before or two hours after a
meal.
</P>
<P>
   A patient survey presented at the conference showed that a
majority of patients taking such drugs missed a dose at some point
during the three days prior to answering the survey. Many people
with HIV, while thankful for the drugs, say their jobs and
lifestyles make it difficult to keep a rigid dosing schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects share the blame for poor adherence. Nausea and
diarrhea are common. Protease inhibitors can also cause
lipodystrophy, in which fat wastes away from the face, limbs and
upper trunk; cholesterol levels as astonishgly high as 1,000; a
condition called ``buffalo hump,'' in which fat accumulates on the
spine; and type II diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Already drugs are being created or reformulated for less
frequent doses and fewer pills. Efavirenz (Sustiva), a once-a-day
drug manufactured by DuPont, is now pending approval by the U. S.
Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb has reformulated a existing drug,
didanosine, or ddI, into a once-daily pill. This form, called
Videx, is still in testing.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs are being combined into single pills, such as Glaxo
Wellcome's Combivir, which contains two common anti-HIV drugs, AZT
and 3TC. Combivir is designed to be taken one pill at a time, two
times per day, with or without food.
</P>
<P>
   A new experimental drug that has impressed researchers at the
conference is abacavir, which belongs to the same class of drugs as
AZT and 3TC. Abacavir also is a one-tablet, twice-daily formulation
by Glaxo, and has the additional advantage of being relatively slow
to cause resistance. Last week Glaxo asked the FDA for accelerated
approval of abacavir.
</P>
<P>
   Another experimental Glaxo drug, amprenavir, is a new protease
inhibitor that also shows promise.

 &HT;    Dare to bare in newest short shorts
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 5: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixty years ago when Alice Marble stepped onto the court at
Wimbledon wearing shorts, it was a scandalous thing to do. It took
nerve and a sense of the dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a cheeky group such as the Spice Girls is headline news
in their short shorts. And it still takes some nerve and a good
figure to wiggle into a pair.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crop includes tight shorts threaded with spandex, to
hug well-toned bodies perfectly. Looser styles, in cottons, have
drawstring waists.
</P>
<P>
   Best tops are tubes, tanks and camisoles. For a leggier look,
try platform sandals or thick-soled sneakers. Or go flat with
ballet styles or slides.
</P>
<P>
   A few short tips:
</P>
<P>
   -- Short shorts aren't for everyone. Only wear them if you have
small hips and trim legs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't show off too much derriere.
</P>
<P>
   -- Never wear short shorts to the office, even on casual
Fridays. They are strictly leisure wear.

 &HT;    TANKS A LOT!
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY5: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It recently occurred to us that _ to keep spotlighting trends
that appeal to our readers _ we should get out of the office more
to see what people are really wearing. The results of our first
foray, on a jungle-hot day, are as follows. We found a range of
women wearing tank tops. Atlantan Nicole Warren, 21, expressed the
consensus with: ``Tank tops and little skirts or shorts and sandals
... that's all I'm wearing this summer. They make getting dressed
easy. And there's plenty (of tank tops) to choose from.'' Who knows
what we'll discover on our next style safari. But look sharp. The
next subject we turn our camera on could be you.
</P>
<P>
   STYLE POINTS: Tank tops invite the question of what _ if
anything _ to wear under them. Some tanks may be of the right
texture and fabrication to allow less endowed women to go braless.
Wearing two tanks of contrasting colors is another stylish and
modest option. But when wearing a bra under a tank is a must, heed
the advice of Awa Woodf, manager of Bisou-Bisou in Atlanta: ``You
should wear a strapless bra. It looks too tacky if the straps are
showing.'' Unless that's the look you like.

 &HT;    Take your pick: The berries of summer vs. the perils of the
brier patch
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JULY 5: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orchard Hill, Ga.--One of the surest ways of telling a city kid
from a country kid in the South is to ask whether he's been
blackberrying. City kids may not have heard the berry used as a
verb. Country kids have; they know it means long pants and long
sleeves, stickers and chiggers, inky fingertips and pails of
precious berries that catch the sunlight like cut glass.
</P>
<P>
   I am a city kid, and, frankly, blackberries have always
frightened me a little. Not the berries but the bushes, with their
canes and thorns reaching out like long arms and claws. And the
chiggers, legions of red larvae itching to bite your flesh. And
worst of all, the snakes that we were always warned could be a
hiding in the brush, because they like the critters that like the
blackberries.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I love cobbler and preserves as much as the next person,
but the prospect of wading into blackberry thickets seemed kind of
risky to a suburban boy raised on the soft lawns of DeKalb County.
</P>
<P>
   So I was relieved when I phoned Buck Creek Farm, a pick-your-own
place 50 miles south of Atlanta, and heard the man make berry
picking sound almost as easy as grocery shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on down. Our blackberries don't even have thorns. We've
got restrooms, water, picnic tables. Wear shorts if you want to.''
Chuck Aly didn't guarantee that his berries were serpentless, but I
got the picture: This was no Little Shop of Briers.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of picking thornless blackberries in a parklike
setting would have amused generations of Southerners. They took it
as an article of faith that the best-tasting blackberries were wild
and that you had to dress like a beekeeper to extract them from the
inconvenient places where they grew. In ``Sook's Cookbook''
(Longstreet, 1989), Marie Rudisill tells about an old woman in
Monroeville, Ala., who always took a fierce razorback named Red Rip
along when she went into the woods blackberrying. Her reason? ``His
squealing scared the snakes away.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people still think wild blackberries taste better than
domesticated ones. The agricultural experts don't necessarily
agree. They say the two taste about the same, as long as there's
been enough rain. If the weather has been dry, wild berries will be
seedier and less juicy than the irrigated ones on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think wild berries taste better because they have to
sweat and fight those chiggers and rattlesnakes to get them,''
jokes Gerard Krewer, a small-fruit specialist with the University
of Georgia Extension Service in Tifton.
</P>
<P>
   Although blackberries go way back in Southern cooking, they've
never developed into a sizable industry here, perhaps because the
berries are readily available in the wild. By contrast, blueberries
_ more associated with New England cooking _ have become an
industry with its own trade association. Georgia has more than 250
commercial blueberry growers, many of them around the southeast
Georgia town of Alma, where the 24th annual blueberry festival was
held last weekend. The blueberry farmers were sassy enough four
years ago to try to win a statewide property tax exemption from
voters. ``Blackberries, of course, have no lobbyist,'' wrote The
Atlanta Journal's Jim Wooten, who opposed the tax break, having
been a blackberry-eating country boy in McRae before he became an
editor in the big city.
</P>
<P>
   They grow both berries _ black and blue _ at Buck Creek, a
30-acre fruit and Christmas tree farm off Interstate 75 in the
community of Orchard Hill, near Griffin. When my wife and Iarrived
on an overcast Saturday in June, the first day of berry season,
people were already picking at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Aly, a slender 47-year-old in jeans spotted with dark berry
juice, was sitting under a tarpaulin shelter next to a scale and a
stack of white buckets. Farming isn't his regular job; he pays the
bills selling insurance. But he grew up on farms in Florida and
North Carolina, and when he heard Buck Creek was for sale a couple
of years ago, he bought it rather than see it subdivided for home
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to come down here from Atlanta and see things
growing,'' he said. ``We've got a generation of kids who don't know
where their food comes from. We had a woman in here _ she must have
been 32 _ and when I took her to the vegetable garden, she said,
'Wow, I didn't know that's how potatoes grew.'''
</P>
<P>
   I chuckled knowingly, then stopped as it dawned on me that I,
who had never been blackberrying, could be the subject of his next
anecdote.
</P>
<P>
   We grabbed a couple of buckets and headed into the field, where
there were long ranks of blueberry bushes, looking like azaleas
with nandina berries, and half as many blackberries, their leggy
canes trained on stakes and wires to grow in hedgerows. Picking
blueberries is simple, Aly showed us; they're ready when they've
turned from pink to blue-gray. Blackberries are trickier; they go
from plum-red to deep indigo but aren't really ripe until they fall
into the palm at the slightest tug.
</P>
<P>
   I noticed that Luce, his pet hound dog, had followed us and had
her nose stuck in a blueberry bush. ``She eats the blueberries, but
she won't touch the blackberries,'' Aly said. Maybe if dogs could
make cobbler...
</P>
<P>
   Aly left us and we got to work. An hour or so later, we returned
to the weigh stand with two buckets full of berries and fingers the
color of new bluejeans. We had seen Japanese beetles, but no snakes
or chiggers. Aly weighed the produce _ 10 1/2 pounds _ and charged
us $9.70, maybe a fourth what you'd pay at the store. He doesn't
weigh pickers, or we'd have paid twice as much for all the berries
we ate in the field.
</P>
<P>
   While we were settling up, we struck up a conversation with a
couple of regular customers who had clearly never suffered from
brier patch phobia. William and Barbara Yeoman grew up down the
road in Barnesville and have been picking berries all their lives.
``We've been married 13 years, and I don't guess she's bought five
jars of store-bought jelly all that time,'' William said in an
accent as tangy as an unripe blackberry. Barbara smiled bashfully.
``I just like putting things up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   William has a great job for a berry lover; he operates heavy
machinery for the county road department. As he grades dirt roads
way back in the woods, he notes the location of blackberry patches
and muscadine and scuppernong vines. When the time is ripe, he
turns off the machinery, harvests the fruit in his tractor cap and
takes a snack break.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded nice. But the city boy in me wanted to know whether
he'd ever had a close brush with a snake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, snakes love to curl up in the old brier patch. I've
run into them plenty of times. Might near stepped on them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this calmly, as if he were talking about stepping over
the family cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what really got me,'' he continued, ``was the day I ate
too many. Some of them had fermented. I got kind of woozy and had
to sit down in the shade.''
</P>
<P>
   PUI _ picking under the influence. That's one blackberrying
danger I hadn't counted on.

 &HT;    Sugary to cerebral: Angelique, La Bouche rule dance floor
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   La Bouche _ the creation of disco Frankenstein Frank Farian, the
same man who brought you Boney M and Milli Vanilli _ became dance
music darlings in 1996 with the high-energy hits ``Be My Lover''
and ``Sweet Dreams.'' The duo's perfectly credible sophomore
effort, ``SOS,'' offers more proudly synthetic dance grooves, again
lathered with Melanie Thornton's creamy vocals and Lane McCray's
terse raps.
</P>
<P>
   The first single, ``You Won't Forget Me,'' lives up to its name
_ it's a sassy bit of sexual bravado set to a percolating beat.
Alas, the title track isn't a cover of the Abba classic, but,
incredibly, it's almost as catchy. (Dig McCray's sly chant
``dit-dit-dit, dash-dash-dash, dit-dit-dit.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Indians vocalist Angelique wants you to dance as well, but
she has something more ambitious in mind than La Bouche's sugary
melodies. On her solo debut, the exotic-looking Los Angeleno
fashions herself a hip-hop/techno Fiona Apple. The leadoff track,
``Number,'' pulsates with quasi-industrial intensity, while the
slow groove ``Ruby'' employs baroque-sounding strings to tell the
tale of a jilted girl.
</P>
<P>
   For all their differences, though, the two acts occasionally
touch on similar themes. ``I don't want to be just a number,''
Angelique intones on ``Number,'' while on ``You Won't Forget Me,''
Thornton insists, ``I'm better than the rest.'' In the often
faceless world of dance music, La Bouche and Angelique stand out by
celebrating the individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``SOS''

<P>
   La Bouche. RCA.
</P>

 &HT;    Talented pair still mired in the '70s
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1980, no one would have lumped Lionel Richie and Linda
Ronstadt into the same category. She was the loopy-earring queen of
country rock, he the Afro-and-platform-shoe-wearing lead singer of
the Commodores (and, later, a suave solo act). But here we are,
nearly 20 years later, and these two are stuck on the same page of
the baby-boomer musical yearbook like a time-warped ``cutest
couple.'' On their new albums, neither of these onetime superstars
has changed the formula from the days when they ruled pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   Richie tries to upgrade his smooth '70s vibe on ``Zoomin','' the
opening track, which kicks off with the plucky guitar intro from
TLC's ``Don't Go Chasing Waterfalls.'' And there's an ambitious rap
number, ``To the Rhythm,'' that sounds like Mase on Xanex,
delivering over-the-top, fight-the-power lyrics straight out of the
Temps' ``Ball of Confusion.'' But most of these tunes sound like an
echo of Richie's syrupy 1983 love ballad ``Hello.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronstadt sticks equally close to comfort. Her soprano is still
as hauntingly beautiful as in her ``Love Is a Rose'' days, but most
of these tunes are about as fresh as an owl-shaped macrame wall
hanging.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Raitt and Elton John have both proved there can be life
beyond the '70s. Ronstadt and Richie need to clue in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Ran''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ronstadt. Elektra.11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

   Lionel Richie.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury. 12 tracks.

 &HT;    Spinning bare facts into magical `Einstein'
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The facts are bare. In 1986, love letters between Albert
Einstein and physicist Mileva Maric revealed that in 1902 they had
a child out of wedlock. Mileva went home to Serbia to give birth to
Liserl but left the baby behind when she returned to Einstein in
Switzerland, where they eventually married. A 1903 letter mentioned
that Liserl was ill with scarlet fever. Then she was lost to
history, perhaps adopted, perhaps dead. Einstein probably never saw
her.
</P>
<P>
   Anna McGrail transforms fact into magical realism and brings
Liserl's voice to life in this intelligent, engaging novel that
opens in 1910. Adopted by a Hungarian woman, Liserl is 8 when she
meets Mileva for the only time. The child has inherited her
parents' brilliance in mathematics, and Mileva pays for her
education. Liserl craves her biological mother's unavailable love,
then replaces that hunger with a desire for revenge on the father
who rejected her. When she learns that he is Albert Einstein, she
vows to use her mathematical genius to bring him down.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually World War I forces Liserl to leave Hungary with her
teacher, a curious fraulein named Maja, who metamorphoses into many
guises and becomes younger over time, a word never to be used
loosely in a novel about an Einstein. Liserl, unmindful of history,
prefers to formulate a theory of relativity, to muse over the
nature of light. In Berlin, she marries Josef and has two children,
slow-witted Albertina and precocious Paul. In a challenge to
Einstein's pacifism, she works with the Nazis on creating the
atomic bomb. But hers is a Jewish family, and she learns too late
that ``we are condemned to a world that is more and more chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Maja, adopting new identities, leads Liserl safely through time
and space: from London to Los Alamos. There, disguised as a
secretary in 1945, Liserl corrects the physicists' equations as she
types and gives birth to the bomb. History's invisible daughter
finally confronts her famous father on his deathbed and learns that
``we only ever go backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Science, it seems, wrought the Theory of Relativity, but the
Theory of Everything, which Einstein seeks at the end, lies in the
realm of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Einstein''
</P>
<P>
   By Anna McGrail. Norton. $24.95. 333 pages.

 &HT;    Memoirs show life for blacks in the South
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carrie Allen McCray, daughter of African-American activist Mary
Rice Hayes Allen, remembers a photo of a white man on her mother's
bedroom mantel. Only much later did McCray learn that John Robert
Jones, a Confederate general, was her mother's father. It was part
of a ``monstrous history'' about which Mary Allen never spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a researcher interested in the officer, McCray, now
in her mid-80s, has pieced together the family's past. When she was
16, Malinda Rice, a freed slave, went to work in Harrisonburg, Va.,
for Jones' sickly wife. Malinda had two children by the general,
including the light-skinned Mary. Jones went against custom by
acknowledging paternity and supporting his black children, even
after Malinda died at age 29. For this, and for standing by a later
black mistress and their children, he was essentially written out
of Confederate history. But McCray concludes that her mother was
``a child of two (nurturing) worlds'' who learned self-worth from
the general, who was an integral part of her life, and from her
Uncle John, the ex-slave who raised her.
</P>
<P>
   At age 12, Mary began her fight for ``full freedom'' when she
tried unsuccessfully to integrate an ice cream parlor. The general
sent her to Hartshorn Memorial College and she married black
educator Gregory Hayes, who gave her ``the courage to stand up to
governors, mayors, superintendents of schools, managers of stores,
or whoever she felt she had to confront about injustice.'' They had
seven children, and when he died, she took his place as president
of Virginia Seminary for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Mary's second husband, lawyer William P. Allen, with whom she
had three children, including Carrie, took the family north. In New
Jersey, Mary taught her children to fight racism everywhere. She
made a daughter return again and again to a beauty shop that
refused her service until the owner relented.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Rice Hayes Allen emerges as a courageous worker who
believed that education was the road to freedom and that good, if
insistent, would overcome evil. Her life proved that credo true.
McCray's story about her mother is a welcome, important
reconstruction of the shards of history.

<P>
   Southern readers are divided into two types: those whose
families were so changed by the Civil War that it remains of vital
concern to descendants today, and those for whom the conflict is as
distant as the American Revolution. Clay Lewis' memoir will
enthrall the former group, as he shows how the war stamped one
generation after another, so that even 20th-century relationships
are built on residual battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' mother had North Carolina roots, while his father's
family hailed from Mississippi and Oklahoma. After the family
settled in the Washington area, Lewis and his sister grew up in a
dysfunctional home. Lewis' father drank, leading to family
violence, while his mother seemed too aware of their
lower-middle-class status. Over the next few decades, Lewis jumped
in and out of marriages and jobs and struggled with anger and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks answers to the puzzle of himself in the past, delving
into family history all the way back before the Civil War, even
visiting an old abandoned homestead. What he finds, through partial
reconstruction, explains how he became who he is. He discovers that
his inheritance is the giant absence that the war left _ of lives
lost and a kind of life lost, of fathers who didn't return home. He
finds in himself a historical trace of ``a vast inner night that I
possess more truly than I possess anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the book is sometimes overwritten and overwrought,
there is poetry and a touch of Proust in this fine memoir in which
absence is at the heart of history.

 &HT;    Evanovich goes from housewife to romance to mysteries
 &HT;    By Don O'Braint
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A little more than a decade ago, Janet Evanovich was a housewife
and mother of two who was looking for a way to make some extra
income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no writing skills,'' Evanovich says. ``I tried (writing)
children's books and was no good at that.'' She proposed a mystery
series about a female private eye, but publishers weren't
interested. Finally, a friend suggested she try writing romance
novels.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, after churning out bodice-rippers such as
``Back to the Bedroom'' and ``Naughty Neighbor,'' Evanovich decided
it was time to try something different. ``I wanted more action,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired while watching ``Midnight Run'' on television one
night, Evanovich created Stephanie Plum, a New Jersey department
store lingerie buyer turned bounty hunter. Her first novel, ``One
for the Money,'' sold to the movies for nearly $1 million, and
Evanovich was on her way to becoming a best-selling author.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta this week to promote her fourth book, ``Four to
Score'' (St. Martin's, $23.95), Evanovich says she tries to lace
her mysteries with lots of humor.
</P>
<P>
   In the new novel, Stephanie's assignment is to track down Maxine
Nowicki, who stole her boyfriend's car and then jumped bail. After
Stephanie's car is blown up, her apartment firebombed and Maxine's
mother scalped, she is so desperate to solve the case that she
hires 83-year-old Grandma Maxur, along with 7-foot transvestite
rock musician Sally Sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made Stephanie in some of my own image, except she's slimmer
and braver,'' says Evanovich.
</P>
<P>
   -- KID STUFF: Encouraged by the success of Rosie O'Donnell's
book ``Kids Are Punny'' (625,000 copies so far), publishers are
scrambling to get similar books onto their fall lists. ``Punny 2''
is coming in October from Warner Books, and ``Kids Say the
Darnedest Things,'' comments gleaned from Bill Cosby's CBS series,
is scheduled for September from Bantam. Also in the works, from
Simon &AMP; Schuster, is ``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy,'' children's letters
to the nation's first pets. Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   -- GRAND OPRAH: The Oprah Winfrey magic continues. When Soho
Press published Edwidge Danticat's debut novel, ``Breath, Eyes,
Memory,'' in 1994, the critically acclaimed book sold 9,000 copies
in hardback and 43,000 copies in a Vintage Contemporaries paperback
edition. After Winfrey picked the novel for her May Book Club
selection, Soho rushed back to press with 20,000 additional copies,
and Vintage printed 600,000. Danticat's next novel, ``The Farming
of Bones'' (Soho, $23), will be published in September with a
50,000 first printing.

 &HT;    MINI VIEWS: Reviews of movies now on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Amistad'' (R) _ Steven Spielberg's earnest but unbalanced
film is at its best in its wordless moments, including a horrific
glimpse into the sweaty belly of a slave ship and in its opening
minutes, when captured Africans viciously slaughter the ship's crew
and try to retrace their way homeward by following the sun.
Unfortunately, the movie has a lot of talk in it. Based on a
historic 1839 incident, ``Amistad'' grows thick at the middle with
the intricacies of the Africans' court case, argued by Matthew
McConaughey, Morgan Freeman and Anthony Hopkins (as a crotchety
John Quincy Adams).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Long Way Home'' (unrated) _ This powerful,
Oscar-winning 1997 documentary focuses on the overlooked time
between the 1945 liberation of German concentration camps and the
founding of the state of Israel three years later. Freedom from the
horror of genocide was not the end of the war for the Jews. Bereft
of family, property, homes and every trapping of their prewar
lives, the Jews found themselves unwelcome in their former
hometowns and were lumped together for months in U.S.-operated
camps for displaced persons. The film shows their determination to
find a new homeland, often suffering the same sort of hardships
they thought they had left behind during the war. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Ma Vie en Rose'' (R) _ In a sunny French suburb, 7-year-old
Ludovic (Georges De Fresne) can't understand all the fuss when he
dons his sister's dresses and announces that he plans to marry the
son of his dad's boss. Director Alain Berliner's candy-colored
comedy interweaves Ludo's fantasy world, involving a Barbie-like
doll named Pam, with the accelerating anger of both neighbors and
his own family as he insists that God made a mistake, that he was
meant to be a girl. The movie is emotionally uneven, but it
elegantly scores its points about intolerance for anything that's
perceived as not ``normal.'' In French with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``No Looking Back'' (R) _ Wildly overrated
writer-director-star Edward Burns (``The Brothers McMullen'') tries
to get serious in this drama about a waitress (Lauren Holly) torn
between her loyal boyfriend (Jon Bon Jovi) and the handsome heel
who walked out on her three years ago (that would be Burns). It
wants to be a sensitive, if dull, character study of a young woman
learning to make choices. But the problem is that the character is
underwritten and Holly is too pretty and too limited an actress to
make us care. Grade: C +
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Replacement Killers'' (R) _ Hong Kong action star Chow
Yun-Fat aims for a Hollywood crossover in a flick that plays like a
light version of ``The Killer'' and other, better titles. Teaming
with Mira Sorvino as a passport forger, he plays a hit man who
wants out. But the Los Angeles mob would rather kill him first.
Directed by Antoine Fuqua, it's briskly paced, with some
interesting chases. But it lacks the delirious, ante-upping payoffs
of the real-deal flicks directed by John Woo and his colleagues.
Grade: B -

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Un ejemplo de la situacion nada boyante del sector bancario en
America Latina es el chileno Gonzalo Marin.
 &HT;    Este ejecutivo de informatica de 26 anos decidio hace poco
comprar un apartamento de US$60.000 en Santiago. En el pasado no
habia tenido muchos problemas para conseguir credito para comprar
dos autos nuevos, asi que penso que conseguir una hipoteca seria
facil.
 &HT;    De eso nada. El banco prestatario, Citibank, le informo que
tramitar la hipoteca demoraria casi un mes. Al final se tardo tres
meses. Y mientras esperaba, la tasa de interes subio. Para cuando
todo estuvo listo, el pago inicial requerido se habia multiplicado
por cinco, de US$600 a casi US$3.300. ``En parte fue mala suerte:
el mercado bajo.
 &HT;    Pero en parte se debio a la demora [del banco],'' afirma Marin.
``Me dejo un mal sabor en la boca.''
 &HT;    En comparacion con algunos paises vecinos, Marin tuvo suerte de
conseguir un prestamo hipotecario. Aunque la disponibilidad de
credito ha mejorado un poco desde que la devaluacion del peso
mexicano en 1994 hizo dispararse las tasas de interes y aplasto el
gasto del consumidor en toda la region, los bancos latinoamericanos
todavia cuidan con gran celo la billetera.
 &HT;    Pero en realidad esto es algo positivo, dada la situacion de la
region, que parece pasar del auge al desespero cada dos anos. Si
estos paises han aprendido algo es que mientras mas debil es el
sistema bancario, mas dura es la caida en caso de crisis economica.
 &HT;    ``Si el sistema bancario es fuerte, la crisis es menor, mucho
menor,'' dice Jose Garcia Cantera, un respetado economista de banca
latinoamericana en Salomon Smith Barney en Nueva York. ``Solo se
convierte en una crisis si el sistema bancario resulta ser el
eslabon mas debil de la cadena.''
 &HT;    Y ahora parece que la mayor parte de los sistemas bancarios de
la region tratan de reforzar ese eslabon. Han comenzado a apretarse
el cinturon, a fortalecer sus resultados y a usar nuevas
tecnologias.
 &HT;    Tambien han comenzado a diversificarse a servicios financieros
de alto rendimiento, como los seguros y la administracion de
valores.
 &HT;    Parte de ese impetu viene de la competencia, es decir, los
bancos extranjeros que han invadido a Latinoamerica. Instituciones
espanolas como Banco Santander, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) y Banco
Central Hispano (BCH), han sido los mas energicos. Pero otros, como
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. (HSBC), con sede en el Reino
Unido, tambien han puesto el pie en la region, al igual que
ABN-Amro Bank, de Holanda, y Bank of Montreal, de Canada. Solo un
punado de bancos estadounidenses han tanteado el terreno,
fundamentalmente Citibank, BankBoston y Chase Manhattan.
 &HT;    Chile. A principios de los anos 80, un colapso similar a la
crisis monetaria mexicana de 1994 hizo que el control de los bancos
chilenos cayera en manos del banco central.
 &HT;    Aunque quedan algunos casos por resolver, la mayoria de los
bancos chilenos se han recuperado, o pasaron a manos de otras
instituciones por medio de fusiones. Ahora han comenzado a trabajar
con ahinco los mercados de credito al consumidor con el fin de
recuperar la confianza del publico y la fortaleza financiera.
 &HT;    En la actualidad hay 31 instituciones bancarias y 17 de ellas
son bancos comerciales extranjeros, entre ellos Banco Santander y
Citibank.
 &HT;    Los bancos chilenos son muy disciplinados en comparacion con los
demas paises de la region, y pueden compararse con los
norteamericanos en terminos de salvaguardas para inversionistas y
depositantes. Parte de esta disciplina se debe a las estrictas
normas impuestas durante el gobierno militar tras el colapso
economico de 1982-1983. Esto hace de los bancos chilenos
instituciones seguras pero en extremo conservadoras, en una
economia por lo demas completamente liberalizada. A pesar de que
hace poco se aprobo una ley que permite a los bancos comerciales
diversificarse a los sectores de seguros, factoraje y prestamos al
extranjero, la mayoria de los bancos prefieren esperar a ver que
pasa.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, el conservadurismo tiene sus ventajas. Los
prestamos incobrables representan aproximadamente el 1 por ciento
de todos los prestamos, mientras que el crecimiento en materia de
emprestitos ha registrado un 11,6 por ciento anual en lo que va de
esta decada, segun un estudio de la Sociedad de Fomento Fabril de
Chile (Sofofa). El rendimiento sobre valores aumento en un 18,3 por
ciento anual entre 1990 y 1995.
 &HT;    La entidad reguladora bancaria, la Asociacion de Bancos e
Instituciones Financieras, informo que el total de prestamos
bancarios aumento casi un 60 por ciento entre 1994 y 1997, a
US$45.000 millones. Por su parte, el crecimiento de las ganancias
no ha sido tan estelar, aunque si constante, con un alza de casi el
37 por ciento a US$3.000 millones durante el mismo periodo.
 &HT;    Inicialmente, los bancos chilenos sintieron el golpe de la
crisis asiatica, pero se recuperaron rapidamente, y los resultados
del primer trimestre de 1998 han superado las expectativas de los
analistas.
 &HT;    Argentina. Las condiciones del sector bancario argentino son un
poco mas tensas. Las escenas de clientes airados y desempleados
protestando frente a las puertas del difunto Banco Patricios son ya
familiares para los argentinos, quienes han experimentado de
primera mano el pasado turbulento del sector bancario del pais. Esa
es una de las principales razones por las que Argentina es uno de
los paises con menos depositos bancarios de toda la region, con una
proporcion de depositos equivalente a solo el 22 por ciento del
Producto Interno Bruto (PIB).
 &HT;    Desde agosto de 1997, el banco central ha suspendido las
operaciones de tres instituciones debido a su insolvencia y a
problemas de fraude. Los problemas financieros dentro del grupo
inversor espanol-suizo Socimer llevaron al cierre de sus dos
bancos: Medefin-UBN en febrero y Banco Patricios en marzo. A eso se
agrega la intervencion, rodeada de una gran dosis de escandalo, del
Banco de Credito Provincial de la Plata, donde resultaron afectados
unos US$791 millones en depositos y aproximadamente 300.000
cuentas.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, a pesar de esos males, el sector es uno de los mas
dinamicos y abiertos de la economia argentina, segun un reciente
informe de la firma de corretaje Santander Investment. ``Esto no es
un indicador de la salud del sistema,'' dice Carlos Gomez Lopez,
analista de CS First Boston en Nueva York. ``El banco central se
mantiene atento y los grandes bancos son muy solidos.''
 &HT;    El sector ha mejorado sustancialmente bajo el tutelaje de los
inversionistas extranjeros, cuyo abundante capital les ha permitido
comprar las principales instituciones bancarias del pais en el
ultimo ano y medio. Los espanoles han llevado la delantera: el BBV
adquirio y fusiono Banco Frances con Banco de Credito Argentino,
mientras que su archirrival, Banco Santander, adquirio Banco Rio de
la Plata.
 &HT;    Como resultado, el numero de bancos argentinos ha bajado de 205
en diciembre de 1994 a 139 en la actualidad. La invasion
extranjera, y el empeno por mejorar la calidad tras la devaluacion
del peso mexicano en 1994, ha resultado en que 20 de los
principales bancos controlan el 75 por ciento del mercado. Se
espera que la consolidacion siga adelante. Segun el banco central,
15 bancos se fusionaron o fueron liquidados en los ultimos dos
anos. Se espera que se produzcan mas casos para el ano 2000.
 &HT;    Por su parte, los analistas pronostican que el sector se quedara
con unos 50 bancos. En lo que respecta al resto, ``me sorprenderia
si sobreviven a los proximos cinco anos,'' dice Malcolm Gibson,
analista de HSBC Roberts Capital Markets en Buenos Aires.
 &HT;    Los inversionistas se sienten alentados por las prometedoras
perspectivas de crecimiento del sector de banca minorista. Desde
1990, los depositos han aumentado de US$11.000 millones a US$74.400
millones, una tasa anual de acumulacion del 25,6 por ciento,
mientras que los prestamos han aumentado en el 17,5 por ciento
anual. Desde noviembre de 1997, se han abierto aproximadamente 1,9
millones de cuentas bancarias debido a una nueva norma oficial que
obliga a las empresas con 100 empleados o mas a realizar los pagos
de nomina electronicamente.
 &HT;    En un esfuerzo por capturar este dinamico crecimiento, los
bancos han iniciado una energica campana de expansion. Durante los
proximos dos anos, se espera que la cantidad de sucursales
bancarias en Argentina aumente casi el doble, de 4.000 actualmente
(una de las mas bajas del mundo) a 8.000. El ano pasado el banco
central recibio 600 solicitudes para abrir sucursales, y cada mes
entran en funcionamiento entre 250 y 300 cajeros automaticos.
 &HT;    Entre los bancos mas ambiciosos estan los espanoles, y BBV
planea aumentar sus sucursales de 200 a 400. Banco Rio de la Plata
firmo un contrato con YPF, la petrolera argentina, para abrir 100
sucursales en estaciones de servicio.
 &HT;    El interes en el sector minorista y la creciente competencia han
hecho los servicios bancarios mas accesibles para la poblacion,
segun Gomez Lopez, de CS First Boston. Las tasas de interes de los
prestamos, por ejemplo, promedian ahora el 8,6 por ciento, en
comparacion con el 85,8 por ciento en 1990. De hecho, los prestamos
al sector privado alcanzan en este momento US$61.500 millones, el
20 por ciento del PIB. Las tasas hipotecarias tambien han bajado,
del 17 por ciento antes de la crisis monetaria mexicana, a menos de
11 por ciento.
 &HT;    ``El banco central tiene un interes especial en aumentar la
bancarizacion [expansion del sector de la banca minorista],''
afirma Gomez Lopez.
 &HT;    Aunque los bancos aumentaron la tasa primaria de prestamos en
pesos en casi el 60 por ciento durante la crisis asiatica, han
regresado rapidamente a su nivel normal, afirma Gomez Lopez. ``Es
casi como si no hubiera habido crisis. El sector esta saludable,
crece, tiene liquidez, tine un enorme potencial de expansion y es
muy interesante,'' anadio.
 &HT;    El sector bancario espera ahora por la propuesta privatizacion
del mayor banco argentino, Banco de la Nacion, que se espera genere
entre US$3.000 y US$4.000 millones cuando se venda en 1999 o el
2000.
 &HT;    Aunque el sector bancario esta satisfecho con la venta, muchos
senalan que la institucion ofrece prestamos subsidiados por el
gobierno a los agricultores y companias pequenas, que no cumplen
los requisitos normales de asistencia financiera. Ese tipo de
prestamos probablemente quede eliminado bajo una administracion
privada.
 &HT;    Brasil. El sector bancario brasileno ha pasado por un periodo
especialmente dificil. En 1994 los bancos brasilenos estaban en su
mejor momento. Con una inflacion de aproximadamente el 2.000 por
ciento, ganar dinero era facil.
 &HT;    Pero cuando el presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso hizo mas
estricta la politica monetaria mediante el Plan Real, los bancos
perdieron la capacidad de hacer dinero sobre la base de la
inflacion.
 &HT;    Asi que muchos tuvieron que aprender otra vez el abecedario
bancario: como generar ganancias sobre los prestamos y depositos.
 &HT;    La situacion pronto se convirtio en la supervivencia del mas
fuerte. Entre 1995 y 1997, casi 100 instituciones financieras,
incluidos 50 bancos, desaparecieron, debido a la mala
administracion, la corrupcion o el fraude. El costo de los
desastres de la banca privada significo para el gobierno un total
de US$21 millones.
 &HT;    Los bancos estatales tambien resultaron afectados. Debido a
varios anos de perdidas, el banco central de Brasil intervino dos
de los mayores bancos estatales. Banerj, con sede en Rio de
Janeiro, fue objeto de una reestructuracion y finalmente se vendio
al Banco Itau en 1997 por US$300 millones. En 1994, Banespa, con
sede en Sao Paulo, se transfirio al control federal como parte de
un acuerdo de reestructuracion de la deuda del estado de Sao Paulo.
En estos momentos se alista su privatizacion, que debe ocurrir mas
adelante este ano.
 &HT;    En 1997, los bancos extranjeros comenzaron a invadir el mercado
brasileno. HSBC compro los activos bancarios del Banco Bamerindus
do Brasil S.A., el quinto banco del pais, por US$1.000 millones. El
anuncio de la venta constituyo un viraje en la consolidacion del
sector bancario brasileno. Tambien mostro la nueva disposicion del
gobierno de permitir a los inversionistas extranjeros participar de
manera significativa en el sector.
 &HT;    Posteriormente se anunciaron varias adquisiciones en 1997,
incluida la compra de una participacion del 50 por ciento en el
banco de inversiones Multiplic por parte de Lloyd's TSB, por un
valor de US$600 millones, y una participacion del 51 por ciento en
Banco Geral do Comercio por parte de Banco Santander a un costo de
US$100 millones.
 &HT;    A finales de abril de este ano, BBV anuncio la adquisicion por
US$450 millones de un 55 por ciento del Banco Excel Economico.
 &HT;    La cifra de sucursales de bancos extranjeros autorizados por el
banco central aumento de 200 en 1995 a 2.000 en 1998, y el volumen
de los activos de grupos extranjeros aumento del 10 por ciento al
16 por ciento de los activos bancarios totales del pais.
 &HT;    Tras cuatro anos de fuerte reestructuracion, la banca brasilena
esta a punto de tomar impulso. Pero la fortaleza de los bancos
foraneos constituye un problema para las instituciones locales.
Como hacer frente a esta competencia?
 &HT;    Los mayores bancos privados ya se han ajustado al adoptar
politicas conservadoras en materia de prestamos, invertir en
tecnologia, reducir costos mediante despidos y cobrar por servicios
que antes prestaban gratis. Las cuotas por servicio, que el banco
central libero de su control en 1996, son una fuente de ingresos
cada vez mas importante.
 &HT;    A pesar de los problemas, el sector bancario brasileno esta hoy
en una situacion mucho mejor.
 &HT;    ``La competencia es muy saludable porque obligara a los bancos a
ofrecer mejores servicios a menor costo,'' dice Mario Coelho,
director de Austin Asis, firma de asesoria con sede en Sao Paulo
que se especializa en analisis de riesgo.
 &HT;    Es de esperar que mas bancos desaparezcan, asi como mas fusiones
y adquisiciones. Segun tres analistas de banca, en Brasil todavia
hay demasiados bancos, mas de 200 segun el conteo mas reciente. Se
espera que los bancos mas pequenos pasen a manos de los grandes.
Estas nuevas alianzas ofreceran una amplia gama de productos
financieros, desde administracion de efectivo hasta corretaje y
colocacion de valores.
 &HT;    La crisis asiatica en octubre pasado obligo al gobierno a tomar
medidas energicas para proteger el real, que incluyo duplicar las
tasas de interes a casi el 40 por ciento. Como resultado, ni los
trabajadores de poca paga ni los pequenos negocios se atrevian a
pedir prestamos.
 &HT;    Pero la preocupacion resulto ser infundada. El gobierno redujo
gradualmente las tasas, del 34 por ciento al 28 por ciento, y ahora
estan en el 23,25 por ciento.
 &HT;    Pero los brasilenos tienen buena memoria. ``[En 1997] tome un
prestamo de US$250 para comprar una aspiradora. Despues de 12
letras, habia pagado US$490,'' dice Ana Maria de Andrade, una joven
de 29 anos que vive en Rio. ``Nunca mas en la vida quisiera pasar
por una experiencia similar,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Mexico. Los bancos mexicanos tambien pasaron por momentos
amargos. Pero todavia les queda mucho camino por recorrer.
 &HT;    El secretario de Finanzas de Mexico, Jose Angel Gurria, es
conocido por su estilo discreto. Pero cuando de bancos se trata, no
se anda con panos tibios. El sistema bancario mexicano, dijo
recientemente en declaraciones ante el Congreso, es ``el eslabon
mas debil en el desarrollo economico de Mexico.''
 &HT;    En realidad, si se los compara con cualquier otra epoca desde la
crisis economica de 1995, los abrumados bancos comerciales
mexicanos gozan de cierta salud. Gracias a un masivo programa de
rescate del gobierno y a enormes infusiones de capital por parte de
bancos extranjeros, que han adquirido participaciones en algunos
bancos mexicanos y comprado otros, los niveles de capitalizacion
han aumentado y los indices de prestamos morosos han bajado.
 &HT;    El credito todavia es escaso y caro. Los creditos al consumidor
cobran en estos momentos tasas que rondan el 35 por ciento, en
comparacion con un nivel de inflacion de un 13 por ciento que se
proyecta para 1998. Por su parte, los prestamos comerciales cobran
tasas de aproximadamente el 20 por ciento. Pero se espera que los
prestamos a los sectores no financieros crezcan en terminos reales
este ano por primera vez desde la crisis.
 &HT;    Carlos Gomez y Gomez, director general de Santander Mexicano y
nuevo presidente de la Asociacion Bancaria de Mexico, dice que los
prestamos reales pudieran crecer entre el 4 por ciento y el 5 por
ciento este ano. Algunos analistas del sector privado se muestran
incluso mas optimistas. Rafael Bello, de Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
en Nueva York, pronostica que los prestamos pudieran crecer hasta
el 10 por ciento en 1998.
 &HT;    Pero esos niveles constituirian solo una ligera mejora a partir
de una base muy pequena, y los bancos se han convertido en una
fuerza marginal en promover el crecimiento economico.
 &HT;    Casi todo el crecimiento del PIB mexicano desde 1994 se ha
basado en las exportaciones y la inversion, con recientes mejoras
en el consumo. Pero los grandes exportadores mexicanos y las
multinacionales extranjeras, que han generado la mayor parte de las
exportaciones y la inversion, tienen acceso a prestamos mas baratos
fuera del pais. La naciente recuperacion del consumo se basa casi
completamente en el aumento de la demanda y los ahorros, no en el
credito al consumidor, segun analistas.
 &HT;    La falta de financiacion competitiva por parte de las
instituciones mexicanas ya amenaza con afectar la balanza de pagos
del pais, a medida que las companias grandes se dan cuenta que
pueden conseguir mejores condiciones de credito a traves de bancos
extranjeros o los mercados de deuda. De los US$34.000 millones de
deuda extranjera de Mexico que maduran este ano, se calcula que
casi US$18.000 millones estan en manos del sector privado. La firma
estadounidense de calificacion de credito Standard &AMP; Poor's calcula
que la deuda externa del sector privado mexicano fue equivalente al
40 por ciento de las exportaciones el ano pasado, casi igual que
antes de la crisis.
 &HT;    Mientras tanto, los contribuyentes tendran que pagar durante
anos los errores de los bancos. El costo del rescate bancario se
elevo hace poco a US$65.000 millones. De los US$60.000 millones en
prestamos incobrables en manos del ente gubernamental Fobaproa, los
funcionarios de la Secretaria de Finanzas opinan que casi el 30 por
ciento pudiera ser cobrable. Los analistas del sector privado se
muestran menos esperanzados.
 &HT;    No parece haber a la mano ninguna solucion a corto plazo. Pero
el gobierno esta en proceso de poner en practica varias politicas
que promoveran una reestructuracion de largo alcance en el sector
bancario.
 &HT;    En un reciente paquete de medidas presentado ante el Congreso,
el gobierno propuso eliminar las restricciones a la propiedad de
bancos por parte de entidades extranjeras. Anteriormente, los
bancos foraneos podian comprar instituciones bancarias mexicanas,
pero no las tres mayores, porque cada una representa mas del 6 por
ciento de la capitalizacion total del sistema bancario mexicano. Si
el proyecto de ley se aprueba, como se espera, en septiembre, los
extranjeros podran convertirse en propietarios de estos tres
grandes bancos y no necesitaran autorizacion especial para comprar
bancos mas pequenos.
 &HT;    ``No cabe duda que estas medidas tienen que ver con la
globalizacion del sistema financiero mexicano,'' afirma Gomez y
Gomez.
 &HT;    ``Le daran mas flexibilidad a los inversionistas mexicanos y
extranjeros que buscan instituciones financieras solidas y
rentables,'' agrego.
 &HT;    Los bancos extranjeros ya han adquirido participaciones en
instituciones pequenas, liderados por los espanoles. BBV compro
Cremi, Oriente, Credito y Probursa; Santander adquirio el 51 por
ciento de Banco Mexicano y BCH es propietario del 20 por ciento de
Bital. En agosto pasado, Citibank se subio al carro de las
adquisiciones al anunciar la compra de Confia por US$45 millones.
Bank of Nova Scotia posee el 10 por ciento de Inverlat, con opcion
a comprar 55 por ciento mas.
 &HT;    Mientras tanto, los bancos mexicanos son presa de una fiebre de
consolidaciones. Despues que el presidente Carlos Salinas de
Gortari reprivatizo el sector bancario a principio de los anos 90,
los banqueros llenaron el pais de sucursales. Pero despues que la
crisis economica golpeo al pais a finales de 1994, con la
consiguiente alza de las tasas de interes y la merma del poder
adquisitivo, la demanda de servicios financieros se desplomo. Como
consecuencia, Mexico se convirtio en uno de los paises con mas
exceso de banca en la region.
 &HT;    Asi las cosas, los bancos mexicanos han comenzado a maniobrar
para alcanzar economias de escala. A finales del ano pasado, GBM
Atlantico anuncio que el Grupo Financiero Bital lo adquiriria,
formandose asi la cuarta institucion financiera de Mexico con casi
US$14.000 millones en activos. Se esperan mas fusiones y
adquisiciones para mas adelante este ano, con la posible compra de
BanCrecer por parte de un banco extranjero.
 &HT;    Paises andinos. La situacion de la banca ha comenzado a mejorar
en otras partes de America Latina. En Peru, el crecimiento de los
prestamos y la rentabilidad bajaron ligeramente el ano pasado. Pero
los prestamos morosos bajaron del 6,7 por ciento a finales de 1996
al 5,3 por ciento a finales de 1997. La cobertura de los prestamos
morosos tambien ha aumentado, al 88,4 por ciento, en comparacion
con el 84,9 por ciento hace un ano.
 &HT;    A pesar de los problemas politicos, Colombia es uno de los
sectores bancarios mas fuertes de Latinoamerica. El ano pasado este
sector mostro un crecimiento de prestamos del 33,2 por ciento, de
cuya cifra el 11,8 por ciento se genero en el cuarto trimestre. Sin
embargo, la liquidez bajo ligeramente del 8,8 por ciento al 9,2 por
ciento y los margenes netos de interes se redujeron del 7,7 por
ciento al 6,1 por ciento.
 &HT;    Venezuela es el nuevo mercado bancario en auge [ver Latin Trade,
mayo de 1998]. Aunque la reciente declinacion de los precios del
petroleo pudiera afectar la calidad de los valores, el sector
bancario venezolano esta mucho mas fuerte y saludable que en 1994.
Por ejemplo, su cobertura de prestamos morosos a finales de 1997
era del 124 por ciento.
 &HT;    Aunque los bancos extranjeros han inyectado capital fresco en
toda America Latina, tambien han mantenido a los banqueros
latinoamericanos en estado de alerta, lo que ha resultado positivo
para las fragiles economias latinoamericanas, y sus consumidores.
``La entrada de bancos extranjeros realmente se va a dejar
sentir,'' afirma Garcia Cantera, de Salomon Smith Barney. ``Al
final, todo el sistema va a funcionar con mayor eficiencia.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Un ejemplo de la situacion nada boyante del sector bancario en
America Latina es el chileno Gonzalo Marin.
 &HT;    Este ejecutivo de informatica de 26 anos decidio hace poco
comprar un apartamento de US$60.000 en Santiago. En el pasado no
habia tenido muchos problemas para conseguir credito para comprar
dos autos nuevos, asi que penso que conseguir una hipoteca seria
facil.
 &HT;    De eso nada. El banco prestatario, Citibank, le informo que
tramitar la hipoteca demoraria casi un mes. Al final se tardo tres
meses. Y mientras esperaba, la tasa de interes subio. Para cuando
todo estuvo listo, el pago inicial requerido se habia multiplicado
por cinco, de US$600 a casi US$3.300. ``En parte fue mala suerte:
el mercado bajo.
 &HT;    Pero en parte se debio a la demora [del banco],'' afirma Marin.
``Me dejo un mal sabor en la boca.''
 &HT;    En comparacion con algunos paises vecinos, Marin tuvo suerte de
conseguir un prestamo hipotecario. Aunque la disponibilidad de
credito ha mejorado un poco desde que la devaluacion del peso
mexicano en 1994 hizo dispararse las tasas de interes y aplasto el
gasto del consumidor en toda la region, los bancos latinoamericanos
todavia cuidan con gran celo la billetera.
 &HT;    Pero en realidad esto es algo positivo, dada la situacion de la
region, que parece pasar del auge al desespero cada dos anos. Si
estos paises han aprendido algo es que mientras mas debil es el
sistema bancario, mas dura es la caida en caso de crisis economica.
 &HT;    ``Si el sistema bancario es fuerte, la crisis es menor, mucho
menor,'' dice Jose Garcia Cantera, un respetado economista de banca
latinoamericana en Salomon Smith Barney en Nueva York. ``Solo se
convierte en una crisis si el sistema bancario resulta ser el
eslabon mas debil de la cadena.''
 &HT;    Y ahora parece que la mayor parte de los sistemas bancarios de
la region tratan de reforzar ese eslabon. Han comenzado a apretarse
el cinturon, a fortalecer sus resultados y a usar nuevas
tecnologias.
 &HT;    Tambien han comenzado a diversificarse a servicios financieros
de alto rendimiento, como los seguros y la administracion de
valores.
 &HT;    Parte de ese impetu viene de la competencia, es decir, los
bancos extranjeros que han invadido a Latinoamerica. Instituciones
espanolas como Banco Santander, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) y Banco
Central Hispano (BCH), han sido los mas energicos. Pero otros, como
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. (HSBC), con sede en el Reino
Unido, tambien han puesto el pie en la region, al igual que
ABN-Amro Bank, de Holanda, y Bank of Montreal, de Canada. Solo un
punado de bancos estadounidenses han tanteado el terreno,
fundamentalmente Citibank, BankBoston y Chase Manhattan.
 &HT;    Chile. A principios de los anos 80, un colapso similar a la
crisis monetaria mexicana de 1994 hizo que el control de los bancos
chilenos cayera en manos del banco central.
 &HT;    Aunque quedan algunos casos por resolver, la mayoria de los
bancos chilenos se han recuperado, o pasaron a manos de otras
instituciones por medio de fusiones. Ahora han comenzado a trabajar
con ahinco los mercados de credito al consumidor con el fin de
recuperar la confianza del publico y la fortaleza financiera.
 &HT;    En la actualidad hay 31 instituciones bancarias y 17 de ellas
son bancos comerciales extranjeros, entre ellos Banco Santander y
Citibank.
 &HT;    Los bancos chilenos son muy disciplinados en comparacion con los
demas paises de la region, y pueden compararse con los
norteamericanos en terminos de salvaguardas para inversionistas y
depositantes. Parte de esta disciplina se debe a las estrictas
normas impuestas durante el gobierno militar tras el colapso
economico de 1982-1983. Esto hace de los bancos chilenos
instituciones seguras pero en extremo conservadoras, en una
economia por lo demas completamente liberalizada. A pesar de que
hace poco se aprobo una ley que permite a los bancos comerciales
diversificarse a los sectores de seguros, factoraje y prestamos al
extranjero, la mayoria de los bancos prefieren esperar a ver que
pasa.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, el conservadurismo tiene sus ventajas. Los
prestamos incobrables representan aproximadamente el 1 por ciento
de todos los prestamos, mientras que el crecimiento en materia de
emprestitos ha registrado un 11,6 por ciento anual en lo que va de
esta decada, segun un estudio de la Sociedad de Fomento Fabril de
Chile (Sofofa). El rendimiento sobre valores aumento en un 18,3 por
ciento anual entre 1990 y 1995.
 &HT;    La entidad reguladora bancaria, la Asociacion de Bancos e
Instituciones Financieras, informo que el total de prestamos
bancarios aumento casi un 60 por ciento entre 1994 y 1997, a
US$45.000 millones. Por su parte, el crecimiento de las ganancias
no ha sido tan estelar, aunque si constante, con un alza de casi el
37 por ciento a US$3.000 millones durante el mismo periodo.
 &HT;    Inicialmente, los bancos chilenos sintieron el golpe de la
crisis asiatica, pero se recuperaron rapidamente, y los resultados
del primer trimestre de 1998 han superado las expectativas de los
analistas.
 &HT;    Argentina. Las condiciones del sector bancario argentino son un
poco mas tensas. Las escenas de clientes airados y desempleados
protestando frente a las puertas del difunto Banco Patricios son ya
familiares para los argentinos, quienes han experimentado de
primera mano el pasado turbulento del sector bancario del pais. Esa
es una de las principales razones por las que Argentina es uno de
los paises con menos depositos bancarios de toda la region, con una
proporcion de depositos equivalente a solo el 22 por ciento del
Producto Interno Bruto (PIB).
 &HT;    Desde agosto de 1997, el banco central ha suspendido las
operaciones de tres instituciones debido a su insolvencia y a
problemas de fraude. Los problemas financieros dentro del grupo
inversor espanol-suizo Socimer llevaron al cierre de sus dos
bancos: Medefin-UBN en febrero y Banco Patricios en marzo. A eso se
agrega la intervencion, rodeada de una gran dosis de escandalo, del
Banco de Credito Provincial de la Plata, donde resultaron afectados
unos US$791 millones en depositos y aproximadamente 300.000
cuentas.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, a pesar de esos males, el sector es uno de los mas
dinamicos y abiertos de la economia argentina, segun un reciente
informe de la firma de corretaje Santander Investment. ``Esto no es
un indicador de la salud del sistema,'' dice Carlos Gomez Lopez,
analista de CS First Boston en Nueva York. ``El banco central se
mantiene atento y los grandes bancos son muy solidos.''
 &HT;    El sector ha mejorado sustancialmente bajo el tutelaje de los
inversionistas extranjeros, cuyo abundante capital les ha permitido
comprar las principales instituciones bancarias del pais en el
ultimo ano y medio. Los espanoles han llevado la delantera: el BBV
adquirio y fusiono Banco Frances con Banco de Credito Argentino,
mientras que su archirrival, Banco Santander, adquirio Banco Rio de
la Plata.
 &HT;    Como resultado, el numero de bancos argentinos ha bajado de 205
en diciembre de 1994 a 139 en la actualidad. La invasion
extranjera, y el empeno por mejorar la calidad tras la devaluacion
del peso mexicano en 1994, ha resultado en que 20 de los
principales bancos controlan el 75 por ciento del mercado. Se
espera que la consolidacion siga adelante. Segun el banco central,
15 bancos se fusionaron o fueron liquidados en los ultimos dos
anos. Se espera que se produzcan mas casos para el ano 2000.
 &HT;    Por su parte, los analistas pronostican que el sector se quedara
con unos 50 bancos. En lo que respecta al resto, ``me sorprenderia
si sobreviven a los proximos cinco anos,'' dice Malcolm Gibson,
analista de HSBC Roberts Capital Markets en Buenos Aires.
 &HT;    Los inversionistas se sienten alentados por las prometedoras
perspectivas de crecimiento del sector de banca minorista. Desde
1990, los depositos han aumentado de US$11.000 millones a US$74.400
millones, una tasa anual de acumulacion del 25,6 por ciento,
mientras que los prestamos han aumentado en el 17,5 por ciento
anual. Desde noviembre de 1997, se han abierto aproximadamente 1,9
millones de cuentas bancarias debido a una nueva norma oficial que
obliga a las empresas con 100 empleados o mas a realizar los pagos
de nomina electronicamente.
 &HT;    En un esfuerzo por capturar este dinamico crecimiento, los
bancos han iniciado una energica campana de expansion. Durante los
proximos dos anos, se espera que la cantidad de sucursales
bancarias en Argentina aumente casi el doble, de 4.000 actualmente
(una de las mas bajas del mundo) a 8.000. El ano pasado el banco
central recibio 600 solicitudes para abrir sucursales, y cada mes
entran en funcionamiento entre 250 y 300 cajeros automaticos.
 &HT;    Entre los bancos mas ambiciosos estan los espanoles, y BBV
planea aumentar sus sucursales de 200 a 400. Banco Rio de la Plata
firmo un contrato con YPF, la petrolera argentina, para abrir 100
sucursales en estaciones de servicio.
 &HT;    El interes en el sector minorista y la creciente competencia han
hecho los servicios bancarios mas accesibles para la poblacion,
segun Gomez Lopez, de CS First Boston. Las tasas de interes de los
prestamos, por ejemplo, promedian ahora el 8,6 por ciento, en
comparacion con el 85,8 por ciento en 1990. De hecho, los prestamos
al sector privado alcanzan en este momento US$61.500 millones, el
20 por ciento del PIB. Las tasas hipotecarias tambien han bajado,
del 17 por ciento antes de la crisis monetaria mexicana, a menos de
11 por ciento.
 &HT;    ``El banco central tiene un interes especial en aumentar la
bancarizacion [expansion del sector de la banca minorista],''
afirma Gomez Lopez.
 &HT;    Aunque los bancos aumentaron la tasa primaria de prestamos en
pesos en casi el 60 por ciento durante la crisis asiatica, han
regresado rapidamente a su nivel normal, afirma Gomez Lopez. ``Es
casi como si no hubiera habido crisis. El sector esta saludable,
crece, tiene liquidez, tine un enorme potencial de expansion y es
muy interesante,'' anadio.
 &HT;    El sector bancario espera ahora por la propuesta privatizacion
del mayor banco argentino, Banco de la Nacion, que se espera genere
entre US$3.000 y US$4.000 millones cuando se venda en 1999 o el
2000.
 &HT;    Aunque el sector bancario esta satisfecho con la venta, muchos
senalan que la institucion ofrece prestamos subsidiados por el
gobierno a los agricultores y companias pequenas, que no cumplen
los requisitos normales de asistencia financiera. Ese tipo de
prestamos probablemente quede eliminado bajo una administracion
privada.
 &HT;    Brasil. El sector bancario brasileno ha pasado por un periodo
especialmente dificil. En 1994 los bancos brasilenos estaban en su
mejor momento. Con una inflacion de aproximadamente el 2.000 por
ciento, ganar dinero era facil.
 &HT;    Pero cuando el presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso hizo mas
estricta la politica monetaria mediante el Plan Real, los bancos
perdieron la capacidad de hacer dinero sobre la base de la
inflacion.
 &HT;    Asi que muchos tuvieron que aprender otra vez el abecedario
bancario: como generar ganancias sobre los prestamos y depositos.
 &HT;    La situacion pronto se convirtio en la supervivencia del mas
fuerte. Entre 1995 y 1997, casi 100 instituciones financieras,
incluidos 50 bancos, desaparecieron, debido a la mala
administracion, la corrupcion o el fraude. El costo de los
desastres de la banca privada significo para el gobierno un total
de US$21 millones.
 &HT;    Los bancos estatales tambien resultaron afectados. Debido a
varios anos de perdidas, el banco central de Brasil intervino dos
de los mayores bancos estatales. Banerj, con sede en Rio de
Janeiro, fue objeto de una reestructuracion y finalmente se vendio
al Banco Itau en 1997 por US$300 millones. En 1994, Banespa, con
sede en Sao Paulo, se transfirio al control federal como parte de
un acuerdo de reestructuracion de la deuda del estado de Sao Paulo.
En estos momentos se alista su privatizacion, que debe ocurrir mas
adelante este ano.
 &HT;    En 1997, los bancos extranjeros comenzaron a invadir el mercado
brasileno. HSBC compro los activos bancarios del Banco Bamerindus
do Brasil S.A., el quinto banco del pais, por US$1.000 millones. El
anuncio de la venta constituyo un viraje en la consolidacion del
sector bancario brasileno. Tambien mostro la nueva disposicion del
gobierno de permitir a los inversionistas extranjeros participar de
manera significativa en el sector.
 &HT;    Posteriormente se anunciaron varias adquisiciones en 1997,
incluida la compra de una participacion del 50 por ciento en el
banco de inversiones Multiplic por parte de Lloyd's TSB, por un
valor de US$600 millones, y una participacion del 51 por ciento en
Banco Geral do Comercio por parte de Banco Santander a un costo de
US$100 millones.
 &HT;    A finales de abril de este ano, BBV anuncio la adquisicion por
US$450 millones de un 55 por ciento del Banco Excel Economico.
 &HT;    La cifra de sucursales de bancos extranjeros autorizados por el
banco central aumento de 200 en 1995 a 2.000 en 1998, y el volumen
de los activos de grupos extranjeros aumento del 10 por ciento al
16 por ciento de los activos bancarios totales del pais.
 &HT;    Tras cuatro anos de fuerte reestructuracion, la banca brasilena
esta a punto de tomar impulso. Pero la fortaleza de los bancos
foraneos constituye un problema para las instituciones locales.
Como hacer frente a esta competencia?
 &HT;    Los mayores bancos privados ya se han ajustado al adoptar
politicas conservadoras en materia de prestamos, invertir en
tecnologia, reducir costos mediante despidos y cobrar por servicios
que antes prestaban gratis. Las cuotas por servicio, que el banco
central libero de su control en 1996, son una fuente de ingresos
cada vez mas importante.
 &HT;    A pesar de los problemas, el sector bancario brasileno esta hoy
en una situacion mucho mejor.
 &HT;    ``La competencia es muy saludable porque obligara a los bancos a
ofrecer mejores servicios a menor costo,'' dice Mario Coelho,
director de Austin Asis, firma de asesoria con sede en Sao Paulo
que se especializa en analisis de riesgo.
 &HT;    Es de esperar que mas bancos desaparezcan, asi como mas fusiones
y adquisiciones. Segun tres analistas de banca, en Brasil todavia
hay demasiados bancos, mas de 200 segun el conteo mas reciente. Se
espera que los bancos mas pequenos pasen a manos de los grandes.
Estas nuevas alianzas ofreceran una amplia gama de productos
financieros, desde administracion de efectivo hasta corretaje y
colocacion de valores.
 &HT;    La crisis asiatica en octubre pasado obligo al gobierno a tomar
medidas energicas para proteger el real, que incluyo duplicar las
tasas de interes a casi el 40 por ciento. Como resultado, ni los
trabajadores de poca paga ni los pequenos negocios se atrevian a
pedir prestamos.
 &HT;    Pero la preocupacion resulto ser infundada. El gobierno redujo
gradualmente las tasas, del 34 por ciento al 28 por ciento, y ahora
estan en el 23,25 por ciento.
 &HT;    Pero los brasilenos tienen buena memoria. ``[En 1997] tome un
prestamo de US$250 para comprar una aspiradora. Despues de 12
letras, habia pagado US$490,'' dice Ana Maria de Andrade, una joven
de 29 anos que vive en Rio. ``Nunca mas en la vida quisiera pasar
por una experiencia similar,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Mexico. Los bancos mexicanos tambien pasaron por momentos
amargos. Pero todavia les queda mucho camino por recorrer.
 &HT;    El secretario de Finanzas de Mexico, Jose Angel Gurria, es
conocido por su estilo discreto. Pero cuando de bancos se trata, no
se anda con panos tibios. El sistema bancario mexicano, dijo
recientemente en declaraciones ante el Congreso, es ``el eslabon
mas debil en el desarrollo economico de Mexico.''
 &HT;    En realidad, si se los compara con cualquier otra epoca desde la
crisis economica de 1995, los abrumados bancos comerciales
mexicanos gozan de cierta salud. Gracias a un masivo programa de
rescate del gobierno y a enormes infusiones de capital por parte de
bancos extranjeros, que han adquirido participaciones en algunos
bancos mexicanos y comprado otros, los niveles de capitalizacion
han aumentado y los indices de prestamos morosos han bajado.
 &HT;    El credito todavia es escaso y caro. Los creditos al consumidor
cobran en estos momentos tasas que rondan el 35 por ciento, en
comparacion con un nivel de inflacion de un 13 por ciento que se
proyecta para 1998. Por su parte, los prestamos comerciales cobran
tasas de aproximadamente el 20 por ciento. Pero se espera que los
prestamos a los sectores no financieros crezcan en terminos reales
este ano por primera vez desde la crisis.
 &HT;    Carlos Gomez y Gomez, director general de Santander Mexicano y
nuevo presidente de la Asociacion Bancaria de Mexico, dice que los
prestamos reales pudieran crecer entre el 4 por ciento y el 5 por
ciento este ano. Algunos analistas del sector privado se muestran
incluso mas optimistas. Rafael Bello, de Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
en Nueva York, pronostica que los prestamos pudieran crecer hasta
el 10 por ciento en 1998.
 &HT;    Pero esos niveles constituirian solo una ligera mejora a partir
de una base muy pequena, y los bancos se han convertido en una
fuerza marginal en promover el crecimiento economico.
 &HT;    Casi todo el crecimiento del PIB mexicano desde 1994 se ha
basado en las exportaciones y la inversion, con recientes mejoras
en el consumo. Pero los grandes exportadores mexicanos y las
multinacionales extranjeras, que han generado la mayor parte de las
exportaciones y la inversion, tienen acceso a prestamos mas baratos
fuera del pais. La naciente recuperacion del consumo se basa casi
completamente en el aumento de la demanda y los ahorros, no en el
credito al consumidor, segun analistas.
 &HT;    La falta de financiacion competitiva por parte de las
instituciones mexicanas ya amenaza con afectar la balanza de pagos
del pais, a medida que las companias grandes se dan cuenta que
pueden conseguir mejores condiciones de credito a traves de bancos
extranjeros o los mercados de deuda. De los US$34.000 millones de
deuda extranjera de Mexico que maduran este ano, se calcula que
casi US$18.000 millones estan en manos del sector privado. La firma
estadounidense de calificacion de credito Standard &AMP; Poor's calcula
que la deuda externa del sector privado mexicano fue equivalente al
40 por ciento de las exportaciones el ano pasado, casi igual que
antes de la crisis.
 &HT;    Mientras tanto, los contribuyentes tendran que pagar durante
anos los errores de los bancos. El costo del rescate bancario se
elevo hace poco a US$65.000 millones. De los US$60.000 millones en
prestamos incobrables en manos del ente gubernamental Fobaproa, los
funcionarios de la Secretaria de Finanzas opinan que casi el 30 por
ciento pudiera ser cobrable. Los analistas del sector privado se
muestran menos esperanzados.
 &HT;    No parece haber a la mano ninguna solucion a corto plazo. Pero
el gobierno esta en proceso de poner en practica varias politicas
que promoveran una reestructuracion de largo alcance en el sector
bancario.
 &HT;    En un reciente paquete de medidas presentado ante el Congreso,
el gobierno propuso eliminar las restricciones a la propiedad de
bancos por parte de entidades extranjeras. Anteriormente, los
bancos foraneos podian comprar instituciones bancarias mexicanas,
pero no las tres mayores, porque cada una representa mas del 6 por
ciento de la capitalizacion total del sistema bancario mexicano. Si
el proyecto de ley se aprueba, como se espera, en septiembre, los
extranjeros podran convertirse en propietarios de estos tres
grandes bancos y no necesitaran autorizacion especial para comprar
bancos mas pequenos.
 &HT;    ``No cabe duda que estas medidas tienen que ver con la
globalizacion del sistema financiero mexicano,'' afirma Gomez y
Gomez.
 &HT;    ``Le daran mas flexibilidad a los inversionistas mexicanos y
extranjeros que buscan instituciones financieras solidas y
rentables,'' agrego.
 &HT;    Los bancos extranjeros ya han adquirido participaciones en
instituciones pequenas, liderados por los espanoles. BBV compro
Cremi, Oriente, Credito y Probursa; Santander adquirio el 51 por
ciento de Banco Mexicano y BCH es propietario del 20 por ciento de
Bital. En agosto pasado, Citibank se subio al carro de las
adquisiciones al anunciar la compra de Confia por US$45 millones.
Bank of Nova Scotia posee el 10 por ciento de Inverlat, con opcion
a comprar 55 por ciento mas.
 &HT;    Mientras tanto, los bancos mexicanos son presa de una fiebre de
consolidaciones. Despues que el presidente Carlos Salinas de
Gortari reprivatizo el sector bancario a principio de los anos 90,
los banqueros llenaron el pais de sucursales. Pero despues que la
crisis economica golpeo al pais a finales de 1994, con la
consiguiente alza de las tasas de interes y la merma del poder
adquisitivo, la demanda de servicios financieros se desplomo. Como
consecuencia, Mexico se convirtio en uno de los paises con mas
exceso de banca en la region.
 &HT;    Asi las cosas, los bancos mexicanos han comenzado a maniobrar
para alcanzar economias de escala. A finales del ano pasado, GBM
Atlantico anuncio que el Grupo Financiero Bital lo adquiriria,
formandose asi la cuarta institucion financiera de Mexico con casi
US$14.000 millones en activos. Se esperan mas fusiones y
adquisiciones para mas adelante este ano, con la posible compra de
BanCrecer por parte de un banco extranjero.
 &HT;    Paises andinos. La situacion de la banca ha comenzado a mejorar
en otras partes de America Latina. En Peru, el crecimiento de los
prestamos y la rentabilidad bajaron ligeramente el ano pasado. Pero
los prestamos morosos bajaron del 6,7 por ciento a finales de 1996
al 5,3 por ciento a finales de 1997. La cobertura de los prestamos
morosos tambien ha aumentado, al 88,4 por ciento, en comparacion
con el 84,9 por ciento hace un ano.
 &HT;    A pesar de los problemas politicos, Colombia es uno de los
sectores bancarios mas fuertes de Latinoamerica. El ano pasado este
sector mostro un crecimiento de prestamos del 33,2 por ciento, de
cuya cifra el 11,8 por ciento se genero en el cuarto trimestre. Sin
embargo, la liquidez bajo ligeramente del 8,8 por ciento al 9,2 por
ciento y los margenes netos de interes se redujeron del 7,7 por
ciento al 6,1 por ciento.
 &HT;    Venezuela es el nuevo mercado bancario en auge [ver Latin Trade,
mayo de 1998]. Aunque la reciente declinacion de los precios del
petroleo pudiera afectar la calidad de los valores, el sector
bancario venezolano esta mucho mas fuerte y saludable que en 1994.
Por ejemplo, su cobertura de prestamos morosos a finales de 1997
era del 124 por ciento.
 &HT;    Aunque los bancos extranjeros han inyectado capital fresco en
toda America Latina, tambien han mantenido a los banqueros
latinoamericanos en estado de alerta, lo que ha resultado positivo
para las fragiles economias latinoamericanas, y sus consumidores.
``La entrada de bancos extranjeros realmente se va a dejar
sentir,'' afirma Garcia Cantera, de Salomon Smith Barney. ``Al
final, todo el sistema va a funcionar con mayor eficiencia.''

TREASURIES ARE UNCHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged
Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve Board's policy-making
committee, as expected, decided not to adjust interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond closed at a price of 107 6/32, leaving the
bond's yield at 5.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
attributed the Fed's decision to a slowdown in the economy, subdued
inflation, the budget surplus and the malaise in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury securities opened weaker Wednesday after the dollar
fell in currency trading. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated
investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign
investors, who also benefit from the currency translation.
</P>
<P>
   But then a report on manufacturing suggested the economy was
slowing. ``Indeed, economic data released today clearly indicated a
slowing of economic momentum, as exemplified by the sharp decline
in the National Association of Purchasing Management index, a
fallback in construction spending, and the flattening in the index
of leading indicators,'' Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   The June manufacturing index fell to 49.6 from 51.4 in May, the
first time in two years that the level has dropped below 50, a sign
of contraction in the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
   Fine added that some of the declines in the index were for
production, employment and inventories, and while some of the
sluggishness may be a result of the strike against General Motors
Corp., he said, the crisis in Asia was playing a much greater role.
</P>
<P>
   Construction spending tumbled 1.5 percent in May to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $633.5 billion as private and public
sectors registered declines. And the Conference Board's index of
leading indicators was unchanged in May for the second consecutive
month, which could be signaling slower growth in the third quarter
as well as the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The government will report Thursday on the number of jobs added
to the economy last month and on the unemployment rate, both of
which are capable of moving the market. Estimates of jobs created
range from an increase of 125,000 jobs to an increase of 250,000,
placing the consensus at about 190,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Fine said the average for the number of jobs added to the
economy in the last two months has been plus 300,000. ``So even if
it comes in at the high end of expectations, it is still below the
recent average,'' he said.

 &HT;    Things that work well: Winning the war against mosquitos
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- Removing stagnant water: Mosquitos need water to breed. Dump
or get rid of all containers that collect rain water. Dump plant
dishes and squirt birdbaths with a hose every three days.
</P>
<P>
   -- DEET: DEET _ the active ingredient in many repellents, such
as Off! _ has been used for more than 50 years and is considered
generally safe. However, a few cases of illness and even death have
been reported, so don't use a dose that's too concentrated.
Products containing up to 35 percent DEET are sufficient for
adults; 10 percent is the maximum for children. With these and
other repellents (except permethrin) the user must coat every bit
of exposed skin for effective protection.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bite Blocker: This all-natural repellent formula has been
available in Europe for several years but is a recent arrival in
the United States. Bite Blocker is made of soy, coconut and
geranium oils and has tested as effective as DEET. Some people
dislike its sweet smell and oily texture. Manufacturer: Consep,
Bend, Ore. 1-800-367-8727
</P>
<P>
   -- Citronella-based lotions and sprays: Most repellents
described as ``natural'' contain citronella, which generally
provides shorter protection time than most DEET-based products.
Buzz Away, a spray containing citronella and other natural oils,
provided an average of 88 percent repellency during a two-hour
exposure. Buzz Away manufacturer: Quantum, Eugene, Ore.
1-800-448-1448.
</P>
<P>
   -- Permethrin: An artificial insecticide, permethrin keeps
clothes mosquito-free. It's not for use on the body, so it's
generally used along with a lotion or skin spray. Two brands are
Sawyer Permethrin and Coulston's Duranon, which can be used on
tents and other camping gear as well as clothing. Both are sold in
camping stores.
</P>
<P>
   Things that work less well: Winning a battle against mosquitos
</P>
<P>
   -- Smoke: Studies show citronella candles can reduce the number
of bites, but only for a person who's very close to the candle.
Ingredients in other smoke-producing repellents vary. One, an
incense coil called Eaton's, relies on a chemical called
``allethrin.'' Says Ray Noblet of the University of Georgia, ``It's
fun to use, and it may have some effect, but it's negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Avon Skin-So-Soft: This bath oil received a lot of publicity
several years ago when NASA trainees used it when parachuting into
Florida swamps. In the lab, Skin-So-Soft provided about a half-hour
of protection, a duration 10 times less than DEET. Avon now offers
Skin-So-Soft with citronella, which may be more effective. Avon:
1-800-367-2866
</P>
<P>
   Things that don't work: Surrendering to mosquitos
</P>
<P>
   -- Electric bug zappers: These kill a lot of bugs, but not many
mosquitos. Tests show yards with zappers have about the same number
of mosquitos as those without.
</P>
<P>
   -- The citrosa plant: A genetically engineered geranium hybrid,
these are supposed to emit a citronella aroma that repels
mosquitos. However, in tests in Florida, mosquitos actually landed
on the plant's leaves.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ultrasonic repellent devices: Supposed to mimic other insects
and thus repel biting mosquitos, research shows they don't work.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bat houses: Locked in a room with mosquitos, bats do feed on
the bugs. Outdoors, they seem to prefer other insects.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bug-repellent bracelets: John Gormley of the Fulton
County(Ga.) Health Department is not impressed. ``Bug-repellent
bracelets don't protect anything but the wearer's wrist,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   -- Eating garlic or vitamin B: Says UGA's Noblet, ``I have never
seen any conclusive evidence that what you eat repels mosquitos.''

 &HT;    Declaring war against mosquitos
 &HT;    By Holly Morris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is it that we can send a man to the moon, but we can't
manage to make our back yards liveable in the summer? Despite years
of spraying, zapping and slapping, mosquitos still seem an
unstoppable menace.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that people haven't tried to get rid of mosquitos. They
have, for centuries. They've drained swamps, covered ponds with
oil, sprayed whole counties with insecticide. More recently,
they've stocked waters with fish that eat mosquito larvae.
</P>
<P>
   But mosquitos are tough customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insect populations evolve and adapt very quickly, rather like
a virus,'' says Ray Noblet, who heads University of Georgia's
Department of Entomology. Their systems can adjust to insecticides
and other manmade changes in their environment.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, mosquitos can travel for miles, so eradicating them
in one area has limited effect.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, mosquitos are a nuisance, but for people who are
allergic to substances in the bugs' mouths, too many bites can
bring on a fever.
</P>
<P>
   And some people just seem to get bitten than others.
``Blood-feeding insects find some individuals more attractive than
others. We don't know why, but this is true whether you're talking
about people or cattle,'' says Noblet.
</P>
<P>
   One such person is Clare Sahling, an Atlanta interior designer
who is turning a grassy embankment by her house into a garden. The
cost in mosquito bites is high.
</P>
<P>
   Sahling says her ``mosquito-magnetism'' forces her to wear an
elaborate costume _ bandanna, blue jeans, high socks and
long-sleeve shirts, all sprayed or soaked in repellent _ to tend
her garden on hot days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out the door and every mosquito in both counties screams
`LUNCH!''' she says. ``Off! is my summer perfume.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bolen, a Northlake accountant, says he's known to
neighborhood mosquitos as ``a good blood meal.'' When he goes
outside, he douses himself with repellent lotion, and resigns
himself to ``let whatever gets through the repellent chew on me.''
</P>
<P>
   As troubling as mosquitos can be, some anti-bug meaures really
do work. With a little information, it's possible to choose a
weapon that succeeds _ and to avoid those that don't.

 &HT;    CNN series to take long look at Cold War
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CNN plans to give viewers a sneak peek at some of the reams of
footage it collected for ``The Cold War'' documentary series. On
Aug. 30 (date is still tentative), CNN will run a one-hour special
on Fidel Castro, based largely on ``Cold War'' executive producer
Pat Mitchell's 5 1/2-hour interview with the Cuban president in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Castro was the toughest to land of the roughly 600 original
interviews done for ``The Cold War,'' which debuts Sept. 27 and
runs for 24 weeks. The Cuban president, the subject of persistent
rumors about ill health, is extremely active and voluble in the
footage included in ``The Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who's president of CNN Productions, is scheduled to
return to Cuba on July 17 to tape some footage of the country,
which has a CNN bureau but is still off-limits to American
tourists. Mitchell said Castro has also agreed to let CNN take
video inside his personal office in the Palace of the Revolution in
Havana, which is almost never allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War'' is one of the longest documentaries ever made.
Sir Jeremy Isaacs, who produced ``The World at War,'' about World
War II, for British TV in the 1970s, assembled the 24-hour history,
which covers every possible angle of the conflict, from Yalta
through the Rosenberg spy trial, the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile
crisis, Korea, Vietnam and the fall of communism. Actor Kenneth
Branagh narrates.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner, who came up with the idea (and gets a ``series
concept by'' credit at the end of every episode), reviewed every
episode and even found an error that three historical consultants
and all the writers and producers had missed, Mitchell said. An
early segment referred to Franklin D. Roosevelt declaring war on
Japan in World War II, but Turner pointed out that only Congress
can officially declare war. Branagh had to be called back to make
the change in the narration.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the drumbeating out of CNN recently has been for its new
``NewsStand'' show, but that will be changing in the coming weeks,
as ``The Cold War'' gets more and more promotional attention.
Turner, Mitchell, Isaacs and Branagh will talk up the show to TV
critics July 10 at the Television Critics Association meeting in
Pasadena, Calif.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Ample sunshine, comfortable humidity and seasonable temperatures
will prevail over a large area from the northern Mississippi Valley
to the Northeast coast. High pressure moving east from the Ohio
Valley will promote gentle breezes across most of the region. Some
puffy cumulus clouds will develop near the Appalachians. A few
brief showers or thundershowers will blossom over the mountains of
the central and southern Appalachians later Thursday afternoon as a
jet stream disturbance approaches from the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather will persist over the southern Plains and much of
the Southeast. A front separating the hot air mass from the cooler
air over the northern states will be the focus for clusters of
clouds and thundershowers. Local flooding is possible over portions
of the southern Mississippi Valley where thunderstorms pass
repetitively over the same area. Clouds from a tropical disturbance
over the southern Gulf of Mexico will approach the coast of Texas,
but heavy showers are expected to remain offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Some sunshine will yield to scattered strong thunder near the
Canadian border from Montana to Minnesota as a cold front slips
south. Clouds and showers will linger into the night over the
Dakotas and southern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually hot conditions will linger over most of the interior
West. Thunderstorms will form over many mountain peaks during the
afternoon. Most of the West Coast States will be dry and
seasonable. A few strong thunderstorms will form over the mountains
of northern California and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Downburst
</P>
<P>
   A fist of powerful winds called a downburst punched parts of
Pittsburgh Tuesday afternoon, causing widespread damage. As a
series of severe thunderstorms marched across western Pennsylvania,
momentum from fast, high-altitude winds was transferred to the
ground by downdrafts in the thunderstorms. In Pittsburgh, downburst
winds gusted as high as 85 mph in the North Hills section, creating
a swath of damage five miles long and one to two miles wide. Trees
were blown down on homes and power lines. A preliminary report
indicated that 10 people were injured by the downburst.

ZVEREVA'S ROLL CONTINUES AS SHE OUSTS SELES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Natasha Zvereva had never beaten Steffi Graf before
ousting her from Wimbledon in straight sets last week.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently something about this year's tournament has put a
charge into Zvereva's game, because she ended another winless
streak Wednesday by dumping Monica Seles, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, to move
into the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Center Court, Venus Williams was losing to
third-seeded Jana Novotna, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2), and screaming at the
umpire over line calls.
</P>
<P>
   Two calls in particular upset the 18-year-old, who at one point
yelled: ``I know it's out, she knows it's out, everyone knows it's
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the crowd probably enjoyed my emotional
outbursts,'' said Williams, the seventh seed. ``I guess someone
would turn the channel and suddenly see some girl screaming and
keep it there, because I know I would. It probably brightened up
someone's day.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no such histrionics in the Zvereva-Seles match, as
the unseeded native of Belarus eliminated the sixth-seeded former
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played pretty steady from the baseline and I didn't go for
many shots,'' said Zvereva, who was only hoping to make it past the
first round before Wimbledon started. ``I just tried to put the
shots deep and I hit them flat. Usually I intend to put more spin
on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised big time. I'm absolutely thrilled. It's
completely unexpected. It makes it a double pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva held a 4-1 lead at one point in the first set, but she
held her own in the tiebreaker. In the second set, Zvereva broke in
the fourth and sixth games to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed my backhand all over the place; you just can't do
that,'' said Seles. ``I definitely had quite a few chances, but she
definitely played some really smart tennis. I just didn't feel
anything was going well. Once you miss a few key shots, I got more
uptight with myself and she made some good shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when you walk out there, you can lose every
match,'' added Seles, who had difficulty with her serve as well as
service return. ``It was just my performance that really bugs me,
it's very tough. Today, the standard I was playing was not good.
She's definitely playing better than she used to, no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles did advance the farthest at Wimbledon since 1992; she
bowed out in the third round last year.
</P>
<P>
   But this day belonged to the 27-year-old who wears sunglasses
even on shady days and who wants to become the finest farmer ever
in Minsk when her playing days have concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, France's Nathalie Tauziat pulled off another upset by
whipping Lindsay Davenport, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, the second seed, hurt herself with an inaccuarte
forehand, while Tauziat changed her strategy and stayed at the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you always go to the net she starts to return well, to
pass well,'' said Tauziat, ``so I mixed it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the 16th-seeded Tauziat overpowered Davenport, a
surprise since Davenport is 6 feet 2 inches, 175 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now my game is powerful and I worked hard for that
because the tennis game today is very powerful,'' stated Tauziat,
2-0 on grass against Davenport (0-7 on other surfaces). ``I showed
I can play faster and faster and better than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really hitting the ball very hard and I knew this was
her favorite surface coming in,'' said Davenport. ``And once I
started losing a bit of confidence in my forehand, I started
backing up on it. She was putting so much pressure on me, returning
my serve very hard and very deep.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last quarterfinal match, top seed Martina Hingis broke
through to oust fourth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, 6-3, 3-6,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to be like playing on clay or hard court and not on
grass,'' Hingis said. ``There was lots of running, long rallies. I
played a very good match, with not too many mistakes. I kept having
40-0 each service game and I kept losing it, so I didn't feel quite
happy about that. I was like, `Come on, not again.' But finally, I
made it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was considered a breakthrough last year when new
Windows-based personal computers were offered for less than $1,000.
But now it looks as if the $500 barrier will be next to crack, at
least if an Internet-based PC company called iDOT continues on its
current pace.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, iDOT (www.idot.com) broke the $600 level with
an entry-level Windows 98-based system that includes a
200-megahertz AMD K6 (Pentium class) processor with MMX technology,
32 megabytes of high-speed SDRAM, a 2.1-gigabyte hard drive, 2MB of
video memory, a 32X CD-ROM drive, and a pair of Universal Serial
Bus ports.
</P>
<P>
   The $599 iDOT system is about as far back in the technology pack
as one can get these days without looking for a hand crank _ the
front edge today is a 400-MHz Pentium II system _ but it is a
workable computer for those who have modest computing needs and
whose primary interest is low price.
</P>
<P>
   For an extra $79, users can add an upgraded sound card, speakers
and a 56K modem, and for another $99, a 15-inch monitor. (A 17-inch
monitor is $199 extra.) With a $199 Canon BJC 4300 color printer,
the total system price is $976, which is a few bucks cheaper than
any other comparable new system found on www.pricescan.com, a
comparative shopping service on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   A Gateway salesman named Leo snorted derisively when a caller
asked what Gateway had in the sub-$600 price range. ``I can tell
you where your $599, 200-megahertz K6 system will be one year from
now _ an expensive doorstop,'' Leo said. He advised spending $1,200
for a faster Pentium-based system.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices said he was not sure
whether AMD still made the 200-MHz K6 chip _ it does not _ and
suggested that the faster 266-MHz chip was ``the sweet spot'' for
entry-level PCs these days.
</P>
<P>
   While competitors carped about iDOT's 200-megahertz system, the
Austin, Texas-based company shut them up by cutting the price of
its leading-edge 400-MHz Pentium II computer to $1,699.
</P>
<P>
   When will we see new Windows 98-compatible computers slip below
the $500 mark? Mark Marlow, iDOT's vice president for marketing,
said it could happen before the end of the year. _ PETER H. LEWIS

   Flaw in Word 98 Can Spread Your Personal Information
</P>
<P>
   It's a paranoid computer user's worst nightmare: private
information from your hard disk made accessible for the reading
enjoyment of strangers. And it could happen if you use Microsoft
Word 98 for Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   As reported last week on the MacInTouch Web page
(www.macintouch.com), hidden chunks of old e-mail, disk-directory
paths, Web addresses and other confidential information from the
user's hard drive or RAM can be embedded in Microsoft Word 98
documents. The unintended information can be made visible when the
documents are opened with a text-editing program like BBEdit, thus
making e-mailed or networked files a potential security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Users have blamed the glitch on Word 98 failing to overwrite
previously stored data in the hard drive when it saves a file to
the same part of the disk. In MacWeek magazine, a Microsoft
spokesperson acknowledged the problem and stated that the bug rises
from the file-deletion methods used by Macintosh operating system.
</P>
<P>
   According to MacInTouch, however, similar problems have also
been reported in Microsoft Office 97 for Windows and Adobe
PageMaker files. The site notes that Microsoft posted an
appropriate patch for Windows 95 on its Web site, but that the
company was still investigating the Macintosh problem. _ J.D.

   New Internet Loan Services Not for the Faint of Heart
</P>
<P>
   Applying for a loan is an eerie process. You disclose
information about yourself that you'd be loath to share with your
shrink, and then wait while numbers get vetted and crunched by
anonymous clerks at the lender's offices.
</P>
<P>
   Online mortgages make the process eerier still _ yet more
satisfying for those who prefer instant gratification. Spend
fifteen minutes tapping your personal finance information into a
database out in cyberspace and within a few hours you've
prequalified. No unnecessary interaction with humans need take
place.
</P>
<P>
   Several e-loan services are already well established. They
include E-loan, Quicken and Home Shark. The types of loans they
offer include mortgages, home equity, personal, auto, credit cards
and debt consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, $482 million in loans had originated on the
Internet, according to a report from Forrester Research. The same
report predicts that this number will reach $40.5 billion by 2001.
The latest entrant is Lending Tree (www.lendingtree.com), an online
loan center that distinguishes itself from the others by sending
applicants to multiple lenders simultaneously, and having those
lenders bid against each other for the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Like its competitors, Lending Tree has a privacy statement in
which it assures customers that it will not sell or share any
personal information with any organization, other than the lenders
to whom they send the applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take great precautions in handling personal information,''
said Douglas Lebda, president of Lending Tree. Such disclosures are
an improvement over the physical loan applications, where no such
overt assurances are made. Still, it might take some time before
people feel comfortable tossing their social security numbers and
salary information out into cyberspace. _ KATIE HAFNER

   This Elephant Can Remember Those Lost Web Pages
</P>
<P>
   Want to recall that fabulous Web page you found yesterday? You
know, the one you forgot to bookmark?
</P>
<P>
   If that happens to you often, you might be suffering from
internesia (the inability to remember important Internet
information.) For people who do suffer from internesia or whose Web
bookmarks can fill a disk drive, help may be on the way. Elephant
Tracks, a new downloadable program, watches where a Web browser
goes and allows users to retrace their footprints.
</P>
<P>
   The program was written by Ed Staub, a 44-year-old programmer
who said he found himself suffering from internesia around New
Year's. ''I had this problem and looked for a solution,'' Staub
said. ``I couldn't find it, so I wrote this.''
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Tracks indexes the words on Web pages that are viewed.
When people need to look up an earlier page, they can search the
index for that page. Staub said it is much easier then looking
through a history folder or hitting the back button, and certainly
handier than a bookmarks list that goes on and on. ''It is an
infallible extension to a fallible memory,'' Staub said.
</P>
<P>
   He expects to find a lot of users for the product, saying that
the average age of the Internet user has gone from 32 to 38 in the
past two years. Elephant Tracks for Internet Explorer costs $24.95
and may be downloaded from www.elephantsoftware.com. A version for
Netscape Navigator should be ready in September. _ STEVEN E. BRIER &QL;

   New Laptop Bus Puts the ``Port'' Back in Portable
</P>
<P>
   Laptops are more mobile than desktop models, but they have their
own problems, including smaller screens, smaller keyboards and less
useful pointing devices. You can buy full-size peripherals for your
desk but as subnotebook manufacturers downsize their machines, they
often leave off ports. A port replicator is one solution, but they
are not available for many machines.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona company wants laptop users to hop on the Bus, a
universal port replicator that plugs into the PC Card slot on
almost any notebook. Connect all the peripherals into the Bus, they
say, plug the Bus into an available Type II PC card slot and you
are rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Made by CNF, Inc. (www.cnfinc.com), the device supports
industry-standard serial, parallel and video ports, as well
keyboard and mouse peripherals. The current model works with
Windows/Intel machines. _ STEVEN E. BRIER

   New Mexico Internet Law Ruled Unconstitutional
</P>
<P>
   Laws that seek to protect minors from Internet pornography may
be palatable to politicians and voters. But thus far, they haven't
passed muster with the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a law was to take effect in New Mexico that would
have made it a misdemeanor to ``knowingly or intentionally''
transmit sexual content, including ``actual or simulated nudity,
sexual intercourse or any other sexual conduct'' to a minor. Late
Tuesday, however, a federal judge issued an opinion enjoining the
legislation and declaring that it violates the First, Fifth and
Fourteenth amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Judge LeRoy Hansen, a U.S. District Court judge for the District
of New Mexico, ruled that the proposed law threatens the ability of
adults to post and share such content among themselves, and the
capacity of minors to receive constitutionally protected speech,
such as art.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the judge ruled that the law would have given New Mexico
the right to regulate trade in other states, which is a not allowed
under the Fourteenth Amendment's Commerce Clause.
</P>
<P>
   The decision should come as no surprise given the fate of two
similar laws. In June 1997 the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the
Communications Decency Act, which would have made it a felony to
send ``indecent'' material to minors. _ MATT RICHTEL

TEXAS COMPANY BUYS ANOTHER NEW ENGLAND DAIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another sign of rapid consolidation in the dairy industry,
West Lynn Creamery Inc. said Wednesday it has been acquired by the
same Texas company that acquired Garelick Farms a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies will now be owned by Suiza Foods Corp., a $1.8
billion-a-year Dallas &UR;  &LR; distribution firm and holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its home base, Suiza runs dairy operations up and
down the East Coast and in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the all-cash transaction were not disclosed. Layoffs
and plant closings are not expected at closely held West Lynn, of
Lynn, Mass., said Suiza chairman and chief executive Gregg L.
Engles.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, West Lynn chief executive Arthur Pappathanasi
said he and his management team will continue to run the dairy,
which has estimated annual sales of $215 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partnership with Suiza...offers us access to capital
necessary to continue our expansion in both our dairy and ice cream
operations,'' Pappathanasi said.
</P>
<P>
   Engles pointed out that West Lynn primarily serves food service
customers while Garelick Farms, of Franklin, Mass., is more focused
on supplying dairy products to grocery chains.
</P>
<P>
   Savings can be realized by ``rationalizing'' the distribution
systems of Garelick Farms and West Lynn, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, opportunities could arise where one truck could
deliver milk to a grocery store and a nearby food-service customer
rather than dispatching different trucks to each location as
Garelick Farms and West Creamery do now.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be ways for the two companies to save money on
advertising and marketing costs, Engles said.
</P>
<P>
   Dairies have been traditionally a regional business.
</P>
<P>
   There were once about ``15 players'' in the Northeast market,
many of them family owned, and that number has fallen to about 10,
according to Engles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire dairy industry is consolidating,'' said CJS
Securities analyst Arnold Ursaner, who follows Suiza.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming a public company in 1996, Suiza has ridden
the &UR;  &LR; surging stock market to make nearly 40 acquisitions; in the
last year or so, its stock has risen from $14 a share to about $60.
</P>
<P>
   Under Engles, who has a background as an investment banker and
merger-and-acquisitions expert, Suiza seems to be in a race with
Illinois-based Dean Foods Co., as both look to piece together a
national distribution network of dairy operations.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent fiscal year, Dean made nine acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   With all this consolidation going on, a few big operations now
tend to dominate a region, and some smaller players are feeling the
squeeze, Ursaner said.
</P>
<P>
   What Suiza does is to ``offer independent dairy entrepreneurs a
reasonable exit strategy'' with an acquisition offer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With estimated annual revenues of more than $500 million,
Chelsea-based H.P. Hood Inc. said it has succesfully competed for
years with Garelick Farms in supermarkets and with West Lynn in the
food-service segment of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't change a lot for us because we compete with them in
different channels,'' said chief operating officer Jeffrey Stephen
of Hood, which is now owned by the Kaneb family.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, having Garelick and West Lynn owned by the same
Texas conglomerate is more likely to hurt smaller players than
someone as big as Hood, Ursaner said.
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal 1997, Suiza reported a profit of $28.8 million on
sales of $1.79 billion. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of
Suiza closed at 59 7/8, up 3/16 Wednesday.

   GAMBLING-ELDERLY (Cedar Rapids, Iowa) For Milford Hartz, the
adrenaline started to flow right about the time that the
teal-colored deluxe motor coach bus pulled into the parking lot in
front of the Wal-Mart store, located right behind the Royal Fork
Buffet restaurant. It was 8:30 a.m. and the bus was soon loaded
with over 30 elderly adults, most of whom had spent a lifetime of
early morning hours toiling on the surrounding farms and in nearby
factories. With hundreds of casinos scattered throughout 26 states,
and a growing population of seniors looking for places where they
can socialize, find companionship and be a part of something that
is lively and new, casino gambling has become a favorite pastime

   CHINA-CLINTON (Shanghai, China) _ President Clinton, in his last
address to a mass audience in China, says Wednesday that he will
continue to speak out on behalf of democracy and individual
liberty, but that the United States does not seek to dictate to
China the path of its development. In an interview with China's
main government-run television network, Clinton said that China's
current course of economic liberalization and greater personal
freedom is ``morally right,'' and that the status of the United
States as the world's lone superpower did not give it the right to
use its economic and military right to impose its values on China
or any other nation. The interview with China Central Television is
to be broadcast on Thursday. By John M. Broder.

   ALA-ELECT-ASSESS (Montgomery, Ala.) _ As a battle for the soul
of Southern Republicanism, the Alabama primary that Gov. Fob James
Jr. won so convincingly on Tuesday reinforced a number of political
truths about the party and the region. Religious conservatives
still wield immense influence. Strong stands against taxes still
sell. Race still matters. And even as Southerners take a leading
role in national politics, they still resent federal intrusion.
Each of those factors played a role in James's surprisingly
conclusive victory over Winton Blount 3d, a Montgomery businessman,
in their hard-fought primary runoff. By Kevin Sack.

FOR THE FORT WORTH DALLAS BALLET, BALANCHINE IS OUT, ECLECTIC IS
IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new coach, a new conductor, a new director _ sometimes it
means a continuation of the old style under a new person. Sometimes
it means a whole new epoch.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet, the departure of Paul Mejia,
50, as artistic director and the arrival of Benjamin Houk, 36,
definitely means a new era.
</P>
<P>
   It is the end of Fort Worth Dallas Ballet's years as the most
strongly Balanchine-devoted company in America, and the beginning
of a post-Balanchine era.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographer George Balanchine (1904-83) arrived in the United
States in 1922, in the post-Revolutionary wave of refugees from the
old Russian empire. From his base in New York, he created a style
of ballet rooted in the Russian tradition but capturing the energy
and breadth of America. It focused on the beauty of the female body
and was accompanied by musical masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine lived in a manner that was materially modest _ he
ironed his own shirts _ and sexually extravagant _ including a
string of affairs and ballerina wives _ while creating the greatest
body of choreographic masterpieces in history for his company, the
New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   His influence in ballet is comparable to that of Beethoven in
music or Shakespeare in drama: From now to eternity, not a step
will be taken on any ballet stage anywhere that will not contain a
bit of Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   His numerous pupils spread the Balanchine gospel around the
world. Paul Mejia, who earned Balanchine's ire in 1969 when he
married Balanchine's favorite ballerina, Suzanne Farrell, is one of
dozens of still-active apostles who knew Balanchine in person, who
worked with him in the studio and who learned his style and
philosophy from direct contact.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia's professional adoration of Balanchine, unencumbered by
their personal feud, was reflected in the way the dancers in the
Fort Worth Dallas Ballet looked and moved _ and in the repertory
they danced for over a decade, devoted entirely to works of
Balanchine and works by Mejia in a style that was an unmistakable
extension of Balanchine's.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 years, under Mejia's guidance, Fort Worth audiences came
to know and love Balanchine's creations, from ``Serenade'' to
``Apollo'' to ``Western Symphony'' to ``Jewels'' _ a varied
universe of dance, all from one source.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the pupils of Balanchine's pupils are filling the ranks.
Benjamin Houk never knew Balanchine. But he danced for 13 years,
eight as a principal, in another Balanchine-focused company, the
Pacific Northwest Ballet, which was directed by two Balanchine
dancers, Kent Stowell and Francia Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole dance world is built on Balanchine's genius,'' Houk
says. ``As in music, one era builds on another. Baroque goes to
classical, classical goes to romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in dance, Balanchine leads to post-Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean we stop dancing Balanchine ballets,'' Houk
says. But it does mean that the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet will dance
fewer works by Balanchine and more works by other choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's season in Fort Worth, arranged by consultant Bruce
Marks after Mejia's resignation in January and before Houk's
appointment in June, includes only two relatively short works by
Balanchine, and a whole range of works by major choreographers
previously unknown on the live stage in Fort Worth: Antony Tudor
and Agnes de Mille from earlier in the 20th century, for instance;
Marius Petipa from the 19th; and, from our own time, Lila York and
Kent Stowell.
</P>
<P>
   Houk, who will arrive in Fort Worth this month, says that future
seasons will probably have a little more Balanchine _ three or four
works _ but that the general pattern has been set for a mix of
established choreographers, historical pieces and contemporary
choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   And Houk has promised a more eclectic company. In the
traditional pieces, audiences will see more of ballet the way it
looked before Balanchine. (Although Balanchine worshipped the
female form, he also helped liberate the male dancer from the
stand-up role.) We'll see a calmer, more picturesque image of
ballet than Balanchine envisioned in some of the 20th-century
works, with more overt development of character and plot _ as in
Tudor's ``Lilac Garden'' and De Mille's ``Rodeo.''
</P>
<P>
   And we'll occasionally move into the anything-goes realm, where
the lines between modern dance and ballet blur. Physically, it
won't be harder for the dancers, but it will stretch them
emotionally and philosophically. Instead of working with just the
half-century of dance marked by Balanchine's career, they will be
asked to go back to the 19th century and forward to the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Houk expects to present a few of his own works through the
years, but he certainly won't be present as a choreographer to the
extent that Mejia was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're combining elements of contemporary dance and strong
classical technique,'' Houk says.
</P>
<P>
   That's all right with Barbara Horgan, general director of the
Balanchine Trust, the New York City Ballet-based organization that
controls the performance rights to Balanchine ballets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think an artistic director should have the freedom to
present whatever ballets he feels are right for his company and
audience,'' she says. ``Even Mr. Balanchine would have criticized
an all-Balanchine company.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Fort Worth Dallas Ballet still a ``Balanchine'' company?
</P>
<P>
   ``That label becomes less important and significant as
repertoire becomes more eclectic, as the lines are blurred,'' Houk
says. ``We're an `American' company.''

NORTHER IRELAND ASSEMBLY HOLDS FIRST SESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ There was heckling, but no punches. Ian Paisley walked
in, but he didn't storm out. Insults were hurled, but chairs were
not. People were scorned as murderers, but no one got killed.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy broke out in Northern Ireland Wednesday, and at the
end of the day the new Assembly was still in business and there was
no blood on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who took part in the inaugural sitting of the
108-seat Assembly were eight former paramilitary prisoners, three
men who were shot in assassination attempts, one who survived a
bomb that killed 11 of his neighbors, and several others who
escaped various attempts to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   It was striking to watch David Trimble and Seamus Mallon shake
hands after they were elected leader and deputy leader. The last
time they stood shoulder to shoulder was in a village called
Poyntzpass where two best friends _ one a Catholic, the other a
Protestant _ had been shot dead in a bar, in the dark days of last
winter when a political settlement seemed hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, leader of the party that represents most Protestants,
and Mallon, deputy leader of the party that represents most
Catholics, together comforted the dead men's families. It was a
spontaneous show of solidarity and humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, they again occupied the common ground that has proved
so elusive these past 30 years. Trimble and Mallon stood in the
same room where the Good Friday accord was reached and vowed to
represent the interests of all people. Later, they slapped each
other's backs and joked over who would buy the other a drink.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon became the Assembly's deputy leader because John Hume,
the head of his party and the chief architect of the Good Friday
accord, removed himself from the running. Hume's act seemed to set
the tone for a day that was remarkable for its magnanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon warmly praised Trimble as someone who led the majority of
Protestant unionists ``with courage, with dignity, with
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissident unionists accuse Trimble of going soft on demands that
the Irish Republican Army begin turning in its arsenal before its
political representatives in Sinn Fein take up Cabinet positions
and its prisoners are released. But Trimble insisted, ``We will not
sit in government with unreconstructed terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, standing just 20 feet away from the former IRA leaders
and current Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness,
said, ``We have always acknowledged the possibility that people can
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Even McGuinness applauded Trimble. But Adams acknowledged
reality by saying that his party would abstain from voting for
Trimble as first minister because ``it could be used to beat him
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a fundamentalist Christian, the Rev. Ian Paisley
and the dissident unionists he leads do not believe republicans
like Adams are capable of redemption. But even the dissidents who
believe the Good Friday accord is the beginning of an eventual
slide into a united Ireland seemed to be seduced by the prospect of
taking part in the first sitting of a local government in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Paisley and his allies wasted little time in making life
uncomfortable for Trimble, whom they consider a traitor, and for
Sinn Fein's 18 Assembly members, whom they derided as murderers.
They coughed and snickered when Sinn Fein members made introductory
remarks in Gaelic.
</P>
<P>
   But most observers here were surprised by the relatively
restrained behavior of Paisley, who has heckled worse in British
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were remarkably tame,'' said Monica McWilliams, leader of
the Women's Coalition, a centrist party. ``I expected a lot worse
from them. I think they realize now, this is going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In taking his seat, Paisley explained, ``I'm not going in to
negotiate with Sinn Fein, but to confront them.''
</P>
<P>
   As members registered votes on procedural matters, dissident
unionist Jim Shannon began voting in the Ulster Scots language. By
last night, Adams was registering his votes in Irish, English, and
Ulster Scots.
</P>
<P>
   As debate droned on about the potential for violence Sunday in
Portadown, where a Protestant group is barred from marching through
a Catholic neighborhood, everyone knew that long days lay ahead. A
notice hung in the makeshift bar next to the Assembly room: ``The
bar will be open from 12 until necessary.''

I THINK, THEREFORE I AM, BUT THERE'S SO LITTLE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be true, as it is often said, that people don't read
anymore. Certainly it is true that, outside of a few academic
departments, very few of us are reading the classics of philosophy,
for example, Immanuel Kant's ``Critique of Pure Reason'' or Rene
Descartes' ``Discourse on Method'' or Jean-Paul Sartre's ``Being
and Nothingness.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the edifices of thought built by the likes of Kant
and Descartes are among the great achievements of the human mind,
that is a shame.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Shortcuts to philosophical understanding have
existed for decades in the form of such books as Bertrand Russell's
``History of Western Philosophy'' (which is sometimes so dense that
only another philosopher could understand it) or the works of Will
and Ariel Durant. These books satisfy a need, even though they
represent a kind of secondhand knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   We feel that to be educated persons we ought to know at least
the main lines of thought of the seminal minds from Socrates to
Wittgenstein. But their works are long and difficult, and who has
the time?
</P>
<P>
   Now, into our world of short-lived thirsts for knowledge comes a
series of attractive little paperbacks by Paul Strathern with
titles that perfectly capture the need. Strathern, an British
writer who is not, it would seem from the dust-jacket description,
a professional philosopher, has written a series of books called
``Plato in 90 Minutes,'' ``Thomas Aquinas in 90 Minutes,'' ``Kant
in 90 Minutes,'' and so forth, continuing with Descartes,
Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Sartre and others.
</P>
<P>
   The books have been published by Ivan R. Dee in Chicago, which
advertises a list of others for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   I've read a few of Strathern's volumes, and, I find them hard to
stop reading, in the way that potato chips are hard to stop eating.
They are seductive; they satisfy a certain appetite; they can be
consumed on the run; but they are so short of a full meal that one
wonders about their ultimate values.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where many a scholar has spent decades studying every
one of Plato's dialogues, the idea of Plato in a 90-minute,
bite-size morsel seems a sacrilege, the intellectual equivalent of
a flat stomach from just five minutes of easy exercise a day.
</P>
<P>
   But no, that is going too far. Strathern's books are
well-written, clear and informed; they have a breezy wit about
them. Each of these slender volumes combines a quick, lively
biography of a particular thinker, a summary of that person's main
ideas and, perhaps most useful of all, a bit of historical
contextualization, a few lines on where each person fits into the
grand scheme of Western thought.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Kant in 90 Minutes,'' for example, contains a very concise
description of the radical skepticism of David Hume (whose own 90
minutes are on the list of future books), which Kant was trying to
surmount in his ``Critique of Pure Reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Strathern's first lines on Descartes tell the reader that at the
end of the 16th century, ``philosophy had stopped. It was Descartes
who started it up again.''
</P>
<P>
   What Strathern means is that philosophy in the Middle Ages had
become scholasticism, which supported church dogma and declared new
ideas to be heretical. Descartes put the emphasis on ``reason
rather than dogma'' and redirected philosophical attention to ``the
analysis of human consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Strathern's volume on Sartre begins, briefly, with Hume and
continues, only slightly less briefly, with the creation of
phenomenology by Edmund Husserl before going on to a gently mocking
description of Sartre's existentialism. (Strathern finds Sartre a
brilliant thinker, but also a pretentious windbag, which is reason
enough to like his series.)
</P>
<P>
   Sartre, for example, spent 1933 in Germany studying the
``phenomena'' of existence. That was the year Hitler came to power,
but Sartre was too busy pondering existence to take much notice of
reality, a condition that stayed with him for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to be dismissive of Strathern's efforts and, indeed,
anybody who has more than a half-forgotten undergraduate education
in the main currents of Western thought might well find his books
elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Others less informed may find the summaries of concepts so
compressed as to be confusing. There are other questions to ask
about his effort, philosophical questions as it were. Is it better
to have a smattering of philosophical information than none at all?
The old proverb, after all, reminds us of the dangers of a little
bit of knowledge, the main danger being that we will forget how
ignorant we actually are and form half-baked opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Another question has to do with the point of reading philosophy
in the first place. Philosophy is different from biography or
polemics. One reads Kant or Descartes not merely for their ideas
but for the play of great minds engaged in deep thought on
torturously vexing questions. In this sense, several of the most
satisfying moments in Strathern's 90 moments per volume come in
reading the brief excerpts that he has chosen from the philosophers
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I desired to devote myself wholly to the search for
truth, I thought it necessary . . . to reject as if utterly false
anything in which I could discover the least grounds for doubt, so
that I could find out if I was left with anything at all which was
absolutely indubitable. Thus, because our senses sometimes deceive
us, I decided to suppose that nothing was really as they led us to
believe it was.''
</P>
<P>
   In such fashion does Rene Descartes embark on his quest for the
one indubitable truth on which his system was founded: I think,
therefore I am. Or, here are a few immortal lines from Kant:
</P>
<P>
   ``Time has no objective reality; it is not an accident, not a
substance, and not a relation: it is a purely subjective condition,
necessary because of the nature of the human mind which coordinates
all our sensibilities by a certain law, and is a pure intuition. We
coordinate substances and accidents alike, according to
simultaneity and succession, only through the concept of time.''
</P>
<P>
   This is good stuff. In the best of circumstances, it might even
lead one to read more of the original works. On the other hand, not
very many of us are going to spend the next few weeks poring over
the 800-plus pages of ``The Critique of Pure Reason.''
</P>
<P>
   I have Strathern to thank for the snippet of Kant, this jot of
erudition, that he has added to my meager store as well as for his
reminder of how little I know. Strathern's books are good enough
for them to provide genuine education, even if thin education, and
I am prepared in this case to believe that a thin education is
better than no education at all.

FROM COFFEE-TABLE CLUTTER TO COVETED COLLECTIBLE

   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Batscha was wary. ``I really don't think you
should say,'' the president of the Museum of Television and Radio
cautioned a second time as Steven Reddicliffe's finger came close
to pointing out TV Guide's most valuable cover.
</P>
<P>
   Reddicliffe, the magazine's editor in chief, eyed Batscha
quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you just say which covers are most collectible,
rather than mentioning what they're worth,'' Batscha advised.
</P>
<P>
   Surely there aren't fanatics out there who would try to rip a
plexiglass-encased TV Guide cover off the wall of the museum's
galleries, at 25 W. 52nd St. in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have security,'' Batscha replied, a bit indignantly.
Then he sighed. ``I guess this is what Philippe de Montebello has
to deal with all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of ``A Television Diary: 45 Years of TV Guide
Covers,'' which runs through Aug. 31 at the Museum of Television
and Radio, fail to see any irony in linking their show to those
overseen by the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on April 3, 1953, when a newborn Desi Arnaz Jr. gazed
winsomely from the first cover of Walter Annenberg's new creation,
the ``bible of television'' has aspired to greater heights than
mere coffee-table clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,350 covers later, and well into Desi Jr.'s middle age,
the magazine has racked up enough commissions by prominent artists
_ 37 Hirschfelds, two Charles Addams, a Rockwell, a Peter Max, a
Warhol and (could it be?) a Dali _ to invade The New Yorker's turf
and to catapult its status at least as high as a television tower.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors can discuss their newest acquisitions on some 15
sites on the Internet. So big, in fact, is cover collecting that it
warranted its own ``Seinfeld'' episode. (TV Guide returned the
favor by issuing a special collectible four-cover farewell to the
sitcom.)
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, according to a press release, strives to show
``how far television (and society) has come in its depiction of the
American family,'' and 400 covers are categorized to do just that:
``The Viewer on Television,'' ``History: Fact and Fiction,''
``Spies and Private Eyes,'' ``Friends and Neighbors'' and, yes,
``The Changing Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Even animals get their own category. (What else to do with
Lassie and her _ uh, his _ 11 covers?) But after hundreds of
covers, most of them unflinchingly upbeat and energetic, a viewer
may wonder just whose society is on view.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ``The Changing Family.'' If the '50s were idyllic _ and
they were if you believe the scenes of domestic tranquillity on
``Ozzie and Harriet'' and ``Father Knows Best'' _ then the '60s and
the '70s were blissful. Fred MacMurray and two of his three
television sons frolic aboard a Schwinn; Bonnie Franklin, Mackenzie
Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli keep a lid on their ``One Day at a
Time'' hysterics; even Archie Bunker smiles winningly from his
La-Z-Boy. Only the women of ``Good Times'' manage to conjure a
prickly distance deemed appropriate to the show's theme of racial
struggles. By the '90s, ``Roseanne'' comes out smelling like the
Avon lady.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the news category. ``Since the early days of
television, we have trusted journalists to tell us what's going on
in the world around us'' reads the accompanying release.
</P>
<P>
   Trust an avuncular Walter Cronkite, dressed in gray wool and
thoughtfully caressing his pipe? Most definitely. Trust the ``60
Minutes'' correspondents as they surround a paper-strewn conference
table, serious expressions all? Yes, probably. Trust Barbara
Walters wearing a mad polka-dot print, giant hoop earrings and her
hair in a major flip? Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: TV Guide did go with the flow, mirroring
its vast readership. It began with a circulation of 1.5 million and
has grown to a readership of 13 million, making it the
largest-selling weekly magazine in the country. The cover
photographs from the '60s recreate the era's psychedelic energy as
the Hullabaloo Dancers do the monkey in Douglas Kirkland's
strobe-effect sequence, as a groovy Tom Jones throws out a
succession of hipster gestures in Prigent's collage, or as Mike
Connors takes cool aim on Gene Trindl's quadruple-exposure
``Mannix'' cover. Richard Amsel's pale pastel drawings capture the
'70s hair infatuation in the feathered fantasy dos of ``Charlie's
Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   The '90s fixation on body, if not soul, is evident in cheesecake
shots of Teri Hatcher, Jenna Elfman and the ``Baywatch'' babes,
even if their bodies were covered, peculiarly, by bold type. ``The
type was a dynamic feature of the cover and there was lots of it,''
said Reddicliffe. OK, but only from the neck down?
</P>
<P>
   And what about those Hirschfelds of subjects including Lawrence
Welk, Bob Hope and Lassie, her ears woven with Nina's? Or Warhol's
multiple of Barbara Feldon from ``Get Smart''? Or Dali's Surrealist
view of television, amputated thumbs implanted with television
screens?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were special commissions,'' Reddicliffe said. ``We try
to come up with something unique when the situation warrants it.''
</P>
<P>
   (For the record, covers by famous artists aren't necessarily the
most valuable. That honor goes to a mint-condition first cover of
baby Desi Arnaz Jr., valued at $3,000, although the ``Superman''
cover, with George Reeves in the Sept. 25, 1953, edition, runs a
close second. Both are in the exhibition, which moves to the
museum's Los Angeles galleries from Sept. 10 through December.)
</P>
<P>
   Other unusual situations have required a two-part ``X-Files''
cover where opposing halves of David Duchovny's face, bought
separately in the same week, could be matched to make a whole; a
four-part ``Simpsons'' cover that joined end-to-end to become the
family's couch, and a four-part ``Star Trek'' cover, each part
featuring a different crew member, that when joined form the
fleet's insignia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to have fun,'' said Reddicliffe, pointing to the
magazine's ubiquitous red logo. ``It's not always red. Sometimes
we'll change the color of the logo to match the uniform of a sports
team. Other times we'll have an animator deal with it creatively,
bitten off by the Cookie Monster or chiseled away at by Fred
Flintstone.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains the jumping. Lucille Ball in black leotard, above
a hothouse flower. (The most popular subject of all, Ball had 31 of
her own covers.) Sonny and Cher, captured midflight with their hair
_ lots of it _ swaying to the beat. The cast of ``Third Rock From
the Sun'' decked out in '60s paraphernalia with legs akimbo.
Regardless of the decade or even the topic, TV Guide liked to shoot
its subjects with their feet off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word is always energy,'' said Reddicliffe. ``It's high
energy that really captures your eye and conveys your authority.
Jumping is good.'' Reddicliffe pointed to Lucy Lawless' ``Xena: The
Warrior Princess'' cover as an example of ``spontaneous energy.''
But for all that energy, the superhero Xena isn't jumping. ``Oh,
well,'' shrugged Reddicliffe. ``Maybe it's the armor.''

   LONDON _ Is a knighthood dangling out there for England's ``Our
Tim''? Will the queen dub him Sir Timothy if he can win two more
tennis matches and ascend the summit called Wimbledon that has
caused more Englishmen to choke than kidney pie or bangers and
mash?
</P>
<P>
   Because it's there, countless Limeys have tried to climb
Wimbledon, only to vanish into thin air at the first slope.
Occasionally one gets higher, such as Roger Taylor, a semifinalist
25 years ago when the Big W was torn apart by a boycott by the best
players such as champions Stan Smith, Rod Laver, and John Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger Taylor?'' Timothy Henry Henman, the uncommon climber, is
saying. ``Yes, I've heard of him. But that was a year before I was
born.'' Taylor lost to a Czech, Jan Kodes, who won the title.
Henman Wednesday beat a Czech, Petr Korda, the Australian Open
champ _ and does that mean he will erase England's kickball grief
by planting the flag as well as photos of Queen Elizabeth, Elton
John, and Boy George atop the Big W?
</P>
<P>
   A problem looms above him, however. Slight difficulty, but no
more daunting than the Hillary Steps leading to the pinnacle of
Everest. It is the sheer Sampras Wall, super cold and forbidding.
Take lots of oxygen with you, Timmy.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Wade _ a.k.a. ``Our Ginny,'' _ the last English person
to make it to the top, only 21 years ago, used to say the worst
sound in the world was a Centre Court mob's collective groan
whenever she lost a point.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICKFORD, R.I. _ Bob Gilbane bought a dream house by mail for
$495. The ready-to-build plan of a charming, elaborate cottage _
with columns and porches, wavy shingles and oval windows _ was
designed by one of the country's best-known architects, Robert A.M.
Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbane liked it so much when he saw it in Life magazine he made
it the centerpiece of his new 80-acre subdivision here.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there were some changes he wanted to make. He added a
basement, something the plans did not include. And because the site
he chose was on a hill, he added a patio and French doors opening
out from the basement.
</P>
<P>
   But then there were the changes he was forced to make. ``Out of
21 pages, there were 11 errors,'' the developer said ruefully. The
dimensions didn't quite line up: The first floor was almost two
feet bigger than the foundation, he said. Gilbane's workers quickly
took down the skeletal walls and spread the difference across the
width of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the cost estimate. To add all the rich detailing
the architect specified _ ``copper gutters, columns, scalloped
cedar shingles and Dutch kicks on the overhangs,'' he recalled _
the house, estimated at $150,000 to build, would total $350,000.
``The only way anybody could build it for $150,000,'' Gilbane said,
``is to use vinyl siding, square columns and a lot of
compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   After he and others pointed out the mistakes, the Stern office
sent out plans correcting the errors. And this week Gilbane
pronounced himself satisfied _ he just sold the house for $680,000.
He is so satisfied, in fact, he is eyeing another Dream House plan,
this one by a star-in-waiting, Dennis Wedlick.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the annual Life Magazine Dream House series and
fueled by the onslaught of home magazines, television shows and
Internet sites, the house plan business is booming _ Mark Englund,
a partner at Home Styles Publishing and Marketing, which sells
25,000 house plans annually, estimates the industry at $50 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the plans sold are still done by nameless boiler-plate
draftsmen, but increasingly the big names _ Stern, Michael Graves,
Hugh Newell Jacobsen _ are jumping in. And for young up-and-comers
these houses-by-mail fulfill the populist mission to bring good
design, if not to the masses, then at least t to the middle-class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long, long overdue,'' said John Rattenbury at Taliesin,
the firm Frank Lloyd Wright founded. In the tradition of the
master, whose floor plans appeared in Life magazine in the 1930's,
Taliesin sold several hundred plans last year through Life. ``It's
one of the saddest things that people of moderate means are subject
to a glaring lack of good design.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they choose them partly for cocktail-party bragging
rights or for their aesthetic appeal, the people who have built the
houses agree on one thing: they could have never afforded to hire
these architects to build them a custom house.
</P>
<P>
   ``These baby boomers are starting to react against `bigger is
better','' Gilbane said. ``People want houses with mahogany and
trim _ they don't want a box Colonial.'' House plans by known
architects, he said, ``are a great opportunity to get excellent
design without paying them the $30,000 and $50,000 they'd charge as
a fee.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference in price can be substantial. For one thing, the
architects who agree to draw these plans-to-go _ and many refuse _
deliberately design a house that can be built for families that are
not wealthy. These dream houses-by-mail are usually no more than
2,500 square feet (Lilliputian by a star's standard).
</P>
<P>
   But as this populist ideal takes hold, its pitfalls are being
hotly debated. Critics whisper that such commercial zeal cheapens
the profession and devalues an architect's services. And Kevin
Ireton, a former builder who is the editor of Fine Homebuilding
magazine, points to one of the biggest issues: with arms-length
design-by-mail, the architect never meets the clients and never
visits the site. ``The main problem with buying a house plan in
this way is that it isn't designed for your specific site _ that's
the reason a lot of architects don't want to sell plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the $200 to $600 for the plans, the homeowner should
expect to spend another couple of thousand dollars to have an
architect adapt the plan for the site and the local building codes.
Then, before a spade is stuck into the (hopefully not rocky)
ground, there is the matter of the changes to the plan, which,
judging from interviews, often turn out to be pretty major.
</P>
<P>
   Take Laurie Kelley, who built another of Stern's bungalows about
a half an hour south of Gilbane's house, in Wakefield, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she and her husband, Charlie, a computer programmer,
built the house for $150,000, she replied: ``No way! Not even
close! We took out a mortgage, cashed out our retirement, took the
money from our other house. I think it cost more like $250,000 to
$275,000 _ and that was with us doing all the painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We modified it a little bit,'' she added, laughing. ``We
downsized it. We changed the inside. We expanded the kitchen, we
narrowed the hallways, we made it more open. We're still working on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such changes can be pretty shocking to the mega-architects _
notorious perfectionists with their own dreams of the perfect
Everyman house, built exactly as they planned it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a house built from a Robert A.M. Stern plan _ with no
further input from the architect _ was a Robert Stern house, Stern
replied, ``It is and it isn't.'' Shrugging, he compared the selling
of house plans to rearing children. ``You expect them to do their
own thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Graves, who sold 108 plans for the 1995 Dream House he
designed for Life, said he was ``frankly, surprised _ I guess I was
naive _ but I thought people would buy the plans and build the
house, lock, stock and barrel, as I designed it. Or I thought that,
if they wanted to make changes, they might ask us for a little
drawing. But they didn't.'' And after they had built the house,
they sent him photographs of what they had done, bragging that they
had ``added their little touches,'' he said, his voice tinged with
sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Graves said he would consider doing it again.
``Architects,'' he said, ``get a bad name for working only with the
elite.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, who has sold 1,200 house plans, was so buoyed by his
success that he is creating another Dream House, for This Old House
magazine, with one big difference. This Dream House is designed for
an actual site _ and plans will not be sold until the prototype
house is built, so that any little glitches can be ironed out. And
he is exploring a way to license his designs _ in effect selling
local architects the franchise to control the style of alterations
that he will allow.

 WICKFORD, R.I.: will allow.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across the country, many other architects are gearing up. Sarah
Susanka, 41, of Minneapolis, who sold hundreds of plans through
Better Homes and Gardens magazine and whose firm will design next
year's Dream House for Life magazine, has already signed a contract
with a drafting service that will handle alterations to the plans
for $60 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Others architects, like Melanie Taylor in New Haven, Conn., have
established their own _ separate _ plan companies. And there are
several books of house plans by well-known architects scheduled for
the fall, including one combining the houses in Celebration, the
Disney town near Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, these architects say their well-heeled clientele,
who regularly pay them $50,000 fees for their smaller houses, have
not complained about seeing their work touted in glossy magazines
as ``affordable housing.'' They say their two client groups _
millionaires and the middle-class _ rarely intersect; so, the
architects are not losing their high-end business.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the mail-order business takes off, some see the color of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Newell Jacobsen jokes that he took the job designing the
1998 Life dream house to tap into his ``own private oil well.'' He
added that ``none of us are wandering monks out to save the world
from bad taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Other architects disagree, about both the mission and the money.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor said she has only sold 400 plans since 1984. ``It's
not a big source of income,'' she said. Duo Dickinson, an architect
in Madison, Conn., sold 30 plans of a small, stylish concrete house
after it appeared in last August's Better Homes and Gardens.
Dickinson, 42, said he was paid only $5,000 to design the
2,600-square-foot house, replete with arches, gables and a vaulted,
17-foot ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to sell 16 plans just to pay me back for my time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some architects say it's pedestrian,'' he added. ``For me,
it's the opposite: it's doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   From Palladio to A.J. Downing to Frank Lloyd Wright, architects
for centuries have been drawn to the Egotistic/Altruistic notion
that the hoi polloi are just as deserving of great house designs as
those living life at the top.
</P>
<P>
   But those famous architects released their floor plans _ not
actual blueprints, some complete with electrical and plumbing
diagrams. The house plan books were more like treatises, ``with the
plans as examples of the concepts,'' said Wedlick. ``They were
meant to be inspirational _ not an end in themselves like the plans
are.''
</P>
<P>
   To Wedlick, who created Life's 1995 Dream House, the idea of
creating a generic house for millions of Americans to read about
was immensely tempting. ``After all,'' he said, ``I was 34 years
old, following Bob Stern,'' replacing I.M. Pei who backed out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 38, he says he probably wouldn't do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying a set of plans,'' Wedlick said, ``is not even close to
hiring an architect; it's an entirely different kind of animal. To
me, it's a little heartbreaking for someone not to get the full
benefit of the design.''
</P>
<P>
   Running the gamut of the job _ from first meetings to see how a
family uses its existing space to supervision of the builder at the
site _ Wedlick argued that hiring an architect is only slightly
more expensive than building a big custom kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Wedlick, unlike several of his mail-order colleagues, visited as
many of the Dream Houses built from his plans as he could find _
278 were sold. (Melissa Stanton, the editor at Life who supervises
the Dream House feature, said that many people who bought the plans
``put them on a shelf, a kind of fantasy,'' making any estimates of
how many were built impossible.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of the way the Dream Houses were adapted by
other architects,'' Wedlick said. ``And I'm happy that the people
seem to be so happy in them but it is, in a way, nothing to do with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the families Wedlick visited was Bill and Holli Siff, who
built their Wedlick house in Contoocook, N.H., a piquant example of
what he calls Modernist Romanticism, with his characteristic
stacked window bays under a steeply peaked Hansel &AMP; Gretel roof _ a
Cotswold cottage drawn by Giacometti.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Siff did was hire a local architect to alter
Wedlick's plan.
</P>
<P>
   First, they flipped it around, so what Wedlick envisioned as the
front became the back.
</P>
<P>
   Then they took the mud room out of the kitchen wing . And while
they were at it, why not put the mud room in a new 10-foot-longer
connection between house and garage, add a dormer window, close up
the see-through garage and changed its roofline, creating a bigger
bedroom for theSiffs' teen-age daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the change in the garage roof, Siff said sheepishly
that ``it looks like a motel.'' He paused. ``But we had to do it.
We needed that bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the house still looks special,'' he said, exulting, as his
wife nodded vigorously. ``People drive by, grind to a halt and just
stare. It's a really stunning looking house, and we love it.''

 WICKFORD, R.I.: love it.''   &HT;    HOW DO THE STARS (AND NEAR-STARS) MEASURE UP?
 &HT;    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Ireton, the editor of Fine Homebuilding magazine, spends
his days scrutinizing blueprints and renderings, anxiously
delivered by architects hoping for a display in his pages.
</P>
<P>
   A former builder, Ireton can spot an ineffective layout, an
unbuildable roof, an indecipherable plumbing diagram. He agreed to
review the mail-order plans of five architects _ Robert A.M. Stern,
Michael Graves, Dennis Wedlick, Sarah Susanka and Duo Dickinson _
including Stern's Life magazine house, one of the most popular of
the ``dream houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Praising the ``strong detailing'' in the plans _ a hallmark of
an architect-designed house _ Ireton noted that those details make
a house trickier to build. ``There isn't a house here I would build
without a really competent builder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of his observations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A.M. Stern
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL APPRAISAL _ It's rare that a builder gets to deal with
such extensive, well-detailed plans as his 1994 Life dream house
($505). Stern even specifies the pattern of the bathroom tile and
offers a dozen different cutouts for the shutters.
</P>
<P>
   CONSTRUCTION _ Designed for a flat site.
</P>
<P>
   PROS AND CONS _ The foundation is complicated, with many jogs
and bays. The octagonal first-floor bedroom might be done more
cheaply by cantilevering it over a rectangular foundation. For a
gutsier look, Stern uses heavier _ and more expensive _
two-by-sixes for interior walls rather than the normal
two-by-fours. Custom windows and a roof that is very tricky to
frame are all part of the charm, but cost more money.
</P>
<P>
   COST _ The most expensive: I wouldn't be surprised to hear it
cost $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Graves
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL APPRAISAL _ His 1996 Life dream house ($505) is an
amalgam of traditional and industrial shapes.
</P>
<P>
   CONSTRUCTION _ Designed for a flat site.
</P>
<P>
   PROS AND CONS _ This is a fairly easy house to build. Graves
literally threw a curve into the design by adding one of his
trademarks _ a rotunda, complicating what had been an easy roof to
frame. But don't let the builder talk you into a square gallery:
the rotunda is the thing you fell in love with. The exterior
detailing is the cleanest of all five houses. Builders may see
dollar signs when they catch the copper-clad chimney, but it may
not be more expensive than masonry. Graves puts glazing to good
effect by keeping the number of windows low, then splurging on the
wall of windows over the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   COST _ In the $250,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Wedlick
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL APPRAISAL _ His 1995 Life dream house ($505) has the
simplest footprint _ a rectangle with a striking roof. While Stern
uses traditional details, Wedlick plays with textures and shapes.
</P>
<P>
   CONSTRUCTION _ Designed for a flat site, but like the Stern and
Graves plans, it can be rotated to capture views and light.
</P>
<P>
   PROS AND CONS _ A contractor must be very good to build the
steep roof and work out the way it meets the eaves. The roof will
cost more, but if anybody tried to build this house with a
shallower roof, I think I'd shoot him. One advantage: The plans
list the stock molding numbers and make use of manufactured
windows, which saves time and money.
</P>
<P>
   COST _ One of the least expensive houses _ but to be done right,
at least $250,000 in the Northeast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Susanka
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL APPRAISAL _ Her 1998 Better Homes and Gardens Home Plan
Ideas plan ($430) is deceptively complex; it looks simple but is
carefully thought out.
</P>
<P>
   CONSTRUCTION _ Of the four houses, this is the most
site-specific _ designed for a steep south-facing slope. It could
be built on a flat site but would not be nearly as charming. If you
built on a north-facing slope, you'd want to add more
energy-efficient, possibly smaller, windows.
</P>
<P>
   PROS AND CONS _ The plans are smaller and more difficult to read
than the others; the house is harder to visualize. To work,
everything must line up perfectly. But the roof is framed by
manufactured trusses, so you can get the house ``out of the
weather'' quickly, a plus in cold climates.
</P>
<P>
   COST _ It would probably cost between $300,000 and $325,000 in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Duo Dickinson
</P>
<P>
   GENERAL APPRAISAL _ His 1997 Better Homes and Gardens plan
($300) is the most unusual and contemporary house. The structure
and many details are built with cement. (It was commissioned by the
Portland Cement Association.)
</P>
<P>
   CONSTRUCTION _ Designed for a flat lot and difficult to rotate
because of the elaborate front entrance. Because of the material,
the design is full of zoomy details like sweeping arched ceilings
and columns.
</P>
<P>
   PROS AND CONS _ Many builders will be scared off by the
unconventional concrete wall system. If they aren't, they may come
to love the system _ which is designed to be put together quickly _
and want a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   COST _ Ireton declined to give an estimate, but Dickinson said
the house was built for $340,000 in Indianapolis.

BANKBOSTON, SOX' MARTINEZ FIELD COMMUNITY SERVICE AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez and BankBoston announced
Wednesday a community service partnership that includes the
establishment of a foundation to provide grants to nonprofit
organizations focused on youth, family and education.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston will contribute $200,000 to establish the Pedro J.
Martinez and Brother Foundation, and Martinez _ who already does
considerable community service work in his home country, the
Dominican Republic _ will appear on behalf of the bank at some
community events and in a televised public service announcement.
Bank officials said Wednesday that the partnership involves no
commercial appearances or endorsements by Martinez on behalf of the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he will make a decision about how much money he
will contiribute to the foudation after the baseball season is
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents instilled in me and my brothers the need to look
out for others _ not just ourselves,'' Martinez said. ``I recognize
that at times, lots of people feel discouraged by events in their
lives. I wish to reach these people _ especially children _ who
need to know that help is available.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's brother Ramon, pitches for the Los Angeles Dodgers,
and another brother, Jesus, is active with both major league
players in community and charitable work in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Gifford, chairman of BankBoston, said that it was Martinez
who approached the bank, but the bank quickly seized upon the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read about this guy, it was obvious he would serve as
an excellent community resource,'' Gifford said. ``You combine the
best pitcher in baseball with someone who has a wonderful passion
for kids and the public relations sensibility he has, and you look
at what we're trying to do in the community and it's a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I met him and for 45 minutes _ as much as I wanted to
talk about baseball _ we talked about kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials said the demands they will make on Martinez have
little structure, at this point. A televised public service
announcement will feature Martinez highlighting the bank's efforts
to establish mentoring programs in the community. He also is
expected to appear on behalf of the bank during its annual United
Way kickoff day, during which 300 bank employees perform community
service.
</P>
<P>
   Grants from the Pedro J. Martinez and Brothers Foundation will
not be distributed until 1999 to allow time for the trustees to
raise additional funds and to establish clear guidelines for grant
reviews, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   For futher information, nonprofit organizations can write to
Franklin Paulino, Pedro J. Martinez and Brothers Foundation, c/o
BankBoston, 100 Federal Street, Mailstop 01-28-05, Boston, MA,

`DAILY FOCUS' PROVIDES AN EYE ON CHINA'S CHANGING MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-NOTEBOOK, HONGKONG-AIRPORT) 
(th) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ It is hardly surprising that President Clinton chose
the wildly popular news magazine ``Daily Focus'' as his final forum
to address the Chinese people. Every evening at 7:38 more than 300
million people tune in to the 15-minute program whose hard-hitting
investigations and interviews show just how far the Chinese media
have come since the days when they provided little more than
Communist Party dogma.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which was first broadcast in 1994, is
sophisticated, offers great drama, and confronts a wide range of
topics that would have been deemed too sensitive for exploration
only a few years ago: domestic violence, corruption in the courts,
state factories flouting pollution laws, nuclear proliferation in
Asia. Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
appeared on the program during his visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface it resembles ``60 Minutes.'' But underneath there
is a crucial difference: ``Daily Focus'' _ like other television
shows, and magazines and newspapers in China _ is owned by the
state, in this case by the government's main television network,
China Central Television.
</P>
<P>
   The program's investigations and choice of topics clearly
reflect China's new openness about certain types of problems,
particularly official corruption. But the program, which has some
features of independent journalism, is in many respects a
newfangled instrument of propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a government television station and we share a common
interest with the government,'' said Liang Jianzeng, the general
producer of ``Focus,'' who has been with the program since its
start. ``We have several standards for choosing topics: First, it
needs to be news. Second, it has to be something that our audience
wants to watch. And, third, the government has to want to solve the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Using this formula, ``Daily Focus'' has become perhaps the most
popular show in China, with five-second advertisements that sell
for $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, for example, hundreds of millions of
Chinese watched senior government officials in the central city of
Luoyang squirm. The officials had extorted $100,000 in illegal
taxes from a wealthy private school. Now a crew from ``Focus'' _
with microphones waving and cameras rolling _ descended on
government offices demanding to know why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did the township demand $6,500 from the school `to quell
trouble caused by local villagers'?'' asked an earnest-looking
reporter named Bo Yang. ``Why did the local justice bureau demand
that the school be re-notarized, even though its form was
up-to-date?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the reporter cornered a court official, Chen Lianghua,
as she washed her hands in her office sink, and asked why the court
had ordered the school to pay. ``I'm not sure about this matter,''
a miffed-looking Ms. Chen answered, as she walked away, the camera
trailing behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an order from the court. You should have known about
it,'' Bo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not convenient to talk now,'' Ms. Chen answered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While such investigations are a fixture on ``Focus,'' there is
also occasionally more conventional fare, like a recent paean to
President Jiang Zemin's visit to the United States last year. And
there are the other topics that never appear, like forced abortions
and the release of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Some less prominent programs and certain publications with
looser government ties, like Southern Weekend and Beijing Youth
Daily, have pushed the boundaries of discourse a bit further.
</P>
<P>
   But there are always limits. When a legal affairs columnist for
Southern Weekend recently criticized the common practice of
awarding judgeships to retiring army officers, for example, his
weekly column disappeared for two weeks, replaced with a front-page
commentary by an army colonel supporting the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness to discuss publicly difficult issues reflects
the greater confidence of Chinese leaders. But the central
government also clearly appreciates that the press can be an
effective weapon in its battles with local officials, who have
increasingly ignored national laws and policies, imposing taxes and
penalties on their own, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials, including former Prime Minister Li Peng, who
now heads the National People's Congress, have praised ``Daily
Focus.'' And the program's aggressive young reporters, who get
their tips both from viewers and the central government, have
proved effective enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the program documented how a district government in
Zhejiang Province had removed elected village heads from two dozen
villages and replaced them with cronies. Now the district officials
are under investigation and new elections have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Such episodes have also bolstered the program's sky-high
advertising rate, an important consideration when government
financing is dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   Liang said that the producers did not need any clearance before
deciding on specific topics, although he said that the station's
leaders sometimes elected not to broadcast a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it is because the quality is not so good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In China now there is a saying: ``Avoid fires, avoid theft,
avoid `Daily Focus.'''
</P>
<P>
   Liang, who recently visited ABC's ``20/20'' studio in New York,
said with a laugh, ``Some people are afraid to be interviewed
because they know they've done something wrong.'' &QL;

SWITCH TO NEW AGENT IS WOODY ALLEN'S LATEST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Woody Allen, who has overhauled most of his longtime
production staff, has abruptly left his New York-based agent as he
vigorously pursues an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   After 30 years with Sam Cohn, the vice chairman of International
Creative Management in New York, Allen has decided to move to the
William Morris Agency, where he will be represented by John
Burnham, executive vice president of the agency and a head of its
motion picture department in Los Angeles. Diane Keaton, a longtime
friend of Allen's, has been Burnham's client for 15 years. She
introduced the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's move caught Hollywood agents, executives and producers
by surprise. Although directors and stars periodically leave their
agents, especially if they endure a flop or two, Allen's long-term
bond with Cohn was considered unbreakable.
</P>
<P>
   Allen declined to comment on the change, except to issue a
statement through Leslee Dart, his spokeswoman, saying, ``Sam and I
had a long and productive professional relationship and remain
close friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But two of Allen's associates said that he had decided to leave
Cohn, a venerable agent in New York's theatrical and literary
community, partly because, he felt, the Los Angeles-based Burnham
was better suited to find him acting roles periodically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's keen on acting; he wants more choices and
opportunities,'' said one of Allen's associates, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has acted in only a handful of movies made by other
filmmakers, but he is now interested in finding more roles,
associates said. Allen starred with Bette Midler in the 1991 comedy
``Scenes from a Mall,'' directed by Paul Mazursky. The movie was a
box-office disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn's clients include actors such as Paul Newman, Susan
Sarandon and Sigourney Weaver, as well as writers E.L. Doctorow,
Arthur Miller and Nora Ephron.
</P>
<P>
   Why Allen is seeking more acting roles is unclear, but film
parts are often lucrative and, as one of his associates said, ``can
be a lot of fun.'' But Allen is not expected to limit his
remarkable output of films; he releases about a movie a year. His
next film, ``Celebrity,'' set to be released in the fall, stars,
among others, Leonardo DiCaprio, Winona Ryder, Kenneth Branagh and
Judy Davis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Associates of Allen said that Ms. Keaton had introduced Allen to
Burnham several years ago, and that the two men had established a
friendly relationship. Burnham has visited Allen in New York
several times. When Allen visited Los Angeles late last year for
the first time in about 20 years, Burnham had a party at his home
for him. Allen was in Los Angeles to promote his film
``Deconstructing Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen's decision to leave Cohn comes after the filmmaker's moves
over the last year to substantially overhaul the tightly knit
production staff that has been with him for decades and helped
fashion classics like ``Annie Hall,'' ``Manhattan'' and ``Hannah
and Her Sisters.'' The departures included Allen's longtime
producer, Robert Greenhut, as well as his associate producer, film
editor, cinematographer, set photographer and costume designer.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of the Allen team was sought and made by Jean
Doumanian, Allen's current producer and his best friend for 30
years, who wanted to cut costs. In recent years, Allen's films,
most of them highly praised, have not earned money in the United
States but remain popular abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Doumanian's company, Jean Doumanian Productions, is financed
by Sweetland Films, an independent company of mostly European
investors, who took over the financing of Allen's films.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn and Burnham declined comment.

BANKBOSTON SELLING WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS BRANCHES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BankBoston Corp. said Wednesday that it had agreed to sell its
Berkshire County operations to Banknorth Group, Inc. of Burlington,
Vt., for $52 million, shedding for the second time in a decade its
presence in the western Massachusetts region.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a sign that mid-sized and superregional banks are
keen to pare operations in markets deemed more suitable for
community banks. In an era of mergers and consolidations, larger
banks cannot achieve big earnings growth serving smaller areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our geographic separation and less urban market lends itself
more to a community banking approach, where we can be agile and
focused in meeting the specific needs of the region,'' said Steven
H. Massicotte, who oversees BankBoston's Berkshire County
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wednesday's deal, Banknorth, which owns seven community
banks throughout Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, will
gain 10 BankBoston branches with retail, consumer, small business,
and commercial lending operations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, expected to close in the third quarter, will not
result in management changes or layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, New England's second-largest bank, had four branches
in Berkshire County in the 1980s. Known then as Bank of Boston, it
sold them in 1989 but re-entered the area four years later when it
bought Multibank Financial Corp. of Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Banknorth will gain approximately $285 million in deposits and
$120 million in loans from BankBoston's Berkshire operations.
BankBoston's private banking, trust and investment management units
in the area will become part of a Banknorth subsidiary, The
Stratevest Group
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston is the nation's 16th-largest bank holding company,
with $71.4 billion in assets, operations in Latin America, and a
national corporate lending unit. The company nudged up 1 3/4 to
close at 57 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.

   In a display of ``Art'' for art's sake, London audiences will
get a chance to see the Tony Award-winning American version of
Yasmina Reza's play ``Art,'' while Broadway theatergoers will see
Britain's Olivier Award-winning version.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an agreement between British and American Equity, the

 &HT;    WELCOME WARMER FOR BUSH THAN GINGRICH AT HISPANIC MEETING
 &HT;    440&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Two potential competitors for the 2000 Republican
presidential nomination came together Wednesday to make a pitch for
the votes of Hispanics, who have objected to GOP-led immigration,
welfare and education initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
delivered essentially the same message to the annual meeting of the
League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), a civil rights
group for the fastest-growing minority in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came today to say my door is open. We want to work with
you,'' Gingrich said at a luncheon for nearly 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gingrich was politely received, Bush heard cries of
``We love you'' from the audience and responded in kind. ``Te
amo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Their back-to-back speeches showed, in Bush's case, the
potential for Republican success among Hispanics and, in
Gingrich's, how far the party still has to go after the 1996
election, in which President Clinton received nearly three-fourths
of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-speaking governor, who got only a quarter of
Hispanic votes in 1994, has worked hard to cultivate Hispanic
support in his first term. He opposed the Gingrich-led House vote
in 1996 to make English the nation's official language and has
called for maintaining bilingual education programs that work. In
his bid for re-election this year, Bush leads Democrat Gary Mauro
among Hispanics in the latest Texas Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is, to many Hispanics, the embodiment of the
Republicans' harsh treatment of Latinos. LULAC's Texas delegation
officially boycotted his speech, vice president Margaret Mata said,
``because he has never supported the Hispanic community.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich himself acknowledged his surprise at being invited to
speak. ``This is not the first of five things I thought I'd get
invited to today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker mainly avoided areas of controversy Wednesday,
instead promoting his proposal to use budget surpluses to create
retirement accounts for working Americans and speaking in vague
terms about supporting legal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   LULAC President Belen Robles praised Gingrich for pressing one
bill that would allow Puerto Ricans to vote on statehood and
another to study land claims in New Mexico relating to the
Mexican-American War.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was silent on several issues important to Hispanic
groups, including his fierce opposition to the use of statistical
sampling to improve the accuracy of the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau contends that sampling will give a truer
picture of the size of racial and ethnic minorities, who are most
likely to be missed in the traditional head count.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gingrich has expressed opposition to
``English-only'' legislation that would bar governments from
printing official documents in other languages.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign spokesman Mike Shields said Wednesday that the
speaker continues to support making English the nation's official
language, a proposal Hispanic groups vociferously oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican-sponsored legislation pending in the House
would make it harder for legal immigrants to become citizens and
would let voting registrars use government naturalization data to
verify voter eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of critical policy issues on the table
where the leadership in Congress can send a signal that they will
continue to offend the community or send a signal of support for
the community,'' said Cecilia Munoz, vice president of the National
Council of La Raza, another leading Hispanic organization.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz was one of a dozen Hispanic leaders who met Gingrich in
his Capitol office last week, the first such meeting since he
became speaker three and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Vargas, director of the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials, said Gingrich used the right words
in the meeting. ``Actions, we're still waiting for,'' Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's speech Wednesday drew a similar reaction. ``We want
to hear more commitments, but it was still the beginning of
dialogue,'' said Peggy Anastos, LULAC's New Jersey director.

COMMENTARY: PRIMAKOV IN CYPRUS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia _ long
the KGB's top operative in the Middle East and still Saddam
Hussein's closest ally _ sees himself as a new Andrei Gromyko.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike that Soviet stoneface, Primakov represents no superpower.
But because he now runs Boris Yeltsin's foreign policy, and because
he has the latest Russian missiles to sell, this Gromyko with a
smiling face has found a way to split the NATO alliance by
inflaming Greeks and Turks over the island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Cypriots on that independent Mediterranean island near Turkey
number 650,000 ethnic Greeks and 200,000 ethnic Turks. When Greek
nationalists got pushy in 1974, Ankara sent in troops to protect
its Turkish minority in the north, cruelly driving out Greek
residents, setting up a republic that the world does not recognize,
and establishing air control over the whole island. Cypriots have
been glaring at each other ever since. (You have to be Irish to
understand.)
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Cypriot government is irritated at Turkey's air
control. It is feeling feisty at the European Union's signs that it
could gain membership in the coveted economic club, especially
since the EU has snubbed Muslim Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   To assert its nationhood, Greek Cypriots went shopping for
surface-to-air missiles that could knock down Turkey's planes if
war came. First stop was the United States. Then Europe; none of
its nations would join in an obvious military provocation of
Turkey, a NATO member.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes Primakov, lighting a match in the gas-filled room.
How much do you Cypriots have to spend? $200 million. At $5 million
a missile, that'll buy you 40 of our best new S-300s, not only
threatening Turkish air domination, but capable with some
modifications of hitting Turkish soil. When can you take delivery?
September. A deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks are reacting to this deal today the way the Kennedy
Administration did when Khrushchev put the Soviet missiles on ships
to Cuba: You put those missiles in and we'll take them out. The
nuclear missiles Gromyko lied about were 90 miles from the United
States; these offensively defensive SAM's are 50 miles from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov has a fistful of interests in Cyprus. His commercial
interest is in getting hard currency for Russian arms and keeping
missile factories humming.
</P>
<P>
   Especially delicious to the ex-spymaster is the espionage
interest: Cyprus has long been the intelligence crossroads of the
Eastern Mediterranean, of benefit to Syria, Iraq and Libya. Turks
charge that along with the missiles would come Russian
``technicians'' to bolster Russia's intelligence network.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, international spooks know that corporations in Cyprus'
capital, Nicosia _ a city split by a ``green line'' like a Berlin
wall separating Greeks and Turks _ have for years made it the
money-laundering capital of the Middle East. Our State Department
says the Greek south is now cleaner than the Turkish north, but the
whole island launders. Primakov will be able to monitor the flight
of Russian rubles to foreign banks, and gain added leverage over
Serbia, which gets clandestine foreign money support through
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the strategic interest. Cyprus is the flashpoint of a
Greek-Turkish tension that extends into the Balkans. Here was
Primakov's way to retaliate at NATO expansion by breaking apart the
southern flank of the Western alliance _ not only at no cost to
Russia, but at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright, in a meeting with Primakov in Luxembourg in
May, tried to talk him out of shipping the missiles; she failed.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, unable to negotiate the Cypriot factions into
a sensible ``bizonal, bicommunal'' federation, creatively tried to
use the impending Cyprus crisis as a shoehorn to ease Turkey into
being fairly considered for EU membership. But the Germans and
Greeks would have none of that.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Primakov's maneuvering and European anti-Turk
bias, we now have (1) Ankara more adamant than ever about a
separate Turkish Cypriot republic; (2) the United Nations, which
patrols the green line, passing resolutions blaming Turks for
everything, and (3) Greeks lurching into a foolish missile
provocation.
</P>
<P>
   This thing could get out of hand. President Clinton should get
on the horn to Yeltsin and say, ``Tell Primakov to cancel that
missile order.''

MAN BURNED AS BLAST DESTROYS HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 33-year-old Springfield, Mass. man was reported to be in
critical condition at Brigham and Women's Hospital Wednesday being
treated for third-degree burns he suffered in a botched attempt to
kill himself by blowing up his house with gas, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Swiderski had removed a half-inch drip plug from the gas
service line coming into his Hood Street house and let the
pressurized gas stream in while he remained in the house, said Sgt.
Kenneth Gustafson of the Springfield arson squad.
</P>
<P>
   The blast at about 2:30 a.m. destroyed Swiderski's house, but it
did little damage to neighboring ones and injured only him. It blew
the roof off the house and blew out all the walls, leaving only
some of the structural timber standing.
</P>
<P>
   The force blew Swiderski, who was alone in the house, onto the
front lawn, a fire department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman living next door told investigators that the blast was
so loud she thought lightning had struck Swiderski's house.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary investigations found that Swiderski, who is
separated from his wife, had composed a five-page letter and posted
it as E-mail to 207 people in the hours before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; His wife and two children had been living elsewhere, Gustafson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a long, rambling letter and we consider it tantamount to
a suicide note,'' Gustafson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said investigators are not sure what ignited the gas.

JOHN H. PRESCOTT, 63; DIRECTED THE N.E. AQUARIUM FOR 22 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John H. Prescott, who developed New England Aquarium in Boston
into ``the preeminent aquarium in the world,'' died Tuesday at his
home in Weston, Mass. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Prescott was executive director of the aquarium from 1972 to
1994. During his tenure he oversaw the design and construction of
the aquarium's $2 million floating Discovery exhibit of sea lions
and dolphins and expanded the institution's educational and
research programs.
</P>
<P>
   His work in establishing a marine mammals rescue and
rehabilitation program at the facility helped pave the way for
similar rescue programs at other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   As Mr. Prescott said in a story published in a the Globe on
Sept. 23, 1990, ``It's not fish in a box any more. The old kind of
aquarium was like a postage-stamp collection. One fish after
another, each with its label. We want to show fish as they live in
their actual habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Jerry R. Schubel, current president of the aquarium,
said, ``John Prescott provided remarkable leadership for the
aquarium for more than two decades. He established standards of
excellence across the institution which persist today.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Prescott was also an accomplished marine biologist who, with
colleague Ken Norris, is credited with being the first to document
the existence of dolphin sonar and echolocation.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the University of California, earned a
master's degree in ethology at the University of Southern
California, and completed the advanced management program at
Harvard Graduate Business School.
</P>
<P>
   He was affiliated with Marineland of the Pacific from 1957 to
1972 and rose from assistant curator to general manager of the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Prescott consulted on the development of aquariums
throughout the world, most recently in the Biosphere in Arizona. He
was chairman of the committee of scientific advisers to the US
Marine Mammal Commission and was an adviser to the International
Whaling Commission.
</P>
<P>
   He was the recipient of many awards, including the Marlin
Perkins Award, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association's highest
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Rudolph Pierce, chairman of the board of trustees of
the aquarium, said, ``John Prescott developed the New England
Aquarium into the preeminent aquarium in the world. Our success is
his legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Sandra (Baker); two sons, Blane and Craig;
and two stepsons, William Marsh and John Marsh.

YAKKETY YAK? ANIMALS DO TALK BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hit the road, Dr. Dolittle. An investigative reporter contends
in a new book that any human can communicate with animals. All it
takes is telepathy.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Myers, a former assistant city editor at The Washington
Post, interviewed 50 ``animal communicators'' for ``Communicating
With Animals: The Spiritual Connection Between People and Animals''
($14.95, Contemporary).
</P>
<P>
   The 50 say they can converse with elephants, llamas, horses,
dogs, cats, pigs, squirrels, fish, dolphins, whales, seals, geese,
goats, parakeets, sparrows, blue jays, butterflies, rodents and
slugs _ ``the most sensuous beings I've ever connected with,'' one
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a little out there, but it's true,'' said the
80-year-old Myers, the author of several books. He reluctantly
admits that his only proof is assumption. But how would YOU confirm
that an incontinent terrier had a cleaning fetish?
</P>
<P>
   His talkative subjects say that animals chatter in many forms.
Some are downright verbose. Others transmit emotions and pictures.
It's up to an intuitive listener to interpret the extrasensory
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Myers' topics range from ``You Can Talk With Animals if You're
Psychic _ And We're All Psychic'' to ``The Plight of Robbie the
Cockatoo'' to ``The Complicated Emotional Lives of Animals.'' Don't
trip on the New Age words sprinkled throughout, like
``channeling,'' ``spiritual awareness'' and ``inner wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers tackles the most-often-asked questions:
</P>
<P>
   Are some animals poets? Certainly. Birds, cats and horses seem
to be most prolific.
</P>
<P>
   Can telepathy find lost animals? It has before.
</P>
<P>
   Communicators contend that they have healed wounded spirits (a
Great Dane suffering from sexual discrimination) and broken hearts
(a racehorse longing for his security blanket _ an old feed pail)
and even physical ailments (a constipated pooch).
</P>
<P>
   If you're salivating to try this at home, some communicators
offer one-day workshops for an average $75. But Myers found a few
things in common.
</P>
<P>
   First, you must suspend your disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Second, open your heart and feel the love.
</P>
<P>
   Third, listen.
</P>
<P>
   Start with easy questions such as ``Do you like your food?''
Graduate to hard ones, ``Can you believe I'm standing here talking
to you, squirrel?''
</P>
<P>
   Suspend your disbelief. That's the hardest part.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ President Clinton, in his last opportunity to
address a mass audience in China, said Wednesday that he would
continue to speak out on behalf of democracy and individual liberty
but that the United States did not seek to dictate the path of
China's development.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with China's main government-run television
network, which is to be broadcast on Thursday, Clinton said that
China's current course of economic liberalization and greater
personal freedom was ``morally right'' and that the status of the
United States as the world's lone superpower did not give it the
right to use economic and military might to impose its values on
China or any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the interview Clinton sent subtle and somewhat
contradictory messages to different audiences in China. His words
offered reassurance to President Jiang Zemin and other leaders in
Beijing that the United States would not and could not impose its
will on China.
</P>
<P>
   But he also signaled to ordinary Chinese citizens _ and to
domestic critics of his policy of engagement with China _ that he
would continue to press Beijing to allow greater personal freedom
and take steps toward a more open political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a genuine movement toward openness and freedom
in China, which obviously as an American, and as an American
president, I hope will continue and increase and which I believe is
right _ morally right _ but I also think it's good for China,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked whether the world needed a single leader to
mediate disputes within and among nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short answer to your question is yes, the world needs a
leader, but not in the sense of one country telling everyone else
what to do,'' Clinton said. ``So it's a different sort of world
leadership than in the past where it's just a question of who has
the biggest army gets to send a list of instructions to another
country and you think it will be done. That's not the way the world
works now.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave as examples the intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Haiti by the United States and its efforts to mobilize other
nations to combat drug trafficking, weapons proliferation and
ethnic conflict. He said the way to obtain results in the
post-Cold-War world is to forge alliances to exert influence,
rather than trying to act unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so the United States' role I think is to try to create a
structure where more likely than not the right things will be done
when problems arise _ not to just do it all ourselves or tell other
people what to do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House sought this interview because an earlier one
with the network, China Central Television, held before Clinton
left Washington, was heavily edited by the Chinese authorities and
received little notice in China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The interview on Wednesday was conducted by Shui Junyi, anchor
of CCTV-1's popular public affairs program ``Focus'' and Chen
Xiaowei, an anchor on CCTV-4, the state network's international
channel and host of a Sunday news program.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning was gentle, particularly compared to the
grilling Clinton got from several students at Beijing University on
Monday, who challenged him on U.S. policy toward Taiwan and human
rights in America.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked when he first became interested in China and gave a
vintage Clintonian response. He said he was eight or nine years old
and reading an encyclopedia and came across the entry about China.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was fascinated by what I read,'' Clinton said. ``I
always wanted to come here from that time on.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the most gratifying thing about his trip was the
decision by Jiang to allow their Saturday press conference and his
speech at Beijing University to be carried live on Chinese
television. He said he was surprised and pleased by the decision to
allow the ``open, sweeping communication'' with the Chinese people
that those two events afforded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, I think, was very good,'' Clinton said. ``I think it was
also good for the Chinese leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sat for the 20-minute interview at the modern Shanghai
Stock Exchange, where earlier he had received a rousing welcome
from enthusiastic traders on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   At the exchange, Clinton conducted a roundtable discussion with
young entrepreneurs, who told him of the difficulties in starting a
new business, securing venture capital and dealing with the
bureaucracy. Clinton told the business people that they were an
important force for change in China and a source of the new jobs
that will be needed as state-owned enterprises close.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Clinton visited a housing development to
witness a relatively new phenomenon in China _ the private
ownership of homes. The Jin Hui Gardens complex opened five years
ago, offering Chinese families the opportunity to buy their own
apartments for $42,200 to $96,500, according to figures provided by
the developers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told families assembled at the development that home
ownership represents an investment in society and the bedrock of
middle-class life.
</P>
<P>
   ``All China benefits from more homeowners because that means
more jobs, a stronger economy, stronger families,'' Clinton said.
``And, of course, when people own their own homes, they are free to
take new jobs without worrying about losing housing benefits. We
also see around the world that homeowners take more responsibility
for the communities in which they live.''
</P>
<P>
   The president announced a new joint U.S.-China program to
promote the construction of affordable, energy-efficient housing.
He also said that American officials would work with Beijing to
create a middle-income mortgage-lending market and to strengthen
legal rights for property owners.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton is to fly to Guilin, a picturesque city on
the Li River, where he will deliver an address on the environment.
He continues on to Hong Kong, where on Friday he will give a
address business leaders on the turmoil in the Asian economy and
conduct a news conference before returning to Washington on Friday
night. &QL;

MAKING BOOKS: NERVOUS TWITCH IN THE WALLET 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To think that Wednesday's consummation of the merger
of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell doesn't mean important
changes in book publishing is to believe that it is the swaying
grass that causes the wind. But mostly the changes will be gradual,
played out over time, since the conglomerate that put it together
actually considers the publication of books a primary business.
</P>
<P>
   The merger molded by Bertelsmann AG, the German media company,
creates the world's largest English-language trade-book publisher,
with a seemingly endless number of divisions and imprints. For
anxious authors and their agents, the fear is that this
consolidation will mean that the various members of this giant
family will not be allowed to bid against each other for books. And
the bidding game is the spine of agenting and the stem of authors'
income.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in this atmosphere of slashed competition, not only will
there be fewer places for an agent to sell a writer's work, but the
author's advance is likely to be considerably lower than before.
Another fear is that there will be a large number of book contract
cancellations when the new management gazes upon the inventory of
books in the pipeline and finds duplications. Cancellations, one
may forget, would mean fewer choices for readers. Management was
emphatic that these feared cancellations would not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding question is more complicated, largely because Bantam
Doubleday Dell, which was owned by Bertelsmann before the merger,
has one set of rules about intrapublishing-house bidding among its
divisions and Random House has another set, which is far more
popular with agents and their authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it the Random House rules or the Bantam rules? No one
knows,'' one agent said, making the point that this was the single
most important question for authors.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that some form of the more writer-friendly
Random House rules will be used by the merged company, which will
be called Random House Inc. But there will have to be a definitive
answer quickly, since agents are not going to take much of a
vacation from deal making, and there are many other publishing
houses waiting to bid and buy.
</P>
<P>
   Every agent can recall an exception to the policy, but the
Random House rules allowed an agent to submit a manuscript secretly
to an imprint in any or all of its four adult trade-book divisions
(and, of course, to other publishing houses as well) and set them
bidding against one another, up to a point. Good money-letting
competition, enjoyed by agent and client. If in the end, however,
there were only two Random House imprints left in the auction, then
the agent had to disclose that fact, so the publishing house did
not have two of its own imprints skyrocketing the advance by
last-minute bidding.
</P>
<P>
   At Bantam Doubleday Dell, multiple submissions to its imprints
had to be made known by the agent from the start. If more than one
of its four adult trade divisions were interested in bidding, they
decided among themselves which imprint would take part in the
auction. Surprisingly, it was usually the imprint offering the most
money, since it was believed that that imprint had the most
commitment to the project and therefore would have more fire in
nurturing the book through publication and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Priest, an agent, said the merger was not necessarily bad,
``if multiple companies within the big one are allowed to make
their own editorial decisions'' and not have such determinations
forced upon them from the top. ``Sometimes there's a problem when
the auction gets up to very high money,'' he said. ``They don't
then want to bid against themselves, but it's all right if they
allow lots of their people to compete up to a certain level of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is that the new Random House will allow its
divisions to bid against one another until the auction reaches
hundreds of thousands of dollars, and then the company, after
conversations among its intramural competitors, will decide which
one of its imprints stays in the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Kay Murray, assistant director of the 7,400-member
Authors Guild, said: ``We've maintained all along that the merger
isn't good for writers. We are afraid of a decrease of diversity in
the books published, with one publisher having a third of the
market share.'' Actually, the new publishing company will have 10
percent of the total book market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She said that every time there has ``been a big merger, imprints
are closed and contracts are canceled and editors leave.'' Still,
she will be happy, she said, if the Random House rules apply to
bidding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Author Nick Lemann said that it certainly ``is not nuts to be
against the merger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they will let the divisions bid freely against
each other,'' he said, ``and this is particularly sensitive in book
publishing because it involves the public discourse. If you are the
guild, you have to be aware of both economic self-interest and the
public's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not to have a million small publishers or one big
publisher. Everybody agrees that the ideal is somewhere in the
middle, and the merger reduces the number of major players by
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the new company drop some of its imprints? Its management
says no, certainly not any time soon. But experience suggests that
trimming some is a real business possibility. Will it consolidate
some of the noneditorial departments? The history of such mergers
says yes. And will that be any time soon?
</P>
<P>
   The merger comes just as book publishing is shivering from flat
sales, large returns from booksellers and the rocketing advances,
among other perceived horrors. But even the American dream of 40
acres and a mule eventually became 140 acres, and so on, and so on.
And apparently Peter Olson, the chairman and chief executive
officer of the new Random House Inc., hasn't heard that books as
such have been terminated to be replaced by computer reading.

POLICE CHIEFS DECRY LOSS OF POWER IN WEAPONS BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association lined up
on the State House steps Wednesday to denounce the latest version
of an assault weapons ban, saying it takes away their power to
regulate who should have a gun.
</P>
<P>
   The group originally supported the overall measure. But a
late-filed amendment forming an appeals board to overrule police
chiefs' gun-licensing decisions has made them sour on the final
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although the House approved the legislation last week, the bill
still needs to be rectified with the Senate version, a process that
creates an opportunity for the amendment to be deleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amendment, if passed, would put firearms in the hands of
individuals previously rejected for such purposes by the local
chief of police,'' said Dennis Teehan, president of the MCPA. ``The
local police chief is in the best position to make decisions
regarding the issuance of firearms permits. The chief knows his
local citizens better than any politically appointed board. An
appropriate review process is already in place for a district court
judge to appeal a chief's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   While Acting Governor Paul Cellucci issued a statement
supporting the group's outcry, he has refused to ask gun lobbyist
Michael Yacino to step down as the head of the Massachusetts
Neighborhood Crime Watch. Under the amendment, Yacino, who also
serves as executive director of the Gun Owners Action League, would
have the right to nominate a member to the seven-member board that
could overrule the police chiefs. Yacino's efforts on behalf of gun
enthusiasts to dilute the assault weapons bill has drawn criticism
from Cellucci's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Cellucci urged the Legislature Wednesday to
``reject the amendment and restore muscle to the bill and to our
police.''
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, who joined the group in
denouncing the amendment, said Cellucci ``needs to address it in
action as well as words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Yacino's full-time job is to kill this legislation,''
Harshbarger added. Yacino could not be reached for comment.

COMMENTARY: SAVING THE CITIES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For many years the goal of people concerned
about the nation's cities was, for the most part, simply to stop
the hemorrhaging. Crime seemed out of control, longtime residents
were fleeing, entire neighborhoods were collapsing into rubble and
ash.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core inner-city neighborhoods _ the South Bronx in New
York, the Hough section of Cleveland, the Central Ward in Newark _
were seen by many as incurable concentrations of poverty and
pathology. Much of the rest of the country closed its eyes and
turned its back. Such neighborhoods, according to a particularly
destructive but pervasive view, not only were beyond saving, they
weren't worth saving. In the early 1980s a devastated neighborhood
in Kansas City, Mo., was used as a location site for ``The Day
After,'' a television movie about the aftermath of a nuclear
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Hard at work but hardly noticed during those terrible years were
the many men and women who, in small, often ragtag groups, rolled
up their sleeves and did what they could to counter one of the
biggest problems _ the desperate need for housing. Sometimes, in
the midst of chaos and misery, their goal was to build just one
house. Their attitude, invariably, was, ``You have to start
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago the Clinton administration released a
report declaring that, finally, after decades of struggling, the
nation's cities were rebounding. It's too early to reach for the
champagne. The inner cities, especially, are still intensely
isolated communities in which joblessness is high, poverty is
rampant, drug addiction is flourishing and genuine opportunities
are hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   But some very good things are happening. Crime is down,
municipal budgets are in much better shape, and even in hard-core
areas there are unmistakable early signs of renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Go back now to the men and women who rolled up their sleeves and
decided to build some housing. In the really tough neighborhoods,
they are the unheralded heroes. Working with churches and small
community organizations, they pulled off surprising early
successes. New homes would go up on a block, or old buildings would
be renovated, and before long a startling transformation would
occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the miracle of small steps,'' said Paul Grogan,
president of a national support group _ the Local Initiatives
Support Corporation (LISC) _ that recognized the potential of these
local groups, which came to be known, accurately but not very
excitingly, as community development corporations, or CDC's.
</P>
<P>
   Certain things happen when new homes, even a small number,
appear in a previously blighted neighborhood. The construction
itself creates economic activity. Architects and contractors are
hired. New families are drawn to the neighborhood and a new sense
of pride can be seen. Graffiti and other forms of vandalism tend to
occur with less frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blighted and abandoned housing sends a terrible signal,'' said
Grogan, whose group held its annual meeting here this week. ``It's
a magnet for drugs and other criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   What groups like LISC have found is that the new or refurbished
housing in most cases became a stabilizing force, a locally
developed defense against what had appeared to be unstoppable
blight.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, although very slowly, economic activity would pick
up. As a Boston resident described it: ``The neighborhood became a
neighborhood again.''
</P>
<P>
   LISC and some other groups began working with CDC's several
years ago, helping to arrange financing and offering the kind of
expertise that allowed the local groups to operate on a much larger
scale. What began small is now huge, and hugely important. LISC,
the largest of the intermediary groups, has directly raised $3
billion in financing since 1979 and has leveraged $3.5 billion
more. With the help of LISC and others, CDC's have built thousands
upon thousands of units of decent affordable housing all across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not enough. There is still a critical shortage of
affordable housing in the big cities. And there are many other
problems as well. But the cities are better off than they have been
in many years. And the men and women who built housing during the
worst of times deserve to be applauded.

CRIME STOPPER (Phoenix) - Alvin Moses says Phoenix's new
crime-fighting approach has worked in his neighborhood. Since
police stopped arresting drug dealers, gang members, and armed
robbers one-at-a-time and attacked the dens from which they dealt
death and dope, life has become a lot more peaceful. Police say
that, in fact, crime has gone down 31 percent in three central
Phoenix neighborhoods where they fought crime by taking a tough
stance against the apartments from which the crime emanated. It's
part of a nationwide crimefighting stragegy. By BILL HERMANN. Story
rescheduled from Wednesday, will move in the ``A'' cateogry. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SKINHEADS (Phoenix) - Four Lake Havasu City skinheads are indicted
by a federal grand jury in Phoenix on civil rights charges stemming
from the beating of a Mexican-American man. These skinheads are
tied to a group indicted last year for a cross-burning. Police say
skinheads are a big problem in Mohave County. By JERRY KAMMER.

GREATBAGEL (Phoenix) - Great Bagel &AMP; Coffee Co. closes its
11-company owned locations in the Phoenix area after a two-year
struggle for profitabilty. The Valley of the Sun is just too
saturated with bagel and coffee shop competition, Great Bagel's
president says. Great Bagel's demise is not the first sign of
distress in the once-hot business. Manhattan Bagel Co. of Eatonway,
N.J., filed for Chapter 11 reorganization last November. Stock in
Einstein/Noah Bagel Corp., which does business in the Phoenix area
as Einstein Bros. Bagels, has fallen to the $3-$5 range from $15 a
year ago. By JANE LARSON. Story will move in the ``F`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - If you break down the numbers, it works
out to $530,000 per word. Or $353,333.33 per syllable. Or $132,500
per letter. At least, that's what you get once you cut out all the
legal mumbo jumbo, the self-serving pronouncements and the
half-baked attempt at social engineering. None of that means a
thing. What's important is the $5.3 millon settlement and a simple
10-word phrase that almost gets lost in the paperwork: ``The city
is liable for the death of Edward Mallet.''By E.J. MONTINI. Story
will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL;

 &HT;    Lopez begins yet another quest for elusive Open title
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. -- Ray Knight, otherwise known as Nancy Lopez's
husband, became a statistics freak through baseball. A few years
ago, Knight suddenly awoke in bed at 3 o'clock one morning, rolled
over and asked the greatest player in modern women's golf: ``Do you
know who the best player in the LPGA is?''
</P>
<P>
   Knight had been figuring career driving statistics, scoring
average, average money _the whole package _ but at 3 a.m., Nancy
Lopez was not too fond of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' she said groggily. ``Who is the best player in
the LPGA?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patti Sheehan _ but you're second.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me all the stats,'' Lopez said this week, ``and I
went back to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   As Knight probably could tell you now, his wife also has 42
runnerup finishes to accompany her 48 wins. Unfortunately, four of
them have come in the U.S. Women's Open, which begins today on the
Blackwolf Run Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to sleep after her last near-miss was the toughest. A
year ago at Pumpkin Ridge, Lopez lost her grip on a U.S. Women's
Open trophy on the last stroke of the 72nd hole.
</P>
<P>
   When her final putt, a 10-footer that slid left of the hole,
allowed England's Alison Nicholas to secure her victory, it marked
the beginning of a lengthy mourning period for Lopez. Now 41, the
Albany, Ga. resident had to wonder if she had just blown her last
good opportunity to win the most prestigious title in women's golf.
Each post-tournament interview that day was a fight to hold back
the tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hard not to start crying,'' she said, ``because
I instantly felt the emotions that I felt walking to 18, that whole
day, then missing the putt. They came back like they had just
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 21 years later, a lot of people forget that Lopez tied for
second in the Open as an amateur in 1975. Or that she nearly won
the Open in her first try as a professional. Her undoing? A zipper
on her pants that had broken and opened up every time she bent down
to read a putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone through so many different feelings through the years
of playing the U.S. Open,'' Lopez said. ``I went through years of
basically choking myself when I got there because I wanted to win
it so bad. ... Then, I said, 'OK, it doesn't really matter if I win
the U.S. Open. I'm just going to play the best that I can.' I was
trying to take the pressure off myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics insist that Lopez's career will not be complete
without the USGA's highest honor. Some days she agrees; some days
she doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to win the U.S. Open,'' she said Tuesday, when all
the old pressures of the tournament started to form again. ``I just
have to keep trying. Eventually I will get too old, and maybe I
can't do it then after a certain time, but I still feel pretty
young. I feel like I still have a chance to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in April, Lopez suggested, ``I don't think it would bother
me much if I never won the U.S. Open. I never won the U.S. Amateur
and I was the No.1-ranked amateur for years. I don't think it would
take away from what I've done if I don't win a U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, with her missing treasure approaching again, Lopez
offered a more honest appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think deep down inside it probably will matter to me,
but I can't be selfish, really,'' she said. ``I think it would be
selfish saying that I would be unhappy not winning a U.S. Open
because of not completing my career. ... I've had a great life and
a great career on the tour. If I don't win a U.S. Open, I just
believe that God didn't have it in his plan for me to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   It might take a U.S. Women's Open to put Lopez's season into a
higher gear. It's been a struggle, beginning with the missed cut in
Atlanta in April, followed by another the following week at the
Sprint Titleholders. For her career, Lopez has missed just 19 cuts
in 395 events. Lately, though, it's three of her last six and a
mediocre spot on the money list, 35th with $120,585. Not exactly
what Lopez had in mind 20 years after her spectacular nine-win
season.
</P>
<P>
   It continually mystifies Lopez as to how some players can win an
Open but little else. Nicholas, for example, owns only two other
LPGA wins. Slowed by bronchial pneumonia this year, she has missed
three cuts, withdrawn twice and barely gets a mention as a
contender this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't now if it's because all the pressure has gone
somewhere else and they're just playing, or what it is,'' Lopez
said. ``I try and think about that and analyze it. Maybe the
pressure is so much more on players you'd think would win the U.S.
Open and maybe it lets somebody come in there and sneak in and win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Lopez's fans should not wish too hard for her to win an
Open. In Knight's opinion, such a development might push Lopez to
full-time car-pooling with their three kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she would win an Open, I'm sure there would not be a
tremendous amount of motivation left,'' Knight says. ``It's gotten
to where she gears everything for that tournament.''

 &HT;    Golf no longer old hat for McGann
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ There is an expression, used mostly among cowboys
and ranchers yet somehow appropriate during U.S. Women's Open week
in America's heartland/Dairyland, too, about folks who are more
style than substance.
</P>
<P>
   All hat and no cattle.
</P>
<P>
   This is an unflattering reference (if not a downright unkind
one) to somebody who looks good on the job, but doesn't quite
measure up when it comes to doing the real work.
</P>
<P>
   The fancy headwear by which Michelle McGann _ the Glad Hatter of
the LPGA Tour _ is so easily identifiable makes her an easy target
for such an insult as she endures a difficult year.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not reduce McGann to imposter status.
</P>
<P>
   Not again.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   McGann, who for the past three seasons has been one of her
sport's superstars, is struggling. She started well enough with a
couple of high finishes _ including a tie for third in The Office
Depot near her Singer Island home _ in her first two events of the
season. But she has missed seven cuts (amounting to more than half
her schedule since those first two tournaments) and comes into the
Open at Blackwolf Run Golf Course in a slump that matches the venue
in terms of nastiness.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't broken 70 in her past 15 rounds. Her stroke average
of 72.73 is her highest in seven years. And in a world where
fractions mean thousands of dollars, the jump from scoring numbers
posted each of the three most-recent LPGA seasons when McGann was
busy winning seven titles _ 71.56, 71.43 and 71.52 _ is more than a
little disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been beating myself up,'' McGann said Wednesday afternoon
after a practice round. ``I lost my confidence, and that's half the
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help that I'm such a perfectionist. You start
expecting that you'll play well every week, and that's not going to
happen. But little things start bothering you, and then everything
gets out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of golf's maddening appeal is that it does that to
everyone, but McGann seemed to be on a roll after waiting until
1995 _ she joined the LPGA Tour in October 1988 at the age of 18 _
for her first victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but I beat myself up then, too,'' McGann said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a twist of fortune, McGann's celebrity status works
against her. At the end of her practice round, for example, her
father and caddy, Bucky, worked the ropes behind the 18th green as
an advance man passing out pictures of his daughter for her to
sign.
</P>
<P>
   She accomodated all requests, and did the same thing at various
times on the course _ even stopping to pose for pictures between
greens and tees _ and heard all the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you going to win?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you feeling OK?''
</P>
<P>
   McGann says it's nothing out of the ordinary. A slump is a slump
is a slump ... she hits it well, and can't putt; or putts well when
she isn't hitting it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you feel like saying is, `Hey, I'm human,''' McGann said.
</P>
<P>
   She says she ``likes the test'' at Blackwolf Run, which is the
second-longest U.S. Women's Open course in history and would
therefore seem to suit McGann's power game. But her previous Open
history suggests it is not the kind of event in which to expect a
dramatic McGann recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The can't-break-70 syndrome McGann is enduring on the LPGA Tour
has covered her Open experiences since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all it takes is one round,'' McGann said. ``That can be
all you need to turn your mind around.''
</P>
<P>
   She figures she has the cattle to go with the hat.
</P>
<P>
   She just happens to have misplaced the livestock.
</P>
<P>
   But the heartland/Dairyland of America may be the place to find
it.

 &HT;    Venus loses cool, match
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Rage overwhelmed Venus Williams in the
Wimbledon quarterfinals Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Third seed Jana Novotna happened to be on the other side of the
net at the time, and by keeping control amid chaos, the 29-year-old
grass-court veteran defeated Williams 7-5, 7-6 (7-2) for a spot in
her fifth Wimbledon semifinal today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I played really good tennis today,'' Novotna said.
``And I made Venus desperate at some times. I think she lost it a
little bit there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, an 18-year-old who had expected to win her first title
here, yelled at the chair umpire twice, nearly cried and bellowed
at a lineswoman _ all over what she considered incorrect line calls
in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that you're upset about the bad call,'' said
Williams, who rarely, if ever, has had such an emotional match or
outburst. ``I was just upset because I deserved the point because
she hit the ball out.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna _ who now plays top seed Martina Hingis _ showed off her
classic Wimbledon winning style in the first set, serving and
volleying well to win 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 3-all in the second set, Williams argued her first call
after winning a point to reach 15-40 on her serve. Despite winning
the point, she thought the previous shot from Novotna was wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ball was so far out,'' she hollered above the crowd noise
at an unresponsive chair umpire while pointing to where Novotna's
ball had landed.
</P>
<P>
   She then stomped toward the lineswoman on the service line and
yelled, ``Ya gotta call'em'' while glaring at her.
</P>
<P>
   Williams lost her service game on the next point, then lost the
next game before winning the next two, earning back the service
break. She looked angry but hit both of her aces of the match in
the service game.
</P>
<P>
   At 3-3, Williams double-faulted, falling behind 15-30. She lost
the next point with an long but was convinced Novotna's shot before
hers had also gone long. She walked toward the umpire, arguing all
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's out,'' she screamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows it's out,'' she yelled louder, pointing at someone
in the crowd. ``Everyone else knows it's out, but you don't know
it's out.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams got a round of applause from the fans, but nothing from
the umpire. She stalked back to serve and double-faulted, giving
Novotna a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Still shaking in fury, she returned to her seat for the
changeover and snatched her towel off the chair. She had tears in
her eyes and looked close to breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a firm belief that those balls were out and that those
linespeople should have called them out,'' Williams said. ``But I
think it just helped me play better. I was more willing to try to
get that win.''
</P>
<P>
   She did win the next game, breaking Novotna's serve and holding
her own for a 5-4 lead. During the changeover, a team of
linespeople was rotated, which Williams' mother and sister cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna and Williams each held serve until they reached 6-6.
Williams played poorly in the tiebreaker, or as she put it,
``missed some opportunities,'' losing 2-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the crowd probably enjoyed my emotional
outbursts,'' she said, smiling and laughing. ``I guess someone
would turn the channel and suddenly see some girl screaming and
keep it there. I know I would. It probably brightened up someone's
day.''
</P>
<P>
   After reflection, Williams didn't regret her John McEnroe-like
episode, saying she felt obligated to let everyone know her
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I needed to do that and I needed to do that
probably because I really wanted to win those points, and the ball
was really out,'' Williams said. ``And sometimes you need to make
sure that you can go on to the next point.''
</P>
<P>
   She might have been happy with the result, but Novotna was
happier, pointing out that experience is worth quite a bit at
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that I had the edge because I could see in the second
set Venus started to come in quite a lot,'' Novotna said. ``She's
not even coming in in mixed doubles or in doubles. So you can
imagine how desperate she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams expects to learn a lot when she studies both her play
and her behavior at her second Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year I don't think there's anything that will be stopping
me except for me,'' she said.

`BERNARDIN': ANCHORED BY CHURCH TEACHINGS, DRIVEN BY VATICAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The television producer who sets out to profile as
deeply admired a religious figure as Cardinal Joseph Bernardin
risks losing the human being in an aura of reverence. So credit is
due to Martin Doblmeier and Frank Frost for putting together a fond
portrait that allows the man to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   This program emphasizes the influence on the young priest of the
Second Vatican Council, which opened up church practices and
directed attention to issues of poverty and peace. By the time he
was named archbishop of Cincinnati in 1972, he had already earned a
reputation as a leader of a changing church. But this program makes
clear that on some crucial matters, notably the Supreme Court's
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which he steadfastly opposed, Bernardin
felt himself anchored in traditional Roman Catholic teachings.
</P>
<P>
   More to the liking of liberal observers was his opposition to
the use of nuclear weapons. Even as the Cold War raged, Bernardin
took a prominent role in formulating the mandate of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops ``to draw a strong, clear line _
politically and morally _ against resort to nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as his vision of a moral public policy combined support for
poverty programs with opposition to abortion, so he preached
opposition to nuclear weapons without any hint of softness toward
communism.
</P>
<P>
   As recalled by observers of religion in America, his
soft-spoken, noninflammatory approach achieved marvels of consensus
within the church and admiration outside it. In his television
appearances, he presented a principled, self-effacing figure,
always mild but never weak. So it was a shocker in 1993, when at
the peak of his influence as archbishop of Chicago and a member of
the College of Cardinals, he was charged by a former seminarian
with sexual abuse back in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that time, when reports of pedophiliac priests were
making headlines, Bernardin's unambiguous denials at a news
conference _ ``I just want to say to you that everything that is in
that suit about me, the allegations, are totally untrue, they are
totally false'' _ were persuasive, and a few months later his
accuser dropped all charges.
</P>
<P>
   The program ends with the cardinal's typically plain-spoken
television reports on the course of his cancer, which was diagnosed
in 1995. He treated it with the openness for which he always
strove. His final efforts before his death the next year were given
to advancing what he called common ground on divisive issues both
within his church and with other faiths.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this appreciation, some reverence seems in order.
``Bernardin'' helps us to understand why those who knew him well,
as one eulogist says, felt privileged ``to live in the time when a
holy man was the archbishop of Chicago.''

CLINTON URGES CONTINUED US INVESTMENT IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China -- In an unusual intersection of capitalism and
communism, President Clinton strode onto the floor of the new
Shanghai Stock Exchange Wednesday to the loud applause of its
red-vested traders, capping a two-day blitz through this financial
capital for more open markets and a more open way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly urged United States businessmen here to
continue their investment in China for the good of both countries.
He highlighted a Chinese home ownership program by telling a
nostalgic tale of buying his first house. And he recounted the
highlights of his trip for the Chinese state television station,
describing his press conference with Chinese President Jiang Zemin
as ``historic for a long time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White House aides quietly monitored the less
diplomatic side of the Clinton presidency. They watched from afar
as Pentagon aide Linda Tripp made her first appearance before the
Whitewater grand jury in Washington to begin answering questions
over her secret taping of Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the testimony, White House spokesman Michael McCurry
expressed little interest in the topic. ``The president is
concentrating on one trip, and it's China, not Linda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sun-splashed atrium of the Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel here,
Clinton told members of the American Chamber of Commerce that China
represented the future of America's economic strength, and that in
many respects, American investment here would help China's future
in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the positive impacts you have on the United
States, your work here has a very positive impact in China,''
Clinton told the group. ``China's 20-year track record of
unprecedented growth has been fueled in part by foreign products,
know-how, investment, trade and energy. These ties also have more
profound, long-lasting effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They strengthen the rule of law, openness and
accountability,'' Clinton added. ``They expose China to fair labor
practices and stronger environmental standards. They spread
powerful agents of change: fax machines and photocopiers, computers
and modems.''
</P>
<P>
   That change, at least in business terms, was never more apparent
than when Clinton circled the catwalk of the Shanghai stock
exchange, descended by elevator and walked onto the floor as young
traders in red vests applauded loudly and presented him with a vest
of his own. Above, a stadium-sized videoscreen captured the moment
for distant onlookers. The market was closed temporarily for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The stock exchange, which began eight years ago with just 30
issues, now lists more than 500.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then ducked into a conference room for a 20-minute
interview with China's national television network -- a session in
which he said he was surprised that Zemin had permitted their joint
press conference Saturday to be broadcast on live television in
China.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that his first memory of China was reading about it
in an encyclopedia as a child. In this, his first visit there, he
said he was struck by the economic growth sweeping the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also believe there is a genuine increase in people's control
over their own lives,'' he said. ``Incomes are going up, people
have more choices in education, more choice in jobs, the freedom to
travel. I think there's a genuine movement toward openness and
freedom in China, which obviously as an American, and as an
American president, I hope will continue and increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the summit's accomplishments, Clinton said, ``I think that in
the end it may be that the biggest achievement was the increased
understanding and the sense of a shared future. I mean, I think the
press conference that President Jiang and I did will be viewed as
historic for a long time to come. And the fact that he wanted to do
it, he enjoyed it and it was on national television I think was
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton, accompanied by US Rep. Edward
Markey, one of six lawmakers in the White House delegation, stopped
at an Internet cafe and talked to students who paid $2.50 an hour
to link up to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also endorsed a novel housing reform program in which
Chinese residents are allowed to buy their own apartments rather
than rent a state-owned company apartment. He visited the home of
Yu Jinyuan, a resident of Jin Hui Gardens, which includes four and
six-story garden apartments where several families have become
first-time homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 20 years ago, I bought my first home,'' Clinton
said. ``I actually bought it because my girlfriend liked the house.
We were driving by the house one day -- it was a very small house
-- and she said, I like that house very much. So I found out the
house did not cost too much money and I bought it. And then I said
to my girlfriend, `I bought that house you like, now you'll ave to
marry me.' And she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Shanghai for Guilin, a breathtaking mountainous
region which for thousands of years has served as the subject of
traditional Chinese ink paintings of winding rivers set against
hilly backdrops. There, he planned to focus attention on the
environment, before flying to Hong Kong for a night and day of
meetings and speeches to conclude his trip.

   JUG-ANCIENT (Seattle) An ancient Middle Eastern jug found in
Seattle has been returned to the University of Chicago's Oriental
Institute, more than a half century after it disappeared. A
warehouse worker for Goodwill Industries stumbled across the relic
while sifting through donations last spring. The institute had
loaned out the jug to a patron to raise money in 1943, officials
said. The 4-inch jug made of roughly textured brown clay didn't
look like much when warehouse worker Randy Jones found it in an old
camera box among the clothing, costume jewelry and usual
bric-a-brac donated to the charity.

four years ago. The Beijing announcement essentially affirmed that
China no longer is aiming its 13 DF-5 missiles at American targets

SEASON RAINS BRING END TO MEXICO'S DISASTROUS FIRE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The most disastrous fire season in memory is near
an end, Mexican officials said Wednesday, with seasonal rains
extinguishing some of the thousands of blazes that have consumed
vast areas of brush and timberland this year.
</P>
<P>
   All but eight of more than 13,500 fires registered throughout
the country since January have been extinguished, a Mexican
environmental official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are late, but the normal rainy-season rains have
arrived,'' said Elizabeth Breton, spokeswoman for the Mexican
environmental agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the eight fires still burning throughout the country, four
are already under control,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million acres of Mexican brush and timberlands were
burned, with many of the fires set by rural farmers clearing fields
for planting. As many as 250 fires were reported burning at any one
time.
</P>
<P>
   One U.S. relief official who visited the country had called the
fires ``the worst natural disaster ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires were so intense in late May that smoke drifted into
the United States, prompting health advisories in Texas and
spreading haze across several southern states.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the fires extinguished or under control, the U.S.
Forest Service and its Texas counterpart have been removing 81
firefighters sent in mid-May to help battle the wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   A firefighting team will remain in Mexico to develop long-range
training plans for Mexican firefighters, the environmental agency
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the fire teams, the U.S. Agency for International
Development sent safety, firefighting and communications equipment
for 3,000 Mexican firefighters, as well as portable water pumps and
tanks, firefighting foam, helicopter tankers and two infrared
equipped spotter airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, human efforts combined with seasonal rains ended
the threat to the Chimalapas jungle preserve in southeastern
Mexico. At one time, up to 30 fires were burning in the trackless
jungle mountains of the preserve, the northernmost tropical rain
forest in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering hot spot is at Cintalapa, outside the Chiapas
capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez.

EXPERTS FACE HARSH REALITY AT AIDS CONFERENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Reality has caught up with jubilation over the
expectations of a two-year-old AIDS drug treatment plan credited
with saving thousands of lives in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success of the new treatment, no more than 50
percent of patients can reduce the AIDS virus in their blood to
undetectable levels, if using the most sensitive tests, Dr. Julio
S. G. Montaner, professor of medicine at the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver, said in a speech Wednesday at the 12th World
AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle, Montaner said, is the difficulty patients
have in following complicated schedules that sometimes require five
doses a day and dozens of pills.
</P>
<P>
   Patients failing to take drugs as prescribed run the risk of
developing strains of HIV that cannot be killed by drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects that include a puzzling syndrome of high
cholesterol, high triglycerides and abnormal fat deposits, have
been associated with the most potent of the newer drugs _ protease
inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Waafa El-Sadr of Harlem Hospital Center in New York City
described the difficulties new treatments pose for her patients.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann, 30, suffers a host of problems: asthma, rheumatoid
arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression. She's
undergone a mastectomy for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she also has AIDS,'' El-Sadr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never misses a pill, ever . . . She never complains. The
cruel truth is that in spite of her superhuman efforts, her viral
load creeps up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rochelle is a grandmother at age 36, Sadr said. She changed her
life when she acquired HIV. Even though her immune system is
reviving and she feels better, she asks: ``Will I always have to
take this handful of medications? Can anyone take these forever?''
</P>
<P>
   Montaner said that serving the needs of such patients requires
fine-tuning drugs so that patients have to take fewer pills fewer
times a day.
</P>
<P>
   Patients responded well two years ago when the first potent
protease inhibitors came out and were paired with two members of
the older class of AIDS drugs called reverse transcriptase
inhibitors. Often, doctors could not detect any virus in their
blood by the most common tests.
</P>
<P>
   But a person could find himself taking dozens of pills daily:
Some with a quart of water, some on a full stomach, others on an
empty one.
</P>
<P>
   That became the standard care for AIDS patients, but it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our (hospital) beds are empty,'' Montaner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many true alternatives,'' he said, noting that 11
drugs currently are approved for HIV treatment in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Several drugs have the potential for once-a-day treatment, he
said. Another, called Combavir, is a combination of 3TC and ddI,
two older drugs. It simplifies the dosing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Montaner said he is already simplifying treatment for his
patients, but he warned that eventually, people will become
resistant to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get rid of any of the drugs,'' he said. ``Sooner or
later, you will need them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 60 percent of patients seen by Dr. David Cooper,
president of the International AIDS Society, have developed bizarre
lipid or fat disorders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who practices at St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney,
Australia, said only 10-20 percent have experienced seriously high
rates of these problems.
</P>
<P>
   And while the problem is serious, Cooper does not recommend that
people stop taking protease inhibitors. That's what saved their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The patients have developed abnormal levels of cholesterol and
triglycerides, but they have no other symptoms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Montaner said some newer combinations that are being recommended
do not contain a protease inhibitor yet have virtually the same
effect. A new drug called sustiva and another called abacavir have
had good success when combined with two older drugs such as AZT,
3TC and ddI.
</P>
<P>
   An encouraging note was sounded by Dr. Brigitte Autran of the
Hopital Pitie Salpetriere in Paris who has seen immune systems
revive in patients in response to the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immune system is not dead, even when patients are treated
at near the end of the disease'' she said. Not only are new immune
systems cells generated, but they function as expected.
</P>
<P>
   When the virus is removed, she said, the immune system can
restore itself.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Hirschel, a chairman of the conference and a
professor at the University of Geneva, said he has found that when
the virus in the blood is reduced, he also can stop preventive
treatment usually prescribed to prevent diseases that cause
pneumonia and severe infections of the mouth and throat. Such
problems are often associated with AIDS patients.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Villa Villa,'' a performance art show by an
Argentine group called De la Guarda, is described by its creators
as a celebration of life. Each night, at the Daryl Roth Theater,
they aim to re-create the wild atmosphere of random unity that
occurs at street festivals in South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main idea behind De la Guarda,'' said Pichon Baldinu, one
of the show's two directors, who translates the name of the group
as Guardian Angel, ``is to take care of the spirit of the audience:
To try to make something very positive and to make all of the
audience enjoy that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The roots of ``Villa Villa'' (pronounced VEE-sha VEE-sha) were
planted in 1985. It was the second year of democratic rule in
Argentina, and the country was still reeling from the effects of
the military dictatorship's campaign against leftists and
subversives, known as the dirty war.
</P>
<P>
   Baldinu and another director, Diqui James, were fresh out of
drama school, and the mood they recall was dark. They joined an
underground street-theater group called ``La Organizacion Negra''
(``Dark Organization'') to mirror the terror and chaos that they
felt had enveloped the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of violence around us all of the time,''
Baldinu said. ``A lot of murders, suffering and injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the group was to shock audiences out of complacency,
often by using displays of demolition and destruction. Their fame
grew, and when in 1989 they scaled the pyramidal monument in
central Buenos Aires known as the Obelisco, they drew 25,000
spectators. Shortly afterward, a law was passed banning the use of
the monument for performances, and the group took to the
international festival circuit.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992 the group was divided. The political climate was
changing, anger was dissipating, and some members were turning to
more traditional theater. Anxious to continue the spirit of
experimentation, James and Baldinu left to form what was to become
De la Guarda. They teamed up with rock climbers who taught them how
to use ropes and harnesses to fly above an audience. ``We wanted to
test the limits,'' said Baldinu, ``to have the audience inside the
show, to give them strong emotions without using violence, which
was the tool we used to use.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 they were joined by an experimental dance group called
El Descueve, and took the name of their show from the ``villas''
that are equivalent to shantytowns in Argentina. ``We never had
money in that period, and the expression we used to use was `do it
Villa Villa,' meaning, don't stop your idea, just do it with
something you have, without resources,'' said Baldinu. ``We lived
and created the show with that spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a show that is partly improvisational. Drawing on
their experience from festivals around the world, they allow the
audience's reaction to drive each performance, which in part means
dictate the action. ``We try to use these things,'' said Baldinu,
explaining that if something particularly interesting happened in
one part of the show, the cast allows the moment to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is part of the theater _ to use that time, that moment,
that situation,'' he said. ``It is the opposite of mass
production.''
</P>
<P>
   Having presented the show mainly for short runs, in festivals,
the group hopes this philosophy will sustain the performance
throughout its first commercial run of at least three months.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Rent,'' Jeffrey Seller and Kevin McCollum,
joined with two other producers, Daryl Roth and David Binder, to
bring De la Guarda to New York after watching the ensemble perform
at the London Theater Festival last year.
</P>
<P>
   There are no characters in ``Villa Villa,'' and no script in the
traditional sense. ``We don't want you to understand the
characters,'' said Baldinu. ``We want you instead to feel the
expression, and the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience is bombarded with sensory experience: Aerial
choreography is accompanied by primitive drums, multicolored lights
and ambient music. The goal is interaction between the audience and
the lithe, muscular performers who, dressed in business suits,
descend periodically from their aerial playground to interact with
theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the people of a city,'' Baldinu said, ``people who are
trying to fly, to get into another atmosphere, the same people that
you can see in the street walking to their job.''
</P>
<P>
   James said, ``People walk out and some are saying, `Ahh, that
was the beginning of creation,' and someone else will say, `No, it
was Armageddon.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the directors urge people not to analyze. ``We don't want
the audience to think,'' Baldinu said. ``We want them to feel, all
the time. We want to give them a lot of sensations and situations
to react to, so they can't ask what it all means.''

JUDGE BARS SAFETY RULES IN NEW-HANDGUN SALES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Attorney General Scott Harshbarger's plan to use
consumer protection laws to attack gun violence was dealt a serious
setback Wednesday by a Suffolk Superior Court judge who ruled
Harshbarger does not have the legal authority to mandate quality
control standards for new guns sold in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Diane Kottmyer Wednesday issued a
preliminary injunction that bars Harshbarger from enforcing the
quality standards that took effect Tuesday. She also barred rules,
scheduled to take effect Sept. 30, from being enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power granted to the attorney general by (state law) does
not encompass the power to establish design and performance
standards for products sold in Massachusetts,'' Kottmyer wrote in
her 15-page order.
</P>
<P>
   She said lawmakers have never authorized Harshbarger to use the
consumer protection law the way he has against gunmakers. The law
``seeks to prevent economic harm'' while the gun regulations are
aimed at ``the threat to public safety posed by defective and
otherwise unsafe'' handguns, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Kottmyer also noted that she issued the preliminary injunction
because gunmakers who sued Harshbarger have shown they are likely
to win their case and would suffer ``irreparable harm'' if forced
to modify their plants to accommodate the Massachusetts
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Harsbarger said Wednesday he is confident he will ultimately
convince the courts that he was within his authority to issue the
rules, which also required gunmakers to start installing child
safety locks in new guns sold in the state after Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger is the first attorney general in the nation to turn
to local consumer laws as a way to attack ``junk guns'' and
Saturday Night specials that law enforcement blames for a large
percentage of gun-related crimes in the state. His effort is backed
by the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association as well as
handgun control groups and emergency room physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe common sense will prevail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank A. Libby Jr., the Boston attorney for the industry's
gunmakers and gunshop owners, said he was ``pleased with the
result, but equally gratified with the thoughtful, detailed
decision recognizing the limits on the attorney general's
rulemaking authority.''
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Kottmyer did allow Harshbarger to enforce one
rule, which requires gunmakers to disclose the accuracy of new guns
with barrels less than 3 inches long. An industry spokesman said
companies will comply, but questioned the validity of the standard,
which requires new guns to be shot from 7 yards, 14 yards, and 21
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody shoots a handgun at 21 yards in self-defense,'' Richard
Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council
Inc., said Wednesday. ``What are you doing shooting at someone 63
feet away?''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman also said the industry would prefer to work with
Harshbarger _ instead of fighing in court _ to achieve what Feldman
said was a common goal of reducing gun-related crimes and violence.
The US Conference of Mayors has recently begun talking with
gunmakers about their financial cost and human cost stemming from
gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the regulations that Kottmyer put on hold, new guns must
meet quality standards governing the metal used to make them, and
must past ``drop tests'' that show the gun won't accidentally
discharge.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations also require new guns to have ``load
indicators'' which tell whether a cartridge is in the chamber of
semi-automatic weapons, and ``magazine safety disconnect'' that
would prevent a gun from firing if a magazine had been removed.

SPORTS COLUMN: STARS' GAME A STRANGER IN NEW YORK  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When baseball's All-Star Game begins Tuesday night at Coors
Field in Colorado, the nation's fans have decreed that no member of
baseball's real all-star team, the Yankees, will be in the American
League starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With a 56-20 record before Wednesday night's game with the
Phillies, not having an All-Star starter is a tribute to what the
Yankees have accomplished as a team this season.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also an indictment of both the Yankees and the Mets in
dimming the dazzle of the All-Star Game by not holding it for more
than two decades at Yankee Stadium or Shea Stadium. Out of sight,
out of mind for many New York fans in the annual balloting for
starting lineups.
</P>
<P>
   If the game were played at Yankee Stadium or at Shea Stadium
more often, New York fans would care more about it.
</P>
<P>
   In the fans' voting sponsored this year by CompUSA and Pepsi,
each of the 30 major league clubs received 1 million ballots to
distribute to fans at its ball park. The larger a club's attendance
during the voting period, the more ballots are likely to be filled
out.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rich Levin, the executive director of public
relations for Major League Baseball, no record is available as to
how many ballots were cast in each of the various franchise areas.
</P>
<P>
   Although no Yankee will be among the eight starting position
players, the AL manager, Mike Hargrove of the Cleveland Indians,
added five Yankees to the squad Wednesday _ center fielder Bernie
Williams, right fielder Paul O'Neill, shortstop Derek Jeter, third
baseman Scott Brosius and the left-handed pitcher David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The only Mets starter, Mike Piazza, opened on the National
League ballot as the Los Angeles Dodgers' catcher before being
traded to Florida and then to New York. Only one other Met, the
right-hander Rick Reed, was added to the NL squad.
</P>
<P>
   If and when the Yankees and the Mets get new stadiums, maybe
they would be willing to put an All-Star Game on display. Until
then, it is something that happens everywhere but New York. There
has not been one at Yankee Stadium since 1977, the year after the
renovated Bronx ball park reopened. There has only been one at
Shea, in 1964, the year it opened.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder New York fans don't seem to get out the vote for the
All-Star Game. It has been a generation since they have had one.
</P>
<P>
   And the earliest New York could get the game is 2001. Next
year's site is Fenway Park in Boston. In 2000, Florida has it.
</P>
<P>
   In any baseball team's big picture, the season is what's
important. The All-Star Game is just a one-night show. Two days
later, nobody remembers who won. But the score isn't important. For
three hours on a Tuesday night in July, it's a wonderful show _ the
best all-star game in sports.
</P>
<P>
   New York was reminded of the fun of the spectacle last February
when the Knicks and Madison Square Garden were the hosts for the
National Basketball Association's All-Star Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a serious result, the NBA's best players were on
display, especially Michael Jordan in what might have been his
final All-Star Game and his next-to-last Garden appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But in the NBA All-Star Game, nobody plays defense unless it
comes down to the final minute, if then. In pro football's all-star
game, the Pro Bowl, nobody is allowed to blitz the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's All-Star Game is much more valid. By the nature of
baseball, its game is sport's ultimate one-on-one confrontation:
the best hitters against the best pitchers. And there's no rule
that says the pitchers can't throw their best fastball, their best
breaking ball or their best changeup.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the game, the All-Star workout day on Monday,
with its home run derby, skills competitions and team batting
practices, provides fun for fans who don't have tickets to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   When the workout day began about two decades ago, it was free.
The ball park gates were open. But it proved to be so popular, it's
now a hot ticket. They needed a lottery to distribute the
workout-day tickets this year in Denver, where the price ranged
from $25 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, there's no baseball All-Star Game, no All-Star
workout day, no All-Star fun and festivities. And until there is,
the All-Star Game will never create the New York interest it
deserves.

PHOENIX OUTLET SATURATION CLAIMS GREAT BAGEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Great Bagel &AMP; Coffee Co. closed its 11 company-owned
locations Wednesday after a two-year struggle for profitabilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last two years it's been very hard. We've been losing
money, and the competition continued to come in,'' said Gary
Sandeen, president of the Phoenix-based company.
</P>
<P>
   The closure has put some 120 workers out of jobs. Great Bagel
will refer them to other restaurants looking for workers, Sandeen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Four franchisee-owned stores in the Phoenix area and two Great
Bagel Expresses located in Phoenix and Tempe (Ariz.) Texaco
Starmarts will remain open.
</P>
<P>
   When Great Bagel opened in 1993 offering big bagels, specialty
cream cheese and gourmet coffee, there were only a handful of bagel
and coffee shops in the Valley, Sandeen said. At the start of this
year, however, he estimated there were 128 shops in the Phoenix
area competing in that segment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oversaturation has hurt sales. Where we used to be the only
place, now there are three and four options for people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bagels' reputation as primarily a breakfast item also hurt the
stores' ability to attract a lunch crowd, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company tried a variety of things to survive, he said,
including slashing overhead and merging locations. It stopped
selling franchises more than a year ago as managers tried to get
their hands around Great Bagel's problems, Sandeen said.
</P>
<P>
   A potential deal to sell Great Bagel &AMP; Coffee Co. fell through,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trends kept getting worse and worse,'' he said. He
estimated the company lost $400,000 to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Great Bagel was owned by Uniquely Casual Restaurants Inc. of
Danvers, Mass., and a partnership of private investors, Sandeen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though consumers' bagel consumption continues to rise, Great
Bagel's demise is not the first sign of distress in the once-hot
business.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Bagel Co. of Eatonway, N.J., which operates primarily
on the East Coast, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court last November.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in Einstein/Noah Bagel Corp., which does business in the
Phoenix area as Einstein Bros. Bagels, has fallen to the $3-$5
range from $15 a year ago. Boston Chicken Inc., which owns 52
percent of the San Diego-based company, has put its stake up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Other major players have yet to achieve their planned
expansions.
</P>
<P>
   Brueggers Bagel Bakery opened in Phoenix in 1996 with plans for
25 stores within five years. It currently has five stores.
</P>
<P>
   Chesapeake Bagel Bakery of Washington, D.C., entered the local
market in 1994 with plans for 20 franchises over the next five
years. It currently has two stores.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix remains a strong market for Einstein, with double-digit
growth year-to-year in comparable-store sales, marketing manager
Matt Sullivan said Wednesday. The company, which entered Phoenix
nearly three years ago, has 14 company-owned stores in the market
and plans four more this year, he said.

<P>
   USTI NAD LABEM, Czech Republic _ On the outskirts of this
depressed industrial town, about 50 Gypsy families live in two
dilapidated, graffiti-strewn apartment blocks along Maticni Street
where voices are often loud and celebrations boisterous.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street stand three prim row houses with gray facades
and white lace curtains drawn across the windows. These are the
homes of Czech families who have persuaded the City Council to
build a 15-foot-wall on the Gypsy side of Maticni Street to
separate the Czechs, physically and psychologically, from what they
consider their undesirable neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsies and several Czech human rights groups have called
the wall an attempt to create a ghetto. They declare that the
project is the latest example of designating the Gypsies, who
number between 200,000 and 300,000, as outsiders in the Czech
Republic, which has a population of about 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, Ladislav Hruska, makes no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wall is about one group that obeys the laws of the Czech
Republic and behaves according to good morals, and about a group
that breaks these rules _ doesn't pay rent, doesn't use proper
hygiene and doesn't do anything right,'' Hruska said as he sat in
his office below a portrait of President Vaclav Havel, a prominent
spokesman for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a racial problem. It is a problem of dealing with
decent and indecent people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years the Czech government _ once widely
considered the leader in Central Europe in the transition from
communist rule, which ended in 1989, to a civil society _ has come
under increasing criticism for its failure to address the growing
disparities between Gypsies and non-Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent U.S. State Department report on human rights
around the world gave vivid detail of how Gypsies, also called
Romany or Roma, ``suffer disproportionately from poverty,
unemployment, interethnic violence, discrimination, illiteracy and
disease.'' Unemployment among Gypsies is about 70 percent, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   After Usti nad Labem announced that the wall would be built,
Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., co-chairman of the Commission on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, criticized the Czech cabinet
for remaining silent in the face of continuing attacks and
discrimination against Gypsies and other minorities. The only
criticism of the wall by a Czech government official so far has
come from the minister without portfolio, Vladimir Mlynar, who is
responsible for Gypsy affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Smith attributed the government's silence in part
to politics. Public opinion polls have consistently shown that
Czechs harbor what the State Department report called a ``deeply
ingrained popular prejudice against Gypsies,'' and Czech
politicians, like all others, keep a close eye on opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The prejudice, of course, is felt acutely among the Gypsies of
Maticni Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how three families have more sway than 50
families,'' said Miroslav Demeter, 44, as he looked over at the
austere facades across the narrow street. ``The wall will make
things worse. The Romany are very angry, because all over Europe
they are breaking down walls but here they are building walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Demeter and several other Gypsies acknowledged that all was not
perfect at the apartment houses. It was true, he said, that many
families did not pay rent to the city. It was also true, said Tibor
Badi, 48, that some families used the surrounding gardens as a
refuse heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing on my verandah smoking a cigarette one day and
I was almost hit by a falling chair,'' he said, when one tenant
decided to discard the chair by throwing it out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the issue is that the Gypsy community is quite
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   It includes families like Badi's, who have held jobs for many
years and who lived during the Communist period alongside Czechs in
integrated housing. High school certificates on the living room
wall in Badi's apartment attest to the education that he and his
wife, Marta, received under communism.
</P>
<P>
   But other Gypsy families here have little education, have rarely
held full-time jobs and show contempt for the better educated like
Badi.
</P>
<P>
   At the bar U Pristavu on the corner of Maticni Street, the
owner, Eva Kompertova, says she allows in only certain Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let in three families _ they don't make any trouble _ but I
don't let the others in because they get into fights,'' Ms.
Kompertova said as she sipped a beer with some Czech customers.
``On our side of the street, Romanies are not allowed. They don't
even go over there because it's so clean they feel uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with Gypsies from the apartment houses, Hruska
agreed to postpone construction of the wall to September. In the
meantime, the Gypsies are being asked to keep the area clean and
reduce the noise level. But Hruska said he did not believe the
Gypsies would meet the required standard.
</P>
<P>
   Demeter, who was tending a newly planted garden, was not
optimistic either. ``In three months you can't change things,'' he
said. ``It's the culture; Romany people are different.''
</P>
<P>
   In Prague, a human rights advocate at the Helsinki Committee for
Human Rights, Marta Mikluskova, said it is essential that the City
Council drop the plan. ``If Usti is allowed to build a wall, it
will become a precedent for other towns,'' she said, ``and others
will start planning and do it within a year or two.''

BOSTON PEACE GROUP TO MONITOR IRISH MARCH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As thousands of Protestants &UR;  &LR; threaten to defy police
and march through a Catholic ghetto in Northern Ireland's Portadown
neighborhood this Sunday, carrying lambeg drums and singing
anti-Catholic songs, a group of Bostonians will be in their midst,
monitoring the violence that's expected to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   PeaceWatch Ireland, a Boston grass-roots group, is sending a
delegation of four that includes Heeten Kalan, a South African who
lives in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Northern Ireland resonates with me,'' said
Kalan, who has toured the Belfast area five times. ``The heavy
level of security and surveillance just blew me away. It reminded
me of parts of South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fear that the march could become the first large-scale
confrontation between Irish Catholics and Protestants since a peace
agreement was approved in May.
</P>
<P>
   Kalan will arrive in Ireland this morning, along with Sean
Cahill, an Irish-American activist; Jean Riesman, a Jewish woman;
and Scott Daugherty, an Irish Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   With cameras strapped to their necks and pen and pads in their
hands, the four plan to document any violence at the Orange Order
march.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland Parades Commission ruled last week that the
marchers must use another route, but the Orange Order says it is
within its civil rights to march down Garvaghy Road, a main
thoroughfare of the Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the parades commission forbade the Protestant
Unionists from marching down Garvaghy Road, a standoff lasted five
days. When police finally allowed the marchers to go down Garvaghy
Road, they beat scores of Catholic nationalists who tried to block
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what the Orange Order stands for ... they are
very similar to the Klu Klux Klan,'' Cahill said. ``They are a
supremacist organization. This march is about dominance over
another group. That's why it's so offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalan said he hopes the presence of PeaceWatch Ireland, along
with hundreds of other witnesses from around the world, will help
keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world will be watching this particular march,'' he
said. ``Whatever happens is going to have a significant impact on
the peace process in Northern Ireland.''

FACE LIFT WON'T ALTER TRADITION AT CASA MANANA
</HEADLINE>
 MANANA-OVERHAUL-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PERRY STEWART 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The musicals will still go round and round
at Casa Manana, even after the domed theater undergoes a major
renovation _ the first in its 40-year history _ with money raised
in a $5 million campaign that stands at $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Denton Yockey, in his first season as executive producer,
suggested this year that the theater explore changing Casa from a
theater-in-the-round format to a proscenium, or modified thrust,
stage. In May, the Casa board voted 19-16 to keep Casa Manana in
the round but to improve sight lines and add a revolving stage.
</P>
<P>
   Those enhancements will be part of an estimated $4.6 million
spruce-up that includes all-new seats, more restrooms and
concessions, and more classrooms for Casa Manana Children's
Playhouse and School. Any money left over from the $5 million will
be put into an endowment fund for maintaining the building.
</P>
<P>
   When the changes are completed, Casa will seat 1,500 instead of
the current 1,800. If the modified-thrust plan had been adopted,
the capacity would have been 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   The work won't begin until most of the money is raised. Yockey
and his board would like to begin the renovation at the end of a
summer, stage winter shows in the new Bass performance hall in
downtown Fort Worth, and reopen the domed theater the following
summer. Casa's $5 million capital campaign started in February
1996, but for a time, it took a back seat to the Bass hall's
money-raising effort.
</P>
<P>
   With theater-in-the-round, the audience surrounds the stage.
This heightens intimacy, but it limits the use of scenery and all
but rules out the lavish spectacles that are the current rage. In
proscenium-style theaters, such as the Bass hall, the audience is
seated in front of the stage and never sees what happens on either
side of or in back of the performance space. This enables elaborate
changes of scenery. Proscenium-style theaters typically have
overhead ``fly space'' with which to introduce large set pieces and
concoct special effects, such as the famous crashing chandelier in
``The Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether or not to get rid of theater-in-the-round
at Casa Manana has been the topic of quietly intense speculation
within the Fort Worth theater community for several weeks. There
were no apparent heated confrontations between the factions,
although some longtime theatergoers believed that Yockey, the new
guy in town, was reaching too high too soon.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Yockey is straining mightily to be a cheerleader
for Casa Manana-in-the-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is torn up about this,'' he said. ``It was something we
wanted to explore. The debate, I think, was instructive and
positive for the board. It gave them a real issue. We're not
staying theater-in-the-round because we just happen to. We voted to
do it. We endorsed theater-in-the-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a choice. I'm delighted with the changes we've added,
and I think we'll continue to do great theater here. The seat
reduction is not going to harm us. We're not using most of those
seats now. My efforts were always about improving the quality of
the experience as opposed to trying to maximize seating capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Casa Manana will continue to produce summer musicals on its home
stage at University Drive and West Lancaster in the Fort Worth
Cultural District. But the number of shows per season may vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already muted slightly, in that our winter season is
moving to the Bass hall,'' Yockey said. ``In the summers we may
decide to have more musicals, or fewer. And we'll probably present
more concerts in the home theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Clifton, Casa's vice president of development, is one of
the board members who favored the modified thrust stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the limitations of theater-in-the-round,'' Clifton
said. ``And we felt that as custodians of the institution and as
custodians of the funds being raised, we had an obligation not to
reject change out of hand just because it was a departure from
tradition. There was an interest in knowing we were exploring all
feasible and reasonable possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifton agrees that having to decide between two stage designs
has been a healthy experience for board members, forcing them to
inform themselves about the theater's options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to explore what would deliver the best patron
experience from an artistic standpoint,'' he said. ``Then we
explored how to get the greatest breadth in the number of
productions that can be done. Then there was the financial issue,
the cost of putting on shows under each configuration. Then,
finally, you weigh in for the patrons who look at Casa as a Fort
Worth institution and ask how much of that is tied to it being in
the round.''
</P>
<P>
   The redesign of the seating area will enable Casa to correct
what Yockey calls ``a 40-year-old mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Dacus and James Snowden, the two Fort Worth men who had
the most to do with making Casa Manana happen back in 1958, wanted
a sharp rake, or slant, from the seats to the stage. But the city
of Fort Worth was involved in the project. And for some
incalculable reason, the bureaucrats or inspectors of the day
argued for a gentler slope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage was supposed to be at a lower level,'' Yockey said.
``The audience needed to look down at the stage, and Mel Dacus
fought for that. But the city folks apparently thought they were
the experts, and that Mel and Mr. Snowden didn't really know what
they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The stage was built low, all right. But with the mild rake that
the city insisted on, the stage wasn't fully visible. So it had to
be built up, as was the orchestra pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual pit floor is lower than the one we use. You can
just see it,'' Yockey said, pointing to a small fissure in the
wooden floor of the orchestra area.
</P>
<P>
   Dacus, an honorary board member who argued in favor of keeping
the in-the-round format, said he is pleased with the renovation
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can rebuild the interior with high-rake seats in the
back and put a revolving stage in, that would be interesting,'' he
said. ``That would preserve the round and at the same time give
some innovation.''

NORTHERN IRELAND FOES TRADE BARBS INSTEAD OF BOMBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ In another significant step in the
peace effort in this British province, Protestant and Roman
Catholic members of the Northern Ireland Assembly began Wednesday
to discuss a new political structure for the province that is
designed to give the Catholic minority more power.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong debate produced the usual attacks by each side, but
there was a generally relaxed atmosphere and several members drew
laughs and smiles with humorous zingers at opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal of the assembly is to end the sectarian
violence that has killed more than 3,200 people since 1969. Most
Protestants want the province to remain part of Britain. Most
Catholics want closer ties, or even union, with the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish Republic to the south.
</P>
<P>
   Most officials, Catholic and Protestant, said the mere existence
of the assembly raised hope for, but did not guarantee, a permanent
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The New Northern Ireland Assembly, as the 108-member body is
called, is to enact the peace settlement approved by a referendum
on May 22. Elections on June 25 produced a body designed to give
Catholics more political power despite the Protestant majority in
the province and in the assembly. To achieve this, mainstream
Protestants and Catholics are cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   In its first act, the assembly's two religious groups, Catholic
nationalists and Protestant unionists, combined to appoint a
Protestant, David Trimble, as first minister, and a Catholic,
Seamus Mallon, as deputy first minister. Mallon was an unexpected
choice for the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good day for democracy in Northern Ireland,'' said
Monica McWilliams, elected as a member of the Women's Coalition.
``For the first time ever we began to have dialogue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But enthusiasm for the historic event was tempered with
widespread fear that more violence could break out this weekend
during a Protestant Orange Order parade in a Catholic area.
</P>
<P>
   A government commission has ordered the route of the parade
changed so that it will not pass Catholic residences in the city of
Portadown, 40 miles southwest of here. Catholics resent the parade.
Angry Protestants, insisting that freedom of assembly is a basic
democratic right, are threatening to confront police. The Sunday
parade, in the suburb of Drumcree, has fomented violence by both
Protestants and Catholics for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly will have executive and legislative authority in
the province, which has been ruled directly from London since 1972.
The last, brief, attempt at a two-religion assembly collapsed after
members had fist fights in the chamber and Protestants caused civil
disorders and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The session Wednesday, in Castle Buildings in the Stormont
section of Belfast, included one scene that would have been
unthinkable a few years ago. For the first time Gerry Adams, the
president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican
Army, sat in the same negotiating room with his nemesis, the Rev.
Ian Paisley, the Protestant preacher and leader of the hard-line
Democratic Ulster Party.
</P>
<P>
   Paisley attacked Sinn Fein as cohorts of IRA terrorists. But he
referred to the Sinn Fein leader as ``Mr. Adams,'' something he has
usually avoided saying in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, too, was polite and he worked a clever political tactic
to help Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party, who was also
under attack by Paisley. When the vote for Trimble and Mallon was
taken, Sinn Fein abstained, making it difficult for Paisley to
claim that Trimble had been elected first minister with the help of
representatives of IRA terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Paisley has said he wants to thwart the work of the assembly
because it will lead to a united Ireland. During a four-hour
debate, he and his supporters repeatedly scolded Trimble for
agreeing to negotiate with Sinn Fein in the new assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In the vote, Trimble and Mallon, who is deputy leader of the
mainstream Catholic Social Democratic Labor Party, won 61 votes
among a combination of Protestants, Catholics and independents. The
no vote was 27, comprising Paisley's party and other like-minded
Protestants. No other slate was nominated. Under the rules, passage
of measures in the assembly requires a majority of both religious
factions.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Mallon, a member of the British Parliament from
the town of Newry, came as a surprise. Until noon it was expected
that John Hume, as leader of the Social Democrats, would be chosen
as deputy first minister. Hume was one of the architects of the
peace agreement that set up the new assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But Hume said he had decided to concentrate on his work as a
member of both the British Parliament and the European Parliament
in Strasbourg, France.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Paisley noted loudly that those who voted for
Trimble would be rewarded by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.
``There'll be OBEs galore,'' he said, referring to the Order of the
British Empire, an honor coveted by many Britons.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of some members seemed to improve a few days ago when
they learned that the British government had set their salaries at
about $50,000 a year, almost double the provincial average. &QL;

EDUCATION CHIEF OUT; TEACHER TEST THRESHOLD RAISED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Board of Education's acting commissioner stepped
down unexpectedly Wednesday effective immediately, leaving the
meeting room even before the board reversed itself and raised the
passing standard on Massachusetts' first teacher certification
test.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci filed a bill Wednesday
that would require all current teachers to take the certification
test.
</P>
<P>
   At the board hearing, interim Board of Education chief Frank
Haydu III walked out of the meeting, to gasps from the audience.
His departure was prompted by a discussion with board chairman John
Silber Tuesday night, he and Silber said afterward, in which Silber
made clear Haydu no longer enjoyed the support of the board. Haydu
had earlier said he would stay on until September.
</P>
<P>
   The board immediately appointed David Driscoll, longtime deputy
education commissioner and a former Melrose schools superintendent,
as interim chief. Members then resumed debate over the teacher test
grading.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 6-1, the board reversed its vote of last week and
raised the passing score on the new teacher test to the higher
standard recommended earlier by an education panel.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote affects only candidates who took the April 4
test, or who plan to take the July 11 test. Teacher candidates
taking the test in October and later had always been required to
pass at the higher standard.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the passing standard voted in Wednesday, 59 percent of
the 1,800 candidates who took the two-part, eight-hour test in
April failed, compared to 44 percent who failed under the lower
standard. The change affects 263 candidates who passed under the
lower standard, who now must retake the test.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Candidates can expect to get their scores in the mail within
the next few days, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As testing experts see it, the controversy surrounding the
teacher test and the rush by politicians to impugn the quality of
the candidates, and current teachers, is based more on political
motivation than an understanding of the details of the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Finn, executive director of the Massachusetts Association
of School Superintendents, told the board that the change in the
passing standard voted Wednesday is ``relatively minor.'' Raising
the passing score by one or two points, he said, hardly affects the
caliber of teachers who barely pass.
</P>
<P>
   On the literacy and communications test, the education panel's
higher standard, adopted Wednesday, requires that candidates get 28
out of 36 points to pass the reading section; 17 out of 23 to pass
the grammar portion, and 17 out of 24 to pass the writing
mechanics, summary, and composition section.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these standards is only one point higher than the
standards adopted last week, Finn noted, except for the writing
section, where the passing score was raised by two points.
</P>
<P>
   Educators also said references to teachers getting ``D''s or
``F''s on the exam have been incorrect, because no letter grades
are assigned.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret McKenna, president of Lesley College, who addressed the
board Wednesday, said the test is graded much like the Scholastic
Achievement Test in high school; by point, not grade.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Abigail Thernstrom said after the vote that she
will propose a measure at September's board meeting that randomly
selected Massachusetts teachers be made to take the test
anonymously, with no consequences if they fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would provide data to shape professional development
policies and give further insight into the quality of the test,''
she said. She noted that she did not know whether her proposal
would require legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote came after Cellucci, House Speaker Thomas
Finneran, and others lambasted the board's first vote lowering the
standard, saying it undermined education reform's effort to raise
standards for students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever said improving our public schools would be easy,''
Cellucci told board members before their vote Wednesday. ``We want
to make sure that when a new teacher goes into the classroom, they
are competent and capable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Cellucci's proposal to test all teachers, Beacon Hill
observers said Wednesday that with the legislative term set to
expire in a few weeks, and the likely focus on election efforts in
the fall, there appears little likelihood the bill would get
serious consideration this year.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Wednesday's vote, Thernstrom said she initially
voted in favor of lowering the passing standard ``in deference to
Frank Haydu. I had felt an obligation to work with him and be a
team player. But he is no longer commissioner and that
consideration is off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Thernstrom said, she ``never thought that the
message we delivered (with the first vote) would be heard as a
reduced commitment to high standards. It is important to deliver
more firmly'' the board's support for high standards.

BOSTON PEACE GROUP TO MONITOR IRISH MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As thousands of Protestants &UR;  &LR; threaten to defy police
and march through a Catholic ghetto in Northern Ireland's Portadown
neighborhood this Sunday, carrying lambeg drums and singing
anti-Catholic songs, a group of Bostonians will be in their midst,
monitoring the violence that's expected to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   PeaceWatch Ireland, a Boston grass-roots group, is sending a
delegation of four that includes Heeten Kalan, a South African who
lives in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Northern Ireland resonates with me,'' said
Kalan, who has toured the Belfast area five times. ``The heavy
level of security and surveillance just blew me away. It reminded
me of parts of South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fear that the march could become the first large-scale
confrontation between Irish Catholics and Protestants since a peace
agreement was approved in May.
</P>
<P>
   Kalan will arrive in Ireland this morning, along with Sean
Cahill, an Irish-American activist; Jean Riesman, a Jewish woman;
and Scott Daugherty, an Irish Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   With cameras strapped to their necks and pen and pads in their
hands, the four plan to document any violence at the Orange Order
march.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland Parades Commission ruled last week that the
marchers must use another route, but the Orange Order says it is
within its civil rights to march down Garvaghy Road, a main
thoroughfare of the Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the parades commission forbade the Protestant
Unionists from marching down Garvaghy Road, a standoff lasted five
days. When police finally allowed the marchers to go down Garvaghy
Road, they beat scores of Catholic nationalists who tried to block
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what the Orange Order stands for ... they are
very similar to the Klu Klux Klan,'' Cahill said. ``They are a
supremacist organization. This march is about dominance over
another group. That's why it's so offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalan said he hopes the presence of PeaceWatch Ireland, along
with hundreds of other witnesses from around the world, will help
keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the world will be watching this particular march,'' he
said. ``Whatever happens is going to have a significant impact on
the peace process in Northern Ireland.''

CRITICS VOICE DISPLEASURE OVER NEW PAPAL CANONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II's effort to end debate on such controversial
issues as the ordination of women through changes he made this week
in canon law, will not succeed in forcing obedience from the many
Roman Catholics alienated from the church, several theologians and
scholars interviewed said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's warning that those who dissent from church teachings
would face a ``just penalty'' unleashed widespread criticism by
theologians Wednesday, though little comment from the American
church hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretentious attempt by the present pope to stifle
conversation and dialogue,'' said Thomas Groome, professor of
theology and religious education at Boston College. ``I read the
blessed thing and without being too melodramatic, I was on the
verge of tears. It's a very sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Catholic theologians predicted the harsh tone of the papal
document would harden the views of the many American Catholics who
already consider Vatican pronouncements irrelevant to their
spiritual lives. Others said the Pope was merely making definitive
what has been Vatican teaching for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Matthew Lamb, a professor of theology at Boston College
and a prominent Catholic intellectual, said the papal decree was
necessary because too many American theologians have become
enamored with popular cultural trends, abandoning sound
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in communion with the pope and we have a tradition to
uphold,'' Lamb said. ``There has been an awful lot of dumbing down
of Catholic knowledge and tradition and and as a result we have
these sorts of problems and debates. The Holy Father is calling our
attention to what really is Catholic teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   By explicitly spelling out the penalties for any Catholic who
opposes truths the church holds to be ``definitive,'' the pope
seemed to be taking aim at liberal American Catholic theologians,
who have in recent years challenged the Vatican's authority on
doctrinal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Church observers said the Vatican seems concerned that these
professors are too heavily influencing rank-and-file Catholics, and
need to be forcefully reined in.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul said he was acting to change canon law ``to defend the
faith of the Catholic Church against the errors that arise on the
part of some faithful, especially those dedicated to the discipline
of sacred theology.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's letter discussed the church's ``profession of
faith,'' a list of basic Catholic beliefs John Paul reworked in
1989. All clergy and Catholic teachers are required to abide by
this profession. His letter then detailed the penalties for
dissenting from these articles of faith.
</P>
<P>
   What provoked the dismay of many theologians and Catholic
activists was not just the letter but an accompanying commentary by
the Vatican's chief ideological watchdog detailing examples of
articles of faith ``definitively held'' by the church and therefore
``infallibly taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those mentioned by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who heads
the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, were the church's
teachings on euthanasia, sexual relations outside marriage and the
exclusion of women from the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   Ratzinger said anyone who rejects a Catholic doctrine would ``no
longer be in full communion with the Catholic Church.'' The
punishment dissenters might face could range from warnings to
excommunication, church officials said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The Vatican would be very happy if all discussion of
anything theologically questionable would cease,'' said Carolyn
Osiek, professor of New Testament at Catholic Theological Union in
Chicago. ``In fact, that won't happen, because the job of
theologians is to keep pursuing issues and raising questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will have a chilling effect on theological
discourse throughout the Catholic world,'' said Scott Appleby,
director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism
at the University of Notre Dame. Particularly vulnerable would be
teachers at schools under direct ecclesiastical control, like
Catholic seminaries, and nuns and priests who are under the
authority of religious superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Even at powerful Roman Catholic institutions, like Notre Dame,
Boston College and Georgetown University, where professors enjoy
broad academic freedom, the papal document could be useful
ammunition to conservatives trying to weed out liberal teachers,
Appleby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been alumni, people on boards of trustees who have
been saying, `Why are we letting liberal theologians question the
teachings of the church?''' Appleby said. ``This kind of ruling
will allow those people to say, `See, we told you so,' and put
pressure on university administrators not to be supportive of
dissenting theologians.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing chasm between the Vatican and a significant number
of American Catholics undermines the church's ability to speak
effectively about social and economic issues, several theologians
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very deeply-rooted trend in the church to simply
ignore the institutional church and concentrate on one's own
community of faith, and that's unfortunate,'' said David O'Brien,
Loyola professor of Roman Catholic studies at the College of the
Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. ``The institutional church is
becoming less and less important in the lives of people, and as a
result the church is in a weaker position to carry out its mission
and address vital issues like poverty, immigration, labor rights.
People just turn their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's pronouncements also has caused bitter feelings
among some Protestants. Among the articles of faith Ratzinger cited
as being ``definitively held'' was the 1896 declaration of Pope Leo
XIII on the ``invalidity of Anglican ordinations.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Catholic church does not recognize Anglican
ordinations, Roman Catholic and Anglican leaders have made
significant progress in recent years in improving relations between
the two churches.
</P>
<P>
   R. William Franklin, dean of the divinity school at Yale
University and a key participant in Anglican-Catholic
conversations, said the Vatican decree brings the ecumenical
movement to a ``halt, because if someone else's priestly orders are
declared invalid and it's considered an infallible teaching, why
talk?''

ALLEGED LOTTERY WINNER'S QUIRKS DESCRIBED AT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Watertown widow who claims she won a $21 million
lottery jackpot often changed her mind and canceled lottery tickets
after purchasing them, another avid lottery player testified
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The witness, Donald Philippe, 41, said he saw 72-year-old
Paraskeve Kantges play the lottery hundreds of times at different
Watertown locations.
</P>
<P>
   Often, he said, he purchased lottery tickets she had rejected
and declined to pay for after ordering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always changed her mind. I'd tell the guy, `I'll take
it.''' Philippe said, referring to Kantges' rejected tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges claims she telephoned the winning Mass Millions bet to
Coolidge Provisions on Feb. 5, but store owner Nick Havan said she
called back later to cancel the bet, so he kept the winning ticket
for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges denies she canceled the bet. She has records to show she
played the same number every day for years.
</P>
<P>
   Former Massachusetts Lottery executive director Samuel M.
DePhillippo ruled in favor of Kangtes, but Havan appealed. Retired
Superior Court Judge Robert Steadman is hearing the appeal at
lottery headquarters in Brantree and will make a recommendation to
the full lottery commission.
</P>
<P>
   A third person, Sonia Bardakjian of Watertown also claims the
jackpot. Like Kantges, Bardakjian said she phoned in a bet on the
winning number to Coolidge Provisions. The lottery rejected her
claim.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Wednesday, Philippe, an MBTA bus driver who lived
in Watertown for years, described an occasion where he said Kantges
snapped a lottery ticket he had just purchased out of his hand and
claimed it was hers. ``I said, `Hey lady what are you doing with my
ticket?.' I grabbed it back from her.''

ARCHAEOLOGISTS PROTEST REPORTS ULTRA-ORTHODOX TO HEAD ISRAELI
EXCAVATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Breaking ancient clay pots and carrying protest
signs, dozens of angry archaeologists demonstrated Wednesday over
reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised an
ultra-Orthodox party effective control over the country's
excavations.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeology has been at the center of debate in Israel for years
with the ultra-Orthodox vehemently _ and sometimes violently _
opposed to excavations in which they believe Jewish graves have
been found.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the demonstrators are employees of the Israel
Antiquities Authority. One protester shouted over a loudspeaker:
``We do this to show how we feel about the agreement between Bibi
and the Haredim,'' using Netanyahu's nickname and the Hebrew term
for the ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an agreement is ... anti-democratic,'' said Emanuel
Zissman, a Knesset member from the centrist Third Way party who
opposes any deal that would give Israel's ultra-Orthodox a say in
scientific digs. He was one of several parliament members and
public figures gathered at the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The antiquities authority workers said the march from the
Supreme Court to the Knesset was in response to local press reports
concerning a deal with the United Torah Judaism Party, part of
Netanyahu's coalition. One report said Netanyahuy would replace the
current antiquities authority director general with one more
sympathetic to their sensitivities. A spokesman for the prime
minister's office would not comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists said they feared that the move would likely halt
excavations of graves immediately and could eventually hamper digs
throughout a country in which archaeologists have uncovered
evidence corroborating the Bible and shed light on such esoteric
sects as the Essenes, to which many scholars believe John the
Baptist belonged.
</P>
<P>
   With 18,000 digs, Israel has more excavations than any other
country.
</P>
<P>
   Three millennia of Jewish, Christian and Muslim history are
buried beneath the deserts and valleys here. Findings provide a
greater understanding of the history of the Near East, are often
used in textbooks all over the world, and are the subject of
intense debate within the world of archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Step by step, the ultra-Orthodox will try to stop the
archaeological research in the country,'' said Giora Parnos, an
archaeologist with the antiquities authority who works on general
digs. ``They'll try to stop everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Orthodox rabbis have ruled that excavating graves does not
contravene Jewish law. Ultra-Orthodox rabbis contend that the
excavations do, viewing graves as sacred sites that should remain
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that just as you wouldn't want me to dig up your
grandfather, we don't want you to dig up our grandfathers,'' said
Aren Maeir, an archaeologist who is also Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   But in a country with 3,000 years of human history, coming
across a grave site during a routine ``salvage dig'' _ required by
Israeli law before construction is permitted _ is common.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, ultra-Orthodox, particularly from an
extremist sect called Atra Kadisha, descend on the site, where they
fling themselves into graves to prevent their excavation, throw
stones, call the archaeologists ``Nazis'' and recite the pulsa
dinura, a curse that supposedly brings death to the person named.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do this all the time, every day,'' said Osnat Goaz, an
archaeologist with the antiquities authority. ``A normal day for us
is like that. If there isn't a demonstration, I say, `Wow, a really
nice day.' It's part of our lives here.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Amir Drori, general director of the
antiquities authority, has been the focus of particular wrath from
ultra-Orthodox groups. Local press reports said members of the UTJ,
an Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox party with four seats in the 120-member
Knesset, threatened to quit Netanyahu's coalition if he did not
replace Drori with someone more amenable to them.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Radio said Netanyahu likely would appoint Tiberias mayor
Yossi Peretz to the job. Some archaeologists said they feared that
Peretz would bring new members to the Archaeological Council, a
body of the antiquities authority, who would see to it that graves
were not excavated. Peretz withheld comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this will happen, it will stop the excavation of ancient
tombs,'' said Motti Aviam, another archaeologist with the
antiquities authority. ``Later they will stop most of the
archaeology in Israel, and this is what we are afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   Antiquities authority personnel said that if the deal with the
ultra-Orthodox went through, they would fight it at a Knesset
hearing next week and may take the case to the Supreme Court on
grounds that Netanyahu was infringing on scientific freedom by
granting religious oversight to archaeological excavations.

CHINA POLLUTION PROBLEM AMONG WORLD'S WORST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Communist China's founder Mao Zedong once gazed from
the top of Tiananmen Gate and famously declared that the next time,
he wanted to see smokestacks filling the landscape behind the
historic square.
</P>
<P>
   Mao almost got his wish. Not far away is a sprawling complex of
168 hulking steel and iron mills _ almost a city unto itself. The
countless smokestacks spew black soot, causing stinky air, grey
skies and chronic ailments for many of Beijing's 12 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Shougang Iron and Steel Works emits half the air pollution in
Beijing, according to some environmentalists. But it is just one of
1,000 factories in the city, and one among several reasons Beijing
is the most polluted city in China and _ at times _ the dirtiest
capital in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when President Clinton highlights China's environmental
challenges Thursday, he will be cruising the Li River in Guilin,
enjoying the sparkling postcard setting immortalized by countless
poets, and praising officials for cleaning up a waterway that 20
years ago was a murky mess.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Guilin is the exception. For a more telling view
of the monumental task facing a vast nation that is both
industrializing and polluting at record speed, Clinton need have
gone no further than Shougang.
</P>
<P>
   China faces a dilemma shared by all developing nations: how to
expand the economy and raise incomes rapidly while protecting the
environment. But as the most populous nation, one of the fastest
developing, and one saddled with old, polluting technology, how
China balances its need to develop with the pressure to do it
cleanly will have implications for the global environment.
</P>
<P>
   From the ozone layer to global warming, from acid rain to
species extinction, China's choices will affect the world. For its
own citizens, the costs are even more immediate _ dirty air and
unsafe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Economic reform ``has meant everyone wants to get rich as quick
as possible, so the environment is degrading very quickly,'' said
Liang Congjie, president of Friends of Nature, a Chinese
non-governmental organization, and one of a handful of &UR;  &LR; people
Clinton will meet Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese people have a right to a better life,'' Liang added,
``but that also means preserving resources and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, China's top leaders seem to recognize the dangers
of unchecked development. Two years ago, then-Premier Li Peng
berated local officials who weren't enforcing environmental laws,
and the central government pledged to invest $54 billion in the
environment by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But that sentiment has not uniformly trickled down. Beijing,
which has one-tenth of the cars of Los Angeles but suffers almost
equal auto emissions, banned leaded gasoline Jan. 1, and ordered
that new cars be fitted with catalytic converters starting next
year. But many local officials feel more pressure to meet
industrial targets than to protect the environment. Others have
levied fines on polluters, but never spent the money to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   One of new Premier Zhu Rongji's first acts this year was to
elevate the National Environmental Protection Agency to ministry
level, giving it more power to enforce regulations. But closing
dirty plants means laying off workers and losing taxes, something
local officials are reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   China has five of the 10 dirtiest cities in the world. Factory
waste and untreated sewage have contaminated all of China's
freshwater lakes and most of its big rivers. Chemicals are seeping
into groundwater. Farming and logging are causing erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in China's cities.
Indoor coal-burning for cooking and heat in rural areas causes
111,000 premature deaths a year, according to a World Bank study.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of urban rivers do not meet the lowest standards for
irrigation, endangering drinking water. Acid rain threatens 10
percent of land area. And children in major cities have lead in
their blood 80 percent higher than levels dangerous for mental
development, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is stark between most of the country and Guilin,
where riverside factories were shut and trees replanted to protect
a famous landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guilin is probably the last place in China (Clinton) will see
environmental problems,'' said Grace Ge Gabriel, Beijing
representative for the Yarmouth Port, Mass.-based International
Fund for Animal Welfare. ``Even the moat around Beijing's Forbidden
City is polluted with waste water and dump sites. People used to
swim and fish in there. Now there's no fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for most people here, the connection between
environmental damage and daily life is not always clear.
</P>
<P>
   Wei Feng, a 20-year-old street hawker, has trouble breathing
because of the soot, but adds nonchalantly, ``I'm young, so it
still doesn't show.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents agree that despite discomfort, they don't want
Shougang shut down. ``People in this whole district have health
problems,'' acknowledged a 48-year-old steel worker named Zhao.
``But it's better to move it far away. Closing it is impossible.
Too many of us depend on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In China's nascent, but active environmental movement, numerous
efforts are underway to educate people.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Nature started a campaign to bring one's own
chopsticks to restaurants to avoid killing trees. Global Village of
Beijing produces educational books and television, and has started
recycling in pilot neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the 1950s to the 70s, almost everything was recycled in
China because people were so poor. But when people got money, they
followed industrialized world habits of using things once,'' said
Sheri Xiaoyi Liao, president of Global Village of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Another NGO, the Foundation of Civilizational Development,
started a project to rebuild all 6,800 public toilets in Beijing.
Most are appallingly substandard, contributing to air and water
pollution. Two-fifths of Beijing's residents do not have a toilet
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toilets may not be the worst polluter in Beijing, but they are
closest to people's lives,'' said Lou Xiaoqi, secretary-general of
the foundation. ``All pollution comes from a lack of consciousness.
When Mao saw smokestacks as progress, he didn't realize they caused
so many problems.''

CRITICS VOICE DISPLEASURE OVER NEW PAPAL CANONS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II's effort to end debate on such controversial
issues as the ordination of women through changes he made this week
in canon law, will not succeed in forcing obedience from the many
Roman Catholics alienated from the church, several theologians and
scholars interviewed said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's warning that those who dissent from church teachings
would face a ``just penalty'' unleashed widespread criticism by
theologians Wednesday, though little comment from the American
church hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretentious attempt by the present pope to stifle
conversation and dialogue,'' said Thomas Groome, professor of
theology and religious education at Boston College. ``I read the
blessed thing and without being too melodramatic, I was on the
verge of tears. It's a very sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Catholic theologians predicted the harsh tone of the papal
document would harden the views of the many American Catholics who
already consider Vatican pronouncements irrelevant to their
spiritual lives. Others said the Pope was merely making definitive
what has been Vatican teaching for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Matthew Lamb, a professor of theology at Boston College
and a prominent Catholic intellectual, said the papal decree was
necessary because too many American theologians have become
enamored with popular cultural trends, abandoning sound
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in communion with the pope and we have a tradition to
uphold,'' Lamb said. ``There has been an awful lot of dumbing down
of Catholic knowledge and tradition and and as a result we have
these sorts of problems and debates. The Holy Father is calling our
attention to what really is Catholic teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   By explicitly spelling out the penalties for any Catholic who
opposes truths the church holds to be ``definitive,'' the pope
seemed to be taking aim at liberal American Catholic theologians,
who have in recent years challenged the Vatican's authority on
doctrinal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Church observers said the Vatican seems concerned that these
professors are too heavily influencing rank-and-file Catholics, and
need to be forcefully reined in.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul said he was acting to change canon law ``to defend the
faith of the Catholic Church against the errors that arise on the
part of some faithful, especially those dedicated to the discipline
of sacred theology.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's letter discussed the church's ``profession of
faith,'' a list of basic Catholic beliefs John Paul reworked in
1989. All clergy and Catholic teachers are required to abide by
this profession. His letter then detailed the penalties for
dissenting from these articles of faith.
</P>
<P>
   What provoked the dismay of many theologians and Catholic
activists was not just the letter but an accompanying commentary by
the Vatican's chief ideological watchdog detailing examples of
articles of faith ``definitively held'' by the church and therefore
``infallibly taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those mentioned by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who heads
the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, were the church's
teachings on euthanasia, sexual relations outside marriage and the
exclusion of women from the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   Ratzinger said anyone who rejects a Catholic doctrine would ``no
longer be in full communion with the Catholic Church.'' The
punishment dissenters might face could range from warnings to
excommunication, church officials said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The Vatican would be very happy if all discussion of
anything theologically questionable would cease,'' said Carolyn
Osiek, professor of New Testament at Catholic Theological Union in
Chicago. ``In fact, that won't happen, because the job of
theologians is to keep pursuing issues and raising questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will have a chilling effect on theological
discourse throughout the Catholic world,'' said Scott Appleby,
director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism
at the University of Notre Dame. Particularly vulnerable would be
teachers at schools under direct ecclesiastical control, like
Catholic seminaries, and nuns and priests who are under the
authority of religious superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Even at powerful Roman Catholic institutions, like Notre Dame,
Boston College and Georgetown University, where professors enjoy
broad academic freedom, the papal document could be useful
ammunition to conservatives trying to weed out liberal teachers,
Appleby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been alumni, people on boards of trustees who have
been saying, `Why are we letting liberal theologians question the
teachings of the church?''' Appleby said. ``This kind of ruling
will allow those people to say, `See, we told you so,' and put
pressure on university administrators not to be supportive of
dissenting theologians.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing chasm between the Vatican and a significant number
of American Catholics undermines the church's ability to speak
effectively about social and economic issues, several theologians
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very deeply-rooted trend in the church to simply
ignore the institutional church and concentrate on one's own
community of faith, and that's unfortunate,'' said David O'Brien,
Loyola professor of Roman Catholic studies at the College of the
Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. ``The institutional church is
becoming less and less important in the lives of people, and as a
result the church is in a weaker position to carry out its mission
and address vital issues like poverty, immigration, labor rights.
People just turn their backs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's pronouncements also has caused bitter feelings
among some Protestants. Among the articles of faith Ratzinger cited
as being ``definitively held'' was the 1896 declaration of Pope Leo
XIII on the ``invalidity of Anglican ordinations.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Catholic church does not recognize Anglican
ordinations, Roman Catholic and Anglican leaders have made
significant progress in recent years in improving relations between
the two churches.
</P>
<P>
   R. William Franklin, dean of the divinity school at Yale
University and a key participant in Anglican-Catholic
conversations, said the Vatican decree brings the ecumenical
movement to a ``halt, because if someone else's priestly orders are
declared invalid and it's considered an infallible teaching, why
talk?''

 &HT;    Medirisk stock tumbles 69% on earnings report
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Shares of Atlanta-based Medirisk plunged 69 percent
Wednesday after the health-care software company said
second-quarter earnings would fall far short of analyst estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Medirisk made the earnings announcement after the market closed
Tuesday. The stock price then tumbled Wednesday from $20.25 to a
52-week low of $4.87 1/2 before closing at $6.31 1/4, down $13.93
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   It was the leading percentage decliner on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was 6.9 million shares, vs. a daily average of
about 117,000 shares. Also Wednesday, two analysts sharply
downgraded Medirisk stock.
</P>
<P>
   Medirisk declined to comment on the sell-off, saying, ``It's the
company's policy not to comment on market activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock decline caused Medirisk to lose about $100 million in
market value. ``It's a shock,'' Jim Oberweis, a portfolio manager
at Oberweis Asset Management, which owns Medirisk shares, told
Bloomberg Business News. ``It just adds a whole lot of uncertainty
to the equation.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was expected to earn 12 cents a share in the second
quarter, according to analysts surveyed by I/B/E/S. But Medirisk,
which went public last year, said earnings per share, excluding
one-time charges, are expected to be in the range of break-even to
2 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Medirisk said second-quarter revenues are expected to be from
$5.1 million to $5.3 million. In the year-ago quarter, the company
reported revenues of $3.2 million, and adjusted earnings per share
of 7 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the earnings disappointment Tuesday, Mark Kaiser,
Medirisk chairman and chief executive, cited weak sales in its
financial software. Those products include one that tracks
physician charges and reimbursements for 7,400 medical procedures
across dozens of geographic markets.
</P>
<P>
   Other Medirisk software reports patient satisfaction with
managed-care plans, forecasts medical utilization patterns, and
measures outcomes of procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Among Medirisk's clients are employers, hospitals, doctors, and
managed-care companies, which seek data on the cost and results of
physician procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser also said sales lagged in its software that verifies
physician credentials to hospitals and managed-care companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Medirisk also announced Tuesday it acquired a physician
credentialing company, Sweetwater Health Enterprises, for $6.2
million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking action to change sales management, implement new
product distribution channels and introduce new product
enhancements,'' Kaiser said in a statement. But he added, ``The
softness in these (sales) areas is expected to carry over into the
second half of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Medirisk declined to comment further on the sales shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Seth Frank at SunTrust Equitable Securities changed
Medirisk to ``no opinion'' from a ``strong buy'' rating. Robert
Bolen of J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co., who also rated Medirisk a strong buy,
suspended it from coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Medirisk, which employs about 400, expects to announce the
earnings results during the week of July 13. It also announced its
line of credit with NationsBank has increased to $25 million from
$10 million.

FOR BRAZIL, IT ALL DEPENDS ON DUNGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Only four Brazilians have captained a World Cup
championship team. And only one has a chance to do it twice.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Caetano Bledhorn Verri _ ``Carlos'' to his teammates,
``Dunga'' to the outside world _ has announced his intentions to
become the first repeat captain through his vociferousness as
Brazil has qualified for a quarterfinal match against Denmark in
Nantes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dunga has been the most demonstrative of the Brazilians,
reprimanding teammates and even coach Mario Zagallo, in an attempt
to galvanize what Pele described as the best group of players in
the World Cup, but not necessarily the best team.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ronaldinho is more prominent, Leonardo more flashy,
Junior Baiano more powerful, Cafu and Roberto Carlos much faster,
if Brazil becomes ``pentacampeon,'' the symbol of success might
well be Dunga.
</P>
<P>
   Others have stereotypical Brazilian qualities. Dunga adds a
sense of purpose and guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Dunga has changed little since the 1990 World Cup in Italy,
except that his light, flowing hair has been cropped in a
Marine-style crew cut. Then, Brazil played conservatively and was
eliminated by Argentina. Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni and Dunga
received most of the blame for removing the fantasy from the
Selecao.
</P>
<P>
   But perceptions of Dunga have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dunga was like a European player, strong but not very
technical,'' Luis Agosto Veloso, former president of CR Flamengo,
said Wednesday from training camp in Ozoir La Ferriere. ``It took
some time for him to earn the respect of Brazilians. Now in Brazil
they are convinced he is necessary in the team as a leader, a point
of reference.''
</P>
<P>
   So, are the days of jogo bonito (the beautiful game) finished?
Is Brazil sacrificing samba for cynicism?
</P>
<P>
   ``The people always want a spectacle,'' Dunga said at the
beginning of the World Cup finals. ``But soccer is not only
fantasy. If it was so, Brazil would not have gone 24 years without
winning a World Cup. Looking back, the best team always prevails,
and the best team is that which is most complete at every level _
technique, but also the best tactically and organizationally,
because in soccer everyone has to help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Brazilian team to win the World Cup, in 1958, was
known for the creativity and dynamism of Didi, Garrincha, and Pele,
but it also had complementary players such as Zito and the captain,
Bellini.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zito was probably more technical than Dunga, but he was
strong, too,'' Veloso said. ``Dunga is the Brazilian player of the
'90s, the type of player who is very necessary the way soccer is
now played. You need one or two like him in the midfield. He is
like Paul Ince with England. They are especially important for
their mentality and personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunga, 34, has announced he will retire from international
soccer after the World Cup. He was courted last year by the New
England Revolution, but has now signed a contract with Jubilo Iwata
in Japan through 2000. Major League Soccer and the Revolution
likely did not pursue Dunga this year because they consider him too
old, as did most Italian teams when he went to VfB Stuttgart in
Germany in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Dunga was 22 when he arrived at Pisa and soon became a teammate
of Roberto Baggio at Fiorentina. He might have had a more
successful career in Italy had not Count Flavio Pontello, the
Fiorentina president, sold Baggio to Juventus. Then, Juventus also
tried to acquire Dunga, but the fans' revolt over the Baggio affair
made such a proposition not only impossible, but life-endangering.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorentina struggled without Baggio, and the directors proposed
that Dunga become captain, as well as management's representative
in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Dunga refused, saying ``I am a player, not a spy.'' He was soon
gone. But Dunga left a strong impression, especially for his
intensity, illustrated by a confrontation with former teammate
Stefano Carobbi.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Milan sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport
published a picture of a wild-eyed, long-haired Dunga grabbing
Carobbi's shirt during a 1989 game, the caption noting that Carobbi
appeared on the verge of tears.
</P>
<P>
   Dunga followers were not surprised when he made a similar
reprimand to Bebeto during Brazil's 3-0 first-round victory over
Morocco in Nantes. Then, Dunga had appeared to be overreacting
during an easy win, showing up a respected, even-tempered
34-year-old Bebeto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was exaggerating his actions,'' Veloso said. ``He
was very different when Brazil lost to Norway in the next game, and
his teammates called for him to take charge again. They know his
personality is necessary for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunga has recently been inspired by a comment by former Chicago
Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who noted that among Michael Jordan's
qualities is that he improves the performance of less prominent
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another example is Maradona in the 1986 World Cup,'' Dunga
said, ``when Argentina won without any famous names. Because a
champion must not content himself to receive from God the gift of
class; he must put that together with humility and intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The multi-lingual Dunga has become a reluctant favorite of
interviewers at Brazil's training camp on the outskirts of Paris.
Though Dunga's tacit nature reflects his origins in the
traditionally industrial Porto Alegre region, he bonded easily with
the outgoing Romario, who was raised in the poverty of Rio de
Janeiro's favelas.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the start of the finals, Romario was dropped by
Zagallo and assistant coach Zico (who hired bodyguards for his
family in Rio after being threatened by Romario supporters),
leaving only Aldair, Bebeto, Dunga, and Taffarel as full-time
starters from the USA '94 championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Dunga disputed the decision, both privately and in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dunga is from the south of Brazil, so he has a European
background,'' Veloso said. ``His personality is not as simpatico as
people from other places in Brazil, but he is a very good person
with a lot of character, and he actually is very simpatico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Romario seem like opposites, but the differences made
them close. They were roommates on the national team and they
understand each other very well. Dunga tried to convince them to
keep Romario because he thought his experience and mentality were
very important to Brazil winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dunga is the leader of this team, the coach on the field.
Everything depends on Dunga. He is very motivated because this is
the last international tournament for him.''

CAREY HEADED FOR BRUINS TRAINING CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deadline came and went without the Bruins taking any action
to buy out the remaining two years of goaltender Jim Carey's
contract. Barring a trade, Carey is expected to be in Boston's
training camp this fall in order to fight for a job with No. 1
Byron Dafoe and backup Rob Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   It would have cost the Bruins $2.33 million to buy out the pact
that is due to expire at the end of the 1999-2000 season, which
would have saved them $2.67 million.
</P>
<P>
   President/general manager Harry Sinden and assistant GM Mike
O'Connell mulled their options as late as Wednesday morning before
deciding to retain Carey's services. Carey, obtained in a trade
from the Washington Capitals on March 1, 1997, along with center
Jason Allison and right wing Anson Carter, came into a tough
situation here during a season when the Bruins were on the way to
finishing dead last in the NHL standings.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, with new coach Pat Burns at the helm, Carey struggled
with illness and ineffectiveness (3-2-1, 2.90 goals &QL; 
against average in 10 appearances) before being placed on waivers.
He played with the AHL's Providence Bruins (2-7-1, 3.91 GAA) before
undergoing season-ending shoulder surgery in January. Carey said
recently that he is feeling very strong, the shoulder is 100
percent, and he is looking forward to getting back to the form that
won him the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goalie in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Bruins were hoping for when they made the
decision to hang on to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to three things really,'' said O'Connell. ``No.
1, we were not ready to give up on him yet. Then there were the
money issues and No. 3, there's an expansion draft again next year.
But if he can come back and regain the form that he had, then we'd
have the luxury (of goaltending depth) that a lot of teams don't
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Adam Oates is the only player in the deal still with
Washington. Rick Tocchet opted not to re-sign with the Capitals in
the summer of 1997, going to Phoenix instead, and goalie Bill
Ranford was traded to Tampa Bay at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' options with regard to Carey were few. He was coming
off a poor season, and this is a remarkable summer for top-flight
goaltenders who are unrestricted free agents. Mike Richter, said to
be seeking $7 million, is likely to leave the Rangers. John
Vanbiesbrouck, reportedly seeking more than $5 million a season,
likely won't be back with Florida, and Curtis Joseph, who is
reportedly asking for $6 million a year, is too pricey for
Edmonton.

 &HT;    Mercedes plant busy renovating
 &HT;    By Karl Ritzler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The summer shutdown at the Mercedes-Benz plant in
Vance, Ala., is hardly a time of inactivity. The German automaker
is expanding and overhauling the plant to boost capacity and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz, parent of Mercedes-Benz, is spending $40 million
to add 100,000 square feet to the plant and to install painting and
welding robots. Although the robots will increase automation in
some jobs, about 100 employees will be hired to the two shifts per
day to produce more vehicles and help reduce overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The company wants to increase production of its popular M-Class
sport-utility vehicles to 80,000 units next year from 65,000 this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes estimates demand for the M-Class next year at more than
100,000 units. Spokesman Trevor C. Hale said buyers in some markets
must wait up to a year for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the most ergonomically unfriendly jobs and giving
them to a machine or an assist device vs. having people perform the
tasks,'' said Andreas Renschler, president and CEO of Mercedes-Benz
U.S. International. ``Our investment in plant expansion, new
equipment and additional jobs will help the line run more
efficiently, and offer some relief to our team members who have
been putting in extra hours to help meet the high demand for the
M-Class.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, construction crews are opening the walls between
previously built areas and the factory, installing robots and
arranging logistics bays. The bays are used to organize incoming
parts to meet the assembly lines' need for subsystems on a
just-in-time and in-sequence basis.
</P>
<P>
   The factory builds the V-6-powered ML320 sport-utility vehicle
for North American and overseas customers and the four-cylinder
ML230 for export to Europe. In July, the plant will begin building
the V-8-powered ML430.

EX-JUDGE'S PLEA PROMPTS CONCERN IN TEXAS COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ With a former state judge admitting that he once
bribed a prosecutor to fix the outcome of several drug cases, the
district attorney here said he advised his staff to consider hiring
lawyers as a sweeping federal investigation into corruption
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Garcia, a former state district judge in this border city,
pleaded guilty Tuesday to bribery as part of a deal that requires
him to tell federal prosecutors all he knows about the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not privy to what the federal government has,'' Webb
County District Attorney Joe Rubio said. ``I did tell everyone
yesterday that if they felt they had exposure (to criminal
charges), they needed to consult with an attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse in Victoria, Garcia admitted that
while working as a defense attorney, he paid at least $10,000 to an
unnamed assistant attorney in Rubio's office to fix the outcome of
several cases.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his plea-bargain deal, Garcia agreed to testify in
open court and before grand juries as a government witness.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents in late May raided Rubio's office as well as
several other locations, including the homes and residences of a
bail bondsman and a justice of the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Using a moving truck, agents carted more than 5,000 criminal
case files, checkbooks and calendars from Rubio's office.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the parties who have been questioned or searched in
the investigation questioned the tactics the government used to get
Garcia to accept a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked to hear the judge agreed to make a deal with the
government,'' said Fausto Sosa, a former county prosecutor who is
representing one possible defendant in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought these allegations transpired. I don't know how
much pressure they put on him. It seems like a sweetheart deal,''
Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, 64, faces up to 20 years in prison, but could get off
with as little as parole depending on how much he cooperates with
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant district attorney with whom Garcia made a deal has
not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   A federal search warrant indicates authorities were especially
interested in the activities of Rubio and eight people who work in
his office, including investigators and assistant prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, no one had resigned, been fired or re-assigned
as a result of the probe, Rubio said. He said Garcia's admission
wasn't evidence of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But federal authorities have said the investigation continues
and court documents indicate the case involves not only informants
and witnesses, but secretly-recorded phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Castaneda, a Laredo bail bondsman whose office and home
were searched by federal agents, said he believed Garcia was scared
he would die in prison if he didn't accept the plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is like the last of the Mohicans _ retired, in bad
health and feeling distressed,'' Castaneda said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's attorney, James Stafford, could not be reached for
comment Wednesday.

MARTIN TO MAKE PGA DEBUT IN GREATER HARTFORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ Casey Martin will make his PGA Tour debut in
Thurday's opening round of the Greater Hartford Open at the TPC at
River Highlands and will play in next week's Quad Cities Open. The
next decision he may have to make is whether to tee it up at the
CVS Charity Classic at Pleasant Valley July 23-26. ``If I don't
make a heap of money the next two weeks,'' said Martin Wednesday,
``chances are I will not.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin earned $34,043 when he finished tied for 23d at the US
Open at The Olympic Club two weeks ago, putting him at 176 on the
Tour money list. If he can earn as much as the 150th player last
year (Brian Claar, $121,273), he will be entitled to unlimited
exemptions the rest of the year. And if he finishes the year in the
Tour's 150 money leaders, he will earn an exemption to play on the
Tour next year.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was born with a circulation problem in his right
leg, went to court in Eugene, Ore., and was granted an injunction
to permit him to ride in a cart on the Nike Tour. He qualified in a
playoff to reach the US Open and he is exercising the first of his
sponsor's exemptions to play this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good finish at the US Open and feel I played
solidly,'' said Martin. ``I'm looking forward to playing this golf
course. I love it. It feel like it suits my game. It's pretty long,
and the fairways aren't really narrow. I'm not really worried about
proving anything, but I do want to do well. I know there are big
crowds and a lot of people will be watching. I'd love to play well
for a lot of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin spent last week in Disneyland with his his wife,
daughter, and brother. Recognition came in droves. ``When I made
the US Open, they couldn't go,'' said Martin. ``There were a few of
the Disneyland characters who came up to me, and it was kind of an
awkward appearance. I met Tigger and Mary Poppins. Just pointing at
me, swinging a club and my brother said, `You know you're somebody
when the Disneyland characters recognize you.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is no avoiding the recognition, especially when you make
your Tour debut in a cart. ``I'd love to just curtail this and go
play golf,'' said Martin. ``I understand why it's going to happen.
I expect the media attention. Ideally, this will fade, and I'm sure
it will. I knew it would be a topic at some level, but I never
anticipated it would be such a big topic and it still is. It's
surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   There were negative comments from some of the game's biggest
names about his use of a cart. It hasn't carried over to the locker
room. ``Personally, I've had no problem,'' said Martin. ``It's been
great. I've been treated very well.'' Part of the reason Martin
accepted this sponsor's exemption instead of earlier ones is
Hartford Life is involved in the GHO and is one of Martin's
financial backers. ``I've said all along,'' he said, ``I would take
one or two (exemptions). I decided this is the best week for me. I
was just going to take one, but I figured on my way back to
California I might as well stop in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who has Klippel-Trenauney-Weber syndrome, feels like he
has been given a new life in the game because without a cart he
couldn't play competitive golf. ``I'm just grateful I'm riding,''
he said. ``It's always been a problem. I've had it since birth. I
was very close to stop playing because of my leg. It was getting
worse, but since I've been riding it's getting better. It's
uncomfortable in the humidity because of the sock I have to wear on
my leg. But I can't say there's any more pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin can acquire a PGA Tour card by finishing in the top 15 on
the Nike Tour, but he has slipped out of the list. Now it's crunch
time in these two weeks on the PGA Tour. ``I would have to play
extremely well the next two weeks,'' Martin said. ``I feel
confident if I play up to my ability I can play very well. I've
been dealing with this all year, and it's a challenge. If I finish
top 5 or top 10, I might consider (playing at Pleasant Valley).''

NUMBER OF SICK FROM TAINTED TEXAS OYSTERS APPROACHES U.S. RECORD

<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ The number of people sickened by raw
Galveston Bay oysters is fast approaching a national record, with
health officials saying Wednesday that the total had hit 187.
</P>
<P>
   That number was expected to climb Thursday and possibly eclipse
the largest outbreak on record. Last year, 208 people fell ill and
one died in the Pacific Northwest after eating raw oysters tainted
by the bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's total reflected an increase of 59 from the number of
cases that had been recorded through Tuesday in Texas and Florida,
said Kirk Wiles of the Texas Department of Health's seafood safety
division. People who eat raw oysters tainted with the bacterium
typically suffer diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, fever,
vomiting and headache, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 151 cases in Texas and 36 in Florida,'' Wiles said.
``We expect the number to go higher. I know they're still following
up on additional (reports of) illnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Galveston Bay oyster wholesalers last week recalled suspect
oysters taken from seven of 43 beds where harvesting goes on this
time of year. On Tuesday, they launched a recall of oysters taken
since May 27 from all 43 beds.
</P>
<P>
   That move came after some of the reported illnesses were linked
to oysters taken from beds other than the first seven that were
known to have produced tainted oysters.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials urged people not to eat oysters from
Galveston Bay unless they are cooked thoroughly. There is little
risk from eating other seafood from the bay, they said, as long as
it is cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 187 cases of illness on record by Wednesday, 21 were
confirmed through examination of stool samples from the victims,
Wiles said.
</P>
<P>
   The other cases were judged to be associated with Galveston Bay
oysters by state health department epidemiologists who interview
those reporting the illnesses, Wiles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an epidemiological checklist of questions so that you
can qualify whose illness is associated with raw oysters and whose
isn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oyster wholesalers have recalled shipments from throughout
Texas, as well as from Florida, Louisiana, Colorado, New Mexico and
California.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oysters from the 43 Galveston Bay beds, and the water around
them, are being tested to try to determine why the outbreak
occurred. Until the test results are back, oystermen have
voluntarily ceased harvesting from Galveston Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Although many believe this year's early spate of hot weather and
long period of drought may have contributed to the outbreak by
increasing baywater temperatures and salinity, health officials are
not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   They note that Vibrio parahaemolyticus bacteria are constantly
present in bay waters and that heat and drought have not combined
in the past to taint oysters with sickening amounts of the germ.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   People who have suffered symptoms within a day or two of eating
raw oysters have been asked to report the illness to state
officials by calling 1-888-883-9997.

   TOKYO _ The Japanese stock market extended its rally Wednesday
for the sixth consecutive day, logging its third-largest single-day
gain this year, on expectations that the government's plan for
cleaning up the nation's bad loans would spur an economic revival.
</P>
<P>
   The yen also rose. It cost 138.28 yen to buy a dollar in Tokyo,
more expensive than the 139.16 per dollar in New York on Tuesday.
The yen rose further in New York on Wednesday to 138.07 to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is expected to disclose Thursday a plan to tackle bad bank
loans by creating new banks that will take over the business of
failed institutions so that creditworthy borrowers would not be
left in the lurch if their main bank went under.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the proposal is by no means certain. But
investors have begun to raise their hopes that it might actually
begin to reduce large amounts of the nation's bad debt, which is
estimated to be around $600 billion. The benchmark Nikkei index of
225 issues rose to 16,362.89 Wednesday, up 532.62 points, or 3.36
percent, from Tuesday's close. The index has risen 1,300 points in
the last six days, with overall volumes surging to 850 million
shares, nearly twice the usual levels.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that the government also might cut income taxes by
nearly $30 billion also bolstered investors.

FISHING BARGE IS A PIECE OF THE PAST
</HEADLINE>
 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ Several times a week, 58-year-old Mills
Mann of Fort Worth slips away from his home before dawn to travel
30 miles toward Weatherford.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the Parker County town, he disappears off
Interstate 20 and drops down among the huge oaks surrounding Lake
Weatherford. By the time the sun comes up, he is intently watching
a red and white bobber do its dance on the moss-green waters at the
Lake Weatherford Marina.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bite good here,'' Mann said. ``Bass, catfish, sometimes a
few crappie. You can catch a lot of sun perch out here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The fishing barge is something of an anachronism in today's busy
recreational scene. Mann said he doesn't know why, but a fishing
dock, or barge, is a relic to which children and old people with
cane poles are relegated.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bother Mann one bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fish here just because I like to fish,'' he said. ``I've
fished at some of the lakes around Fort Worth, and they don't bite
so good. This is about the best lake around. Everybody is real
friendly; that's why I like to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, he brings friends. Often, he brings his
wife, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves it,'' he said, breaking into a laugh. ``She loves to
talk; she don't care who it is. She talks to people like she's
known them for 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that socialization that draws Mann, he conceded. You have
to like people, and enjoy spending time with them. You can't do
that alone in a fancy boat.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly nothing fancy about Lake Weatherford Marina.
The bait and tackle shop is a single-story blue and white building
that looks as if it was built around the mid-1950s. It was.
</P>
<P>
   Fans circulate the summer heat inside, causing the foam minnow
buckets to do a constant jiggle on wires tied to the ceiling. There
are snacks at the counter, ice cream in the cooler. The shelves are
filled with necessities such as bobbers, packages of hooks and tubs
of Elvis ``D'' Catfish Bait, Liz's Best Catfish Bait, Ole Whiskers
Beef Blood Catfish Bait and Taylor Made Fish Dough for Carp.
</P>
<P>
   There are rope stringers and metal stringers. There are two
stacks of cane poles. And there are minnows. They are $1.25 a dozen
for crappie size, and 20 cents more a dozen if you want bass size.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Reynolds and Roy Walker have owned the marina for the past
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an excellent business,'' Reynolds said, sipping coffee
inside the bait shop. ``On weekends we are completely full; you
couldn't squeeze another person in the swimming area. There's a
zillion boats.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the bait shop, boat slips and ramp, the marina
has a small swimming beach.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small charge, usually $3, but if you get there before
the owners do, you deposit your money in the honor box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a pretty calm little lake compared to some of the other
lakes around Fort Worth,'' Reynolds said. ``We have people drive
all the way from Dallas to swim at our beach. It's a nice clean
beach.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a ``Thursday night workingman's fishing
tournament'' from 6 to 9:30 p.m. ``They pay $25 a team, and if we
have less than 15 boats, it's winner take all,'' Reynolds said.
``If we have more than that, we pay two places.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake Weatherford, by most standards, is a small lake, a place
where you go if you have a couple of hours to fish. If you have all
day, you go somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The boat slips at the marina are filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have a vacancy,'' Reynolds said. ``Even in the winter,
when people take their boats out of the water, we have fishermen
who rent the slips and use them as crappie holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The fishers drop bundles of Christmas trees down into the water
to draw the crappie. Some put tarps over their slips to provide
alluring shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out one morning, about 6 a.m., and I thought I wasn't
going to find a place to park,'' Reynolds remembered. ``It was 8
degrees. It was so cold you couldn't feel your hands, but the
crappie were biting, and people were all over the docks filling up
their 5-gallon buckets with fish.''
</P>
<P>
   The crappie don't bite as well in the summer, but the sand bass
run and the catfish slink around in the deeper water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of kids out here,'' Mann said, nodding toward
16-year-old Bryan Stevens, who was fishing nearby, ``but there
needs to be a bunch more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said parents ought to bring their kids out and show
them how to fish. Spend time with them. Show them just one time
what it's like, and let them get the feel of it. The kids will love
it, and it will keep them out of a lot of trouble.''

NATION'S MANUFACTURERS ARE SLOWING PRODUCTION

 &HT;    
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's manufacturers have slowed production to the lowest
rate of growth since 1995, the clearest impact so far of the Asian
crisis on the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown has become increasingly evident with each new
economic statistic in recent weeks. On Wednesday, the National
Association of Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing
activity weakened in June for a majority of the companies it
surveys each month. It was the first time in 22 months that a
majority of companies had reported weakening instead of
strengthening in their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing employment has fallen in recent months. And
industrial production has slowed sharply this year, to an annual
growth rate of less than 2 percent, down from 6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Production is slowing in large part because stockpiles of unsold
goods have surged and in part because companies are growing worried
that the economic boom cannot continue at its fervent pace of the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make goods for sale abroad have retrenched the
most. Take the Jefferson Smurfit Corp. of St. Louis, which makes
cardboard for shipping boxes. It shut a big mill in Jacksonville,
Fla., Wednesday for 40 days because of slumping exports to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But companies that do business mostly in the United States are
feeling the pressure as well. The Goodman Equipment Corp. near
Chicago says its American customers are reducing orders for the
plastic molding machines and mining equipment it makes. ``They are
more nervous about the future, and more reluctant to expand,'' said
Calvin Campbell, the company's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The production slowdown may help to explain why the Federal
Reserve chose Wednesday, at its latest policy meeting, to leave
interest rates unchanged, even though labor shortages and robust
economic growth suggested that higher rates might be needed to
prevent inflation from taking off. Concern about Asia, on the other
hand, is pushing the Fed to keep rates steady, thus supporting
Asian currencies by making investors less likely to switch into
dollars from Japanese yen or Korean won.
</P>
<P>
   The bright spot in manufacturing, which represents 30 percent of
the nation's economy, comes from consumers. They are still big
buyers, and that is strengthening those manufacturers who serve
them. Rubbermaid Inc., for example, which makes toys and plastic
garbage cans with little competition from abroad, says its output
and sales are rising at the same rate as last year.
</P>
<P>
   The strong demand among American consumers holds out the hope
that the slowdown in manufacturing, which first showed itself early
this year, will be short-lived. If it were to continue, however,
the robust growth of the American economy in the last two years
would undoubtedly disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know which way manufacturing and the economy will
go,'' said William Dudley, director of domestic economic research
at Goldman Sachs. ``The issue is how strong is the shock from Asia
versus how strong is domestic demand. Our view is that domestic
demand will win out, but the contest is under way, and we do not
have a clear winner yet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The numbers of late have not been ambiguous. The manufacturing
index compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Managers
dropped below 50, to 49.6, in June. The index has been steadily
declining since last July, when it peaked at 57.5. The 27-day
strike at General Motors was only partly reflected in the latest
figure and may add to the drag on manufacturing for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Inventories surged 40 percent in the first quarter to more than
$100 billion as companies like Jefferson Smurfit found their
exports suddenly evaporating. Eastman Chemical Co., which makes the
chemical ingredients of plastics products and fibers, responded by
trimming a few percentage points off its production. ``We never
close a plant when demand is not there; what you do is shave back
production,'' said Ernest Deavenport, Eastman's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Nervousness about the future is also a significant constraint,
particularly in recent weeks. New orders have been coming more
slowly since spring, particularly for companies like Goodman, in
Bedford Hills, Ill., that make equipment and machinery for other
manufacturers, and the Hiwasse Co. in Jacksonville, Ark., which
supplies control panels for washing machines and other appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had gone on sales calls in February and customers were
urgent in their demand for quotes from me,'' said J. Richard
Derickson, Hiwasse's chief executive. ``And then in April the
requests for quotes just dramatically fell off and they are just
beginning to pick up now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannay Reels Inc. of Westerlo, N.Y., which makes metal reels for
industrial hoses and fuel trucks, has had a similar experience.
``Our production this year is matching last year, which means it
has slowed; last year production was up 7 percent,'' said Roger
Hannay, the chief executive. ``People are putting expansion on hold
for a while, until they see what happens to the economy and the
stock market, and in the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   The weaker production is hardly uniform. General Electric and
other appliance manufacturers say production is up for them, not
down, thanks to strong consumer demand. The Boeing Co., for all its
concern about a production decline next year because of a cutback
in sales to Asia, is producing flat out this year to meet a backlog
of orders. And the nation's auto companies report that from January
through May, auto and truck production equaled the 5.2 million
vehicles made in the first five months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that its inventories had gotten too large _ given the
potential impact of the Asian crisis, Republic Engineered Steels in
Massillon, Ohio, has been selling them off since early spring,
shaving production in the process. ``We felt we had to convert
those inventories into cash,'' said Harold Kelly, Republic's
executive vice president. ``We want to be more liquid.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcapacity is also hurting select businesses. Having closed 11
factories in January, Levi Strauss says its jeans production is now
in line with sales. ``We were seeing that our market strategy could
not be based on volume,'' said Linda Butler, a Levi Strauss
spokeswoman. ``We had to emphasize innovative products, made in
smaller quantities,''
</P>
<P>
   Eastman Chemical is similarly struggling with overcapacity. The
company had exported from American plants over the last several
years while new facilities were under construction in Malaysia,
Argentina, Spain and Holland. ``Now that they are on line, we are
exporting less,'' Mr. Deavenport said. The cutback has come just as
the demand in Asia collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he said, chemical products going from Europe to Asia
``can't find a home there and they land in the United States,'' Mr.
Deavenport added. ``And an American customer says, `I am going to
buy them at a lower price,' and we lose the sale. That is happening
all the time now.''
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown in manufacturing production is helping to feed some
forecasts that economic growth in the summer and fall will slow to
an annual rate of less than 3 percent, from a very strong 5.4
percent from January through March. Even now, despite the surge in
prosperity over the past two years, annual economic growth has
averaged only 2.3 percent in the 1990's _ the slowest growth rate
of any decade since World War II.

<P>
   When: 12:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: Fox Sports South, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (11-2, 1.64; first
appearance vs. Devils Rays) vs. RHP Jason Johnson (2-5, 5.72; first
appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Maddux, gettin his final start of the first half, is
riding a nine-game win streak, the longest in the league. He has
thrown shutouts in two of his last five starts and in a June 17
complete-game victory over Florida the two runs he gave up were
unearned. Maddux beat Toronto 2-0 on an eight-hitter in his last
start. He leads the NL in ERA (1.64), wins (tied with Tom Glavine
at 11), winning percentage (.846) and shutouts (3) and is second in
innings (137 1/3). He also averages a league-low one walk per nine
innings and has allowed five earned runs in his last 40 innings.
The Devil Rays considered moving Johnson, a 6-foot-6 right-hander,
back one day and letting 10-game-winner Rolando Arrojo face Maddux
but rejected the idea Tuesday. A seventh-round expansion-draft pick
out of the Pirates organization, Johnson will be making his 13th
start and seeks to lower the .304 average he has allowed. Opponents
have 69 hits and 24 walks against him in 48 1/3 innings, and his
5.72 ERA is the highest on Tampa Bay's rotation.

 &HT;    Braves top majors with six All-Star selections
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Braves organization won't be feeling any
slights Tuesday during the 1998 All-Star Game at Coors Field in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta learned Wednesday that it will be the best-represented
team at the game with six players. Pitchers Greg Maddux and Tom
Glavine, first baseman Andres Galarraga and catcher Javier Lopez
will join shortstop Walt Weiss and third baseman Chipper Jones, who
were voted in as starters by the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``They can't blame me
now for putting all my own guys on (the team).''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux might start the game for the National League. Weiss will
be making his first All-Star appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real honor to make the team,'' Maddux said. ``It'd be
more of an honor to start it.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees, who have the best record in baseball,
don't have any starters, but they will have five players in the
game: pitcher David Wells, shortstop Derek Jeter, third baseman
Scott Brosius and outfielders Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres and Cleveland Indians also will send five
players each.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most glaring omission was Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood.
Wood's numbers are solid (7-3, 3.38 ERA), and he has become one of
the best stories in baseball this season and tied a major-league
record for strikeouts in a game with 20. Oakland outfielder Ben
Grieve will be the only rookie in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Managers Jim Leyland of Florida and Mike Hargrove of Cleveland
picked the reserves and pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Edgar Renteria was the only player selected from
Leyland's defending World Series champion Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   But Leyland selected four players from the championship team who
now will represent other clubs _ San Diego's Kevin Brown, Houston's
Moises Alou, Robb Nen of the Giants and Gary Sheffield of the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures released by the Associated Press, several
of the Braves will reap solid financial contract bonuses for being
named to the team. Galarraga, Jones and Weiss will receive $50,000,
and Lopez will earn $25,000. Glavine and Maddux had no bonus money
in their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves sent an all-time high of seven players in the 1996
game and had six last year.

 &HT;    Women's Open Notebook
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. -- Her length and strength should make her a prime
contender this week. Surely, Laura Davies is long enough to hit
irons into tight landing areas. Obviously, she's strong enough to
leave the rough at Blackwolf Run if a drive should manages to go
off line.
</P>
<P>
   It's Davies' attitude that needs to be improved entering today's
first round of the U.S. Women's Open. Four missed cuts in her last
five events have brought out the cynic in Davies' personality. On
May 28 at Rochester, she opened with an 82. She's been through more
putters than golf shirts. And when things are going poorly, nobody
is harder on Laura Davies than Laura Davies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the year has gone, I'm expecting two rounds and (to)
be on my way back to London Saturday morning,'' Davies said
Wednesday. ``I've missed six cuts this year. I'm expecting
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-longest course ever used for a U.S. Women's Open
(6,412), with five par 4s over 400 yards and several playing into
the wind, might cause Davies to play anywhere from four to eight
drivers, depending on the wind and her round situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rough is there, don't get me wrong,'' she said. ``If you
miss the fairway badly enough, you're in real trouble _ if you find
your ball. That one I missed on 16 (par, 540 yards), I nearly
stepped on to find it. (Many of) the holes aren't long enough to
warrant hitting the driver and risking it.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem, really. Davis hits her 3-iron 220 to 250 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez gets red-carpet treatment
</P>
<P>
   Albany's Nancy Lopez is not seeing Blackwolf Run for the first
time this week. She and husband Ray Knight were special guests of
owner Herbert Kohler last month, flying up from Albany, Ga., on his
private jet. They played 36 holes on the tournament course.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had sent a message through one of the ladies that if I ever
wanted to come here, he would send a plane to pick us up, so we can
get back home to see our kids,'' Lopez said. ``So, it worked out
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Appreciative of Kohler's generosity, she said, ``I love flushing
toilets this week. I mean, it is great.''
</P>
<P>
   The scouting trip to Blackwolf Run was not a total freebie.
Lopez said she brought only a dozen golf balls and by the first day
Ray had lost six by himself. With only three each for the second
day, Lopez had to make a rare purchase of a dozen balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are expensive,'' she said. ``I hadn't bought golf balls
in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb: Sorenstam should be favored
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Karrie Webb downplays the rivalry she has with
Annika Sorenstam of Sweden, but she admits, ``She is No. 1 in the
world. She deserves to be the favorite.'' . . . Designer Pete Dye
placed water on Blackwolf Run's three finishing holes. The 421-yard
18th has a flooded waste bunker on the left side and the Sheboygan
River as the hazard near the green. Fittingly, it's called the
``Dyehard'' hole. . . . Tammie Green, who is three-months pregnant
and recently married, found out she was having a baby while in
Atlanta in April during the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship that
she would be having a baby.

<P>
   HONG KONG _ When President Jiang Zemin of China leaves here on
Thursday after celebrating the first anniversary of Hong Kong's
handover, he will be the first passenger to take off from the new
$20 billion Hong Kong International Airport. Unfortunately for Hong
Kong, there will be nowhere near as many people following him as
originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   The airport, the last and grandest monument here to British
colonial rule, was pushed through at a time when Asia was riding
high. Second in cost only to Kansai International Airport in Osaka,
Japan, it also includes _ beyond its two runways and a 45-acre
terminal building that is the world's largest _ a vast network of
highways, bridges, tunnels and railways to transport people the 21
miles into town.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the airport project was the world's largest,
employing 20,000 laborers and more than half the world's dredging
fleet to create a man-made island in the waters off Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built this airport at the wrong time,'' said Jim Eckes,
an aviation consultant at Indoswiss Ltd. in Hong Kong. ``It should
have been built when Hong Kong's economy was suffering and opened
when it was strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicting economic cycles is a fool's game, of course. And in
the fullness of time, Hong Kong's airport may come to be seen as a
wise investment in the future. But for now, it is coinciding with a
bust in air travel. The number of tourists visiting Hong Kong fell
24 percent in the first quarter, and the airport seems likely to
fall far short of its capacity of 35 million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong is only one of several Asian cities that are investing
heavily in new airports. Malaysia opened its $2.5 billion Kuala
Lumpur International Airport on Tuesday. Over the next six years,
Seoul, and Guangzhou in China, plan to open huge new airports,
while Singapore, Taipei and Manila are adding terminals to their
existing airfields. Bangkok may also build a new airport.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, overall passenger traffic declined in Thailand
and Korea in 1997, while it slowed dramatically in Hong Kong and
Singapore. The International Air Transport Association, in a highly
unusual move, slashed its five-year forecast of the annual growth
in traffic for the region to 3.7 percent from 7.7 percent. As with
so many other industries here, Asia's airports are entering an era
of potentially severe overcapacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really couldn't be happening at a worse time, but that's
the breaks,'' said Tony Tyler, director of corporate development at
Cathay Pacific Airlines, the flagship carrier at Hong Kong's
airport, which has invested $1 billion in a new headquarters, staff
hotel and flight-training center.
</P>
<P>
   While airport planners in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong insist that
their projects will pay off in coming decades, they acknowledge
they will fall well short of their passenger targets for the first
few years. And that will put a pinch on everyone from the airlines,
freight carriers and shop owners to the governments, which took on
billions in debt to pay for the projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaysian government will have to stretch out the repayment
of loans to banks, according to Clifford Herbert, the executive
chairman of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Hong Kong's Airport Authority should have no
trouble repaying its first set of bank loans, which come due in
2001. But the steep cost of the project has forced the airport to
demand high prices for everything from the landing fees it charges
to the rent for duty-free shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly the most expensive airport I'm aware of in
Asia and it is more expensive than any airport in Europe,'' said
Ross Allen, the operations director of DHL Worldwide Express in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Airports are potent symbols of civic pride, and Hong Kong and
Kuala Lumpur spared no expense to create glittering gateways.
Though brand new, these projects are symbols of an era in which
Asia's economic growth and the ambitions of its political leaders
knew no bounds.
</P>
<P>
   On a lush site 45 miles from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian
government built a futuristic terminal with sweeping glass walls
and an atrium with a tropical rain forest. It also installed a
modern computer system that integrates every function of the
airport, from baggage carousels to elevators. With the capacity to
handle 25 million passengers a year, the new airport is palatial
compared to the cramped, somewhat shabby quarters of its
predecessor, which will remain in only limited service.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert believes Malaysia, which began planning the airport in
1992, will eventually use every inch of the new facility. But he
conceded that ``if the recession had set in,'' when the airport was
being planned, ``we would have had to scale it down, and the
architecture would have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Brown, the president of GE Southeast Asia in Singapore,
defended the airport's size, noting, ``Asia has always been chasing
the curve in terms of infrastructure. Building this airport ahead
of demand is not a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts said Kuala Lumpur's airport had a glaring
weakness in that it opened without a high-speed rail link to the
city. That could mean two-hour trips to Kuala Lumpur on
traffic-clogged roads. The train will not be ready for two years,
and the government will not allow municipal taxis to take
passengers into the city because it has signed a contract with an
airport taxi service.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's new airport, complete with railway, was conceived by
the British government in 1989 as a statement of confidence in Hong
Kong's future after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Britain chose a
site off Lantau Island, west of Hong Kong. That required chopping
the hills off two small islands and filling in the water between
them to create a giant platform.
</P>
<P>
   As Phillip Bruce, a spokesman for the Airport Authority, likes
to put it, ``We built something the size of Heathrow out of the
sea.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rearranging the topography was expensive: Bruce said the airport
itself cost $6.3 billion, while the roads, bridges and tunnels cost
another $13.7 billion. As an airport alone, Kansai was more
expensive, at $14 billion. Most analysts treat Hong Kong's related
projects as part of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The epic scale of the airport caused a rift between the British
and the Chinese, who were already feuding over the terms of the
handover. China accused Britain of depleting Hong Kong's reserves
to build a project that enriched British design and engineering
firms. When the invitations went out for Thursday's dedication
ceremony, Hong Kong's last British governor, Chris Patten, was left
off the list _ as he was for other anniversary events _ even though
he had championed the project.
</P>
<P>
   Like any huge investment in infrastructure, the airport pumped
money into Hong Kong's economy. But Ian Perkin, the chief economist
at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said Hong Kong's
economy would have run full tilt with or without the project. In
fact, he said the airport may have squeezed out some private-sector
development because so much of Hong Kong's construction resources
were being soaked up by the project.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hong Kong could use an economic jolt. But most of the
main spending is finished. The man-made island has room for a
satellite terminal, which would expand capacity to 87 million
passengers a year from 35 million. But given that the airport will
be lucky to draw the 29 million people that passed through close-in
Kai Tak Airport last year, Hong Kong is unlikely to break ground
soon.
</P>
<P>
   These days, people involved in the project find themselves on
the defensive. Sir Norman Foster, the renowned British architect
who designed the terminal, said the building, which has an
undulating roof-line and swooping wings that resemble a giant
pterodactyl, came in on budget. It was even cheaper per square foot
than other terminals, he said, because it used prefabricated
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Norman said he was frustrated that economic concerns were
overshadowing what he called an extraordinary engineering
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   When money begins flowing again here, Hong Kong International
will scoop up as much of it as it can. The terminal has a vast
shopping center, called Sky Mart, with 143 stores, including a
Chinese tea shop and an Irish bar. Clinton Leeks, the corporate
development director, said the airport hoped to generate 63 percent
of its revenue from nonairline activities _ an unusually high
percentage for an airport outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The airport's large hotel and shopping mall also gives it the
chance to serve as a regional hub within Asia so that, say, a
passenger traveling from Bangkok to New York could change planes in
Hong Kong. The hub market has been dominated by Singapore's Changi
Airport, which has amenities such as a hotel within the terminal
complex. But Hong Kong is better situated geographically than
Singapore, since it can be reached from most European and North
American cities with a nonstop flight.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, though, may be in danger of pricing itself out of the
market. Landing fees, depending on the size of the plane, will be
anywhere from 20 percent to 60 percent higher than at Kai Tak,
which will be shut down this weekend when the new airport opens for
normal traffic. The one-time fee to land a 747 is set at more than
$3,000. And since Cathay Pacific uses a lot of 747s, Tyler said it
would be unprofitable to add many extra flights unless the fees
come down.
</P>
<P>
   Leeks said the airport would re-evaluate its landing fees after
a year. But it is holding the line against retailers, who have
tried to renegotiate rich multiyear leases now that it is clear
that traffic will fall far short of the forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   With the spate of new airports in the region, Asia may soon see
a dogfight between airports not unlike that waged between airlines.
Kuala Lumpur has set its landing fees below those of neighboring
Singapore. And in a direct challenge to Hong Kong, the nearby
Portuguese colony of Macao cut fees in half for late evening
flights at its new airport.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for passengers in southern China will only intensify
further when Guangzhou, which operates the third-busiest airport in
China, opens a new field sometime after 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would view this as the first step in severe airport
competition in this region,'' Eckes of Indoswiss said.
</P>
<P>
   If only people would start flying again.

   ``Anchor Man''
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Farrar
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Nelson Publishers, $19.99
</P>
<P>
   When reading ``Anchor Man,'' keep in mind the line from that old
commercial: ``Thanks; I needed that.'' By the end of Steve Farrar's
latest book, you'll probably feel as if you've been slapped _ at
least once.
</P>
<P>
   ``God doesn't expect us just to take care of our families
today,'' the Dallas Theological Seminary graduate tells his fellow
fathers. ``''He wants your leadership to be so noble that it will
carry your family for at least a solid century. Maybe two.'' And
the way to do that, according to this straight-speaking writer, is
to anchor yourself and your family in biblical principles so
thoroughly that your children and grandchildren and the generations
beyond will continue to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The North Texas author's style is blunt, his prescription basic:
Don't betray your spouse; give your children your time; discipline
them when they need it; remember that they will copy you; tell them
about what God has done for you.
</P>
<P>
   Farrar unabashedly argues for male leadership in the family, but
he has no patience with tyranny or several other masculine vices.
Never mind the military; for Farrar, being a godly father is the
toughest job you'll ever love.

   ``Passion _ Live Worship''
</P>
<P>
   From the 268 Generation
</P>
<P>
   Star Song Records
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best praise and worship music being recorded these
days is aimed at the younger set.
</P>
<P>
   It is present in this recording, which was done live in January
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was Passion '98, the second such conference for
college students in the state capital. The first, in 1997,
attracted 2,000 people. This year, 5,000 made the pilgrimage to
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the conference is to encourage freedom of worship
and intimacy with God. The mission statement comes from Isaiah
26:8: ``Yes, Lord, walking in the way of your truth, we wait
eagerly for you, for your name and your renown are the desire of
our souls.''
</P>
<P>
   The music, performed by the conference music team, reflects the
mission statement nicely. These are powerful, intimate praise songs
set to a contemporary beat. ``Knocking on the Door of Heaven'' and
``Did You Feel the Mountains Tremble'' could become anthems for
this generation of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps even some older folks. Passion should appeal to the
target audience, but there is also a lot there for those of us who
are several years removed from college.

   AMERICAN-LAWN (Undated) _ ``The American Lawn: Surface of
Everyday Life,'' a corker of a show at the Canadian Center for
Architecture in Montreal (through Sept. 27), begins with a ride on
a lawn sprinkler. Back and forth the camera swings, scanning the
archetypal patch of grass, oscillating between peripheral glimpses
of equally iconic neighbors on either side: the no-nonsense lady
trimming her hedge to clipped perfection, the cool kids hanging out
by the garage. In the background, water hisses. The video is
projected onto the floor, and you hesitate to step on it. Your

dwelling under a rock, the name of this 12th-century German abbess
should at least ring a bell by now. Though never canonized,
Hildegard has achieved an eccentric sort of sainthood, having been
adopted as an icon by partisans of such renegade causes as Creation
Spirituality and feminism. By Cori Ellison. (Moved). Photo.

Manhattan. Twist's exercise, called simply ``Symphonie
Fantastique,'' manipulates objects and light within a 500-gallon
tank of water, one side of which, 30 by 40 inches, is visible to an

   AFRICAN-ALBUMS (Undated) _ On too many internationally released
albums by African stars, guest vocalists are enlisted to break the
language barrier; American or European producers tweak the rhythms
to sound more like funk or reggae or whatever else they think will
reach the unconverted. It sounds as if the international labels
that sought out African bands went on to second-guess themselves,
deciding that their African talent may know what plays to the folks
at home but needs help overseas. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).

   DUTCH-ART (Washington) _ Dutch artists pursued subjects among
their immediate surroundings, painting Dutch men and women, their
everyday lives and the Dutch landscape. They gave genre painting
its first definition and painted so many depictions of objects that
the term ``stilleven'' _ still life _ was coined. Perhaps the most
vivid reflection of this worldliness _ this inclusive embrace of
knowledge, experience and beauty _ was the kunstkamer, or art
cabinet, the often encyclopedic arrays of art, artifacts and
natural specimens assembled by prosperous Dutch or Flemish
burghers. So argues ``A Collector's Cabinet,'' a pocket-size show

CASINO GAMBLING A FAVORITE PASTIME FOR OLDER AND ELDERLY
AMERICANS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BRETT PULLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ For Milford Hartz, the adrenaline started
to flow right about the time the teal-colored deluxe motor coach
bus pulled into the parking lot in front of the Wal-Mart store. It
was 8:30 a.m. and the bus was soon loaded with more than 30 elderly
adults, most of whom had spent a lifetime of early morning hours
toiling on the nearby farms and in factories.
</P>
<P>
   But on this recent morning here, 90 miles east on the
Mississippi River, the Lady Luck riverboat casino was beckoning
like a fountain of youth. For the retirees, like scores of others
making similar pilgrimages each day around the country, the casino
offered free transportation, free food, free drinks, an exciting
place where older people are welcomed and respected, and the chance
to soothe any pains of old age with the magic elixir of instant
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get as old as I am, all your friends are gone and it
is not easy to make new ones, especially in a small town'' said
Hartz, an 87-year-old retired farmer. He goes to the casinos
``mainly to get out and be with other people, he said. : But Hartz
conceded: ``There is a little excitement to it. There's always the
hope you might win a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambling has always been an attraction for the elderly. But now,
with hundreds of casinos scattered throughout 26 states, and a
growing population of elderly people looking for places to
socialize, find companionship and participate in something lively
and new, casino gambling has become a favorite pastime for older
Americans and the elderly and an important source of income for
casinos. Each day, thousands take day trips to gambling
establishments. Like electrified cocoons, the casinos swaddle them
for five to six hours, stimulating them with bright lights and
bountiful buffet food, then sending them home, usually with a
little less of their savings.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, for example, more than 3 of every 10 visitors are
over the age of 60, according to the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Bureau. In Illinois, a recent survey found that 40 percent
of gamblers who visit that state's 12 riverboat casinos are over
the age of 55; 30 percent are retired.
</P>
<P>
   A survey conducted at centers for the elderly and at retirement
homes in the region around Council Bluffs, Iowa, where there are
three riverboat casinos, asked those surveyed to rank their
favorite activities. Based on a 62 percent response, the survey
found that bingo, which is often offered at local senior centers,
ranked first. Casinos were second, ahead of museums, shopping, the
theater, sporting events and church activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Depression-era cohort,'' said Dennis McNeilly, a
clinical psychologist in Omaha who is also an assistant professor
at Creighton University's medical school. ``They grew up doing
without, self-sacrificing, putting their families needs before
their own, and then suddenly they're given the opportunity of
getting something for nothing.'' At the casino, McNeilly said,
``everyone is treated in a receptive manner.'' Aging Americans, who
live ``in a society that isolates and marginalizes older adults,
become a part of the mainstream'' in a casino, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The casino industry is doing its part to encourage the fervor.
While they might not be high rollers, older gamblers _ who almost
fill the casinos on weekdays _ provide a healthy share of the
industry's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   To help keep them coming, the casinos pay tour companies to
organize trips for the elderly and to deliver busloads of them.
Aging entertainers whose stars have faded still perform inside
casino showrooms. And many of the amenities and promotions are
designed, it seems, with older gamblers in mind.
</P>
<P>
   On the bathroom walls of the Lady Luck, for example, there is a
special container for insulin needles. And at the Bluffs Run Casino
in Council Bluffs, gamblers who use a ``Player's Club'' card _
which like other frequent customer cards offers awards to loyal
cardholders _ receive 50 percent off of their prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For older people who have lost spouses and friends and are
living off of limited resources, the lure of the casino can be very
strong. Madonna Gilroy, a 75-year-old resident of Lost Nation,
Iowa, whose husband died in January, plans to join her friends soon
on one of the bus trips that depart from her church. ``The boat has
quite an enticement,'' said Ms. Gilroy, who lives 40 miles from the
Mississippi River casinos.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Gilroy's daughter, Kathy Gilroy, thinks it's a terrible
idea. ``Here's my mother getting $66 dollars a month from Social
Security, and $300 from my dad's pension, and she wants to go on a
gambling junket,'' said Kathy Gilroy. Kathy Gilroy said she had
become actively opposed to gambling because people in her small
hometown and across the country had been hurt by the growth of
gambling. Despite her daughter's objections, the elder Mrs. Gilroy
was determined. ``I'm trying to spread my wings a little and take
in some things,'' she insisted.

   Casino gambling has certainly spread its wings in this state
since it was legalized in 1989. There are nine riverboat casinos,
three land-based slot machine parlors at racetracks, and three
Indian reservation casinos. At one of the state's slot machine
parlors, Prairie Meadows, which is just outside Des Moines, daily
gross slot profits are $330,000, far more than the $126,000 that
was anticipated when the casino opened three years ago. ``We still
can't believe it,'' said Steve Berry, the casino's spokeman. ``The
largest group of folks here,'' he noted, ``are 55 to 65.''
</P>
<P>
   While riding on the bus that was headed for the Lady Luck
casino, Ed Schlotterbeck, a 73-year-old retiree, talked about how
his four sisters, all residents of Iowa, visit the casinos
frequently. ``Hell, they go at least once a week,'' he said.
Schlotterbeck, who retired eight years ago after 40 years of
working for a heavy equipment manufacturer in Cedar Rapids, said he
marveled at all of the money being spent at the state's casinos.
``Where's people getting the money?'' he asked. ``I didn't think
these old farmers had that much money.''
</P>
<P>
   The closer the bus got to the Lady Luck, it seemed, the more
Schlotterbeck's leg nervously shook. He usually brings about $200
for gambling. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he does not. His wife
never comes along because she thinks his trips to the casinos are
``the dumbest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the isle, 74-year-old Dee Porter, a widow three times, is
looking for more than a jackpot at the casino. ``I'm single and I'm
looking for a good man,'' she said. Ms. Porter last visited a
casino four days earlier with her daughter, who hit a slot machine
for $6,000, ``but she kept putting the money back in,'' Ms. Porter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joann Wadsworth, a casino employee, greeted the bus and reminded
the occupants to use their players' cards. The cards are inserted
into slot machines by gamblers and they track all of their play,
allowing for frequent player rewards, ranging from a deck of cards
to a casino logo jacket. More importantly, the player's cards
provide the casino with valuable marketing information about its
customers and their gambling activity.
</P>
<P>
   As they departed the bus, Ms. Wadsworth handed the passengers a
coupon for a free buffet meal and a complimentary silver dollar to
drop into the slot machines. One couple, Shirley Danford and Bob
Marsden, are reminded by the tour operator that this is their fifth
trip, and therefore on the next trip they will receive two free
silver dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Danford and Marsden met over 50 years ago at a dance. They
both married other people and raised families, but after their
spouses died, they began dating two years ago. They visit casinos
on weekdays and go ballroom dancing on Sundays. ``I keep him
busy,'' Ms. Danford said. ``We have a good time.'' They have smiled
and giggled throughout the entire ride and refused to give their
ages. ``We're somewhere between 69 and 80,'' Marsden said.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them have brought $15 dollars each to play slot
machines. ``They're not going to get rich off us,'' Marsden said.
</P>
<P>
   One hour after boarding the boat, Dorothy Hunter sat on a stool
in front of a ``Double Dollars'' slot machine, with the till loaded
with dozens of silver dollars she had just won. Ms. Hunter, a
76-year-old retired secretary, was at the casino for the first time
since undergoing triple-bypass heart surgery in April. ``I feel 10
to 20 years younger,'' she said, as she clutched a handful of the
silver dollars in her thick, strong hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come here, spend a few dollars, they get a
nice meal and they have a nice afternoon,'' Ms. Hunter said. ``But
me, I like the machines. It's such a nice high when you win
something. A little excitement in our mundane lives.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After nearly two hours on board, Schlotterbeck was walking
around the boat looking a bit frazzled. ``I can't hit anything,''
he muttered.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four hours on the boat and a total loss of $10,
Hartz quit playing the slot machines and was standing around
watching blackjack players and waiting to soon board the bus to
head home. ``I don't know how to play these card games,'' he said.
``My folks, when we were growing up, they didn't want us to have
anything to do with cards. Money was hard to come by and those
folks knew how to hold onto it.''
</P>
<P>
   When they climbed back on the bus at 3 p.m., if anyone had won,
they did not mention it.
</P>
<P>
   Schlotterbeck, whose sisters love to gamble and whose wife calls
it dumb, lost $90, he said. ``They say `Hey, it's entertainment,'
'' Schlotterbeck parroted. ``Well it ain't entertainment when you
lose your money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Porterfound neither a husband nor a jackpot, but she was as
frisky going back as she was coming. ``I had a good time, but I
didn't win,'' she said. During the ride back to Cedar Rapids, when
one of Ms. Porter's friends blurted out Ms. Porter's age _ which is
74 - she threatened, ``Hey, you want a free for all here?''
</P>
<P>
   Marsden and Ms. Danford, the giddy couple, lost $13 dollars
each. ``I'm busted,'' Marsden said. ``We're the last of the big
spenders,'' Ms. Danford added with a smile.

IRAN'S PRESIDENT LIKES U.S. TONE BUT SAYS ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ President Mohammad Khatami lauded the Clinton
administration Wednesday for softening its tone toward his country
but added that a concrete change in U.S. policy toward Iran was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, Khatami had made no public comment on a speech
by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in June in which she
called on Iran to help create a ``road map'' to normal relations or
on the conciliatory words by President Clinton that followed.
</P>
<P>
   But in a brief question-and-answer session with reporters after
a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Khatami said:
``We believe there is change in their tone, but we're always
looking for action. Honesty lies in action, not words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this change in tone is a gesture of better
understanding by American politicians of the status of the Islamic
Republic, the Iranian nation and the global situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami did not break new ground with his comments calling on
the United States to make a specific policy gesture. Other Iranian
officials, including Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, have already
articulated that view. But the absence of any direct criticism of
the United States or any concrete demand by Khatami reflects a
softer tone on the Iranian side.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Khatami seemed unaccustomed to the Western practice of a ``press
availability'' after an official meeting, at which officials make a
few comments, photographers shoot pictures and reporters fire off a
few questions. But Prodi, who was traveling with a large press
corps, was on a high-profile mission, and it was not surprising
that the two emerged from their hourlong meeting at the Pink Palace
in the presidential compound to greet the media.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami asked Prodi in English whether he wanted to go first.
Prodi replied in English: ``I don't know. Which is your habit? For
me it's OK''
</P>
<P>
   While reporters politely waited, expecting the officials to make
opening statements, Khatami said in Persian: ``Do they intend to
ask questions or not? Or do they want to postpone this?''
</P>
<P>
   After two questions, Khatami ended the brief encounter.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by Prodi, one of the highest-ranking European
officials to visit Iran since its 1979 revolution, was touted by
both the Italian and the Iranian sides as a major political event.
</P>
<P>
   For the Italians, the visit put Prodi in the vanguard of those
Europeans who want to forge close ties _ particularly economic ties
_ with Iran and are bargaining that Khatami can deliver on his
promise to bring about the rule of law and liberalize the country.
</P>
<P>
   But plummeting oil prices have deeply affected Iran's already
damaged economy, and Tehran is not in a position to sign ambitious
financial and industrial contracts.
</P>
<P>
   For the Iranians, the visit helps rehabilitate their global
image. The European Union countries briefly withdrew their
ambassadors from Iran after the verdict by a German court last year
that implicated the country's leadership in a terrorist bombing in
Berlin six years ago. Recently, the Europeans have agreed
informally to allow their foreign ministers to visit Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But Prodi's visit ups the ante, and officials from a number of
European countries were not at all happy that he had decided to
make the trip without consulting them.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, Prodi called his trip important ``not only for
Italy but also for Europe'' and said it would ``open a new chapter
in relations.''
</P>
<P>
   In line with Khatami's mantra that there must be a ``dialogue
among civilizations,'' Prodi received an honorary doctoral degree
from Tehran University and attended the opening of an exhibition at
Tehran's Museum of Contemporary Art of graphic works on Islam by
Italian artists.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the official Iranian press agency reported that Khatami,
in his meeting with Prodi, said, ``Dialogue between civilizations
requires Iran as the cradle of Islamic civilization and Italy as
the parent of Western civilization to have exemplary and excellent
relations with each other.''

   JUG-ANCIENT (Seattle) An ancient Middle Eastern jug found in
Seattle has been returned to the University of Chicago's Oriental
Institute, more than a half century after it disappeared. A
warehouse worker for Goodwill Industries stumbled across the relic
while sifting through donations last spring. The institute had
loaned out the jug to a patron to raise money in 1943, officials
said. The 4-inch jug made of roughly textured brown clay didn't
look like much when warehouse worker Randy Jones found it in an old
camera box among the clothing, costume jewelry and usual
bric-a-brac donated to the charity.

BELL ATLANTIC PAY-PHONE CALL TO COST 35 CENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The days of the one-coin phone call are over.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. said Wednesday it is hiking the cost of a
local call at its pay telephones in Massachusetts to 35 cents from
25 cents. The increase, which is being phased in starting Thursday,
follows closely on the heels of a hike to 25 cents in April 1997.
Before that, the cost of a pay phone call had been a dime since
1953.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bell Atlantic, which owns and operates more than 45,000 pay
phones in the state, says it needs to charge an additional 10 cents
because it faces more competitive pressure stemming from the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic ``must charge competitive prices to the users of
our pay phones,'' said Lorraine Chickering, president-Bell Atlantic
Public Communicatoins. ``The competitive price that has emerged
nationwide is 35 cents for a local call.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bell Atlantic acknowledged that its pay phone business
has been hurt by the growing use of cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates were incensed at the price hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rate hike to 35 cents is really wrong,'' said Robert
Sargent, legislative director for the Massachusetts Public Interest
Research Group. ``This is another example of why the public
distrusts utilities and phone companies when they say all this
competition is a win-win situation. Instead of the promise that
prices would go down, they go up'' under deregulation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others pointed out the impact on poor people.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The pay phone is a public necessity for that group and the
price increase is unconscionable,'' said Jerrold Oppenheim, an
attorney at the National Consumer Law Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Pay phone rates in Massachusetts have been among the lowest
nationwide for years. Until Wednesday, Massachusetts was among only
seven states where a pay phone call cost 25 cents. The rest of the
nation and the District of Columbia have been at 35 cents.
Massachusetts was among the last states where the cost was boosted
to 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic already had raised its rate to 35 cents in
Washington and the 10 other East Coast states it serves. After the
hike in Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island will be the only
other states Bell Atlantic serves that are still at 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheim, the consumer advocate, said that Bell Atlantic has
indicated in regulatory filings that it costs the company as much
as 17 cents in transmission and other expenses for a single call.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 telecommunications law, designed to spur competition in
the regional Bells' local telephone markets, also included
requirements that standard service to homes and businesses would
not subsidize the pay phone business. That subsidy had kept pay
phone calls relatively cheap. Now, Bell Atlantic's pay phone
operations must become an independent profit center.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Bell Atlantic has had competitors in the pay phone
business for years, the elimination of the subsidy also has put it
in more direct competition with challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Morever, since the law went into effect, Bell Atlantic has faced
more competition from other pay phone operators in securing
locations for pay phones. Paul Francischeti, vice president of
marketing and planning at Bell Atlantic Public Communications, said
the rent, or commissions, the company pays to put its phones in
hotels, airports, shopping arcades and other locations has risen
substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic also has faced growing pressure from cellular
technology. The volume of pay phone calls generally has dropped due
to a boom in cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past 18 months, we have started to see a shift to where
cellular and wireless are now eating into pay phone usage,'' said
Francischeti. But he noted that wireless phones are merely ``
stealing growth from pay phones'' rather than ``taking pay phone
usage away.''

GM'S JUNE SALES SOARED, BUT STRIKE-PLAGUED JULY LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. said Wednesday that June car and
truck sales were the highest for any month in nine years but that
July sales would plummet because of two strikes that have shut down
most of the automaker's North American assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Zarrella, vice president in charge of GM's North American
Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing Group, said at a news
conference Wednesday that sales would drop 30 percent to 40 percent
this month compared with sales from the month a year earlier
because of the strikes by the United Automobile Workers.
</P>
<P>
   That would push GM's market share to a record low of 25 percent
and put GM behind Ford Motor Co. as the largest volume vehicle
manufacturer in the United States. Already, analysts say the
strikes at two plants in Flint, Mich., have cost GM $1.18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In June, GM sold 492,937 cars and trucks, including heavy
trucks, a 24 percent increase compared with sales in the month a
year earlier. It was GM's best month since May 1989 and its fourth
consecutive month of year-over-year increase. Though total industry
sales in June will not be available until Ford reports its sales
Monday, Zarrella predicted GM's market share would be between 31.5
percent and 33 percent for June.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler Corp., which also reported June figures Wednesday, said
it had a 10 percent increase in sales compared with those in June
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong June sales report for GM, the strikes, which
have closed 26 of the company's 29 North American assembly plants,
have already diminished GM's sales by preventing shipment of
vehicles to daily rental car fleets, which typically represent
about 20 percent of the automaker's sales.
</P>
<P>
   GM was unable to fill an order for 15,000 fleet cars in June and
will be unable to fill any fleet orders in July, usually the
biggest month of the year for fleet sales, Zarrella said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, GM will be unable to build special-order vehicles
for customers, which typically account for 10 percent of sales, and
sales to employees, which have been running as high as 5 percent of
total sales, will most likely plunge.
</P>
<P>
   If the strike lingers beyond mid-July, the consequences will be
more dire and permanent as customers buy cars and trucks from
rivals instead of waiting for the strike to end, Zarrella
predicted. ``If we can't supply it, we're going to lose customers _
21,000 customers we're likely to lose every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree with Zarrella that those customers could be lost
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition will take as much advantage of the situation
as it can,'' said Joseph Phillippi, an auto analyst with Lehman
Brothers in New York. ``That's not just Ford and Chrysler but also
imports _ every seller from Hyundai to Mercedes-Benz. And the
damage may be lasting.''
</P>
<P>
   GM's inventory of vehicles is already dwindling. The company
entered June with 1.1 million cars and trucks in dealer inventory;
that number dropped to 850,000 by the end of the month, enough to
last through July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough retail inventory to allow our dealers to keep
the sales momentum going in July,'' Zarrella said. ``Consumers can
still go into GM dealerships, see plenty of variety and still get
great value despite the fact that we have a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Total U.S. car and truck sales in June are coming in nearly as
strong as sales in May. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate
for light vehicles reached 16.3 million cars and trucks in May, the
best month since September 1986, and was on track to be just as
high in June, auto executives and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler set a new monthly sales record, selling 252,485 cars
and trucks, a 10 percent increase compared with sales in the month
a year earlier and breaking the record set in May, when Chrysler
surpassed the quarter million mark for the first time in a single
month.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota sales totaled 117,043 cars and trucks, up 17 percent, a
new June record. Likewise, Honda sales set a June record, with
88,928 vehicles sold, an increase of 8 percent from the month a
year earlier. Mercedes-Benz sales were up 82 percent from June
1997, at 15,134 vehicles. Also reporting higher June sales were
Mitsubishi, Subaru, Volvo and Land Rover. Saab and Hyundai sales
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the strikes against GM, analysts predicted the
surge of the last two months would ease somewhat in July. Strong
sales in May and June were buoyed by attractive incentive programs,
some of which will be discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   GM has already announced that it will not renew its Loyalty
First program, which provided owners of GM vehicles with
certificates of $500 to $1,000 to use toward the purchase of
another GM vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Chrysler have not said whether they will continue their
programs, which provide their customers with similar loyalty
coupons and allow their dealers to accept GM coupons as well, when
they expire next week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, automakers and analysts predict an unprecedented fifth
straight year of sales of more than 15 million cars and trucks
because of record consumer confidence, low interest rates and
inflation and a healthy stock market. &QL;

PENTAGON TESTS CONFIRM WHAT N.C. ACTIVIST KNEW ALL ALONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CORY REISS NYT Regional Newspapers c.1998 N.Y. Times News
Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Four years ago, Ted Sampley proved that the
unidentified soldier killed in Vietnam and interred in the Tomb of
the Unknowns was Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Blassie.
</P>
<P>
   But he says Pentagon officials turned their backs when he showed
them his analysis.
</P>
<P>
   So he printed his story in the 10,000-circulation U.S. Veteran
Dispatch, a North Carolina veterans' newspaper he publishes, then
republished it two years later and posted it on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Few noticed. One who did was a CBS News correspondent who began
investigating Sampley's claims and reported in January that
military officials may have known the soldier's identity when the
remains were buried in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Vindication finally came Monday, when the Pentagon confirmed
that DNA analysis had matched the remains to samples from Blassie's
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the circumstantial evidence was right on the money,''
Sampley said Tuesday from the small antiques store he owns in
Kinston. ``I had no doubt about that. My doubts were with the
Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampley feared the government would cover up the truth even
after Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered the remains exhumed
in May. Sampley believes government officials who knew the
soldier's identity in 1984 bowed to political pressure to
memorialize an unknown soldier.
</P>
<P>
   CBS reporter Vince Gonzales, who said Sampley's claims were the
catalyst for his own research and reporting, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were political and military officials who knew this set
of remains had a name,'' Gonzales said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has denied that officials knew Blassie's identity
when the remains were buried, saying that the DNA analysis used to
identify his remains simply was unavailable in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Sampley _ himself a Vietnam veteran and a political
activist _ and Blassie's family had sought a laboratory analysis of
the remains but were turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The sometimes tenuous links made between bones and lost soldiers
upset Sampley so much that he set out to test whether he could do
what the U.S. government hadn't: use the military's own information
to identify the unknown soldier.
</P>
<P>
   He had the tools at his disposal. Since the early 1980s, he'd
been working on a project to collect every scrap of information
about missing Vietnam vets he could find. Sampley now has several
thousand files, all entered into a database that made finding
Blassie's name possible.
</P>
<P>
   The key, he said, was that the government knew the coordinates
where the soldier's remains had been found in South Vietnam, 60
miles north of Saigon. He ran a search on every soldier listed as
missing in that area and made a list.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the process was simple deduction. Sampley knew some
objects had been found with the bones _ parts of a flight suit,
parts of a parachute and a one-man inflatable raft, for example _
which he used to narrow the list.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopter pilots don't use parachutes, so that eliminated
helicopter pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ruled out everyone but a fighter pilot, and Blassie was the
only one who went down there,'' Sampley said.
</P>
<P>
   His quest for the soldier's identity began with anger that had
lingered for a decade, ever since he became convinced that
prisoners of war had not been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   His stake is personal. His father-in-law is still listed as
missing in action in Vietnam, and now his 5-year-old son is
starting to ask what happened to his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Sampley can't answer that. But he's made it a mission to help
others find peace.
</P>
<P>
   And now that his research has been upheld, he warns the families
of Vietnam veterans who were identified by bits of bone and teeth
to question the government's claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the families have a right to question them now,''
Sampley said. ``How many more cases have they manipulated in order
to appease the politicians?''
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department spokesman said there was no reason to
believe such allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``An established, rigorous process is followed to ensure the
accuracy and integrity of the identification attempts,'' said the
spokesman, Lt. Col. Tom Begines.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials haven't decided whether to replace Blassie's
remains with another Vietnam soldier who has not been identified.
Sampley opposes such a move with a simple answer: Let no soldier
rest without a name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a great honor to a government if they were
capable of never having an unknown,'' he said.

JUDGE DISMISSES TAX EVASION CASE AGAINST HUBBELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge, denouncing Independent Counsel
Kenneth W. Starr for orchestrating a ``fishing expedition,'' threw
out tax evasion charges Wednesday against Webster L. Hubbell, a
friend and former top political appointee of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest in a series of setbacks for Starr, US District
Judge James Robertson ruled the Whitewater prosecutor violated
Hubbell's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by
building the tax evasion case with documents Hubbell handed over
under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wrongly turned Hubbell ``into the primary informant
against himself,'' Robertson wrote in a 34-page decision.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he would appeal the ruling, which provided fresh
ammunition for Clinton allies who have accused the independent
counsel of prosecutorial excesses in his four-year investigation
into the president, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their associates.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robertson, in a sharp rebuke, ruled that Starr exceeded
his authority in pursuing the tax charges against Hubbell and three
co-defendants, including Hubbell's wife, Suzanna. The ruling also
throws out all charges against Hubbell's co-defendants _ his lawyer
and his accountant _ in the 10-count indictment Starr brought in
April.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the judge, who was appointed to the federal bench
by President Clinton, found that a special judicial panel violated
its legal limits by permitting Starr to pursue the case, which
generated the indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's original mandate was to investigate the failed
Whitewater land deal in Arkansas involving the Clintons and the
Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan owned by their business partners.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, Robertson said, could have asked Attorney General Janet
Reno to expand his jurisdiction to cover the Hubbell tax charges,
as Starr did to expand his investigation to cover the Monica
Lewinsky sex-and-perjury allegations involving Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Madison-Whitewater matters that were the subject of the
original grant (of jurisdiction) and the tax matters that are the
subject of this case have nothing in common ... except Webster
Hubbell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just very, very grateful,'' Hubbell said outside his
Washington home. ``We didn't expect anything this quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanna Hubbell, standing beside him, added: ``Hopefully, this
is finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr, in a prepared statement, said he ``will seek a prompt
review of this ruling'' through federal appeals. He said the
judge's ruling ``expressly sets itself in disagreement'' with case
law developed in other federal courts, although he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials welcomed the ruling but refrained from
cheering publicly. ``We believe the judge's legal opinion speaks
for itself,'' James Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House legal
staff, said in the administration's only immediate public
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's ruling is the latest in a string of recent legal
setbacks for Starr. Last month, the Supreme Court rejected his
request to force a lawyer for Vincent W. Foster Jr., the late White
House deputy counsel, to surrender notes of conversations with
Foster shortly before Foster killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a federal judge also ordered Susan McDougal, one of
the Clintons's Whitewater partners, released from prison after she
was jailed for more than 18 months for refusing to testify in
Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Supreme Court refused to grant Starr an emergency
hearing on his request to force three Secret Service agents to
testify in his grand jury investigation of Clinton's relationship
with a former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a further indication of Kenneth Starr's
prosecutorial excesses,'' said Representative Barney Frank, a
Newton Democrat and Clinton ally, said after Robertson's ruling.
``It's a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson foreshadowed Wednesday's ruling during a hearing last
week on Hubbell's motion to dismiss the tax charges. During the
session, the judge described Starr's office's view of Hubbell's
Fifth Amendment rights as ``really scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, Mrs. Clinton's former partner in the Rose Law Firm in
Little Rock, Ark., was appointed a US associate attorney general,
the third-highest position in the Justice Department, after Clinton
took office in 1993. But Hubbell left office in disgrace in 1994 as
Starr investigated charges that he had bilked former law partners
and clients.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of mail fraud and tax evasion, Hubbell was sentenced
to 21 months in prison, served 18 months, and was released in
February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But while Hubbell was incarcerated, Starr pursued a new set of
charges related to more than $700,000 in income Hubbell received in
the months after he left the Justice Department. Starr suspected
the payments may have been ``hush money'' to persuade Hubbell not
to cooperate in related Whitewater matters.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied when Hubbell refused to turn over 13,120 pages of
personal documents, Starr received a subpoena in 1996 compelling
Hubbell to produce the material on the condition that Hubbell
receive ``immunity to the extent allowed by law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson ruled that Starr's application for the subpoena
expressed no intention of investigating possible tax violations by
Hubbell. Indeed, the judge wrote, Starr did not seek authority to
investigate the tax charges for more than a year after he received
the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subpoena served on Mr. Hubbell was the quintessential
fishing expedition,'' Robertson wrote. ``The independent counsel
freely admits that he was not investigating tax-related charges
when he issued it.''

FED KEEPS INTEREST RATES STEADY AMID SIGNS OF COOLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ECON-REPORT) 
(mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With signs of a slowing economy and increasing
evidence that the Asian economic crisis is beginning to hurt some
industries in the United States, the Federal Reserve Wednesday
decided not to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Following a two-day private meeting, the Fed said that it was
keeping the benchmark federal funds rate _ the borrowing cost on
overnight loans between banks _ steady at 5.5 percent, just where
it has been since March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other indicators were released Wednesday that
gave a picture of an economy cooling down from the hectic pace of
the past year or so. A key index of manufacturing activity, the
monthly purchasing managers' report, fell in June for the first
time in two years. This index measures manufacturing production and
its sharp decline from 51.4 in May to 49.6 in June was seen as
evidence that the Asian economic turmoil is starting to affect
American industrial producers.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department also reported Wednesday that
construction slumped 1.5 percent in May, the worst drop in more
than four years, and the Conference Board's indicator of future
economic activity remained unchanged from April to May, at 105.2.
This is the second month in a row that the Conference Board's
leading indicator stayed fixed, a sign that the economy, while
still on a positive track, is expected to be sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an economy where inflation is low and the
economy is slowing, there is no reason for the Fed to raise
rates,'' said Stan Shipley, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
``And the three indicators also released Wednesday indicate that
this economy is weakening and weakening rapidly. We think that, by
December, we may begin to see unemployment rise and retail sales
fall and then the Fed will have to vote to lower rates.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of analysts argue that the economy, after a period of
relative weakness, could well rebound in the months ahead and see
little reason for the Fed to cut short-term interest rates. Still,
Merrill Lynch's view was echoed by others. ``A good case is
building that the Fed might need to lower interest rates,'' said
James Glassman, senior U.S. economist at Chase Securities. ``The
dislocations that were caused by the Asia shock are starting to
ripple through the U.S. economy and we are beginning to see lots of
indications that economic growth is slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, the American economy has been largely insulated from
the Asian downturn. In fact, consumers have benefited in many ways
from lower prices for imported goods and lower interest rates
caused in part by the lessening of demand from Asia for capital.
That has helped curb inflation, but some domestic producers have
begun to suffer from reduced demand for American goods in Asia and
from the intense price competition.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
said he was particularly troubled by the drop in the index of
manufacturing activity. ``The purchasing managers' index is
something the Fed watches closely, and the numbers that came out
Wednesday were significant,'' he said. ``Our manufacturing sector
is weakening because of the problems in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has stayed its hand even though monetary policy-makers
have leaned, ever since their meeting in March, toward raising
rates in a bid to slow down what some feared was an overripe
economy. The Fed has long raised interest rates as a way of halting
inflation, and lowered them when it wanted to stimulate the
economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But, since the beginning of the year, inflation has, if
anything, retreated even further and is now running at an annual
rate of under 1.8 percent. In addition, Fed policy-makers are
worried that raising U.S. rates could touch off more financial
turbulence in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia's misfortune is allowing us to enjoy a strong economy
here with low inflation,'' Yardeni said. ``While the Fed might see
that strong economy as a threat to reviving inflation, they
recognize that's not much of a risk right now. What's really
important in these numbers is that we are seeing a weakening price
environment for manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, many analysts expect that the hot growth rate of 5.4
percent that took place in the first quarter of the year could slow
to around 2 percent _ or even lower _ for the rest of the year as
manufacturers and retailers work off excessive inventories that
have built up in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In light of these estimates, the Fed warned banks on Tuesday
against lowering their lending standards on business loans. In a
statement, the Fed said bankers should resist any tendency to
assume ``that the unusually favorable economic environment of the
last few years will continue indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse into the internal reasoning of the Fed may come on
Thursday when the Open Market Committee releases the minutes of its
May 19 meeting.

WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS CLINTON ENTOURAGE OF OVER 1,000 ON CHINA TRIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ When U.S. business leaders wanted to thank
President Clinton for his stop in China's commercial capital, they
presented him Wednesday with a giant ``chop'' _ an engraved stone
stamp used to formalize official papers in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the jade, tiger-headed souvenir was so big it
looked ``imperial.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said of the entourage that Clinton brought to
China with him _ by far the largest of any to accompany a president
on the four Sino-American summits during the past 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has about 550 U.S. government personnel _ and three
family members _ in tow. When one factors in six legislators, 150
security people, a support staff of 150 or more, military personnel
who handle communications and media people covering the trip, the
traveling party numbers more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is accustomed to criticism about its big
traveling contingent, but contends the group is needed to do all
the business on a crowded agenda that extends far beyond Clinton's
meetings with top Chinese leaders, including President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   There are trade and business deals, from farm matters to airport
construction, as well as human rights issues and education
exchanges to be explored, a White House official said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the five Cabinet secretaries and 70 other senior aides
on Clinton's trip are undoubtedly busy with sideline meetings and
negotiations, but at least one or two seem to hang around the press
center and its media-financed buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the president really needs all these folks, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said, ``Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen any presidential entourage which you couldn't
cut probably by half if you wanted to,'' said McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said critics need to ``look at all the other
moving parts behind the summit in which people are doing work,
having meetings with (Chinese) counterparts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Clinton is here is a forcing event; it forces
the bureaucracies to create `deliverables' and to come to closure
on things that have been negotiated,'' McCurry said. ``And that's
what you want to have a summit for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deliverables'' is diplo-speak for deals and agreements that
can be formally announced, sometimes with the intention of making
an otherwise uneventful get-together look fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the local U.S. government representatives have been
working for months, and McCurry said the presence of more senior
officials can nudge ``negotiations that have stalled or need a
personal push.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of stuff going on, and every single one of
these Cabinet people here represents an element of what this very
broad-based relationship is about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry pointed to an announcement in Beijing by Peace Corps
Director Mark D. Gearan that his agency's relations with China were
being formalized, after a five-year trial period, and that 40
English teachers from the United States were heading for Sichuan
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the price that we've paid to schlep everyone over here
worth that? Yes, because it tells the story to the American people
of what this relationship is about in its totality and why we are
engaged with them,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can write the obligatory (story about) too many people and
ten limos and so on. It's easy to write that story,'' said McCurry.
``I just think there is an argument that this all in the end is
worth something because this is what the strategy of engagement is
about _ bringing a whole hell of a lot of people here and getting
them to sit down and start working things out.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the China extravaganza to U.S. taxpayers is hard to
come by, although Republicans in control of Congress are certain to
make an attempt. It's a possibly embarrassing exercise that Clinton
would not face so directly if Democrats were in control of Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Government costs are spread out over dozens of departments, from
the White House to State Department and Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   When President Nixon made his breakthrough trip to China in
1972, his entourage totaled 300. President Ford brought 280 in
1975. President Reagan was accompanied by 340 in 1984. President
Bush, whose China trip in 1989 was added on to his visit to Tokyo
for Emperor Hirohito's funeral, had 300 folks along.
</P>
<P>
   The president is the only government official allowed to be
accompanied by family members on official White House trips, and
Clinton has brought first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as
daughter Chelsea, on summer break from Stanford University, and
mother-in-law Dorothy Rodham of Little Rock, Ark.

PROPOSAL COULD END SCHOOL BUSING IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a proposal that could end two decades of student
busing in Boston, the School Committee has been asked to consider
assigning students to schools with no regard to race, as one of
three new ideas for revamping the assignment program.
</P>
<P>
   If race were eliminated from the assignment process, school
statistics released Wednesday show, the racial percentages in
schools would remain largely the same as they are now, because the
district is 80 percent minority. Under the proposal to eliminate
consideration of race, students would be assigned to schools based
solely on choice and lottery.
</P>
<P>
   School Superintendent Thomas Payzant, stressing he is not yet
recommending any of the three proposals, also asked school
committee members at their meeting Wednesday to consider a
``cluster'' plan he has already publicized. It would give families
fewer elementary and middle schools to chose from, but would better
ensure they could attend schools closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Payzant also offered a third plan for consideration: drawing a
`circle' around students' neighborhoods or homes, and allowing them
to choose from the ten schools closest to them _ all but
guaranteeing them the ability to choose neighborhood schools.
</P>
<P>
   All of the plans could eventually save the money the city now
spends on busing to achieve racial guidelines _ $17 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not recommendations. This is only the beginning of
discussions,'' Payzant said, adding he hopes they will take place
in a ``rational and thoughtful way.''
</P>
<P>
   School committee members, who received the plans for the first
time, are expected to hold public hearings through the fall before
voting for one of them in November. The earliest any plan would
take effect would be the 1999-2000 school year, said school
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The three proposals made Wednesday night grew out of a student
assignment task force that met last year.
</P>
<P>
   School committee members said they remain committed to
desegregation in the schools. Two members said they felt changes in
student assignments should not even be pursued, so the committee
can better focus on teaching and learning. Two others said the
isssue of good schools is tied so closely to parental choice and
desegregatation that it must be explored.
</P>
<P>
   Any revisions to school busing in Boston are expected to meet
with widespread opposition. Already, many minority parents have
made clear they fear that any return to neighborhood schools will
lead to wealthier neighborhoods having the best schools.
</P>
<P>
   Before busing began with a federal court order in 1974, schools
in poor, minority neighborhoods received fewer resources. Boston's
busing plan was revamped in 1989, giving students more choice while
still requiring busing to racially balance schools.
</P>
<P>
   School department officials said they simulated student
assgingments for four grades, using racial guidelines under one
simulation and no racial guidelines in the other.
</P>
<P>
   They were astonished to discover that only 15 of the city's 60
elementary sdhools had too few white students under the free choice
plan than racial balancing calls for. That represented only 196
elementary students citywide.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, schools are required to meet various racial
percentages. Elementary and middle school students choose schools
from one of three zones in the city. High school students choose
citywide.
</P>
<P>
   The pure choice plan would give parents the ability to choose a
wide range of schools within their zone _ as many as 27 elementary
schools, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The other two plans and the desegregation impact each would have
are:
</P>
<P>
   --The cluster plan, which breaks the city up into 10 clusters,
giving parents a choice of 6 to 10 elementary schools in each.
Under the plan, choice would be diminished, but parents would be
able to choose schools closer to home. However, there would be
problems with desegregation because so many Boston neighborhoods
are largely white or black. For instance, the East Boston and
Charlestown cluster would have an 8 percent increase in white
students over what that zone has now, and West Rosnbury would have
12 percent more. The plan also creates peoblems in clusters with
too many students and too few seats, including Roxbury and
Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   --The third plan makes a student's neighborhood or home the
center of a circle, increasing choice of schools over the cluster
plan.

RUSSIAN LEGISLATORS BEGIN TO APPROVE YELTSIN ECONOMIC PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's fractious national legislators complained at
length Wednesday about President Boris Yeltsin's newest and most
drastic belt-tightening plan for the country's faltering economy,
then began rather hastily to approve parts of it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of several days of debate over the proposal,
Communists in the Duma, the lower house of Russia's Parliament,
argued bitterly against Yeltsin's proposals for sales and
value-added taxes that would directly hit consumers. The head of
the upper chamber, the Federation Council, argued that the plan
could rob regional governments of much-needed revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Free-market supporters in the lower house who might otherwise
back the austerity measures said they opposed them anyway, because
they dislike Yeltsin's high-handed style of governing. The
president introduced the proposal nine days ago with a warning that
legislators would have to enact it or face ``other measures,''
meaning he would impose it by decree.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, no one Wednesday seemed willing to predict that
the plan will go down to defeat in the Communist-controlled lower
house, which is considering it first. In large part, legislators
were driven by fears that rejecting the measures outright would
propel the economy into genuine national chaos.
</P>
<P>
   And so the lower house gave preliminary approval to nearly half
of the 20 or so sections in Yeltsin's blueprint. They included a 20
percent value-added tax, a new flat tax on small businesses like
newsstands and gas stations, a cut in the corporate profits tax and
the repeal of a quirky provision that taxes companies forced to
sell products at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Yeltsin also proposes to impose a tax on
bartered deals, now a huge and untaxed slice of the Russian
economy, to raise land taxes, to impose a low-rate flat tax on all
citizens and to wipe out a series of Soviet-era subsidies and
unproductive government jobs. In all, experts have said the
emergency measures should bring in about $22 billion a year. The
government's forecasters have valued the package at about $16
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The government would use the money to make good on back pay to
millions of government workers and to cut its budget deficit, which
is now being financed with high-interest short-term debt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has said that monthly debt
payments now run about 1.4 times the federal government's monthly
revenue, meaning that the government has to borrow money just to
pay for its past debts.
</P>
<P>
   Those sorts of problems have led the International Monetary Fund
to demand an economic overhaul before considering billions in new
loans that would prop up Russian finances and the ruble.
Negotiations over $10 billion to $15 billion in new loans began
last month. Foreign investors have also begun to lose confidence in
the near-insolvent economy, and Russian stocks and the ruble have
been under assault in recent weeks as the crisis worsened.

IN KOREA, RUBIN URGES JAPAN TO TAKE CREDIBLE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ On the last stop of his six-day
four-country sweep of Asia, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin made
his most pointed comments about a country that he did not even
visit, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese economy was clearly on Rubin's mind as he met South
Korean business, labor and political leaders for a report on the
country's economic overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed again and again the ``enormous importance of getting
Japan back on track to support growth in Korea and the region in
general.'' Rubin said he was ``deeply, deeply concerned'' about the
recent slide of the yen against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But he dodged questions about whether the United States would
again step in to prop up the yen with the standard response that
the United States would move if and when it deemed intervention was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   And on the eve of the disclosure of Japan's latest plan to
overhaul its financial system, Rubin exhorted Japanese officials to
come up with a credible solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important key with respect to economic conditions in
Japan is to restructure its banking system in an efficient fashion
that wins the approval of the world financial markets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His decision not to include Japan on his trip, but nonetheless
to talk a great deal about it, has been a subject of intense
discussion in Asia, where Japan's inability to devise a plan to put
its economy back on track is seen as prolonging the region's woes.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and President Clinton's detours around Japan are widely
regarded as a snub to one of the most devoted U.S. allies and have
raised wide-ranging speculation here about a realignment of
American interests.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting Wednesday with Rubin, President Kim Dae-jung
wondered aloud whether the United States and China were forging a
``special relationship,'' a heavily veiled expression of concern
that most Asian countries have about how China's power will grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't characterize it that way,'' Rubin told Kim,
although he added that Clinton had long regarded better relations
between the United States and China as important.
</P>
<P>
   In a day capped by a somber visit to the demilitarized zone
between North and South Korea, Rubin met Kim and business and labor
leaders in hopes of improving his understanding of the issues
confronting Korea as its sweeping efforts to reform its economy
begin to bite.
</P>
<P>
   The more radical of the two labor confederations gave him a
stern lecture on the evils of the International Monetary Fund's
rescue program, which includes maintaining high interest rates and
introducing greater flexibility in the labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Those two factors are faulted for pushing companies into
bankruptcy at the rate of 3,000 a month and putting 1.6 million
people out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the participants in the meeting understood the need
for broad-based support for reform in spite of the immediate pain.
``They were concerned that every sector of the economy bear a share
of the pain,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an attempt to assess that, he met the heads of four of the
five largest conglomerates, the Daewoo, Hyundai, Samsung and LG
groups, and a senior representative of the fifth group, SK, whose
chairman, Chey Jong-hyun, was ill.
</P>
<P>
   Government and other analysts are impatient with the large
groups' efforts to change. But in their meeting, on Tuesday, they
did express their commitment to reform, although the head of
Daewoo, Kim Woo-choong, avoided directly answering Rubin's question
about whether the groups would reduce their debt-to-equity ratios
to 2-to-1 by the end of the year, according to people at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the meeting Kim of Daewoo urged Rubin to do what
he could to further the imports and sales of Korean cars in the
United States. The Korean automobile business is running at 40
percent of capacity, because of virtually nonexistent domestic
demand and stiffer competition from Japanese manufacturers, who
have been helped by the weaker yen.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also met representatives of small and midsize enterprises
who pleaded with him to advocate lower interest rates, according to
those at the meeting. Interest rates on corporate debt have fallen,
to 16 percent for three-year notes from highs of up to 30 percent
when the crisis hit in December.
</P>
<P>
   But small businesses generally pay much higher rates than that,
and the cost of servicing debt is driving many entrepreneurs out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin reiterated American support for South Korea, pledging to
back additional lending from international sources. But he added
that he saw no need for such additional lending, because Korea has
$39 billion in foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the United States went through many of the
same painful adjustments that Korea is experiencing before it
emerged as the world's economic powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of mistakes,'' he said, ``and there's a lot to
be learned from our mistakes.'' &QL;

REACTIONS TO ``GONE WITH THE WIND''

   A POOR BOY'S VIEW
</P>
<P>
   My people are from the South, from the mountains of Virginia and
North Carolina. ``Gone With the Wind'' it ain't.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is the same to me as to others descended from poor
whites in the rural South: It's a story of how the other half
lived. The South I know is down dirt roads and up rutted mountains.
You won't find Tara there.
</P>
<P>
   What's left of my heritage is torn-down farmhouses and overgrown
cornfields. My forebears didn't pass down silver or linens saved
from pillaging Yankees. They handed down a story of Confederate
soldiers who hid horses at the mouth of their holler.
</P>
<P>
   I have an ancestor, Elliott Bingham, who fought and died for the
Confederate cause. But I know little about him. There are no
romantic stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   My relatives were Scottish and Irish immigrants. They worked
hard, minded their business and lived a life far removed from
belles and balls. I doubt they ever drank brandy or smoked cigars.
I do know they made moonshine and rolled cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone With the Wind'' is a wonderful story, nothing more.
Growing up watching the movie, I've seen more white-columned
mansions than my ancestors ever did.

   A TEXAS GIRL'S HEROINE
</P>
<P>
   I've lost count of how many dozens of times I've seen ``Gone
With the Wind.'' The first time, as an impressionable 8-year-old,
left me swimming in images: the beautiful plantations, the fiery
Scarlett, the gorgeous Rhett. For days, I talked constantly about
it with my very Southern mother.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, and in later adolescence, the mixed messages
bombarded me: I was terrified to think I would need an 18-inch
waist for someone handsome to like me, or that I could never eat
heartily in front of men.
</P>
<P>
   It was also appalling to think that life and love were about
suffering. Would I not find the right man? Would I be too blind to
know who the right man was? It took a while for me to figure out
that Scarlett made bad choices once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   But the more important lessons from Scarlett are those I've
found to be true on my own, and were probably some reflection of
Margaret Mitchell herself. Whether Southern or not, a woman can dig
down and find strength to get through tough times by sheer will.
She can stop worrying about herself and help those who need her
strength. She can find answers to impossible questions when
survival _ even emotional survival _ is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, when all seems hopeless, family and home do perform
miracles. They can save a life, and not just in the movies.
</P>

<P>
   FICTIONALLY, MY DEAR
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Mitchell may have been a good writer, but she was a
good liar, too. The ``pretty world of gallantry'' she created was
as remote from the historical reality of the pre-Civil War South as
Camelot was from the real medieval England.
</P>
<P>
   I call on the eyewitness testimony of Frederick Law Olmsted, a
journalist and agricultural expert from Connecticut who traversed
the South several times in the 1850s. A collection of his work,
``The Cotton Kingdom,'' was republished in 1953. Unfortunately,
although the novel ``Gone With the Wind'' is perennially available,
``The Cotton Kingdom'' is no longer in print.
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted describes a vast region that, in the years before the
Civil War, was constantly on the edge of economic ruin, with
widespread ecological devastation and famine. Forests and fields
were depleted and abandoned. Trains and boats ran days late. The
entire culture was hobbled by the inefficiency of the slave system,
with its absence of incentive. Children on plantations were often
isolated and uneducated; the lively social life suggested in the
opening passages of ``GWTW'' was rare indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Gallantry? Men _ slaveholders and overseers _ routinely beat
women viciously and enslaved their own children and grandchildren.
The nonconsensual sex forced on slave women was, in many ways, a
means of creating more property.
</P>
<P>
   Southern hospitality? Olmsted recounts stories of deathly ill
travelers being turned away from remote settlements and says that
he never stayed in a home in the South without being asked to pay
upon leaving. The rare inns were miserable, sometimes without
sanitary facilities. With few exceptions, Olmsted discovered an
entire population, including landowners and slaveholders,
subsisting mainly on sweet potatoes, corn bread and bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the movie and the skill and imagination that went into it.
But don't believe the underlying premise of a grand civilization
destroyed. Yes, the Civil War brought great destruction and
suffering to millions; but what was there beforehand wasn't so
great.

<P>
   Out there, on every two-lane blacktop in Texas, are two sure
things: a flattened armadillo and a Tara wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   In the country, the architectural influence of ``Gone With the
Wind'' is as pervasive as kudzu. The 2-story columns with Ionic
capitals form the gateway to the rural routes.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the columned facades are shallow facsimiles of grand
manors, 3-2s without the sweeping staircase. A self-styled Scarlett
built each one, and it is the house of her dreams. The antebellum
manse indicates social and financial success in the Wal-Mart
vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   To engage your traveling companions, hum a few bars of the
film's theme song every time you see a home belonging to the
Scarlett sisterhood, da DA da dum, da DA da de.
</P>

   Some people, usually children who have no personal ``Gone With
the Wind'' experience, say it's an extremely irritating car game.
Others find it a pleasant way to travel.

   BIRTHIN' STEREOTYPES
</P>
<P>
   Few lines from ``Gone With the Wind'' are as memorable as
Butterfly McQueen's warbling, squeaky cry: ``Lawsy, Miss Scah-lett!
I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies!''
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa, Fla., native's role as Prissy, the dippy young slave,
may have been the one she regretted most. But to me, a 10-year-old
born in the South and raised in Yankee territory, she only played
dumb. Young Prissy was a welcome relief from all that syrupy
sentiment and adult chatter about ``the Wahhr.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after my sister and I were born in Virginia and North
Carolina, respectively, my Southern parents whisked us off to the
cold Midwest in search of better schools and opportunity. Prissy's
world was foreign to me.
</P>
<P>
   In time, I learned that Butterfly McQueen would never shake the
dumb maid stereotype. I also learned that many folk would love to
live in a Technicolor South.
</P>
<P>
   Not this Southerner, sugah.
</P>
<P>
   As for Butterfly, she earned a political science degree from
City College in New York at 64. Twenty years later, in 1995, she
died in a kerosene fire at her home, a few hours' drive east of
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   She had long before dropped out of films. Hollywood would never
cast her in roles that showcased her talent. Now THAT'S what I call
dumb.

ECONOMIC SCENE: COULD URANIUM PRIVATIZATION AID NUCLEAR
PROLIFERATION? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ky.)   (bl)  
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Treasury's announcement Monday that it would soon privatize
the government's half-century-old uranium enrichment plants made
waves largely because of the proposed method of sale. While an
initial public offering of shares in a government-owned corporation
is not unprecedented, it is certainly a novelty in keeping with the
spirit of the high-flying stock market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the more important news is that the Treasury is moving
forward in spite of years of warnings that the sale would undermine
a key initiative for containing nuclear proliferation. For once the
United States Enrichment Corp. is privatized, the company will have
powerful financial incentives to find a means to back away from an
agreement to import 500 tons of bomb-grade uranium from Russia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Privatization is a foreign policy disaster waiting to
happen,'' argued Richard Falkenrath, an economist at Harvard's
Kennedy School of government.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cold War ended and Russia was left with a potent
nuclear arsenal, Tom Neff, a physicist at MIT, had a brainstorm.
Why not buy a chunk of Russia's stockpile of bomb-grade uranium,
blend it with natural uranium to make fuel for commercial power
reactors and resell it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why not, indeed: With much fanfare, Vice President Al Gore
struck the swords-to-plowshares deal with President Boris Yeltsin
in 1993. Russia would manufacture the reactor fuel from its bombs,
and Washington would sell the fuel on world markets. Minatom, the
Russian nuclear authority, with an estimated one million employees,
would get cash to cover the wages of its impoverished nuclear
scientists. Far less bomb-grade uranium would be left lying around
Russia for someone to steal. And all this would happen without a
dime from taxpayers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Enrichment Corp., the federal operator of the plants in
Ohio and Kentucky that enrich natural uranium to commercial reactor
fuel, was assigned to put the agreement in effect. That seemed the
obvious way to go, save for one fact: In an entirely unrelated
burst of enthusiasm for privatizing government assets, Congress had
earlier decreed that the public corporation should be sold to the
highest responsible bidder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stiglitz, then the chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, pointed to the conflict of interest. A
privatized, profit-maximizing U.S. Energy Corp., he argued, would
have an incentive to buy as little Russian enriched uranium as
possible _ at least as long as the price paid to the Russians was
higher than the corporation's own (heavily subsidized) cost of
producing each extra bit of reactor fuel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in a curious role reversal, the government's national
security establishment put the cause of reinventing government
ahead of keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of malefactors.
The State Department, Energy Department and the president's
National Security Council all insisted that the corporation would
do the right thing because federal watchdogs would otherwise
intervene.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stiglitz was outgunned, but not outargued: There was already
tangible evidence that the business conflict was real. For even as
public servants, the corporation's managers had been caught
secretly asking the Russians to slow deliveries to allow the
corporation to sell more from its own inventory. And by Neff's
analysis, the government's will to keep the corporation on the
straight and narrow is likely to be strained again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As long as the price paid to Russia is less than the prevailing
world price, the fuel can always be resold without cost to the
government. But Neff notes that the uranium fuel market is weak _
and will probably get weaker unless the Asian economies soon
recover from their funk. Thus it would hardly be a surprise if the
government were someday forced to choose between turning a blind
eye toward the U.S. Energy Corp.'s machinations or buying up
surplus Russian uranium fuel at the taxpayers' risk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would Washington invest billions of dollars to keep the
fissionable material flowing out of Russia? In a letter to Sen.
John Glenn, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Energy Secretary
Federico Pena assured him that ``if problems arise the
administration will not hesitate to add or replace executive
agents'' _ longhand for ``yes.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Falkenrath is skeptical. ``How likely is Congress to
appropriate money to buy Russian uranium that had, in effect, been
dumped by a privatized USEC,'' he asked? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If economists believe there is trouble looming down the road, so
apparently do the Energy Corp.'s investment bankers. After
subtracting the value of uranium inventories that the corporation
will retain and adding debts it will carry, the USEC's advisers
estimated that the government would realize between $1.15 and $1.45
billion from the public offering _ just four or five years' profit,
projecting from the corporation's fiscal performance in recent
years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just how would the taxpayers be better off selling USEC at five
times earnings rather than banking the cash flow? ``It beats me,''
said a frustrated Rep. Ted Strickland, a Democrat who represents
the Ohio district where one of the corporation's two plants is
situated. &QL;

FIRST LADY WATCHES TORAH FROM U.S. SANCTIFY ABANDONED CHINESE
TEMPLE

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ There was a time, earlier this century, when
Jews flocked to this city. Though traces of their lives are mostly
buried or lost, one prominent relic was revived Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a modest ceremony timed to coincide with a visit by the first
lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, an American rabbi sanctified the Ohel
Rachel temple with a Torah carried all the way from New York,
restoring a symbol of Jewish faith that had been neglected for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi, Arthur Schneier, said it was like bringing a
synagogue back to life. Graciously thanking the people of Shanghai
for taking in so many persecuted Jews when about 20,000 of them
fled here from Europe during World War II, Schneier said he also
hoped that the synagogue would now be protected from a wrecker's
ball. Four other former synagogues have disappeared in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beginning of Jewish life,'' Schneier said.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it is a modest beginning. The authorities in Shanghai
have not yet agreed to let the temple be used again as a place of
worship by the 200-plus members of Shanghai's expatriate Jewish
community.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so anytime soon may be difficult, because China's
government, which supervises religious worship tightly, does not
include Judaism among the five officially recognized religions. The
five are Protestant Christianity, Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism and
Taoism.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton called the restoration of the synagogue ``a very
good example of respect for religious differences and appreciation
for the importance of faith in one's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews hold a special place in the history of Shanghai. Several
Iraqi Jewish families moved here in the late 19th century and went
on to dominate the real estate, securities and banking businesses.
Eventually, tycoons with names like Sassoon, Kadoorie and Hardoon
were among the city's most prominent residents.
</P>
<P>
   Six synagogues were built _ including Ohel Rachel, named for the
wife of Jacob Sassoon, in 1920. At the Shanghai Jewish community's
peak in 1945, it had about 25,000 members. Virtually all of them
left after the Communist Party came to power in 1949 and made
foreigners unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, Ohel Rachel was a warehouse, dusty and
unkempt from years of disuse. Efforts to restore it began only this
year, after Schneier persuaded Shanghai's mayor that it was worth
saving.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the synagogue's walls were a freshly painted white,
marble columns gleamed and crystal chandeliers hung from an arched
roof. Schneier brought the Torah from Park East Synagogue on East
67th Street in Manhattan. He is that congregation's senior rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 26 Torahs, so now we have 25,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whose family was
originally Jewish, also visited the old synagogue Wednesday with
Mrs. Clinton. She did not comment afterward, so the loquacious
Schneier spoke for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows from personal experience about religious
persecution,'' he said. ``She has placed an enormous amount of
energy and effort into religious freedom, and I'm sure deep down it
comes from her personal experience.''  &QL;

<P>
   Has Boeing turned the corner?
</P>
<P>
   The company's top executives all but said so Wednesday during a
teleconference with analysts and reporters. Boeing began the
monthly conferences last fall to chart the progress of an emergency
recovery plan it put in place after its commercial airplane
operations became plagued by huge and costly production delays.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the company said it delivered 61 airplanes in
June, the highest one-month total ever, and was on course to meet
its goal of delivering 550 jets this year. It also said there would
be no more monthly updates. ``The recovery portion of the plan is
now over,'' declared Boeing chairman and chief executive Philip
Condit, though he insisted that the company still faced
considerable challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing shares rose 6.45 percent Wednesday, or $2.875, closing at
$47.4375. But only last week the stock fell to a 52-week low of
$42.75 a share. Boeing is down 3 percent for the year, compared
with an 18.4 percent rise in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many analysts remain bearish, citing blistering price
competition with its European rival, Airbus Industrie, continuing
weakness in Asia and the specter of rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts and some investors contend that few on the
Street fully understand how military contractors like Boeing
account for production, saying that such accounting can
overestimate or underestimate actual earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bad as things have been at Boeing, the way they are
accounting for them makes them look worse,'' said George Shapiro,
the aerospace analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Boeing appears to have its production problems under
control, the company's financial performance could improve rapidly,
a number of analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Because the initial cost of designing and building a new
airplane can be many billions of dollars, Boeing, along with other
military contractors, uses a system called program accounting.
Rather than absorb all the costs at once, depressing earnings,
Boeing averages them over an estimated number of airplanes it
expects to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The practice began in the 1960s with the 707, Boeing's first
commercial jet, and it has continued through the 747 jumbojet to
the 777, Boeing's newest airplane. Traditionally, the first block
equals 400 planes, even if Boeing has received orders for only as
fraction of that number.
</P>
<P>
   The practice helps smooth out earnings but it is considered
risky because there is no guarantee that all the planes in the
initial block will actually be sold. When McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
which was bought by Boeing last year, built its MD-11 wide-body
jet, it chose to average the costs over an estimated 300 airplanes.
But in 1995 the company was forced to acknowledged that it would
never sell that many planes, resulting in a $1.8 billion charge.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Boeing's new 737 narrow-body jet, however, the
opposite happened. Following its tradition, the company decided to
average the costs of the new plane over 400 units. But the
so-called Next-Generation 737 has proved wildly popular with
airlines around the world. Boeing now has firm orders for more than
800 of the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Since last fall, production problems on the 737 have forced
Boeing to take more than $1 billion in charges. The company is now
technically losing money on the airplane. But that is only because
it does not officially recognize the more than 400 additional
orders. Counting even a portion of these would immediately put the
737 in the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 737 was unique because the backlog actually exceeded the
quantity in the program,'' said Boeing controller Gary Beil. ``But
we used the same quantity as other programs, which was
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Another feature of program accounting is that it can
artificially understate earnings as more planes are produced. That
is because the first planes built are the most expensive. As the
operation gains more efficiency and the initial cost of design and
tooling are spread over more units, the costs decline.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore plane No. 400 costs considerably less to produce than
the amount carried on Boeing's books, which is equal to the average
production cost for all 400 planes. The result is more cash for
Boeing at the end of the block than earnings suggest.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where Boeing is right now with its two newest
programs, the 777 and the 737 Next-Generation. Boeing will not say
when, but it will soon have to extend the blocks on both programs,
something many investors believe will sharply increase its
financial results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you extend that block, all your fixed costs start to come
down and all of a sudden the profitability increases,'' said
Stephan J. Klaffke, who manages the equity portfolio for USAA
insurance _ which owns 1.5 million shares of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   But others note that Boeing's performance will only improve if
it succeeds in producing its planes more efficiently _ something it
has had trouble doing lately _ and if it is not forced to sacrifice
profits to win orders away from Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors don't have perfect information because they don't in
fact know what the costs are of the airplanes from 400 to 900 and
what prices they were sold at,'' said Wolfgang Demisch, an
aerospace analyst with BT Alex Brown. ``I think they were sold at
very big discounts to the likes of American and others and so
Boeing won't make much profit on them.''
</P>
<P>
   And if economic instability in Asia spreads to Europe and North
America and if oil prices rise, putting more pressure on airlines,
some of the orders that Boeing now counts as firm may not remain
so.

<P>
   The company has said that it will not extend the block on the
737 until it is absolutely sure that its production difficulties
are behind it. But there have also been discussions within Boeing
about simply eliminating program accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that Harry Stonecipher, the former chief executive
of McDonnell Douglas who is now Boeing's president, believes that
the company is now large enough to absorb big up-front investments
in new planes and that ending the practice would give investors a
truer picture of performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things that have been evaluated and
considered,'' a Boeing spokesman said. ``But at this time there are
no plans to change it.''

CHINA WARNS EX-OFFICIAL TO STOP GIVING INTERVIEWS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former senior Chinese official who was jailed for
opposing the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown has been warned three
times by the Chinese authorities to stop talking to foreign
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The latest warning came on Sunday, only a day after President
Clinton's news conference with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. But
the former official, Bao Tong, has continued to speak out, giving
an interview on Tuesday to the Voice of America's Mandarin-language
service.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American officials said Wednesday that Bao's fate is ``a
topic of significant interest'' to the Clinton Administration. But
they added that they could not say whether Bao's case had been
raised by Clinton in his private conversations with Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Bao, 66, is no dissident. He served as chief of staff to former
Communist Party Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted days before
the June 1989 crackdown and who remains under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Bao, who was jailed then and held for almost seven years, until
May 1996, has used Clinton's visit to speak out about the failings
of the current government. Zhao himself circulated a letter to the
party's Central Committee just before Clinton arrived, calling on
it to reverse its harsh judgment on the demonstrations in the
square, which are officially considered a ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bao gave an interview to CBS News, which was taped by hidden
cameras, and televised on Monday. Bao's son, Bao Pu, said in an
interview that the security police came to his father's Beijing
apartment after the taping on Sunday, presumably because the
apartment is bugged, and spent two hours there.
</P>
<P>
   They said that Bao had violated the law by giving interviews to
foreign journalists without authorization, but Bao answered that
Jiang himself had said the day before that ``every Chinese citizen
is given freedom of speech by the Constitution,'' his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Bao also gave an interview in Beijing to The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bao's third warning from the police, who had also told
him on June 4 and June 8, nearly three weeks before Clinton's
arrival, that he must not give interviews to foreign journalists.
On June 3, The Washington Post had printed its own interview with
Bao. Bao also spoke to The New York Times for a June 25 article
about the Zhao letter; in that interview he said, ``Political
reform is the biggest issue in China today.''
</P>
<P>
   His son, Bao Pu, who lives in the United States, said Wednesday
that Bao and his family are nervous about what will happen after
Clinton leaves China this weekend, but that his father intends to
keep testing the new Chinese openness. Bao is followed by the
police wherever he goes, Bao Pu said.
</P>
<P>
   In his father's colloquy with the security police, his son said,
Bao asked whether he was guilty of any crime by speaking to
foreigners who had themselves failed to get Foreign Ministry
authorization for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police said it was a mistake for him to give any more
interviews,'' Bao Pu said, but his father responded: ``It's not
your job to tell me what's right and wrong; it's your job to tell
me what's legal or illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bao Pu said he had asked his father's judgment of Clinton's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father said, `One cannot overestimate the short-term
effect, but no one should underestimate the long-term effect.''

HOUSTON: THE WORLD CAPITAL OF AIR CONDITIONING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ What heat wave?
</P>
<P>
   The professionals eating lunch at the cafes in the
air-conditioned pedestrian tunnels that wind under downtown were in
suits and long-sleeved dresses and sweaters. One takeout
establishment, The Coffee Bar, was advertising hot cocoa `` for
those cold days.'' People were buying it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's even hotter and more humid here this summer than it
has been in recent memory, with temperatures hovering near 100
degrees in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the conditions outside. Who but out-of-towners,
and the diehards, goes outside? For all the legendary toughness of
Texans, when it comes to summer, Houstonians concede, they stay
indoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pantywaists,'' said Charles Valentine. ``They want air
conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Valentine is complaining. He makes his living repairing
air-conditioners. Summer is when Houston makes much of its
self-proclaimed reputation as the Air-Conditioning Capital of the
World.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt mindful of the reports of unenticing, steamy days and
nights _ caused by its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico _ the
Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau advertises these
facts:
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent of all the homes in the area, and just about
every business, is air-conditioned. Most Houstonians run their
air-conditioners seven months a year. The Astrodome, built in 1965,
was the world's first air-conditioned domed stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks are air-conditioned. And the tunnels, which link
the major downtown office buildings and offer everything from
underground dining to banking to dry cleaning, make it possible to
work downtown without ever venturing outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without freon, we'd be dead,'' said John Prewitt, a Coffee Bar
regular. Prewitt, a banker, was dressed for the air-conditioning in
a long-sleeved shirt, a navy blazer and dark trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, people have been drawn to Houston by, among
other things, its oil, its world-class hospitals and the aeorospace
industry. Dave Debien says he moved here from Ohio 25 years ago
because, well, because of the air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live it, I breathe it, I love it,'' he said. ``Houston is
the most air-conditioned city in the world. This is IT.''
</P>
<P>
   Debien is known around town as the guru of air-conditioning. He
owns an air-conditioning installation and repair company, lectures
and writes on the subject, and appears regularly on a local radio
show to field questions about air-conditioning for three hours at a
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live without computers,'' Debien said. ``We can't live
without air-conditioning. It's like running water.'' Expensive
running water. Debien charges $60 to $80 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   On June 24, Debien, 50, got out of the hospital after an
angioplasty. The next day, he was back at work. The office phones
were ringing off the hook. Air-conditioning systems were breaking
down. People were hot, and they were desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't stand to be three or four degrees away from their
normal comfort level,'' Debien said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hierarchy of desperation among the overheated. When
Bethany Hughes telephoned, in tears, Debien moved her instantly to
the top of the list. Mrs. Hughes is 8{ months pregnant. ``A woman
eight months pregnant, with no air,'' he said. ``That's as close to
a catastrophe as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Debien was in his air-conditioned Chevy Suburban, heading for
the wealthy River Oaks section, where his men were installing
central air-conditioning for a new homeowner.
</P>
<P>
   Most Houstonians have central air, Debien said. ``I don't do
window units,'' he said. ``I didn't say to the surgeon when I went
in for my angioplasty, `While you're in there, can you fix that
liver problem?' I'm a specialist.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Houston summers, there are two kinds of women: Those who go
bare-legged, and those who would not consider appearing in public
without pantyhose, not even when the air is so thick that breathing
is a chore.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter category is Betsy Parish, who writes an Internet
gossip column for Microsoft's city guide, houston.sidewalk.com.
``It's a mark of being dressed,'' Ms. Parish said. At lunch at the
fashionable La Griglia restaurant, she was wearing a black long
sleeved top, white cotton pants, white pantyhose and black strappy
sandals. But she was indoors.
</P>
<P>
   She showed her mettle recently when attending an outdoor
ceremony to dedicate a Texas state historical marker in honor of
her great-great-grandfather, Horace Dickinson Taylor, one of the
early mayors of Houston. It was close to 100 degrees, yet Ms.
Parish wore a light green suit and beige panty hose.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Ms. Parish demands perpetual cool. She recalled her
meltdown last summer, when she felt hot in her own home. Declaring
an emergency, she summoned an air-conditioning repairman. ``He
waved that wand in the air that checks the temperature, and said,
`Miss Parish, is 64 degrees too warm for you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The air-conditioning was working just fine. ``I was having a hot
flash,'' Ms. Parish said.

<P>
   CHURCH OF THE BRETHREN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEMBERSHIP: About 150,000 in more than 1,000 congregations in
the United States and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY: The Church of the Brethren developed as an outgrowth of
radical Pietism in early 18th-century Germany; in fact, much of the
group's theology and practice came from the Pietists of the 17th
and 18th centuries, who were mostly Lutherans unhappy with their
state church.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Brethren immigrated to the American colonies in the
1720s, and an American congregation was established in Germantown,
Pa., in 1723. Until the 20th century, the group's name was the
German Baptist Brethren.
</P>
<P>
   After coming to America, the Brethren were not opposed to urban
life, but most preferred farming and agricultural life. From the
1790s to the 1850s, congregations were established in Kentucky,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, California and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Brethren separated themselves from secular influences, opposed
slavery and wore distinctive, plain dress. The leaders they
selected were not paid and had no theological education, and all
Brethren agreed not to vote, take oaths or enter into lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 20th century, the Brethren were known as
``Dunkers'' because of their unusual practice of baptizing by
triple immersion: in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Tension in the late 19th century caused a division in the
church, and three factions developed: the original group, ``old
order'' traditionalists and a progressive movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of the Brethren is one of the three historic ``peace
churches,'' along with the Mennonites and the Quakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Brethren opposed military service during the American
Revolution and Civil War; in following years, they were allowed to
avoid involvement in war efforts as conscientious objectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Brethren have made several changes this century. For the
most part, they no longer wear the plain dress they were known for,
and their leaders are now professional, salaried pastors. Women
became eligible for ordination in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEFS: The Church of the Brethren has historically resisted
creeds, but the Brethren focus on spiritual life and piety
developed through prayer, Bible study and association with fellow
believers. The church is not considered an organization that
formulates doctrine as much as it is a supportive group of people
who love God and one another.
</P>
<P>
   DAILY LIFE: The Brethren emphasize daily devotion, stewardship
and care for those less fortunate. The church opposes violence,
divorce and remarriage, as well as oath-taking, voting and
attention-getting or distracting dress.
</P>
<P>
   The love feast is the most significant feature of Brethren
worship. The communion service includes foot washing, a love meal
and the partaking of unleavened bread and wine or grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   The church is affiliated with six accredited liberal arts
colleges and a seminary in Indiana. The Brethren are best known
internationally for their relief and rehabilitation work in Europe
after World War II.

ARTISTS SEE NO DECENCY IN RULING ON GRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision upholding a decency test for federal
arts grants has been greeted by a wave of disappointment in the
world of the arts. Performance artists directly affected by last
week's ruling vigorously condemned it, while the response of
playwrights and others ranged from the embattled to the calmly
accepting.
</P>
<P>
   All who spoke on the issue expressed confusion about the
vagueness of the court's language and the difficulty of determining
just what decency is.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member court majority (only Justice David Souter
dissented) insisted that their intention in ruling against Karen
Finley and the three other performance artists known as the NEA
Four _ Tim Miller, Holly Hughes and John Fleck _ was advisory
rather than compulsory.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the ruling did the court say that such standards
would be applied. The subject seemed to be left up in the air, with
each grant to be scrutinized individually. But even if the National
Endowment for the Arts should decide not to use taste as a
criterion in making grants, artists said, state and local officials
(in libraries, schools and theaters) might see the ruling as a
license to limit liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strongest reaction came on the Internet. One music
student said, ``I hope those who'll be making the `decency'
decisions aren't anything like my grandpa, or else it'll be
Lawrence Welk for the rest of my life.'' Another said, ``If Jesse
Helms can decide whether or not Karen Finley can bathe herself in
chocolate on our dime, perhaps your local town council can decide
that your band is just a little too radical to play the Fourth of
July gig in the town square.''
</P>
<P>
   Mac Wellman, one of the most politically minded of American
playwrights, has had his own collision with Helms, the North
Carolina Republican senator who is a longtime foe of government
support for what he has called obscene art.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my knowledge, there is nothing about public standards of
decency in the Constitution,'' Wellman said. ``But there is a great
deal about civil liberties. This incredible decision is a victory
for those who want to control freedom of expression for their own
ends, and that's an obscenity.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from Northern Ireland, where he is working
with the Exile Theater, Wellman said: ``It's a political decision
masking as one concerned with obscenity. What it is really about is
marginalizing opinions that are different, and I think that's a
major setback for civil liberties in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellman called it shocking that poets, novelists and others
outside the theater did not seem to be taking the Supreme Court's
decision more seriously. He asked, ``Have you heard from any poet
laureates on this issue?''
</P>
<P>
   When he was contacted, Robert Pinsky, the U.S. poet laureate,
deferred comment, saying that he had not read the decision and did
not ``know enough about it yet.'' Others also responded in that
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Finley, the performance artist at the center of the storm,
said she regarded the decision as a personal affront as well as a
strike against artistic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it that the Supreme Court has decided my work is
indecent,'' she said. Through her performances, in which she is
often nude, she makes a graphic statement about the abuse of women.
She does not consider her performances to be indecent, she said,
but she does not believe that indecency should even be considered
in making grants. To her and others, the only grounds should be
artistic merit.
</P>
<P>
   After the court decision, she was besieged for comments and
decided to hold a news conference in the middle of a performance of
her current show, ``The Return of the Chocolate-Smeared Woman'' at
the Flea Theater in New York City. Emboldened by the theatricality
of that event, she said she may have more performance news
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Coincident with the decision, the House Appropriations Committee
voted in favor of financing the arts endowment. Ms. Finley's
analysis: ``The eight justices did not make a constitutional
decision. They made a decision purely based on politics. The result
was to keep the endowment, so it could continue not to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Miller recalled that he had faced charges of indecency
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both a long time ago,'' he said. ``In 1947 `All My
Sons' opened in Boston, and the Catholic Church condemned it
because of a line: `A man can't be a Jesus in this world.' They
forbade their members to see the play. When they forbade `All My
Sons,' around the corner was the raunchiest burlesque show of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second was when the Legion of Decency viewed `The Misfits'
before it was released and demanded certain changes. The main one
was the scene in which Marilyn Monroe in a fit of despair walks out
of the house and embraces a tree. That represented to them
masturbation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a continuing age-old universal argument between
decency and the human body. It goes on and on and on. This time
it's especially obnoxious. Certain kinds of art will always be
called indecent, and they need support.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   About Ms. Finley, Miller said: ``Anyone who smears herself with
chocolate needs all the support she can get. If she covered herself
in vanilla, they might not have been so outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   David Rabe, whose plays deal with challenging subjects (most
recently, in ``A Question of Mercy,'' with AIDS and assisted
suicide), said he felt uncomfortable about being represented in
this issue by performance artists, but he accepted that fact and
tried to place the decision in a larger context.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said the ruling was part of ``a juggernaut, a recent
manifestation of a fundamental hatred of art, of anything that does
not coddle the public, that is not entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not surprised by the decision: ``It's par for the
course. The whole argument is, let the marketplace decide. To
suggest that things should rise and fall on the marketplace is a
form of censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial shows that might be accused of bad taste would be
unaffected, because they do not receive public funds. Those who
would suffer are experimental artists who tackle difficult subjects
and need financial support in order to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Miller, another of the NEA Four, said that ever since the
case began eight years ago, his opportunities had decreased. He has
not been invited to perform at any university in the Southeast.
``People are cautious, and they are frank,'' he said. If they book
his show, ``they would be afraid of losing their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe suggested that Ms. Finley, as a performance artist with a
high profile, was being used as a target, but that the real aim was
far more complex and inclusive, and that many others would be
affected. These would include composers as well as authors, and
even artists from the past, as classics are brought into question.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, the lawyer representing the four artists before the
Supreme Court, said he was disappointed in the result, but he took
a conciliatory position about the judgment. ``It's important to
acknowledge that the decision is not as bad as it appears,'' he
said. He indicated that he was heartened by the advisory aspect,
what Justice Antonin Scalia in his concurring judgment referred to
in a negative way as ``the gutting of the statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole did express his concern about the cultural and political
impact of the decision, saying: ``I likened the case to the battle
over academic freedom in the 1950s and '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright David Henry Hwang said that the chilling effect
of the decision was ``more a result of the cultural battle, the
right wing demonizing the NEA.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Cole, he took some comfort in the decision: ``All
things being equal, I would have been happy if the decency standard
had been declared unconstitutional. It's a bad decision, but it's
the one we have, and we have to figure out how to strategize. It's
important for the arts community to be vigilant. We as artists can
mitigate it somewhat by being aware of what's being turned down, on
a case-by-case basis. We can try to influence the process to make
it more favorable to artistic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The painter Leon Golub said: ``One of the ways civilized
societies work in theory is by self-censorship. People who make the
decisions are usually sophisticated or subtle enough not to
provoke. Or if they want to provoke for political reasons, they
know how to stretch a point. Everyone knows how to play the game.
It's really pathetic: these congressmen and the Supreme Court are
responding in a frightened way to pressures being brought in our
culture by right-wing groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will make the decisions about standards of decency? Ann
Beeson, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said she
worried that it might not even be people, but computer software.
She pointed to the proliferation of blocking software designed to
filter out pornography. It is on sale at computer stores, and more
expensive systems are available to libraries and other
institutions. These blockers are so inaccurate as to be, in her
word, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for words and images dealing with sexual matters, they
``block out certain kinds of art sites, including classic paintings
of nudes,'' Ms. Beeson said. ``They can't tell the difference
between pornographic pictures and Botticelli.''
</P>
<P>
   In what might be called Software of the Absurd, programs have
managed to block out the Quakers, the American Association of
University Women and the entire San Francisco Chronicle Web site,
Ms. Beeson said. She added that such software was sold under brand
names like Net Nanny and Surf Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Net Nanny is watching. If the Quakers are in jeopardy, what room
will there be for the Chocolate-Smeared Woman?

1790s to the 1850s, congregations were established in Kentucky,
Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, California and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Brethren separated themselves from secular influences, opposed
slavery and wore distinctive, plain dress. The leaders they
selected were not paid and had no theological education, and all
Brethren agreed not to vote, take oaths or enter into lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 20th century, the Brethren were known as
``Dunkers'' because of their unusual practice of baptizing by
triple immersion: in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Tension in the late 19th century caused a division in the
church, and three factions developed: the original group, ``old
order'' traditionalists and a progressive movement.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of the Brethren is one of the three historic ``peace
churches,'' along with the Mennonites and the Quakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Brethren opposed military service during the American
Revolution and Civil War; in following years, they were allowed to
avoid involvement in war efforts as conscientious objectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Brethren have made several changes this century. For the
most part, they no longer wear the plain dress they were known for,
and their leaders are now professional, salaried pastors. Women
became eligible for ordination in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEFS: The Church of the Brethren has historically resisted
creeds, but the Brethren focus on spiritual life and piety
developed through prayer, Bible study and association with fellow
believers. The church is not considered an organization that
formulates doctrine as much as it is a supportive group of people
who love God and one another.
</P>
<P>
   DAILY LIFE: The Brethren emphasize daily devotion, stewardship
and care for those less fortunate. The church opposes violence,
divorce and remarriage, as well as oath-taking, voting and
attention-getting or distracting dress.
</P>
<P>
   The love feast is the most significant feature of Brethren
worship. The communion service includes foot washing, a love meal
and the partaking of unleavened bread and wine or grape juice.
</P>
<P>
   The church is affiliated with six accredited liberal arts
colleges and a seminary in Indiana. The Brethren are best known
internationally for their relief and rehabilitation work in Europe
after World War II.

 &HT;    NationsBank launches CashPay program
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- NationsBank announced a payroll debit card Wednesday,
calling it ``a win-win proposition for all concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good deal for businesses and for the bank, because
electronic banking is much cheaper than making a transaction with a
teller.
</P>
<P>
   But it might not be such a good deal for the cardholders.
</P>
<P>
   CashPay cards are aimed at employees who don't have bank
accounts, a group that consists primarily of poor people.
Cardholders will have to pay to withdraw money, and might have to
pay charges that their employers had once paid.
</P>
<P>
   In launching the card, the Charlotte-headquartered banking
company is competing with check-cashing mills that in Georgia can
charge $5 or 5 percent of the value of the check, whichever is
higher.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank said the card makes it easier for people without
bank accounts to get their cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advantages of the CashPay debit card include 24-hour ATM
availability and the relief of employees without bank accounts from
having to provide IDs or, in some cases, fingerprints'' at
check-cashing outlets, said Julie Turner Davis, a NationsBank
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The debit cards can be used at ATM machines or point-of-sale
terminals. But each transaction costs $1.50 - and possibly another
$1.50 or more for using machines outside the NationsBank networks.
</P>
<P>
   A Consumer Federation survey of check cashers in 23 of the
largest urban areas found the average cost of cashing a paycheck
was 2.34 percent of the face value of the check, said Jean Ann Fox
of the Consumer Federation of America, based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The range was 1 percent to 6 percent. So if you had a $320
paycheck, it would cost about $7.50 to cash the check (assuming a
2.34 percent charge),'' she said. ``And $1.50 is certainly cheaper
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox questioned why cardholders would have to pay a fee at
all to get their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the face of it, the employer should pay the cost of
delivering the paycheck, and not the employee paying the cost of
getting it, especially since the employee isn't getting any other
banking services,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this looks like is that the employer is shifting the cost
of issuing paychecks to the employee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have designed the product so that the employers could pick
up the fees if they so choose,'' said Linda Diehl marketing manager
of CashPay for NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs the government 44 cents to print, handle, and mail
federal checks,'' said Fox. ``There ought to be enough savings in
electronically delivering payroll checks, rather than printing and
mailing them, to cover the cost of access'' at an ATM machine.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, electronic banking is a big money saver. It costs banks
an average of 12 cents to do an electronic funds transfer, 20 cents
for a direct deposit, 60 cents for an ATM withdrawal, but $1.90 to
$2.30 for a teller withdrawal, said Kim Sutherland, director of
Atlanta-based Market Line Associates, a bank consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Processing electronic based transactions is certainly cheaper
than paper-based transactions,'' said James Smart, a senior vice
president at NationsBank. But he said the charges cover the costs
of direct-deposit, electronic processing, the ATM transaction, and
the cost of the account for non-bank customers.

 &HT;    E. coli toll hits 20
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna and Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- One additional case of infection with E. coli O157:H7
has brought the total count in the White Water outbreak to 20,
public health authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year-old boy from Cobb County who is hospitalized, but not
ill enough to require dialysis, was confirmed by lab tests as
another White Water case, said Dr. Paul Blake of the Georgia
Division of Public Health. The boy visited White Water on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a case that we had known about for a few days, but his
lab tests were pending,'' said Blake, chief of DPH's epidemiology
section.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic testing continues on the 13 cases in Georgia and 7 cases
in five other states. DNA profiles have been completed on five of
the earliest Georgia cases. State scientists hope that, when all
the genetic tests are done, they will be able to say definitively
which of the cases are linked to the White Water park, where
officials believe a child or children defecated in a kiddie pool on
June 11, 12 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   DPH personnel are also waiting for genetic fingerprints on four
other cases of E. coli O157, a potentially life-threatening strain
of a common bacteria. Those cases _ Mary Beth and Anna Dooley of
Hull, and two children from near Athens whom health authorities
decline to identify _ have no known link to the water park.
</P>
<P>
   Once the full range of tests on those cases are complete,
scientists will be able to tell whether the cases constitute a
separate cluster, or whether they are connected to the White Water
outbreak in some unexplained way.
</P>
<P>
   Among the flags that investigators will be watching for, he
said: Whether any of the infected children, in Athens or in the
White Water outbreak, have subsequently infected other children.
Because the incubation period for O157 _ the lag between infection
and the development of symptoms _ can last eight days, those cases
may be showing up in doctors' offices now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the current outbreak, six children with E. coli are
hospitalized at two metro children's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Two girls, ages 4 and 2, are in critical condition at Scottish
Rite Medical Center, and a 3-year-old boy and a 10-year-old boy are
in fair condition, said hospital spokeswoman Kim Lathbury. And a
2-year-old boy is in fair condition and a 3-year-old boy is in good
condition at Egleston Children's Hospital, said hospital
spokeswoman Julie Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said that even though no tainted burgers from Costco
were shipped to Georgia, consumers shouldn't be complacent.
</P>
<P>
   They still need to make sure they cook all hamburger meat until
the juice runs clear from the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Hamburger and any other ground meat from cattle should always be
cooked until the meat is no longer pink, said
</P>
<P>
   CDC spokesman Tom Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prevention goes way beyond the recall,'' he said. ``The bottom
line is they still need to cook their ground beef.''

 &HT;    Star Banc Corp buys Firstar Corp.
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI -- Cincinnati-based Star Banc Corp. said Wednesday it
will buy Firstar Corp., based in Milwaukee, for stock worth about
$7.2 billion. The deal will create the 21st largest bank holding
company in the country, with assets of more than $38 billion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have 720 branch locations (which
include branches from pending acquisitions of both companies), more
than 1,400 automated teller machines and offices in eight
Midwestern states and Arizona, plus trust operations in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after days of rumor and increased activity
on the stock market. The merger is expected to be completed
sometime in the fourth quarter, pending shareholder and regulatory
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Star Banc will shed its name and take on Firstar's name as well
as its headquarters in Milwaukee. However, consumer banking and
specialized lending operations will be based in Cincinnati. Firstar
chairman and chief executive Roger L. Fitzsimonds will become
chairman. Jerry A. Grundhofer, Star Banc's chairman, president and
chief executive will become president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Firstar shareholders will receive a tax-free exchange of 0.76
shares of common stock of the combined company for each share of
Firstar common stock, while Star Banc shareholders will retain one
share of common stock in the combined company for each Star Banc
share.
</P>
<P>
   Firstar stock (NYSE: FSR) closed Wednesday at 46, up 8 3/16.
Star Banc stock (NYSE: STB) closed at 63, down . Star Banc's
Wednesday's closing price represents a price of $48.35 for each
Firstar share in the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement Star Banc and Firstar said that ``some job
reductions are expected, primarily in headquarters and
administrative positions.'' How many Cincinnati positions will be
moved to Milwaukee, and how many overall jobs will be lost is
unknown, said Firstar spokesman Patrick Strickler. ``It is too
early for anybody to answer that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how Star Banc's Community Development Initiative
would impact the new organization, Strickler deferred to another
company statement. ``Both companies are committed to achieving an
outstanding (Community Reinvestment Act) rating after the merger,''
it said.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year, $5.15 billion loan program was announced in
February to make more money available to low- and moderate-income
homeowners, small businesses and community development groups in
Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Star Banc spokesman Steve Dale could not be reached for comment
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Crabtree, an analyst with Dain Rausher in Minneapolis, said
the failure of Firstar's First Forward plan, a massive
restructuring effort, contributed greatly to the decision to merge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Firstar adopted the plan, they put themselves on the
line,'' Crabtree said. ``If they performed well and their stock
price was high, they would remain independent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Firstar fell short of its financial goals. ``The investment
community concluded since (Firstar) failed to deliver its promises
to shareholders, shareholders would demand that it be sold,''
Crabtree said.
</P>
<P>
   Star Banc and Firstar estimate that the merger will allow them
to reduce their expenses by $174 million, with half of this saving
achieved in 1999 and the remainder in 2000.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ President Clinton, in his last opportunity to
address a mass audience in China, said Wednesday that he would
continue to speak out on behalf of democracy and individual liberty
but that the United States did not seek to dictate the path of
China's development.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with China's main government-run television
network, which is to be broadcast on Thursday, Clinton said that
China's current course of economic liberalization and greater
personal freedom was ``morally right'' and that the status of the
United States as the world's lone superpower did not give it the
right to use economic and military might to impose its values on
China or any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the interview Clinton sent subtle and somewhat
contradictory messages to different audiences in China. His words
offered reassurance to President Jiang Zemin and other leaders in
Beijing that the United States would not and could not impose its
will on China.
</P>
<P>
   But he also signaled to ordinary Chinese citizens _ and to
domestic critics of his policy of engagement with China _ that he
would continue to press Beijing to allow greater personal freedom
and take steps toward a more open political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a genuine movement toward openness and freedom
in China, which obviously as an American, and as an American
president, I hope will continue and increase and which I believe is
right _ morally right _ but I also think it's good for China,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked whether the world needed a single leader to
mediate disputes within and among nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short answer to your question is yes, the world needs a
leader, but not in the sense of one country telling everyone else
what to do,'' Clinton said. ``So it's a different sort of world
leadership than in the past where it's just a question of who has
the biggest army gets to send a list of instructions to another
country and you think it will be done. That's not the way the world
works now.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave as examples the intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Haiti by the United States and its efforts to mobilize other
nations to combat drug trafficking, weapons proliferation and
ethnic conflict. He said the way to obtain results in the
post-Cold-War world is to forge alliances to exert influence,
rather than trying to act unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so the United States' role I think is to try to create a
structure where more likely than not the right things will be done
when problems arise _ not to just do it all ourselves or tell other
people what to do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House sought this interview because an earlier one
with the network, China Central Television, held before Clinton
left Washington, was heavily edited by the Chinese authorities and
received little notice in China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   United States officials said they had received assurances that
Wednesday's interview would be broadcast in its entirety. It was
conducted by Shui Junyi, anchor of CCTV-1's popular public affairs
program ``Focus'' and Chen Xiaowei, an anchor on CCTV-4, the state
network's international channel and host of a Sunday news program.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning was gentle, particularly compared to the
grilling Clinton got from several students at Beijing University on
Monday, who challenged him on U.S. policy toward Taiwan and human
rights in America.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked when he first became interested in China and gave a
vintage Clintonian response. He said he was eight or nine years old
and reading an encyclopedia and came across the entry about China.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I was fascinated by what I read,'' Clinton said. ``I
always wanted to come here from that time on.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the most gratifying thing about his trip was the
decision by Jiang to allow their Saturday press conference and his
speech at Beijing University to be carried live on Chinese
television. He said he was surprised and pleased by the decision to
allow the ``open, sweeping communication'' with the Chinese people
that those two events afforded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, I think, was very good,'' Clinton said. ``I think it was
also good for the Chinese leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sat for the 20-minute interview at the modern Shanghai
Stock Exchange, where earlier he had received a rousing welcome
from enthusiastic traders on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   At the exchange, Clinton conducted a roundtable discussion with
young entrepreneurs, who told him of the difficulties in starting a
new business, securing venture capital and dealing with the
bureaucracy. Clinton told the business people that they were an
important force for change in China and a source of the new jobs
that will be needed as state-owned enterprises close.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Clinton visited a housing development to
witness a relatively new phenomenon in China _ the private
ownership of homes. The Jin Hui Gardens complex opened five years
ago, offering Chinese families the opportunity to buy their own
apartments for $42,200 to $96,500, according to figures provided by
the developers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told families assembled at the development that home
ownership represents an investment in society and the bedrock of
middle-class life.
</P>
<P>
   ``All China benefits from more homeowners because that means
more jobs, a stronger economy, stronger families,'' Clinton said.
``And, of course, when people own their own homes, they are free to
take new jobs without worrying about losing housing benefits. We
also see around the world that homeowners take more responsibility
for the communities in which they live.''
</P>
<P>
   The president announced a new joint U.S.-China program to
promote the construction of affordable, energy-efficient housing.
He also said that American officials would work with Beijing to
create a middle-income mortgage-lending market and to strengthen
legal rights for property owners.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton is to fly to Guilin, a picturesque city on
the Li River, where he will deliver an address on the environment.
He continues on to Hong Kong, where on Friday he will give a
address business leaders on the turmoil in the Asian economy and
conduct a news conference before returning to Washington on Friday
night. &QL;

DEMOCRAT IN KENTUCKY SENATE RACE STRESSES CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ For years, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the archenemy
of campaign finance reformers, has insisted that their issue is
politically toothless.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the history of American politics has ever won or
lost a campaign on this issue,'' the Kentucky Republican declared
in February on the eve of the Senate vote that failed to end debate
on campaign finance legislation and probably blocked further Senate
action on the matter this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Democratic congressman is putting McConnell's view to a
stern test on his home turf.
</P>
<P>
   That Democrat, Rep. Scotty Baesler, is trying to make changes in
campaign law a central question in his race to win Kentucky's other
Senate seat in the November election. The issue has brought him to
prominence in the House this year after three terms of blending
into the back benches without much notice.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Louisville on Monday night, Baesler told about 150
true believers that ``the most important subject in the country
today'' was campaign law that allows corporations and labor unions
to donate as much as they want to political parties and spend as
much as they please on political advertising.
</P>
<P>
   This money ``sets the agenda for Congress,'' Baesler declared.
``People who deny that have their head in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally was sponsored by Common Cause and the League of Women
Voters and was billed as a chance for Kentuckians to speak out on
campaign finance reform. All the state's candidates for the Senate
and the House of Representatives were invited, but only Baesler
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, chairman of the committee that raises money for
Republican Senate candidates across the country, who argues that
campaign finance ceilings inhibit free speech and who has led every
recent fight in the Senate against such limits, was derided as
public enemy No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Baesler's Republican opponent in the Senate race, Rep. Jim
Bunning, was persuaded by McConnell to run this year for the seat
being left open by the retirement of Sen. Wendell Ford, a Democrat.
Bunning, a conservative Republican with a strong anti-abortion
stand, has not been outspoken on campaign finance but agrees with
McConnell that the law should remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   In response to an inquiry, Bunning issued this statement:
``Common Cause's agenda for so-called campaign finance reform is
more government and less individual freedom in political campaigns.
I believe that a healthy democracy deserves more speech, not
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Both national parties have made winning Ford's seat a top
priority this year. Party leaders here say the outcome is too close
to call, and handicappers in Washington put it in the tossup
category.
</P>
<P>
   A former captain of the University of Kentucky basketball team
and the mayor of Lexington for a decade, Baesler, 56, has been a
popular figure in this state for years. He has a country-boy
manner, an awkward gait and a quick smile. He clearly finds it
difficult to talk about himself, a trait unusual for a politician.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently his main claim to recognition in Washington
was as the only active tobacco farmer in Congress and a leading
House advocate of the cigarette manufacturers. When President
Clinton was in Lexington the day before the 1996 election, Baesler
pointedly skipped the appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's wrong on tobacco,'' the congressman said at the
time, ``and I'm very upset about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring Baesler stepped out of the pack. His opening came
when House Republican leaders structured the debate on campaign
finance legislation in such a way that no bill could pass without a
two-thirds majority and that, in any case, no vote could be taken
on one of the main bills favored by advocates of change.
</P>
<P>
   Baesler prepared what is known as a discharge petition on
campaign finance legislation, and he and his allies began
circulating it for signatures. Under the rules of the House, if
such a petition gets 218 signatures, a House majority, the issue in
question must be brought to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Discharge petitions are rarely successful. But this time, with
solid Democratic backing and the support of a small number of
Republicans who were embarrassed by their leadership's seeming
heavy-handedness, the number of signatures on the discharge
petition approached the magic number.
</P>
<P>
   That forced House Speaker Newt Gingrich to relent. The issue has
been returned to the floor for an off-and-on debate that began in
late May and shows no sign of conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Baesler says that this time he expects his side will win in the
House. It is unclear whether he is right. The proponents of changes
in the law won on the first test vote, but dozens of votes on
hundreds of measures are still to come. House Majority Leader Dick
Armey has promised that the matter will be resolved by early
August.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear how important the issue will be in deciding
the Senate race here in November. A statewide poll by The
Courier-Journal in Louisville last year found that 4 of 5
Kentuckians believed that federal law should be changed to limit
campaign spending. But by the same proportion, those polled said
the campaign finance issue should not be a top priority for Clinton
and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally Monday night, Baesler scoffed at the idea that
voters do not care about the issue. Holding his palms a half-inch
apart, he said that ``I don't get that many letters in a month on
campaign finance reform'' but that he had not received that many
letters in a year on changing communications law, a step Congress
had managed to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the things we vote on, we don't hear from the
people,'' he said, ``but we do it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an interview, Baesler said he was under no illusion
that the issue would sweep him to victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to make it an issue, and Mitch's central position
insures that it will be an issue,'' he said. ``But the election
won't turn on it alone.''

<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ As a battle for the soul of Southern
Republicanism, the Alabama primary that Gov. Fob James Jr. won so
convincingly on Tuesday reinforced a number of truths about the
party and the region.
</P>
<P>
   Religious conservatives still wield immense influence. Strong
stands against taxes still sell. Race still matters. And even as
Southerners take a leading role in national politics, they still
deeply resent federal intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   The results also buttressed another theme drawn from campaigns
around the country this year, including last month's spending spree
among Democrats in the race for California governor: money does not
always prevail.
</P>
<P>
   James was outspent by his opponent, Winton Blount III, a wealthy
Montgomery businessman, by more than two-to-one. By financing his
campaign heavily with loans from himself and his family, Blount
forced James to spend twice as much as the governor had originally
budgeted for the primary. But he also handed James an issue, and
the governor appealed to this poor state's populist sensibilities
by using television advertising to mock Blount's inherited wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those factors played a role in James' surprisingly
decisive victory over Blount in their hard-fought primary runoff.
With 99 percent of precincts reporting, James had 56 percent of the
vote to Blount's 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was a campaign that probed the inherent tensions in Southern
Republicanism, between the conservative Christians drawn to the
party, and James, by a deeply felt moral agenda, and the
business-oriented voters primarily concerned with the state's
economic interests. One of James' chief strategists was Ralph Reed,
the former executive director of the Christian Coalition.
Throughout the region and beyond, the primary and the ensuing
runoff became widely seen as a test of the power of the Christian
right, less than two years before the presidential primary season
begins.
</P>
<P>
   In the week before James' victory, polls showed the race to be a
dead heat. But the polls could not measure the enthusiasm of James'
support among white conservatives in rural and suburban counties.
Many of those voters were pulled to the polls by last-minute
mailings and telephone calls that emphasized the governor's
devotion to religious causes, like his protests against federal
court rulings prohibiting prayer in public schools and his defense
of a judge's decision to display the Ten Commandments on his
courtroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, for instance, the James campaign directed
three pieces of mail and three telephone calls to each of 90,000
households gleaned from lists of people who attended rallies
supporting Circuit Court Judge Roy Moore's stand on the Ten
Commandments, according to one of the governor's strategists. Many
of the fliers noted James' support from evangelical leaders like
Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and James Dobson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who didn't think before that religious conservatives
were not a big part of the electorate here and the backbone of the
Republican Party simply didn't understand Alabama,'' said Attorney
General Bill Pryor, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The polls also did not detect an apparent backlash against
Blount's endorsement last week by Mayor Richard Arrington Jr. of
Birmingham, a black Democrat who urged his supporters to cross over
and vote in the Republican runoff. An unusual provision allows
Alabama voters to participate in a Republican primary runoff
regardless of whether they voted or how they voted in the first
primary.
</P>
<P>
   James had pursued the mayor's endorsement himself. But when he
did not receive it, his strategists and allies encouraged the
backlash by arguing that Blount would be the captive of ``a liberal
Democratic political boss'' who had demanded a say on appointments
and spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Television advertisements and mailings produced by the James
campaign included photographs of Arrington. And a flier circulated
widely by a black newspaper publisher who supports James also
included a two-decade-old picture of an Arrington adviser, Donald
Watkins, with an Afro haircut that has long been shorn.
</P>
<P>
   James' strategists, who were jubilant about his unexpectedly
broad win, said that their ads were designed to raise questions
about Arrington's influence, and not his race. The same tactics
would have been used, they said, if Arrington were white.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of political scientists and strategists, including
many Republicans, said on Wednesday that the advertisements relied
on an implicit racial appeal and that they had worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about liberal special interest groups and run
pictures of Richard Arrington and Donald Watkins, it's pretty clear
which special interest group you're talking about,'' said Bradley
Moody, an associate professor of political science at Auburn
University. ``It's not labor unions and it's not the Alabama
Education Association.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster from Atlanta who has
worked for candidates and lobbying groups in Alabama, said that the
endorsement by Arrington's Jefferson County Citizens Coalition
seemed to have increased the turnout in some Democratic precincts,
and that Blount had benefited from that vote. But he said that
those votes were more than offset by increases in rural and
suburban counties where white conservatives may have been motivated
to vote for James in reaction to the Arrington endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial indications are that the endorsement backfired,''
Ayres said. ``My sense is that Mr. Blount got on the wrong side of
a racial issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican strategist who has worked on several statewide
campaigns in Alabama put it even more bluntly. ``When you play the
race card in Alabama, it's over,'' the strategist said, speaking on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   James also played effectively, as he has throughout his
political life, to an almost visceral sentiment in Alabama's white
electorate _ a distaste for elites and outside authority. Several
analysts said on Wednesday that his jabs at the federal judiciary
and at critical newspaper editorial writers, whom he poked fun at
in his victory speech, appealed to his state's oft-wounded pride.
In his speech on Tuesday night, James spoke of ``a spirit that says
deep down I'm proud to be from Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Merle Black, an Emory University political scientist who has
written extensively on the Republican politics in the South, said
that James' ability to strike nativist chords was reminiscent of
former Gov. George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old Confederate thing of winning by losing,'' he
said. ``The important thing is making a stand against the odds.
Even if he's losing on these religious issues, it still works with
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Although concerned about the damage inflicted on James during a
prolonged and nasty primary, Republican leaders were ecstatic about
the record number of voters who were drawn to their primaries. With
few runoffs on the Democratic ballot, Tuesday's Republican race
attracted a stunning 455,000 voters, shattering the previous mark
of 359,000 Republican voters in the June 2 primary. That number, in
turn, had smashed the previous record of 215,000, set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   James succeeded by expanding his margin of victory over Blount
in rural counties, and by minimizing his losses in cities like
Birmingham and Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results set up a general election campaign between
James, 63, and Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman, 52, who easily won the
Democratic nomination four weeks ago. Siegelman, who has squirreled
away more than $3.5 million while James depleted his account,
wasted little time in opening a two-front offensive against the
governor on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He continued Blount's efforts to make the campaign a referendum
on James, describing him at a news conference as ``a do-nothing
governor.'' And he relentlessly promoted his plan to enact a state
lottery that would pay for college scholarships, pre-kindergarten
programs and classroom computers.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that education is by far the most important issue to
Alabama voters. But the lottery, like all forms of gambling, may be
a hard sell in a state where evangelical churches play such a
critical role in electoral politics. The governor opposes a
lottery.

ARIZONA SKINHEADS FACE CHARGES IN BEATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - The four Lake Havasu City men taunted Carlos Durand
as a ``wetback'' in front of his three children, according to an
indictment released Wednesday. Then one of them hit Durand in the
head with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
   The four men, several of whom belong to a skinhead group called
Fourth Reich Skins, face federal felony charges of violating the
civil rights of Durand, a Mexican-American granted permanent
residence in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating a man with a baseball bat in front of his children
simply because he is Hispanic is vicious and inhumane,'' U.S.
Attorney Jose de Jesus Rivera said Wednesday. ``We will not
tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution of hate crimes ``is an extremely high priority for
this office,'' Rivera added.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the group accused in the January attack was Jason
Alvord, 19, who Mohave County law-enforcement officials say is
known for covering his body with tattoos, including several
swastikas and the word ``suffer.'' Alvord has been convicted of
theft in that Arizona county, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charges Raymond Parisi, 18; Joseph Downen,
21; and Gary Wilkins, 34. Parisi and Wilkins lived in an apartment
next to Durand's at the time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Alvord and Wilkins also face state charges of aggravated assault
in the same incident. Parisi admitted participating in the attack
on Durand as part of his sentencing agreement in another case.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal indictment, Durand also endured several
previous instances of intimidation before he was clubbed, suffering
head injuries that had to be closed with medical staples. In one
instance, Alvord pointed a pellet gun at Durand and told him, ``I
have a gun right here and I ought to shoot you, wetback,'' the
indictment states.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment comes 15 months after three skinheads were
indicted on federal civil-rights charges in connection with a
cross-burning at the home of one of Lake Havasu City's few Black
families. The three later pleaded guilty and were sentenced to
federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mohave County Attorney Bill Ekstrom said Wednesday that the two
incidents do not indicate a broad pattern of racial intolerance in
his fast-growing county bordering the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have a problem of any great magnitude in the
county,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the skinhead presence, Ekstrom said, ``I think
there's some oddball group there (in Lake Havasu City). And I think
there are little, isolated groups that pick things off the
Internet.'' &QL;

WILLIAMS, SELES AND DAVENPORT ARE UPSET VICTIMS AT WIMBLEDON  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ It was another dry day at Wimbledon, except
for the tears shed by the three American women who failed to join
the defending men's champion, Pete Sampras, in the semifinals.
After their involuntary group exit in the women's quarterfinals
Wednesday, they put away their racquets and got out their
handkerchiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of them, 18-year-old Venus Williams, also had a
screaming tantrum right on Center Court that conjured up images of
her personal hero, John McEnroe, at his boorish best. Or worst.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-seeded Williams became so furious over a trio of
suspect line calls that she added a hysterical oratory against the
umpire and officials to her usual power-hitting display. She posed
a significant threat, but ultimately failed in her bid to upset
third-seeded Jana Novotna, the 29-year-old two-time runner-up here.
Ultimately, Williams was unable to match Novotna's grass-court
experience, and found herself outserved and outvolleyed in the
ensuing tie breaker. She was vanquished, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2).
</P>
<P>
   Novotna's net-rushing came as no surprise to her opponent. ``She
was really slicing and coming in, and basically she played the game
of someone who wants to get in to the net,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   And Williams was unapologetic about her ballistic behavior. ``If
I wasn't so dark, I probably would have turned red,'' she said,
jokingly. ``I think the crowd probably enjoyed my emotional
outbursts.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said her hysteria was not quite of McEnroe quality. ``I
don't think I would get that out of control, but I think everybody
enjoyed watching him go at it,'' she said. ``I think anyone can go
to that limit if they allow themselves to, but he would play
through it and play great tennis, and not everyone's able to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides revealing a petulant side, Williams showed she has a
future on the grass surface. But, as Novotna pointed out, it is not
here yet. ``You can imagine how desperate she was when she started
coming in even after second serves,'' Novotna said, ``and that's
what I wanted to do, be all over the net and put all the pressure
on her, because I knew that we will both be serving and volleying
and I'm sure I'll be better at that.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two Americans to depart Wednesday, second-seeded
Lindsay Davenport and sixth-seeded Monica Seles, left on quieter
notes after being upset by challengers who had had little or no
success against them in the past. The dying grass has a way of
germinating strange developments.
</P>
<P>
   After her 6-3, 6-3 loss to 16th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat, the
first Frenchwoman to reach a Wimbledon semifinal since Francoise
Durr in 1970, Davenport allowed herself a private two-minute crying
jag and then washed away her tears in the shower. Davenport had
dropped just one of her eight matches against the 30-year-old
Tauziat, but it was no coincidence that the sole defeat came here
in 1993 in their only previous meeting on grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this was her favorite surface,'' Davenport said, ``but
I didn't think she was going to be hitting her groundstrokes so
well. I got totally outplayed.''
</P>
<P>
   As did Seles. Returning for the first time in five years to the
only Grand Slam tournament she has never won, Seles was suddenly
bereft of a backhand and found herself upset, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, by
unseeded Natasha Zvereva.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't put two points together today right from the start
of the match, and it never got better after that,'' said a
disgruntled Seles, whose best Wimbledon performance was reaching
the 1992 final. ``She rose to the occasion and I did just the
opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Zvereva used a 38-minute upset of Williams two
weeks ago at Eastbourne as fodder for her unprecedented singles
campaign here. In the second round, Zvereva, the quirky doubles
stylist, ambushed the seven-time champion Steffi Graf. Wednesday,
she reached her first Grand Slam semifinal by thwarting Seles with
a dizzying combination of slices and drop shots.
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva, who owns 20 Grand Slam doubles titles but has often
described herself as ``too lazy'' to go the distance in singles,
admitted her aspirations here were initially humble. ``I thought I
had a good shot to win the first round,'' said Zvereva, who, like
Tauziat, needed to trudge through 43 Grand Slam singles campaigns
before reaching a semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva's aspirations are decidedly less humble now. ``If I
carry on like I played today, I have a chance to win the whole
thing,'' said Zvereva, who has a 4-4 record against Tauziat. She
has already disregarded a 0-4 record against Seles and a 0-17
record against Graf.
</P>
<P>
   In the other women's quarterfinal, the defending champion,
Martina Hingis, ejected fifth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the
defending French Open champion, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. The 17-year-old
Hingis expressed pleasant surprise at finding herself the youngest,
by a decade, of the four semifinalists. ``The older, the better, I
think,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, the dark-haired golden boy of Britain,
12th-seeded Tim Henman, staged the only upset, a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2
ouster of third-seeded Petr Korda. But considering Henman's
messianic sense of duty here, as well as the ankle sprain suffered
by Korda in the previous round, the result did not really qualify
as a shocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was pretty clinical in the way I took my
opportunities and never let him back into it,'' said Henman, who is
the first British man to reach the semifinals since Roger Taylor
did it 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the male losers were reduced to tears, Korda did
his share of whining. ``I couldn't move my ankle the proper way,''
he said, ``and I feel I have one of the best returns in the world,
but I can't really move, so I just gave him a lot of free points.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman, who banged in a 131-mile-an-hour serve, will face a
confident Sampras, a four-time Wimbledon champion, on Friday.
Sampras is 2-0 against Henman, and Wednesday he annihilated Mark
Philippoussis of Australia, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-4, on Court One.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no complaints,'' said Sampras, who did not mind being
out-aced, 14-10, by Philippoussis. ``Everyone talks about the
serve, but the return of serve is the shot that's going to get you
to the final.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other men's semifinal, ninth-seeded Richard Krajicek of
the Netherlands and 14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, two
masters of this surface, will trade aces. Ivanisevic, twice a
Wimbledon runner-up, had 29 aces in a 7-6 (12-10), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6
(8-6) decision against another Dutchman and a fellow lefty,
23d-ranked Jan Siemerink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my 11th Wimbledon, and actually it's the most fun this
year,'' Ivanisevic said, ``so maybe this is the year for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that would make Ivanisevic happier than winning
Wimbledon would be watching Croatia's soccer team win the World
Cup. ``I think the whole country would be drunk for the rest of the
year, including me,'' he said. ``I put the racquets in the
closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek, the 1996 champion, advanced to his second Wimbledon
semifinal by defeating 65th-ranked Davide Sanguinetti of Italy,
6-2, 6-3, 6-4. &QL;

ADVERTISING: LOOKING BEYOND JUNE CLEAVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miss Manners would not be amused.
</P>
<P>
   Women are buying jewelry with their own money. They are playing
professional basketball. And fewer are waiting for the wedding to
buy the house in the suburbs. To tap into this increasingly
lucrative consumer group, a growing number of companies are now
marketing directly to women products and services that were once
pitched almost exclusively to men. Companies that sell everything
from golf equipment to life insurance are more frequently using
advertising aimed solely at women to let them know they want their
business.
</P>
<P>
   Patek Philippe, the luxury watchmaker, for instance, saw a shift
in consumers' buying habits a couple of years ago when women began
to buy more of its expensive men's timepieces for themselves. That
prompted the conservative Swiss company to think differently about
how it communicated with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in it enough to make it a focus of our advertising
worldwide,'' said Hank Edelman, the U.S. president of Patek, which
is based in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, Patek is spending half of its $15 million
marketing budget on promotions aimed at women, a 15 percent
increase from three years ago. And a primary focus of its approach
will be a print campaign focused on women for an $11,800 watch with
mechanical movement and dual time zones, features that until now
the company included only in men's watches.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, which will appear in national newspapers and magazines
this fall, were created by Leagas Delaney in London. They represent
a departure from Patek's usual method of featuring jeweled watches
on the arms of the ladies-who-lunch set. In one of the new ads, a
woman in jeans is teaching her daughter to ride a bike. It carries
the slogan ``Begin your own tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at where the greatest potential growth is, and there
is a whole segment of the population that has not had an interest
in things like this that were thought of being traditionally
masculine,'' Edelman said. ``Younger women and working women have a
greater range of interests.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the 20-somethings are erasing the lines
between traditional male and female roles (think WNBA and the
Citadel). And with the aging of baby boomers comes a generation of
women now in their peak earning years who, more than ever, are
making the financial decisions in their households.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are buying houses by themselves, and women are buying
all kinds of other products that before had been sold to a dual
audience,'' said Anne Marshall, a partner at Women Trend, a
consulting firm in Washington that is part of Holman
Communications. Even so, she said, she has a sense that far too
many ads are still right out of the June Cleaver era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just a matter of putting women in a spot anymore,''
Ms. Marshall said. ``The point is finding messages that will
resonate with reality and are not condescending. A lot of them are
just plain rude, where they say, `You are not the bride and you are
not this.' What does that have to do with running shoes?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, nothing. But marketers are making progress, according to
Advertising Women of New York, an industry group. ``When we started
to look at what marketers were doing who were successful, we found
a number in categories not traditionally marketing to women who
were doing very well,'' said Toni Lee, a spokeswoman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   The group points to Nike Inc. and John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co., for instance. John Hancock has been focusing on
single parents and working women with two series of ads on cable
television channels.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Hancock has gone from talking to men and women in general to
talking to a very specific segment of women whose financial needs
happen to be even more critical because of their situation,'' said
Karen Kaplan, a vice president who oversees the Hancock account at
Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, a unit of Interpublic Group of
Cos. in Boston. ``We are trying to communicate an understanding of
their unique needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency is working on a new series of ads to be added to the
campaign under the original slogan ``Insurance for the unexpected.
Investments for the opportunities.'' The new spots are expected to
hit the market in the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is also expanding its focus on the women's market, and
recently started a series of commercials tied to the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had a lot of `Go women,' inspirational kind of
stuff,'' said Kathryn Reith, a company spokeswoman. ``So what we
did this summer is really sort of focus on what we think is special
about the league, and that is the relationship between the players
and fans.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's spots, which began running last month on NBC, part
of General Electric Co.; Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN, and the Lifetime
cable network, will run through August and feature young girls
interacting with the league's stars. The message? ``This is what
you should be doing with your game,'' Ms. Reith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things it does is really help to continue to tie us
to performance athletic gear,'' she said of the commercials, which
were created by Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, a unit of Omnicom
Group in San Francisco. ``Certainly we've seen a growth of the
visibility of the players, which we hope will spill over into
product sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to tap into the growing number of women taking part in
another sport, Arnold Palmer Golf Co. has created a line of women's
golf equipment called Nancy Lopez Golf. The company began a
campaign to market the product line in April, and plans to expand
the campaign this fall to include national television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company has invested significant seven figures on this
whole endeavor,'' said Cindy Davis, Palmer's president. The print
ads, created by a San Diego graphic design firm, Miriello Grafico,
are running in national women's golf magazines under the slogan
``Defining the women's game.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, ``as companies are realizing they are valuable
consumers, we are taking it more seriously both in the funding we
put behind a brand as well as the way we communicate to that
consumer,'' Ms. Davis said.

SHAKESPEARE MAKES BEAUTIFUL MUSIC _ AND DANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Vernon doesn't shy away from translating other art forms
into dance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the New York-based choreographer gave local audiences
``Arc and Point,'' a ballet inspired by paintings of Vassily
Kandinsky, which were on exhibit at the time at the Amon Carter
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has taken on Shakespeare in ``The Heart of Man,'' which
premiered in June in Fort Worth as part of Ballet Concerto's annual
outdoor summer concert.
</P>
<P>
   During the rest of the year, the small professional company
specializes in outreach performances for schoolchildren. ``The
Heart of Man'' began when Ballet Concerto director Margo Dean asked
for something she could perform in schools, Vernon explains. ``At
first, I wanted to do `Hamlet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon had already choreographed versions of ``Romeo and
Juliet'' and ``Twelfth Night'' for the Eglevsky Ballet company on
Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Hamlet'' was the starting point, Vernon eventually
decided to make a less specific ballet inspired by Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   The title, Vernon says, comes from a comment by Verdi that
``Shakespeare was the greatest authority on the heart of man.'' The
music for the ballet comes from Handel.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting work, about 20 minutes long, presents characters
from various plays of Shakespeare, as well as Queen Elizabeth I,
the ``Dark Lady'' of the sonnets _ and Shakespeare himself.
</P>
<P>
   There are some recognizable scenes from the plays, including a
three-minute condensation of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Several ideas from the age of Shakespeare also inspired Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by how the acting companies of the time were
built like ballet companies of today,'' the choreographer says.
``You had certain people always doing the same sort of role: One
actor always did a prince, another always did an old person.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon was also inspired by the acting he saw at England's
National Theater and Royal Shakespeare Company when, many years
ago, he worked there as a personal assistant. He saw, up close, the
Shakespearean performances of Anthony Hopkins _ ``before he was
famous'' _ and Laurence Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done this ballet as a tribute,'' he says. ``These
performances still stick in my mind. In the right hands,
Shakespeare is still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE IN BALLET AND MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   The Shakespeare-inspired ballet ``The Heart of Man'' is only the
most recent of dozens of ballets based on the Bard. And composers
have for generations been inspired to create tone poems, operas and
musical settings of texts from the plays and sonnets. Here are some
highlights:
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo and Juliet'' has always been a favorite, inspiring a
choral symphony by Berlioz, an opera by Gounod and the beloved
concert overture by Tchaikovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Verdi was the most successful composer of operatic Shakespeare
settings, creating a ``Macbeth'' early on in his career, followed
by two operatic masterpieces, ``Otello'' and ``Falstaff.''
</P>
<P>
   19th-century German composer Otto Nicolai had his one big
success with an operatic version of ``The Merry Wives of Windsor.''
</P>
<P>
   French composer Ambroise Thomas is remembered mainly for his
``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlioz's numerous Shakespeare-inspired works include the
oft-overlooked opera ``Beatrice et Benedict,'' based on ``Much Ado
About Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendelssohn's ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' started out as a
free-standing overture for concert performance, then was expanded
into a complete suite of incidental music for performance with the
play, then went back into the concert hall. The ``Wedding March''
from that suite was for many years the traditional recessional at
weddings in America, and the same music was the basis for a ballet
by George Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, ``Macbeth'' indirectly inspired
Shostakovich's shocking ``Lady Macbeth of the Mtensk District,''
which drew Stalin's ire.
</P>
<P>
   British composers continued to turn to Shakespeare for
inspiration: Elgar produced a monumental symphonic poem, much
beloved by British audiences, on ``Falstaff;'' Benjamin Britten
produced an inspired operatic version of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream;'' and Ralph Vaughan Williams composed one of the most
ravishingly beautiful of all Shakespeare-inspired works, his
``Serenade to Music,'' a choral setting of the text of the garden
scene of ``The Merchant of Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``Romeo and Juliet'' inspired Prokofiev to write one
of the greatest of all ballet scores, which contains almost three
hours of music, allowing the choreographer to set virtually every
scene of the play.

NYC CRIME CONTINUES TO FALL; REPORTED MURDERS AT 32-YEAR LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Violent crime in this city continued its historic
six-year decline during the first half of 1998, according to police
statistics released Wednesday, as the number of reported murders
fell to the lowest level since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the statistics for the first six months of 1997,
murders this year have dropped 24 percent. The number of reported
robberies, burglaries and other serious felonies declined less
sharply, falling 10 percent compared with the first six months of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past four years, New York City has been transformed
from the crime capital of the world to the safest large city in the
United States,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at a news conference
with Police Commissioner Howard Safir at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said there were 286 murders listed in the city
between Jan. 1 and June 30, a 24 percent decrease from the same
period last year, and a huge decline from the 1,081 homicides
reported during the first half of 1991. If crime continues at the
same pace through December, the city will record its fewest number
of homicides since 1963, when there were 549 murders reported, city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The only major felony to show an increase in the first half of
this year was rape, which rose by 0.6 percent compared with the
first half of 1997. Safir attributed that to far more reporting of
acquaintance rapes, a category of crime that before the late 1980s
was far less likely to result in a criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those rapes would not have been reported in the past
because people did not have the confidence that they would be
treated with sensitivity and anonymity,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every state and city in the nation has seen decreases in
crime during the last five years, a trend some criminologists have
attributed to changing demographics, a drop in cocaine use and
stricter sentencing laws.
</P>
<P>
   But New York's crime reduction has been steeper and more
consistent than in most other cities, notably with homicides, which
dropped to 749 last year after peaking in 1991 at 2,262. Overall,
crime began to ebb in 1992, when reported felonies fell by 15
percent, and has continued to fall ever since.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   City officials and many law enforcement officers have credited
an emphasis on more aggressive policing, begun by the previous
commissioner, William Bratton, for sustaining that improvement, and
the mayor said Wednesday that the drop in crime may now be fueling
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the police force has swelled to nearly 40,000
officers, Safir said, because of the 1993 merger of the transit and
housing police departments with the main police force and because
of the Safe Streets-Safe City tax increase enacted by the Dinkins
administration to finance additional officers. With the steady drop
in crime, those officers have been able to devote more time to
deterring the remaining lawlessness, the officials said. Detectives
were able to solve more than 83 percent of reported homicides last
year _ the highest percentage on record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more homicide detectives working on 70 percent fewer
murders,'' Giuliani said. ``That means they can be a lot more
effective in the work that they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said he planned to continue devoting police resources to
the department's anti-drug initiatives, which seek to drive out
narcotics dealers by saturating high-crime neighborhoods with city
officers and federal agents. The initiatives, which were first used
in north Brooklyn, have been expanded into northern Manhattan and
parts of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Safir also singled out the work of the Police Department's
street crime unit, which seizes illegal handguns, and said its
officers had helped reduce the number of shooting incidents from
2,500 in the first half of 1993 to fewer than 1,000 during the
first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani said the crime reductions had brought heavy
declines in crime in virtually every neighborhood, cutting across
ethnic, racial and class lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just happening in the poor sections of the city or
the middle-class section of the city or the more affluent sections,
if you want to describe it that way,'' he said. ``In fact, the
violent crime decline is happening much more dramatically in the
less affluent sections of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Although police officials faced outraged criticism on several
occasions this year when narcotics officers mistakenly raided the
homes of law-abiding citizens, the mayor said the Police Department
had no intention of reducing drug raids and might set a new record
for narcotics arrests this year. Giuliani said that when he took
office in 1994, patrol officers were not allowed to make narcotics
arrests unless a supervisor was present, and that as a result, drug
dealers operated openly in many city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we take the drug dealers off of the streets as much as
possible,'' Giuliani said, ``and it sends a very positive message
to the young people in these neighborhoods. Namely, that drug
dealers don't control the streets. Being a drug dealer is a very
bad way to run your life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMOJOVEL, Mexico _ President Ernesto Zedillo, on a whirlwind
tour through the troubled state of Chiapas, impatiently issued what
sounded like a last call to the Zapatista rebels on Wednesday to
return to peace talks, which lapsed a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before a heavily pro-government crowd in an Indian
village where the Zapatista guerrillas also have many sympathizers,
Zedillo said his administration had used ``all of its good will up
to the limit of our constitutional powers'' to promote
reconciliation in Chiapas and lure the Zapatistas back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo did not say what he would do if the Zapatistas did not
heed his plea, which sounded very much like an ultimatum. But he
implied that the government was considering a break with a
4-year-old law guiding the peace talks that allows the Zapatistas
to keep their weapons until a final settlement is reached and
suspends all arrest warrants against Zapatista guerrilla leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said he would not go to war against the rebels. ``There
can be no wars among Mexicans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president sharply rejected Zapatista claims that he engaged
in political double talk, and sought to turn the charge back on the
guerrilla army, which staged a brief armed uprising in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the Zapatistas' reluctance to give up violent action as
one of the main causes of the smoldering conflict in Chiapas, in
which dozens of Indian villagers have been killed in the last year
in small factional confrontations across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo also blamed two groups for aggravating the situation:
human rights groups, which he said favored the Zapatistas, and
foreigners, who he said became involved in Chiapas politics.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo made an especially harsh attack on Bishop Samuel Ruiz
Garcia, who heads the Chiapas Diocese where most Indians live, and
other Catholic clergymen who have sympathized with the Zapatistas'
call for more equality for Indians. Ruiz resigned recently as a
mediator in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the bishop had ``defrauded'' the government
by exercising his mediator's role with pro-Zapatista bias and
called the Catholic clergymen in Chiapas ``apostles of hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   The president made no mention of scaling back the presence of
the armed forces in Chiapas. The Zapatistas have made a reduction
in the number of troops in the state a condition for returning to
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The government's recent moves in Chiapas have provoked alarm
among international human rights groups and politicians in Mexico
concerned with the deepening polarization.
</P>
<P>
   Since April the government has undertaken several large military
operations to crush local governments that the Zapatistas set up in
towns where they are popular.

SUHARTO WORKING TO PRESERVE FAMILY'S WEALTH, POLITICAL INFLUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Suharto, the former president of Indonesia, is
maneuvering to re-establish a political power base to shield his
family's financial empire from scrutiny by future governments,
according to Clinton administration officials and Western
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   There is no direct evidence that the Suharto family has tried to
bribe political or military leaders, the officials say. But they
add that Suharto and his six children are offering to underwrite
the political campaigns of legislators who vow loyalty to the
family, which has a fortune in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and diplomats agree that Suharto does
not appear to be seeking reinstatement as president. He resigned in
May after tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of
Indonesia's largest cities demanding his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they say, intelligence reports reaching the CIA, the
State Department and the Defense Department show that he is making
use of his riches and his ties to the military to help his children
retain their businesses and their top posts in the ruling political
party, at a time when the political moorings of Indonesia are
fraying.
</P>
<P>
   Next week the party, known as Golkar, is holding a special
national congress to pick new leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto remains chairman of the party's board of patrons, and
two of his children have been appointed to the seven-member
organizing committee for the congress. Four of his children are
members of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   That Suharto, 77, retains close ties to the military, the
nation's most powerful institution, was in evidence in June when he
accompanied several powerful army generals to Islamic prayers held
in military mosques in Jakarta, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suharto has been very active, rounding up support wherever he
can find it,'' said a senior Clinton administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Another administration official said Suharto ``knows that he
can't be president again, but he is going to make sure that his
kids and his cash survive whatever comes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daniel Lev, a professor of political science at the University
of Washington and an expert on Indonesia, said the Suhartos ``are
doing what comes very naturally: they have the wherewithal to buy
political support, and I suspect that is in fact what they are
trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent collapse of the Indonesian currency, the
Suharto family is still widely believed to be among the richest on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   After his resignation on May 21, Suharto went into seclusion for
a few weeks, rarely emerging from his Jakarta home and seeing few
visitors apart from his six children. He was reported to be
depressed and shocked at his ouster after 32 years of iron-fisted
rule.
</P>
<P>
   But Western diplomats in Jakarta and administration officials
with access to intelligence reports say that his isolation is over
and that he has worked aggressively behind the scenes to restore
his contacts with political, military and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Suharto would seek a return to public life _ and
might even try to take power again as president with the help of
the army _ have swirled through Jakarta virtually since the day he
stepped down. Military leaders have been forced to make public
statements denying that they are helping him return to power.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces
commander, acknowledged that he and other senior military officers
remained ``close'' to Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiranto insisted that that situation does not ``imply the
existence of secret or hidden ties,'' nor the suggestion that the
military would help Suharto return to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto was succeeded by his vice president, B.J. Habibie. While
Habibie was considered a protege of the former president, it is
unclear what sort of relationship exists between the two.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Habibie has taken some actions that appear to be
favors to his predecessor, including his decision last month to
dismiss Attorney General Sujono Atmonegoro after Atmonegoro
announced that he was organizing an investigation of the
unexplained wealth of former government officials, apparently
including Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   But other actions by Habibie appear to be snubs, including his
order this week to expel several of Suharto's closest friends from
the Legislature, including Bob Hasan, a timber tycoon who is
Suharto's favorite golfing partner and who helps manage the former
president's fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Suharto recently requested a
secret meeting with Abdurrachman Wahid, the leader of a
30-million-member Muslim society in Indonesia and the nation's most
influential religious leader. While the purpose of the meeting was
not known, the officials presume it had political overtones. Wahid
has been close in the past to Suharto's eldest daughter, Siti
Hardijanti Rukmana. &QL;

 &HT;    `We want to know the truth'
 &HT;    By Sophia Lezin and Doug Nurse
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- On the day he buried his 3-year-old son, Woon Oh's
grief was mixed with compassion for the woman who, police say, left
the boy in a sweltering van for 2 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's suffering enough now,'' Oh said Wednesday. ``We're
trying to forgive her but we want to know the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh also said his wife, worried that the day care van had not
returned their son, Samuel, on Monday afternoon, called the center
for half an hour, leaving a message on the answering machine and
even paging the owner before she reached someone.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not questioned Eun Shin Cho, owner of Kids
and Kids Academy on Lawrenceville Highway in Tucker, because she
has been under a doctor's care since the Monday incident. Cho
reportedly had a close relationship to the child and has been
grief-stricken, said Sgt. Jeff Sligar.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators said complaints have been filed against Kids
and Kids Academy, but they have refused to disclose the nature of
the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Oh and his wife, Choonhee Kim, visited the center a month ago
and were impressed because it offered transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Before attending Kids and Kids, Samuel had been cared for by a
woman along with three other children in her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Oh and Kim thought sending the tot somewhere with more children
would improve his social skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it better to move him to the large environment (so
he could) make more friends,'' Oh said. ``He was so shy, but he was
so bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he didn't speak English well, his parents also felt
Samuel would be more comfortable at a center that catered to
Korean-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of liked the atmosphere,'' Oh said. ``We decided my
son would go to that day-care center.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first week, Samuel would cry when the center's van
arrived to take him to day care. ``But afterward, he got used to
it,'' Oh recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel would rather spend time looking at books than playing
with other children, and he could already read simple words, like
red and yellow. He especially enjoyed riding trains and playing
with toy trains. Last Saturday, Oh said he took Samuel to the
Southeastern Railroad Museum on Buford Highway in Duluth, but it
was closed when they arrived, so they went to Stone Mountain and
rode trains there.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel's intelligence was apparent to Oh's friends at Georgia
Tech, where he is pursing a doctorate in civil engineering. They
would often see the boy writing the alphabet and the names of his
friends during their visits.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from their 7-month-old son, Daniel, the couple has no
family in the area. Oh's college friends have been staying
overnight, cooking and cleaning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Samuel died, his mother was worried because the day
-care center hadn't dropped him home at 2:30 p.m., as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother fretted for an hour and stood outside waiting
for another 30 minutes before calling the day-care center. She
reached someone at 4:30 p.m., Oh said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives suspect that Samuel may have climbed onto the van
without the owner knowing, Sligar said. Day-care center workers
drive children home along a regular route every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother called, one employee looked in the van, which
was parked outside the Korean First Presbyterian Church just up the
road on Lawrenceville Highway. The center had borrowed the church
van because their own vehicle was having mechanical trouble, Sligar
said.
</P>
<P>
   The worker smashed the window with a brick to reach Samuel, and
then called 911. Paramedics and doctors worked for an hour to
revive him, but he died of heart failure brought on by heat
exhaustion, Sligar said.
</P>
<P>
   Police probably will not file any charges in the case, but when
the investigation is finished it will be sent to the district
attorney, who will decide whether to seek an indictment, Sligar
said.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Danny Porter said Wednesday that until he sees
the evidence, probably next week, he won't know whether the facts
would justify presenting it to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The father said he had to charge the funeral on his credit card.
In the hours before the service, Oh said he and his wife are still
in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't believe it,'' Oh said. ``We feel like he's still
alive.''

ANCIENT JUG MAKES ITS WAY HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GORDY HOLT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Thanks to a couple of heads-up Goodwill Industries
employees, a 3,500-year-old jug from the Middle East has worked its
way off its Seattle Goodwill store shelf and back to its keeper at
the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got it in November,'' said Randy Jones, the Goodwill
employee who found it while sorting through donations. ``It was
unloaded off a truck with a bunch of other household items. It came
in a box with a hand-written message on it that said something
like, `This is the box from 1,500 B.C.' and `Do you want it?' or `I
think you'd like it,' I forget which.''
</P>
<P>
   The name of a museum _ the University of Chicago's Oriental
Institute _ also was written on the box, along with what looked
like catalog numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that inside the box was a jug about 4 inches high
made of tan clay and wrapped in heavy cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put it on a shelf and kind of forgot about it,'' Jones said
yesterday, after an Associated Press report out of Chicago informed
the world that, after being missing for 55 years, the little brown
jug had been returned.
</P>
<P>
   Short on money during World War II, the museum launched a loan
program to raise money. The jug was loaned to a Seattle native,
Forest C. Dana, then a professor at the University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Museum registrar Ray Tindel in Chicago said Dana likely
contributed $25 to $50 to use the item. He estimated the value
today at no more $100 because many like it have been found.
However, it could provide valuable clues about life in Armageddon
3,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't sure what the juglet was used for,'' Tindel said.
``We found from that period lots of large storage jars right down
to small pieces like this one. There is some thought that the small
ones were used to dip out contents from the big ones, which were
too big to pour from.''
</P>
<P>
   What became of the jug after it was loaned is not known.
</P>
<P>
   The artifact's return to Chicago occurred several months ago
after Jones remembered what he had left on a shelf and brought it
to the attention of Dennis Grosek, who runs Goodwill's auction
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis contacted the university, and that's how we got it back
to them,'' Jones said. ``I'm kind of glad it's there now and not in
some attic or on somebody's coffee table.''
</P>
<P>
   The object's Seattle-area contributor has not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the tiny container looked as nondescript as most
bric-a-brac that floods through Goodwill's sorting warehouse daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing this one was in a box with some writing on
it,'' he said, ``or it might have gone out in the store for
resale.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the AP account, the jug was discovered by British
archaeologist P.L.O Guy on June 27, 1926, in a dig at Megiddo,
southwest of Haifa in what then was Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Located at the crossroads of two ancient military and trading
routes, the site is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament.

WITH PASSING GRADE RAISED, NEARLY 60 PERCENT OF WOULD-BE TEACHERS
FLUNK TEST  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Flip-flopping mightily, the Massachusetts Board of
Education raised the passing grade Wednesday for teacher
certification exams and thereby flunked nearly 60 percent of the
prospective teachers who took the state's first such tests this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The vote capped two weeks of political storm that, national
education experts say, appeared to be the biggest fuss over a
state's introduction of teacher exams in years, possibly since
Arkansas tried it under a young governor named Bill Clinton in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts is not just any state, though it is tardy in
being the 44th to start testing would-be teachers for basic
competency. It prides itself on its intellectual riches and boasts
that it has the highest number of colleges and universities per
capita in the country. Moreover, Massachusetts is in the midst of a
lively campaign for governor in which educational reform already
figures as a prominent issue.
</P>
<P>
   So when word came in mid-June that only about 40 percent of the
nearly 1,800 test-takers had scored above the equivalent of a D on
the eight-hour exam, the disturbing scores prompted a
finger-pointing-fest at targets from the State House to the
colleges that train would-be teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The situation became even more charged when Frank Haydu 3d, the
state's interim commissioner of education, proposed that a lower
standard be applied that would allow 56 percent rather than 41
percent to pass, and the State Board of Education went along,
citing in part the desire to avoid lawsuits from disappointed
test-takers.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Thomas Finneran, the Democratic speaker of the
State House of Representatives, criticized what he called
``idiots'' who could not define what a noun or a verb was, or the
word ``imminent.'' Rivals accused the Republican acting governor,
A. Paul Cellucci, who is running for re-election, of abdicating
responsibility for educating the Commonwealth's children. U.S. Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., called the Board of Education's vote a blow to
educational reform.
</P>
<P>
   It was appalling to many that so few graduates of education
programs could answer questions like ``What is a preposition?''
Last Friday, Cellucci struck back. He announced that he would ask
the Board of Education, whose nine members are mainly appointed by
the governor's office, to reverse their decision and raise the
passing grade back to a C, meaning an additional 263 people would
flunk. And he proposed a bill that would require competency testing
not only for would-be teachers but for all current ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every parent I talked to said, `We want the high standards,'
'' Cellucci said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said at the Board of Ed meeting,'' he added, ``I started
off quoting John Kennedy when he said 36 years ago: `We choose to
go to the moon and do other things, not because it's easy but
because it's hard.' And no one ever said improving our public
schools would be easy. It is hard. There will be controversy and
there will be conflict and there will be stumbles, but if we stick
with it, we'll get there, and the best way to get there is to hold
the line on standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding the line will have costs, it appears. On Monday, Haydu,
the interim education commissioner who had backed the lower
standards, announced his resignation, saying he was not cut out for
campaign-season politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm naive as to what the governor's race was all about,'' he
said Wednesday as he left the Board of Education meeting for what
he described as a long vacation.
</P>
<P>
   And opposition to the higher passing grade is still brewing, as
was evident at Wednesday's meeting, where most of the guests who
spoke before the panel's 6-to-1 vote backed the lower standards and
denounced the ``teacher-bashing'' brought on by the test results.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Balboni, a would-be teacher who took the test but, like all
the other candidates, has yet to receive his results, denounced the
board's vote and re-vote as ``based on the swing of the political
pendulum.'' He pointed out that in schools, when a whole class does
poorly on a test, the teacher assumes there was a problem with the
test itself, and grades it on a curve.
</P>
<P>
   Others cited the critical problem that teacher candidates found
out only a week before they took it that it was not just an
experiment and would actually determine whether they were
certified. And still others question whether the test is an
accurate predictor of classroom performance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some members of minority groups scored worse than
whites, which could also be the basis for lawsuits. Lawyers with
experience in issues of testing say some suits in connection with
the teacher tests are almost certain to arise.

BUSH, GINGRICH TARGET HISPANIC VOTE
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, U.S. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and the Republican Party courted Hispanic activists
Wednesday by stressing education, free trade and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got a warm welcome from the League of United Latin American
Citizens; Gingrich's reception was lukewarm. Some Texas convention
delegates, saying Gingrich has never supported Hispanics, refused
to listen to the Georgia Republican's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gingrich, who are considered presidential prospects in
the year 2000, both waded into the luncheon crowd of about 1,000
but on opposite ends of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found it is much easier to work in the spirit of unity,''
said Bush, who delivered parts of his speech in Spanish. ``I can't
stand the politics of divisiveness, politics that tends to pit one
group against another.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gingrich were keynote speakers on the first day of the
national LULAC convention at the Dallas Hyatt Regency. LULAC is the
nation's oldest Hispanic civil rights organization. It has about
110,000 members in 45 states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the Republican Party are making a strong pitch for the
Latino vote in November. How this increasingly influential minority
decides to vote may help decide several crucial state and
congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   Never a monolithic voting bloc, Hispanics usually support
Democratic candidates. But they also identify with some socially
conservative GOP issues, such as the strong stance against
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on education Wednesday, Bush trumpeted a pilot program
on public school vouchers, something LULAC opposes. He stood by the
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test, which some say is biased
against Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   But on the lightening rod issue of bilingual education, Bush
advocated reviewing and repairing the state's $130 million-a-year
bilingual program, not ending it.
</P>
<P>
   English should be emphasized, but Spanish would not be expelled,
the governor said. Bush dubbed the concept ``English plus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bilingual programs serve to teach our children English,
then we ought to say, `Thank you very much,' and leave them in
place,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if the bilingual program locks someone into Spanish and
does not achieve state objectives, then we must say, `Change the
program; eliminate the program,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Distancing himself from some in the GOP, Bush advocated open
trade with Mexico and spoke out against any measure that would
effectively build a wall, including military patrols along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``A strong and healthy Mexico is not only good for Texas, it is
good for America. And we better make sure we do not have policy and
rhetoric that will wall Mexico off from America,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush opposed Gingrich-led attempts to make English
the nation's official language. Bush also said it's unwise not to
educate undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
   From the crowd came cries of ``We love you.'' Bush returned
their affection in Spanish by saying, ``Te Amo.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich joked that appearing at a LULAC convention is not the
first place he expected to be. He followed Bush to the podium and
praised several of his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich never directly addressed bilingual education or
immigration, although he did say that every child should graduate
knowing two languages. Instead, he portrayed the
Republican-controlled Congress' balanced budget and efforts to cut
taxes as Latino-friendly issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a moral obligation as a people to try and reach out to
every neighborhood in Texas and across the country'' Gingrich said.
``I came here today to say my door is open. We want to work with
you...''
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated a proposal to return $70 billion in federal
budget surpluses to workers in the form of rebates for payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's biggest applause came when he said the United States
shares the blame for its illegal-drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in talking about bashing Mexico on drugs or
bashing Colombia ... or Bolivia on drugs,'' he said. ``The primary
problem with drugs in the world today is the American market buying
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in LULAC's Texas delegation were not happy Gingrich was
invited to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never shown the Hispanic community any kind of
support,'' said Margaret Mata of Fort Worth. &QL;

U.S. LIMITS SATELLITE WORK BY SON OF CHINESE GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-MEDIA, CHINA-NOTEBOOK,

(th) 
 By JEFF GERTH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the Clinton administration continues to
re-examine whether to allow a $650 million satellite sale to a
Chinese-controlled company, the State Department has blocked the
son of a Chinese general from working on the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Shen Jun, the son of Lt. Gen. Shen Rongjun, is a manager in
Southern California at Hughes Space &AMP; Communications, the
manufacturer of the powerful commercial satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department issued a license in 1996 allowing the
younger Shen, a Canadian citizen, to work as an interpreter in
connection with design talks about the satellites with the
customer, a consortium with close ties to the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
   But the license was suspended last week, while Congress presses
questions about the role of the United States in China's rocket and
satellite projects. Officials are examining Shen's role in the
project as well as the capabilities of the sophisticated
satellites, which are to be the cornerstone of a commercial mobile
phone network planned for China and 21 other Asian countries but
which also could be used to eavesdrop on thousands of phone calls
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided, for now, to suspend a munitions license for
Hughes that permits a Chinese foreign national to perform
interpretation services for Hughes in nonsensitive areas of its
civilian satellite program,'' said James Rubin, a State Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has asked Hughes for additional information
to determine if Shen's work ``was within the scope of the
license,'' Rubin said. The license for Shen could be reinstated or
permanently revoked after the State Department completes its
review.
</P>
<P>
   Shen can still work at Hughes on matters unrelated to the State
Department license.
</P>
<P>
   A Hughes spokeswoman said the company was cooperating with the
State Department's request for information on Shen.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's close scrutiny of the satellite deal and
Shen's license has become part of a U.S. Customs Service
investigation into the help that Hughes and another satellite
maker, Loral Space &AMP; Communications, provided to Chinese rocket
experts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of the license for Shen was partly prompted,
according to Rubin, by ``information that has recently been brought
to our attention that has not yet been published.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said the information came from the
Pentagon and intelligence reports.
</P>
<P>
   The current examination contrasts sharply with the cursory
review by the Clinton administration in 1996 when it approved an
earlier version of the satellite deal as well as a license for
Shen, according to officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department was unaware of the background of Shen's
father when it issued the license in 1996, officials said. Gen.
Shen oversees his country's military satellite and rocket programs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, neither the CIA nor the Defense Intelligence Agency,
which tracks the Chinese military and usually screens export
licenses, were involved in the 1996 satellite license reviews, even
though the Hughes application listed a Chinese military entity as
one of the owners of the consortium buying its satellite, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes-Shen relationship dates to 1994, when Gen. Shen
visited Hughes officials in California. His son, then a computer
instructor in Canada, joined his father.
</P>
<P>
   A Hughes executive said that the company subsequently recruited
the son ``on the merits'' and by 1995 he was working in the
business development area. He is not allowed to work on any matter
that requires a federal security clearance.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996 Hughes wanted to use Shen's language skills in a
satellite deal that it had made with the consortium, Asia-Pacific
Mobile Telecommunications. The deal fell under the jurisdiction of
the State Department. The government requires companies that employ
foreign citizens on federally controlled exports to obtain a
license. In mid-1996 Hughes applied to the State Department for a
license for Shen.
</P>
<P>
   By then, President Clinton had approved the overall deal. Hughes
officials had asked the administration for an expedited decision
and the Defense Technology Security Administration, which reviews
all such licenses, did not check with the Defense Intelligence
Agency or the CIA before approving the project, according to
administration and congressional officials.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Defense Technology Security Administration
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Asian consortium's stock is held by five Chinese
state-owned entities, including one that falls under Gen. Shen's
supervision. A spokesman for the consortium, Liu Tsun Kie, said,
``Shen Jun has been responsible for input into the mobile satellite
network and business operations in China as part of the commercial
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald O'Neal, a Hughes spokesman, said that Shen, a senior
project manager, ``helps train customers to use and operate our
satellites.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Hughes submitted a new license to the Commerce
Department, which now regulates commercial satellites, after its
deal with Asia-Pacific was changed to include different equipment.
Shen ``may be used in the design review coming up'' for those
satellites once Hughes obtains federal approval, O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal is being held up as a result of questions by the
State Department and the Pentagon about whether the satellites,
which contain some of the most sophisticated U.S. communications
equipment, should be sold to a company with close ties to the
Chinese military. &QL;

COURT-MARTIAL URGED FOR 2 IN MARINE JET IN SKI CABLE ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Calif., N.Y., Ind., Colo.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A hearing officer has recommended a court-martial
for the pilot and the navigator of the Marine jet that hit a ski
lift cable in the Italian Alps in February, a military official
said Wednesday. The Marine Corps planned to announce the
recommendation after notifying defense lawyers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Ronald Rodgers, a Marine Corps judge who conducted
seven days of hearings in May and June, will recommend that two
Marine officers in the rear seat of the plane not be charged, said
the military official, who did not want to be further identified.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers' report is a recommendation to the commander of U.S.
Marine Corps Forces on the Atlantic Coast, Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, who
could take any step, ranging from dismissing the case completely to
ordering that all four officers be court-martialed.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, an EA-6B Prowler, severed the cable, sending 20
people in a cable car plunging to their deaths. Italian officials
have urged prosecution of the jet's crew.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, an electronic warfare jet on a low-altitude training
mission, was flown by Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo,
Calif. Seated next to him in the forward cockpit was Capt. Joseph
Schweitzer, 30, of Westbury, N.Y., who had no flight controls but
functioned as the navigator and was actively involved in mission
planning.
</P>
<P>
   Two Marine aviators in the rear cockpit had no flight controls
or view out the front. They were Capt. Chandler Seagraves, 28, of
Nineveh, Ind., and Capt. William Raney, 27, of Engelwood, Colo. In
March a Marine Investigation Board recommended charges against all
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers heard testimony that the Prowler squadron kept outdated
and inaccurate information for mission planning, and that the pilot
might have brought his plane too low because of an optical illusion
created by flying from a narrow mountain valley into a broader one.
</P>
<P>
   The military official said he did not know what charges the
hearing officer had recommended. Official spokesmen for the Marines
refused to comment. The investigation board had said in March that
two charges were possible: negligent homicide, which carries a
sentence of up to three years, and involuntary manslaughter, an
offense that involves ``culpable negligence,'' and carries a
sentence of up to 10 years, which could be imposed for each victim.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Schweitzer, David Beck, said: ``If charges are
dismissed against anybody, I would think that's wonderful. If
charges are referred against anybody, we will prepare for them.''
Speaking in a telephone interview, he said he did not know what the
recommendation was..
</P>
<P>
   Pat Schweitzer, Schweitzer's mother, said in a telephone
interview that no one in her family knew, either. ``We heard it on
the news,'' she said, referring to a television report. ``We were
told we would be informed tomorrow through our lawyers. This has
been horrendous, horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, the pilot, told The Associated Press that he had not been
formally informed of the recommendation, but had heard that he
faced a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just amazes me, the recommendation,'' he said in a
telephone interview with the news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Spinner, who represents Ashby, also said he did not know
what was in the recommendation.

JUDGE BACKS VIRGINIA LAW ON ABORTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time, a federal appellate court judge
has upheld a state law restricting a form of late-term abortion, a
ruling that conflicts with findings by other federal judges that
struck down similar laws in two other states.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision Tuesday upholding a Virginia law enacted in April
barring a late-term procedure that opponents call partial-birth
abortion, 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge J. Michael
Luttig, in Richmond, Va., reversed a federal district judge who had
found the law unconstitutional, a ruling consistent with recent
appellate court decisions in Ohio and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The district judge, Robert E. Payne, had issued an injunction
against the law last Thursday, pending the start of a trial on Aug.
18.
</P>
<P>
   Luttig's ruling was hailed by lawyers for the state as well as
by people active in the anti-abortion movement who have made
abortions in the last trimester of pregnancy a cornerstone of their
effort to draw moderates to their side.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case said Wednesday that they
were considering whether to appeal Luttig's decision to a
three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit, to the full circuit or to
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In arguments before Luttig, the plaintiffs contended that the
Virginia law, which is comparable to measures passed in other
states and is modeled after legislation twice passed by Congress
and twice vetoed by President Clinton, is written so broadly that a
majority of abortions could be banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Luttig has become the only appeals court judge in
America to decide the bill's language is clear, not vague,'' said
Karen Raschke, a lawyer for plaintiffs in the case, including two
doctors, two clinics and three Planned Parenthood branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred percent of the previous court decisions found the
language to be vague,'' Ms. Raschke added. ``He is a rogue judge on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Heller, a lawyer for the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy, a nonprofit group in New York that is also representing the
plaintiffs, said that as a result of Luttig's ruling, women seeking
abortions in Virginia and their doctors would not know whether they
might be subject to prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation outlawing late-term abortion has been adopted in 28
states since 1995 but remains in effect in only eight _ Indiana,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,
Utah and now Virginia. Three other states _ Alabama, Georgia and
Nebraska _ have limited enforcement. Kansas has passed a law
banning the procedure, but has not yet put it into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that would ban late-term abortions in 16 other
states has been blocked by federal or local courts. That includes a
ruling Wednesday by a federal judge in Louisville, Ky., who said he
would prevent a Kentucky law from taking effect on July 15 until he
could hear debate on it next month.
</P>
<P>
   In two of the three cases that have reached an appellate court _
Wisconsin and Ohio _ a three-judge panel ruled against the state.
In the Wisconsin case, the appellate court reversed a lower court
decision to uphold the ban, and the same court is now reviewing a
case involving Illinois' law. In the Ohio case, the U.S. Supreme
Court let stand an appellate court decision that struck down Ohio's
law.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia case came before Luttig after Payne refused the
state's request on Monday to reconsider his decision. With the law
scheduled to go into effect Wednesday, the Virginia attorney
general used a procedure that allows a case to be heard on an
emergency basis before one judge, rather than three.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules allow the loser in a court decision to choose any
judge in the same state as the U.S. District Court. In choosing
Luttig, the defendants gave the case to a conservative judge who
was appointed to the federal bench in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Luttig disputed the plaintiffs' contention that
the state law would expose doctors to prosecution for performing
routine abortions. That assumption, he wrote, ``was simply in
error.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the lower court found ``ambiguity where none
reasonably exists,'' and that no ``persons of ordinary
intelligence'' would conclude that the law prohibits the kinds of
abortions that are constitutionally protected by Supreme Court
decisions.

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal district judge threw out the tax evasion
case against Webster Hubbell on Wednesday, ruling in a powerful
critique of the independent counsel's tactics, that Kenneth Starr
had both exceeded his authority and reneged on a promise to grant
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, James Robertson, found that the criminal case was too
far removed from Starr's original mandate of 1994 to investigate
the business dealings of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton in Arkansas more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ruled that prosecutors, having granted immunity
to Hubbell to force him to produce 13,120 pages of records, then
used those records to make a case against him, in violation of his
rights against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment.
Robertson called the subpoena that led to the immunity agreement a
``quintessential fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   With the dismissal of the indictment of Hubbell, Starr could
lose the leverage he had hoped to use with one of Clinton's oldest
and closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, handed up two months ago, had accused Hubbell,
his wife, and two tax advisers of scheming in the last four years
to avoid paying taxes and penalties of more than $850,000.
Prosecutors had contended that much of the taxes owed on embezzled
money and hundreds of thousands of dollars in income were steered
to Hubbell, a former associate attorney general and longtime
Clinton friend, while prosecutors were seeking information against
the President and Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson ruled that the charges lodged against Hubbell in
April were too far afield from the original investigation over
which Starr was appointed to preside. Starr's original mandate was
an inquiry begun in 1994 to examine the ties of the president and
first lady to a corrupt savings association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent counsel's explanation of how this indictment
is `connected with' the original grant was a recitation spanning
six degrees of relationship,'' Robertson wrote. ``He has identified
no common witnesses, described no similar patterns of conduct,
cited no similar applicable law.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell appeared shocked and relieved by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good day,'' he said at the doorstep of his home here.
``I don't know how to react. It's been five years.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-paragraph statement that was issued by the independent
counsel's office but not signed by Starr said the decision would be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pleadings and oral arguments to the District Court reveal
our respectful disagreement with the district judge's decision,''
the statement said. ``We will seek prompt review of this ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, privately jubilant over the wide-ranging
criticism of Starr, which included a characterization of his
constitutional views as ``scary,'' were nevertheless taciturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else do you say when a federal judge has used words like
`scary' and `fishing expedition?''' said Rahm Emanuel, a senior
adviser to Clinton. ``It speaks volumes about that office and the
investigation itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In China, President Clinton said that he was pleased with the
outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision speaks for itself, but I'm happy for Webb and
Suzy and their family, Mike and his family and Charlie and his
family,'' he said in a remark relayed by Mike McCurry, the
presidential press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, who had also been a partner of Mrs. Clinton's at the
Rose law firm in Arkansas, had served nearly 17 months in prison
for bilking his former law partners and clients before he was
charged in April in the tax case.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have said that Hubbell had failed in the
first criminal case to live up to an agreement to be fully candid,
while Hubbell's supporters have said that the second indictment was
simply a further effort to pressure him unfairly into making false
incriminating statements against the Clintons. The tax indictment
suggested that some of the income he had failed to report to the
Internal Revenue Service might have been to discourage him from
being more candid with investigators, a suggestion that he had
vigorously denied.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robertson first hinted that he was leaning against the
independent counsel at a hearing last Friday when he referred to
one prosecutor's arguments on immunity as ``scary'' and was dubious
about links another prosecutor tried to make between the tax case
and Starr's original charter.
</P>
<P>
   The judge joined the bench in 1994, an early appointee of
President Clinton. He had been a seasoned corporate litigator and
partner at Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering, one of Washington's largest
law firms. While his clients included a number of large
corporations, the judge had also distinguished himself for playing
a leading role in civil rights causes in the United States and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue in his ruling on Starr's jurisdiction was the
delicate balance between the judiciary and the executive branch in
enforcing the independent counsel law and the proper role of the
special court that appoints such counsels and oversees their work.
The court, known as the Special Division, consists of three federal
appeals judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Created by the independent counsel law, the Special Division
serves as a kind of hybrid institution, performing some functions
normally left to the executive branch and others similar to those
of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   In January the special division, acting at the request of Starr,
issued a secret order giving the Whitewater independent counsel the
authority to investigate Hubbell's taxes. The precise question
presented by Hubbell and the other defendants was whether the
special division had the authority to expand Starr's jurisdiction
in the absence of a request by the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Two other federal district court judges ruled last year that the
special division had such authority in criminal cases brought
against peripheral defendants by the independent counsel
investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. Those judges
had written that they were reluctant to second-guess the decisions
of the special division, particularly since they are all appeals
court judges.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday Robertson said he disagreed with those district
court judges. Robertson found that although the special division
consisted of Federal appeals judges, the panel ``in fact is not a
court of appeals.'' Rather by constitutional limitations imposed
upon it by the Supreme Court, the special division performs
``essentially ministerial'' acts that can be reviewed by a district
court.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Robertson wrote, the special division ``may interpret
the independent counsel's original grant. It may not expand the
independent counsel's jurisidction without the consent of the
attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This limitation is constitutional, and, if it is to mean
anything at all, must be enforceable upon a proper challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that his reasoning ought not to affect Starr's
jurisdiction to pursue the investigation of Monica Lewinsky because
the attorney general had specifically recommended that the
indendent counsel examine that matter.
</P>
<P>
   After finding that he had the authority to review the special
division's order conferring authority on the indendent counsel to
investigate Hubbell's taxes, the judge concluded that the order was
not ``demonstrably related'' to the attorney general's application
for the appointment of Starr when he was appointed.
</P>
<P>
   In the immunity section of his decision, Robertson rejected the
independent counsel's argument that the agreement that led to the
production of Hubbell's business records should be narrowly
construed. Prosecutors had maintained that the immunity that they
had granted meant only that they could not tell a jury that they
had received the documents from Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hubbell's compelled production of documents allowed the
independent counsel to build a case against Mr. Hubbell different
in all material respects from the case for which they had been
subpoenaed,'' the judge wrote. ``Mr. Hubbell was thereby turned
into the primary informant against himself.''

 &HT;    Judge removes himself from Jones's case
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A woman who says Andruw Jones is the father of her
child is trying to negotiate a new child-support agreement with the
Braves center fielder _ and end bizarre court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Jacquelyn Barnett of Duluth said Wednesday that DNA tests
indicate a 99.97 percent likelihood that Jones is the father of her
daughter, Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has refused to discuss the woman's paternity suit, which
is pending in Fulton County Superior Court. Jones also would not
comment Wednesday on the action by judge Joel J. Fryer to remove
himself from the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reaction,'' Jones said of Fryer's action.
</P>
<P>
   Fryer's motion to recuse himself from the case was entered June
11, according to the Fulton Daily Report, about the time he was
contacted by Sports Illustrated for an article on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The article quoted Fryer praising Jones as a player and said
that the judge ``should be wearing an Atlanta Braves jersey instead
of a jurist's robe.''
</P>
<P>
   Fryer took himself off the case ``to avoid any appearance of
prejudice or bias,'' according to the Daily Report.
</P>
<P>
   Fryer, who has been on the Superior Court bench for 24 years,
could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said Jones' second blood test came back positive. The
case could go back to court if a compromise is not reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andruw hasn't taken any responsibility, not an inkling of
it,'' Barnett said Wednesday. ``(But) since he is not going to be
there, I have to make sure my child will be supported. I will push
the money issue out the window, I'll take it down to $10, if he
would be a father to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, who is working out of her house for $9 an hour as a
transcriber, said that she met Jones at the bar American Pie early
last year and that they dated for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a struggle make up the difference we need in our
household,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The case went to Fryer's court in February when Barnett sought
$4,449 a month in child support. Jones, who is making $411,000 with
the Braves this season, had offered $2,500. Fryer awarded $1,500, a
temporary order contingent upon Jones taking another blood test.
</P>
<P>
   SI and the Daily Report quoted the judge as saying, ``We've got
a 23-year-old mother here who's got a wonderful education (and) who
wants to stay home until her infant becomes 18 years of age, so
long as that fat cow continues to pay. Well, I don't have great
sympathy for that. I'm going to make her starve to death if that is
what she plans on doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, who is 24, said she was stunned by Fryer's comments.
``I felt as if I was put on the stand,'' she said. ``I was totally
judged not by just Andruw's attorneys but by Judge Fryer.
</P>
<P>
   `` I am trying to be as good as a mother as I can to Madison,''
she said. ``What was addressed was my moral character and (that)
Andruw was victimized. I am not saying he is the victim, either. It
is Madison who is the victim, if there is one.''

NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN RECOVER FROM AIDS
INFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The body's immune system can recover to a large extent,
even after it has been ravaged by severe AIDS, according to
evidence reported here on Wednesday by French scientists at the
12th World AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
   This news helps answer a major question that has long stymied
AIDS researchers. In practical terms, it means that people infected
with HIV, the AIDS virus, would not need to take drugs to protect
against potentially deadly infections that can occur as
complications of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, scientists have not known whether the immune system
could be restored after severe infection with HIV, because there is
little precedent from other immune deficiency diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brigitte Autran, an immunologist at the l'Hopital
Pitie-Salpetriere in Paris, said her studies showed ``a tremendous
recovery'' of the immune system from AIDS. Dr. Autran's research
supports reports from other laboratories that have offered
increasingly strong evidence of the potential recovery of an
AIDS-damaged immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now providing the proof that indeed the immune system
is not dead,'' Dr. Autran said. ``It can be restored even late in
the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., observed, ``Dr. Autran's
work is among the best in showing that there is at least partial
reconstitution of the immune system.''
</P>
<P>
   The studies, which expanded on parts of Dr. Autran's previously
published research, involved a small number of AIDS patients who
had taken newer combinations of anti-HIV drugs for 24 months. The
combinations, often called drug cocktails, can drive the amount of
virus in a person's blood below levels detectable in laboratory
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery of the immune system is directly related to the degree
of suppression of HIV resulting from drug cocktail therapy, Dr.
Autran said. After therapy began, immune system cells returned at
high speed for the first two months and then increased at a slower
but steady pace, Dr. Autran said. Other cells, known as CD-8 cells,
also slowly return toward normal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Autran estimated that it would take four to eight years for
full reconstitution of the immune system to occur. This prediction
presumes that an individual is able to continue taking the drug
cocktails and that the amount of virus remains at low levels. At
this point, no one knows how long a person can tolerate the drugs
or how safe they are over many years.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of immune restoration in AIDS is not a complete
surprise, Fauci said, because immune systems that are severely
damaged from irradiation for bone marrow transplants do recover.
But it usually takes one to two years.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS cripples the immune system largely by the virus'
destruction of so-called CD-4 blood cells. When these cells drop to
low levels, an individual's risk of developing a number of unusual
infections as complications of AIDS increases dramatically. Among
such infections are pneumocystis pneumonia and toxoplasmosis. They
often are the cause of death in people who have AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Autran said that in 1996 her team began testing 303 patients
``at very advanced stages'' of AIDS. After drug therapy, 80 percent
of the participants sustained a significant increase in CD-4 cells.
Over an 18-month period, the median CD-4 counts rose to 194 per
cubic millimeter from 51. The normal CD-4 counts varies, but is
usually from 500 to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Autran said further work was needed to determine whether
earlier or stronger treatment was required for full recovery. She
also raised the possible need for using additional strategies like
vaccines to stimulate the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Tests show that the new CD-4 cells are ``naive,'' meaning that
these newly created cells have not been exposed to foreign
substances like H.I.V. Naive cells emerged after six months and
showed a continuous increase for the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that the new cells are naive is crucial evidence for
restoring the immune system. CD-4 cells are normally produced in
the thymus gland in the upper chest. The gland is large in
childhood, but generally turns into scar tissue as it shrinks in
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the thymus is gone, what is the source of the new CD-4
cells in the recovery of the immune system?
</P>
<P>
   Presumably they come from other areas in the body that function
as a thymus, ``but we don't know where they are,'' Fauci said. He
said his team was making a large effort to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the scientific interest in documenting the recovery of
the immune system is a question crucial to medical practice. Do the
new cells protect against the unusual infections that occur as
complications of AIDS?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Autran believes so. Laboratory tests of restored cells from
the participants indicated that they should be capable of fighting
off microbes that cause toxoplasmosis and other complicating
infections of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Autran and Fauci said it would take clinical trials to
determine at what point patients could safely stop taking drugs to
prevent the complicating infections.

 &HT;    Tropicana cranks up power stats
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ It was only after Tropicana Field was
mapped out that club officials realized the dimensions almost
matched old Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, a quaint fact the Devil Rays
liked to accent as they converted the world's largest
cable-supported dome into a baseball park.
</P>
<P>
   What the tenants have found after three months is hardly quaint.
And after giving up Tuesday night's twin homers to Andres
Galarraga, D-Rays left-hander Tony Saunders spoke up about
Tropicana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows this place is a joke,'' he said after
Galarraga brought to 35 the number of home runs Tampa Bay gave up
in its first 39 home games, as opposed to 25 homers on the road.
``All you have to do is lift the ball here. I mean, the only place
that's legit is to center field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trop measures 370 in the power alleys, 315 down the
left-field line and 322 to right, all easy reaches. Center field is
a cemetery, at 407 straight-away and a preposterous 415 to deepest
left-center, exactly where Chipper Jones homered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hitters are going to like it,'' he said. ``The pitchers
are going to hate it. As long as the pitchers keep the ball up the
middle, that's the only way it plays legit. If they start hitting
balls down the lines or into the gaps, it quickly becomes a
hitter's park.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wohlers project
</P>
<P>
   After a positive first appearance with AAA Richmond Tuesday
night, closer Mark Wohlers was to pitch again Wednesday in the
R-Braves' game in Charlotte. Wohlers needed 16 pitches to retire
the side in a one-walk/one-strikeout eighth inning in Richmond's
6-0 win. The team still maintains no schedule for his return to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Simon says ...
</P>
<P>
   Randall Simon is earning his keep since arriving from Richmond.
He took over at first base Wednesday when Galarraga's left wrist
would not loosen up where he was hit by a pitch the night before.
Galarraga was able to DH. Simon has appeared in all three games
since his call-up.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko update
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko, recuperating from a Monday appendectomy, spoke with
Bobby Cox Wednesday and left his manager thinking the Braves can
get by without placing him on the DL. ``He feels fine,'' Cox said.
``Hopefully, he'll start hitting Monday.''

NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN RECOVER FROM AIDS
INFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ The body's immune system can recover to a
large extent, even after it has been ravaged by severe AIDS,
according to evidence reported here on Wednesday by French
scientists at the 12th World AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, it means that people infected with HIV, the
AIDS virus, would not need to take drugs to protect against
potentially deadly infections that can occur as complications of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, scientists have not known whether the immune system
could be restored after severe infection with HIV, because there is
little precedent from other immune deficiency diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brigitte Autran, an immunologist at the l'Hopital
Pitie-Salpetriere in Paris, said her studies showed ``a tremendous
recovery'' of the immune system from AIDS. Dr. Autran's research
supports reports from other laboratories that have offered
increasingly strong evidence of the potential recovery of an
AIDS-damaged immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now providing the proof that indeed the immune system
is not dead,'' Dr. Autran said. ``It can be restored even late in
the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The studies, which expanded on parts of Dr. Autran's previously
published research, involved a small number of AIDS patients who
had taken newer combinations of anti-HIV drugs for 24 months. The
combinations, often called drug cocktails, can drive the amount of
virus in a person's blood below levels detectable in laboratory
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery of the immune system is directly related to the degree
of suppression of HIV resulting from drug cocktail therapy, Dr.
Autran said. After therapy began, immune system cells returned at
high speed for the first two months and then increased at a slower
but steady pace, Dr. Autran said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Autran estimated that it would take four to eight years for
full reconstitution of the immune system to occur. This prediction
presumes that an individual is able to continue taking the drug
cocktails and that the amount of virus remains at low levels. At
this point, no one knows how long a person can tolerate the drugs
or how safe they are over many years.

COMMUNIST HONG KONG HAS ITS 1ST BIRTHDAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ One year after the Union Jack was lowered here for
the last time, Hong Kong marked the anniversary of its return to
China with a restrained celebration Wednesday that suggested people
had other things on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   On a bright and breezy day that began with a ceremonial raising
of the Chinese flag at Victoria Harbor, China's president, Jiang
Zemin, said the government was ``very satisfied'' with Hong Kong's
first year as a semiautonomous city.
</P>
<P>
   But Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, captured the
dark mood of the place with a plea that people here ``summon
unprecedented courage to overcome the difficulties and open the
doors to the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of Hong Kong is not to be measured by our fortune
today,'' Tung said in a speech to 5,500 guests at a cultural
pageant Wednesday morning. ``Rather, it will be determined by our
current spirit and vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's economy has plowed into a wall since the handover, a
victim of the Asian financial crisis and an inflated property
market. With a deepening recession, soaring unemployment and a
crash in real-estate prices, Hong Kong has gone from being a mecca
of commerce to being just another sickly Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a celebration,'' said Emily Lau, an outspoken
pro-democracy politician who was recently elected to Hong Kong's
Legislative Council. ``We are simply marking the fact that we
survived one year under Communist rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Lau marched with a small group of
demonstrators who were protesting, among other things, the
government's lack of an adequate social safety net to cushion
people from the full force of the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a more militant protest group tried to march on the Hong
Kong Convention Center, where Jiang and Tung were attending a
banquet. The protesters carried placards calling for Jiang to
resign and a black coffin that honored the civilians killed in the
Tiananmen massacre in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   When the group was stopped short of the Convention Center by
riot policemen, the protesters tried to push the coffin through the
police line. A brief standoff ensued and the demonstrators then set
the coffin ablaze to protest being kept so far from the Chinese
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Police exerted a light hand on both rallies. Several observers
said the number of people taking part in the demonstrations was
smaller than at the handover, when police were harshly criticized
for broadcasting classical music to drown out the chants of
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang did not allow worries about the economy to dampen his
mood. Fresh from a public debate in Beijing with President Clinton,
he disarmed the audience at the pageant with a jaunty greeting in
Cantonese, then immediately reverted to Mandarin to deliver the
familiar pronouncements of a top Communist official.
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful handover, he said, ``proves Deng Xiaoping's theory
that Hong Kong people can govern Hong Kong is completely
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese flags fluttered from lampposts and even the
masts of sloops at the Hong Kong Yacht Club, this year's observance
was not a citywide celebration like the handover. Gone were the
spectacular fireworks and laser shows. Instead, Tung squired Jiang
to a series of tightly controlled events with select guest lists,
as the rest of Hong Kong enjoyed a day off in the sunshine.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When they stopped to talk, people had mixed feelings about
celebrating July 1. ``It's nothing special,'' said a clerk in her
30s who would identify herself only as Ms. Lau. She noted that the
biggest change in Hong Kong since China took over was the weak
economy, though she acknowledged it was not China's fault.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lau also said China had muted Hong Kong's freewheeling
atmosphere. ``When we were under British rule, we could speak
freely,'' she said. ``Now we have to be more careful about what we
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people were quietly exultant about the anniversary. ``Being
a Hong Kong Chinese, I am proud to be here at this time,'' said
Patrick Poon, a 50-year-old employee of Dow Corning in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jiang, the Chinese leader, no longer stirs much comment
here since his visit last year to celebrate the handover. ``It's
like if you bought a house and you rent it out,'' said Chu Shu-san,
48, a newspaper vendor in Causeway Bay. ``You'd have to come down
and check it out once in a while.''

FILM SHOWS `PLENTY' OF POTENTIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to overreact to a film like Hav Plenty, which is
probably why it was a Sundance Film Festival fave (or should that
be `fav'?). A romantic comedy that doesn't aim for the lowest
common denominator, its has a good nature that will win you over.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least it makes you want to be won over. The movie wears
its shallow pockets on its sleeve, but it shows off its
preciousness as well, starting with the name game of its title.
</P>
<P>
   Hav is Havilland Savage (Chenoa Maxwell), a career woman who is
successful, beautiful and a little snooty. Plenty is Lee Plenty
(Christopher Scott Cherot), a blocked writer who is homeless,
handsome and easygoing. Longtime friends, they find things heating
up when Miss Savage invites Mr. Plenty _ as they're fond of calling
each other _ to spend New Year's weekend with her friends and her
family.
</P>
<P>
   Some friends; some family. The two lead characters obviously
have a thing for each other, although Hav is dating a hip-hop star
and Lee doesn't much care for her materialism. If the movie had
concentrated solely on them figuring out their attraction, things
might have been fine, but a running gag about Lee's irresistibility
to women is a little tough to buy. Sure, the guy's good-looking,
but he barely showers or changes clothes all weekend. Must be the
pheromones.
</P>
<P>
   What hurts the movie most, though, is one of its badges of
honor: its indie-film budget. This was obviously a labor of love
for Cherot, who wrote, directed and edited the film, which claims
to be based on a true story. Much about him is likable: He's
pleasant on camera, his script has some very funny moments, and his
direction largely steers clear of rookie-filmmaker
self-consciousness. But even the movie's ritzy locations look a
little too indie, as ife he had just grabbed the camcorder, and the
pacing drags _ never a good idea when you're attempting screwball
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Cherot shows enough promise to make you hope that this will lead
to bigger things for him, although he ends the movie on a rather
distressing copout (and sellout) note. Uneven as it is, ``Hav
Plenty'' deserves a chance; but even if you cut it some slack,
you'll still probably want to like it more than you really do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hav Plenty'' is rated R for frank dialogue, sexual situations
and mild violence.

 POLITICS LACES DISCUSSION AT SOCIAL SECURITY FORUM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRANSTON, R.I. _ The fourth question for Vice President Al Gore
at Wednesday's town hall discussion here on Social Security came
from Eve Goldberg, who turned 100 on April 18. Given that she does
not have forever, she said, she wondered when politicians were
going to stop talking about fixing the retirement system and get on
with the job of making sure it would be there for her six
grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Goldberg, God bless you, what a wonderful question,''
replied Gore, warming to the opportunity for a little Oprah-style
politics along with the policy wonkery he mastered long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the reason we shouldn't act right now,'' Gore said.
``They don't call it the third rail for nothing. Both political
parties have scars to show from past battles fought in and around
Social Security policy. And since it's so important to get it
right, it's worth taking a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was optimistic that the Clinton administration and
Congress could work out a solution next year, and he said
bipartisanship on the issue could help reduce public cynicism about
the federal government. But Wednesday's discussion _ the second of
four that the White House has planned for this year _ showed that
consensus among politicians and among the public remains a long way
off.
</P>
<P>
   On the stage alongside Gore were Social Security experts and
lawmakers from both parties, including Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C.,
who made the case for allowing Americans to divert a portion of
their Social Security payroll taxes into private investment
accounts. He said that because workers did not want to pay higher
taxes to deal with Social Security's looming financial problems and
retirees would not countenance big benefit cuts, the natural answer
was to seek the higher returns available in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said privatization might be
attractive on Wall Street, but made little sense for the working
poor. ``If you want to shoot craps, remember that you could win or
you could lose,'' Rangel said by way of reminder that stock markets
go down as well as up, an observation that brought a roar of
agreement from many in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   But the deep division over how to deal with Social Security was
clear in the audience of 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   One questioner said the debate seemed to have become a grab for
more money rather than a consideration of Social Security's role as
an intergenerational guarantee against poverty in old age. ``All I
hear about is me, me, me _ am I going to get back what I put in,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a small business warned that any increase in the
tax bill he has to pay for each worker he employs means he would
hire fewer workers, leading Gore to reiterate President Clinton's
statement of several months ago that the White House sees no need
for an increase in payroll tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   To a single father who asked how he could save for his
retirement when he had difficulty enough supporting his elderly
mother while saving for his children's education, Gore said the
lesson should be that Social Security ``is really a program for all
generations _ when the benefits are adequate for seniors, it takes
the pressure off you.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the talk turned to whether politicians could put aside
partisanship to deal with Social Security before the 2000
presidential race, Gore deadpanned, ``Nobody will be thinking about
elections in 1999.''

GOP CONTENDERS ADDRESS HISPANIC GROUP  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLEN R. MYERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The nation's largest Hispanic political organization,
showing sharp preferences among possible Republican presidential
contenders, made Texas Gov. George Bush feel right at home
Wednesday while treating Speaker Newt Gingrich as a guest more
tolerated than welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the League of United Latin American Citizens, which
is holding its annual convention here, was divided over whether to
even invite Gingrich, in view of his opposition to affirmative
action, bilingual education, the introduction of sampling
procedures in the census and other Lulac causes.
</P>
<P>
   Belen Robles, Lulac's president, cited Gingrich's recent support
for Puerto Rican self-determination, a review of the property
claims of New Mexico's early Hispanic settlers and the restoration
of public benefits to some categories of immigrants who have not
become citizens. Officials of Lulac and other Hispanic groups said
they had agreed to thank Gingrich in speeches and publications.
Several other Lulac leaders, including the Texas delegation,
protested the invitation and left or stayed outside the hotel
ballroom where Gingrich spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich has never done anything to help the Hispanic
community,'' said Francisco Rodriguez III, a former Lulac vice
president who is among many candidates for the group's presidency.
``For him to come before us now without offering even a token of
apology is totally against what we stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich acknowledged in his speech that he was somewhat out of
place. ``I'm a Georgian. I'm a conservative Republican,'' he said,
with a grin. ``This is not the first of five things I thought I
would get invited to today.''
</P>
<P>
   The House speaker, searching for issues where he could win
Hispanic favor without alienating Republican stalwarts,
concentrated on areas of agreement, including free trade with
Mexico. He only alluded to his support of the recently passed
Proposition 187 in California, meant to abolish that state's
bilingual education system, by saying that he favored having
students learn Spanish as well as English.
</P>
<P>
   But for Bush, support for Mexican trade was only a point of
departure for issues including bilingual education, which he has
generally supported but whose effectiveness he proposes to test.
Addressing Ms. Robles as ``el jefe grande,'' he praised her
leadership in well-accented Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Bush held a news conference before his speech, answering some
questions in Spanish. Lulac officials allowed a break in their
luncheon schedule so he could walk into the crowd for handshakes,
backslaps and hugs. Bush, running for re-election this year, has a
huge lead in the polls, overall and among Hispanic voters, over
State Land Commissioner Garry Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, following Bush Wednesday drew polite applause and left
the room immediately after speaking. As with anyone learning a
language, he has made some errors. A Spanish translation of a
statement from his office called him the ``Hablador,'' which,
instead of speaker in Spanish, means something closer to ``big
talker'' or ``braggart.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gingrich and most other Republicans are struggling with
Spanish, they do know arithmetic. From 1992 to 1996, the number of
registered Hispanic voters rose by about 30 percent to 6.6 million,
and Lulac wants to add another 2 million by the 2000. Measures that
have limited or threatened public services for resident aliens have
prodded millions of them to become citizens and to register to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   These new voters are concentrated in large states like New York,
Illinois, California and Texas. Having once hoped to draw even
among Hispanic voters, Republicans are finding that at least three
of four new Hispanic voters are registering as Democrats.

<P>
   When President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin last
Saturday announced to a world audience the two countries have
stopped aiming nuclear missiles at one another, their statement
omitted a key fact: The Pentagon had unilaterally ``detargeted''
Chinese sites more than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon in May 1994 completed removing targeting data from
U.S. nuclear missiles as part of a bilateral agreement with Moscow.
But the mechanics of doing so also led to the removal of Chinese
targets from the U.S. strategic missile force, spokesmen for the
Defense Department and U.S. Strategic Command said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Chinese sites have not been targeted by U.S.
missiles for four years was not noted at the Beijing summit, which
highlighted the detargeting as a sign of improving Sino-American
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Strategic Command, which controls the American nuclear
force of Trident missile submarines, land-based Minuteman III and
Peacekeeper missiles, and nuclear-armed B-52H bombers, acknowledged
the 1994 order removing target data from U.S. missiles embraced all
potential nuclear war sites _ including China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States does not target its nuclear missiles on a
day-to-day basis against any country,'' Strategic Command spokesman
Lt. Col. Phil Hutchinson said in a statement. ``The United States
formally detargeted its missiles on 30 May 1994, in the context of
a reciprocal detargeting commitment with the Russian Federation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Queenie Byars confirmed this.
``When you say the United States detargeted ballistic missiles in
May 1994 did that include China? The answer was yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists said
nuclear weapons experts were generally aware the U.S.-Russian
agreement had led to a total removal of all targeting data from
American missiles. ``They detargeted everything four years ago,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   What last week's announcement by Clinton and Jiang did signify
is that China agreed for the first time to remove American
targeting coordinates from its fleet of DF-5 intercontinental
ballistic missiles. The missiles have been deployed in ground-based
silos in central China since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 13 DF-5 missiles currently on alert can carry a
single multi-megaton thermonuclear warhead between 7,500-9,375
miles, a range that covers the entire continental United States,
Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese arsenal is minute compared with the U.S. nuclear
force. The United States fields between 6,000-10,000 deployed
strategic weapons. The force includes eight Trident submarines at
Navy Submarine Base Bangor in Washington state that carry a total
of 1,536 warheads loaded eight apiece in 24 Trident I missiles per
sub.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's joint press conference in Beijing, Clinton said he
and Jiang had struck a ``mutual decision'' to remove targeting
information from each side's strategic nuclear arsenal as a step
toward improved relations and as a confidence-building mechanism
for further nuclear talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was a mutual decision we made because we felt that,
number one, if we detargeted, we would completely eliminate the
prospect ever of any kind of accidental launch,'' Clinton said.
``And number two, we would take one more step in showing mutual
confidence and trust in one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang told reporters, ``President Clinton and I decided that
China and the United States would not target the strategic nuclear
weapons under their respective control at each other. Then this
demonstrates to the entire world that China and the United States
are partners, not adversaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, asked Wednesday to comment on the Beijing
statements and the fact that U.S. missiles haven't been aimed at
China for years, acknowledged that the Clinton-Jiang agreement did
not concern itself with the time period of any previous targeting.
An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said only that the two leaders focused on agreeing not to target
strategic nuclear weapons at each other, regardless of any actions
taken earlier.
</P>
<P>
   One congressional critic of the White House said the
Clinton-Jiang detargeting announcement was a step to ``lull the
American people into a sense of false security'' about nuclear
weapons, particularly with the high political profile put on
detargeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton and Jiang were looking for something to say''
at the summit, said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a member of the House
National Security Committee who has frequently derided the
administration's arms control policies. ``It was a lot of pomp and
hot air and nothing of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, an expert on nuclear command-and-control systems,
told Congress last year the U.S.-Soviet detargeting accord, while
well-meaning, was ``cosmetic and symbolic'' because the targeting
data remains either loaded in the missile's own computer or in a
standby fire control database that can be reloaded into the systems
within a few seconds. In the case of an accidental missile launch,
Russian programs are set to automatically re-aim the missile at its
last target setting.
</P>
<P>
   New American systems, including the Trident I missiles, have had
all of their targeting data removed from the missile computers but
they can be reintalled within seconds, Pike said. Older Minuteman
III missiles have been re-aimed at open ocean areas _ their
computers require a specific ``aim point'' to be entered in the
missile guidance system.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether the Chinese missiles would require a
manual retargeting instruction or can be re-aimed by computer, Pike
said.

 CONSTRUCTION FIRM TARGETED BY UNIONS FACES STATE LABOR CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A non-union construction company that is the target
of a union protest campaign, including the raucous rally in midtown
Manhattan on Tuesday, faces possible disqualification from many
future state contracts, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on evidence provided by several unions, the state Labor
Department has charged the company, Roy Kay Inc., with misleading
state officials about safety violations and its failure to pay the
prevailing wage to its workers.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations concern the Freehold, N.J., company's
application for certification for an apprenticeship training
program. State officials said they were planning to rescind the
company's certification, which would effectively bar Roy Kay from
working on many state projects.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Roy Kay, whose $32.6 million contract with the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build a subway command
center stirred Tuesday's demonstrations and violent clashes,
disputed the state's charges. A hearing is scheduled for next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said they hoped the MTA would cancel Roy Kay's
contract if the Labor Department ruled against the company, though
it was not clear whether the transit agency would be willing to
switch contractors in the middle of the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a decision would probably open the door to their being
removed from this project and possibly being barred from all public
work in New York,'' said Paul Fernandes, spokesman for the Building
and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, which
organized Tuesday's turbulent rally against Roy Kay.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of the increase in non-union contractors, the city's
building trades unions have singled out Roy Kay because it is
growing rapidly and has won several recent MTA, state and city
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why the labor movement had decided to battle Roy Kay
in particular, Mike Hellstrom, assistant organizing director of
Laborers' Local 79, said: ``Roy Kay has told the building and
construction trades that he's planning to become the biggest
non-union contractor on the Eastern Seaboard. Anytime a contractor
comes and says, `I'm going to going to come and take away your
market share,' that's a threat to us and to our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Kay vice president David Kay said at a news conference
Wednesday that the charges the state Labor Department has brought
against it, based on information the unions provided, were
unfounded. ``They are totally 100 percent false,'' he said,
standing in front of the construction site at 54th Street and Ninth
Avenue. ``There's no justice to it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday, thousands of construction workers paralyzed the morning
rush in midtown when they held a planned, but raucous rally in
front of MTA headquarters. The rally was far larger than city
officials expected. Police Commissioner Howard Safir said he
expected 10,000 protested, but estimated that 40,000 workers
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the demonstration, thousands of burly
construction workers broke off in a spontaneous march toward the
Roy Kay building site. As they headed across town and once they
arrived at the site, dozens of demonstrators clashed with police,
leaving 38 workers arrested and leaving 18 police officers and
three demonstrators injured.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kelly, an MTA spokesman, said the authority would review
any state Labor Department decision to decertify Roy Kay's
apprenticeship program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would review the decision and take appropriate action,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even union officials acknowledged it might be hard for the
MTA to throw Roy Kay off the command center job because there
already was a binding contract and because of the inevitable
difficulties and increased costs in switching contractors in the
middle of a project.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA awarded the contract to Roy Kay because it was lowest
bidder. The second- and third-lowest bidders were also non-union
companies. The fourth lowest bid, $34.9 million _ $2.3 million more
than Roy Kay's bid _ was from a unionized contractor, E.W. Howell
Co. of Melville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The state Labor Department has already suspended Roy Kay's
apprenticeship program, and has scheduled a hearing for August 18
so that the company can present its arguments why its program
should not be terminated.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, contractors are not allowed to use apprentices
on public projects unless they have a state-certified
apprenticeship program. Contractors generally use many apprentices
on their sites because apprentices are paid considerably less than
journeymen.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires public agencies to award contracts to the
lowest bidder, which must pay its workers prevailing wage, although
the low bid can be rejected if the company is determined not to be
a responsible bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said that if Roy Kay's apprenticeship program
was disqualified for perjury or safety violations, public agencies
might then conclude that it was not a responsible company.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Kay, president of the company, defended its performance,
saying that in its 27 years, the building company has been cited
for relatively few safety violations compared with its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference his son, David Kay, added, ``There is
much fury against us because they are scared. We are a legit
company. We pay the daily wage. We have excellent workmanship. They
can't stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen union researchers have been digging up
incriminating material against Roy Kay. They provided the labor
department with information indicating that in its May 1996
apprenticeship application, the company had underreported the
number of safety violations it had been charged with.
</P>
<P>
   The unions also informed the labor department that a state labor
official told Roy Kay that he planned to withhold $44,300 on a
public works project at the New York Psychiatric Center because Roy
Kay had used unskilled workers, who are supposed to be paid at a
lower rate, to do the higher-paid skilled jobs of steamfitters and
sheet metal workers. On its application Roy Kay had said it had no
public work violations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Pakistani claiming to be a defector from his
country's nuclear weapons program said Wednesday that Pakistan's
top military leadership, fearing an imminent Indian nuclear attack,
decided on April 25 to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike on New
Delhi within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   That attack, however, never took place.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Iftikhar Khan Chaudhry, who is seeking asylum in the United
States, also said that Pakistan had already armed and deployed
missiles with nuclear warheads at two sites along the Indian border
and had enough fissionable material for 12 to 18 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of news conferences at the Madison Avenue office of
his lawyer, Michael Wildes, Khan told shifts of reporters that he
had seen Iranian and Chinese technicians at Pakistan's nuclear
plants and that the program received funds from Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates. A story about Khan appeared Wednesday in
USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pakistani official said Khan had made up his story in
order to gain American citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is a total fraud,'' said Ahmad Kamal, the Pakistani
representative to the United Nations. ``He has an identity card
which is a forgery, and it's a bad forgery at that.'' Wildes had
produced a photostat of what was said to be Khan's identification
card from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But Kamal said the card was phony because it bore the general
crest of the Pakistani government rather than the special seal of
the Atomic Energy Commission. He added that the card also bore the
name of the Ministry of Science and Technology, whereas the Atomic
Energy Commission is a separate organization that reports directly
to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Kamal said that Pakistani authorities believed Khan might be a
man who worked briefly in an entry-level job for the nuclear
program and dropped out of sight in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Khan said that he had attended a meeting presided over by Gen.
Jehingir Karmat, the chief of the army general staff, at which
Pakistani intelligence agencies said they had information that
India was about to launch a nuclear attack on Pakistan's nuclear
development sites.
</P>
<P>
   Among the intelligence reports, he said, was word from Pakistani
radar experts working in the Arab gulf states that an Israeli plane
had been seen flying into India. The meeting he described occurred
well before India's nuclear tests on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Khan, who said he was attending the meeting as an assistant to
Dr. Altaf Hussain, the second man in the Atomic Energy Commission,
said that Karmat gave the go-ahead for a strike within two days.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he became upset by the prospect of death and
destruction in both countries and, along with four other junior
colleagues, wrote a letter to Hussain urging that Pakistan refrain
from the attack. If not, he said, they would ``go public'' with
their objections.
</P>
<P>
   Khan said he was dismissed the next day and threatened with
death. He said his wife was kidnapped and is being held by internal
security forces. Khan said he went into hiding and managed to
escape to Canada and then entered the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials in Washington said Khan's story was
being weighed with caution. &QL;

 EMERGING AS A LEADING MAN OF SUPPORTING ACTORS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JUSTINE ELIAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the actor Will Patton, it's the end of the world. Again.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of some 30 films, he has endured post-apocalyptic
mail carriers, squishy parasites from outer space and the wrath of
God, so this weekend's scourge _ an asteroid the size of Texas,
headed straight for Earth _ should be no trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Patton is appearing in ``Armageddon,'' which stars Bruce Willis
and is the summer's second doomsday adventure movie. (The first,
``Deep Impact,'' was released in May.) Though audiences may be
drawn most to the film's fiery special effects, Patton's supporting
performance is likely to bring more attention to his idiosyncratic
career, which has encompassed off-Broadway plays (``Fool for Love''
and ``A Lie of the Mind,'' both by Sam Shepard); art films (``The
Rapture,'' a drama about divine judgment); obscure science-fiction
movies (``The Puppet Masters,'' with the squishy parasites), and
surprise commercial hits (``Desperately Seeking Susan'').
</P>
<P>
   He may be best known as the scheming Pentagon aide in ``No Way
Out,'' the 1987 political thriller starring Kevin Costner, and as
the sinister police officer in ``The Client'' (1994), who tells an
11-year-old crime witness that the FBI has ``a special little
kid-sized electric chair'' for little boys who tell lies.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Armageddon,'' released by Touchstone, a division of Disney,
Patton portrays Charles (Chick) Chapple, one of 13 oil-rig workers
drafted by NASA for a mission to intercept and destroy a killer
asteroid. In a cast that includes some of film's most frequently
employed character actors _ including Billy Bob Thornton and Steve
Buscemi _ Patton, 44, plays the hero's beatifically calm best
friend. Though this is his first appearance in a summer
blockbuster, Patton said, he approached the role seriously, as he
does all roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't play anything until I find something that connects to
my life, something I can carry as my secret map or code for the
character,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a link to his role in ``Armageddon'' wasn't
difficult. As a 19-year-old aspiring actor, drifting about the
country and picking up odd jobs to pay his way to New York City, he
found work cleaning up an oil spill on the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Patton and his fellow day-laborers _ ``all drunk, or hung over,
and sort of unaddressable,'' he said _ were paid to lean off the
edge of a barge and, using giant mops, scoop up the oil slick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of anonymous,'' he said. ``As the boss was leaving
in his motorboat, he says, `Oh, by the way, if you fall in, you'll
be sucked right under.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Patton seemed to be on the verge of telling more stories of
those days when he paused. He said he would rather keep most of the
details about his life to himself. Shy of interviews, he generally
avoided the publicity campaign for ``Armageddon,'' in part, he
said, because he didn't feel able to discuss the film before seeing
a finished print.
</P>
<P>
   He has instead spent the last month driving from Los Angeles
back home to Manhattan. Along the way, he stopped in Idaho to do
one day's work on ``Breakfast of Champions,'' an independent film
directed by Alan Rudolph and starring Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way I feel completely frightened of dealing with other
human beings at all, yet here I am sticking my face in front of a
movie camera all the time,'' Patton said.
</P>
<P>
   Though some describe Patton as a bit reclusive, Holly Hunter,
who first met him in the 1980s, when both were stage actors in New
York, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will is unbelievably charismatic, and he has a certain
mystique,'' said Ms. Hunter, who so enjoyed Patton's performance in
a 1984 production of ``Fool for Love'' that she saw the show
several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I admired him from afar,'' she said. ``I was
completely taken with who he seemed to be in that play: a fantasy,
of course, a complete female fantasy. Kind of an odd female
fantasy, but nevertheless, mine.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Hunter's career soared, she twice sought Patton as a
co-star: in a 1987 television movie, ``A Gathering of Old Men,''
and in the 1995 murder mystery ``Copycat,'' in which the two played
San Francisco police detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Patton is well known for his work in over 40 plays in New York,
including experimental works with Joseph Chaikin as well as the two
by Shepard, and has won three Obie awards. But he is also a
favorite among film directors, both maverick and mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Roeg, who directed Patton in the little-seen spiritual
thriller ``Cold Heaven'' (1992), called him a ``marvelous,
spontaneous actor.'' Roeg said reliable supporting players often
run the risk of being typecast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``But Will, because of the breadth of his talent, has not let
himself be identified as a marketable piece of villainy or
goodness,'' the director said. ``He's got a quality that is innate;
he has a sense of threat about him. Not the threat of fear or
danger, necessarily, but for the audience, the threat of something
unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has volunteered for some uncomfortable jobs. He told
Michael Bay, the director of ``Armageddon,'' to put him ``wherever
there's fire, or explosions, or oil falling all over us, that's
where I want to be, because that's what this movie is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of his favorite roles was in ``Cold Heaven,'' in which
he played a priest. And he particularly liked working with Roeg,
who, he said, was open to suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could pull out a picture book in the middle of a shooting
day, or discuss an essay that Flannery O'Connor wrote about birds,
and say, `That's what I feel this could be about,' '' Patton said.
``There are very few people in movies who can work with that, but
Nic hopes and expects that kind of exploration. If I said something
like that to a lot of these guys, they'd go, `Oh, there's weird
Will again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Charleston, S.C., Patton is the oldest of three
children. His father was a Lutheran minister and later a chaplain
at Duke University. When he was a small child, his parents ran a
foster home for wayward teen-age boys on the family farm near
Charleston, and every Saturday night, the boys put on plays and
revues in the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have been about 5 years old,'' Patton recalled,
laughing. ``I don't know what they were doing, but they brought me
out on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I had on this little hula skirt, and women's eye makeup,
and something done to my hair. And I remember the whole house full
of juvenile delinquents and me both having this moment of ecstasy.
I think that's where it all went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   His interest in acting was also fueled by his father's love of
movies and theater. ``He took me to see movies like `The Heart Is a
Lonely Hunter' at a nice old art theater, and I remember being
really affected by that, and by Alan Arkin's performance.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending public schools in North and South Carolina, and
studying writing, painting and theater at the experimental Hampton
Day School on Long Island, Patton spent a year at the North
Carolina School for the Arts before dropping out and heading for
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first seven years or so, I held so many different jobs
while I was doing theater: selling Christmas trees, working as an
elevator operator, at an all-night vegetable market,'' Patton said.
``I think I chose jobs in which I'd struggle and be unhappy, so I'd
be forcing myself to get acting work.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his first breaks was a yearlong stint on the daytime
television drama ``Ryan's Hope,'' playing Ox Knowles, a race car
driver. The producers described the character as ``a troublemaker
with a heart of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Small roles in two New York-based independent films _ ``After
Hours'' and ``Desperately Seeking Susan'' _ soon followed, and he
seemed to be on the edge of stardom. But when Patton's next film,
``No Way Out,'' became a hit, he was far from Hollywood, starring
in the New York and London productions of Shepard's ``Lie of the
Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance in ``No Way Out'' had impressed the film's star,
Costner, who soon began to write, produce and direct his own films.
Costner called on Patton to play his adversary in ``The Postman,''
the post-apocalyptic fable that was one of last year's most
unsuccessful films, both critically and commercially.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in my position are wise to cast actors like Will,''
Costner said. ``He's a powerful presence, a leading man, not just a
convenient character for the so-called good guy to knock down.''
</P>
<P>
   Patton has no regrets about the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what was so bad about that movie compared to many
others,'' he said. ``I came to think that public perception is
informed by the press in a way that is not healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Armageddon,'' Patton said he was searching for a new
challenge, and not necessarily on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lack in me for not doing theater for so long,'' said
the actor, who has not appeared on stage since 1988. ``That's the
thing that has meant the most to me in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he could not take a stage role ``unless I feel a
life-and-death connection to it.''

GERMAN FILM ABOUT SILENCE SPEAKS VOLUMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The soft-hearted tale ``Beyond Silence,'' the Oscar-nominated
foreign film from Germany, can't help but touch you. The landscape
alone has the ability to enchant; ``Silence'' is set in a bucolic
Bavarian village in the 1800s. But we are also drawn in by the
lovely relationships among the Bischoff family and the heavy
responsibilities placed on 8-year-old Lara (Tatjana Trieb). As the
only hearing person in her family, she has become her parents'
window on the world. When she signs for them, she also rephrases
the conversations so that everyone is well-served. But she is a sly
little girl, and manages to keep a bit of herself even as she gives
her life over to her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Director Caroline Link gives the story a lovely pacing, and
takes her time in planting the seeds that may cause tension. (A
recent report on ``All Things Considered'' dealt with the
difficulty of young children in a family with disadvantaged
members, and how the children's duties within the family slowed
their own development.) This happens to Lara, whose learning is
disrupted by the burden her of role in the family. One light in
Lara's life is the aunt she idolizes: her father's sister, Clarissa
(Sibylle Canonica), who has become a clarinetist.
</P>
<P>
   When the picture leaps 10 years ahead, Lara has followed her
aunt's example, even though her father (Howie Seago) bristles; he's
resentful of his family, who never learned to sign. ``(Beyond
Silence'' is also disdainful of the German stance that lip reading
is preferential to sign language.) As Lara ponders her aunt's offer
to move to Berlin to begin her musical career, events conspire to
make her future, independent life more of a challenge than she
might have dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   Director Link works to achieve a balance, creating a strong and
loving family at the outset, one that unwittingly puts huge demands
on a child, and provokes a future in which the child might leave.
She and her writers add a romantic element when a dreamboat sign
language teacher enters the scene. But the first hour or so has an
evocative touch that becomes a little too plainspoken when Lara
grows up, although she is well-played as an adult by Sylvie Testud.
The second half of ``Beyond Silence'' is a little heavyhanded,
given that the movie is determined to teach a lesson and entertain.
But Link's smoothness in building toward the drama is understated
and calm, before she veers into sentimentality. The film is in
German, with English subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond Silence'' is rated PG-13 for brief adult sexuality.

ANALYSIS: DECISION IS STINGING REBUKE FOR STARR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With STARR-HUBBELL) 
(ps) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel Kenneth Starr has taken a
lot of abuse lately, from Democrats in Congress, President
Clinton's lawyers and friends and even journalists.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday he faced criticisms of a far more serious
nature, in a carefully but harshly worded judicial opinion that
dismissed his tax case against former Justice Department official
Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James Robertson hit him on two fronts, saying that he did
not correctly understand his purview and used overzealous tactics
in his pursuit of Hubbell. He called the counsel's pursuit of
Hubbell a ``quintessential fishing expedition'' and called some of
his constitutional views ``scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which Starr will appeal, was a stinging rebuke for
the independent counsel. It followed other recent setbacks,
including the release from prison of Susan McDougal, another key
figure in Starr's Whitewater investigation; the Supreme Court's
refusal to grant emergency consideration of Starr's efforts to
force the testimony of Secret Service employees and White House
aide Bruce Lindsey, and the Supreme Court decision that Starr could
not pierce the attorney-client privilege between Vincent Foster,
the White House lawyer who committed suicide, and his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was also the contretemps over a magazine article by
Steven Brill, in his magazine, Brill's Content, that accused
Starr's office of unethical leaks to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's decision, though it pointedly differentiated the
pursuit of Hubbell from the case of Monica Lewinsky, was directed
more personally at Starr than the other court decisions. In fact it
is the first time a court has passed judgment on the independent
counsel's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Its effect is also more immediate than the others. In losing
this skirmish, Starr has lost, for the time being anyway, his
ability to use the tax charges as a way of pressuring Hubbell into
cooperating with the larger Whitewater investigation. The
independent counsel has long believed Hubbell has knowledge of
misdeeds by the President and Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell is a longtime friend to the Clintons, dating back to
their days in Little Rock, and a former law partner to Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Given the protracted, seesawing nature of the four-year legal
combat between Starr and President Clinton, it would be perilous to
view any single development in the complex web of the independent
counsel's investigation as decisive. And Robertson, though he wrote
a careful opinion, was challenging some contrary findings by other
judges, and is, after all, only a district judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you have to look at this kind of investigation is like
a trial where both sides have their ups and downs,'' said Theodore
J. Boutrous Jr., a litigator at the Washington law firm of Gibson,
Dunn &AMP; Crutcher. Boutrous, who was a member of former President
Reagan's legal team in the Iran-Contra investigation, added, ``It's
impossible to draw sweeping conclusions from what happens on a
particular day.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Washington's cottage industry of Starr-gazing was in
overdrive as Robertson's decision began circulating among the
city's law firms and within political circles. The judge's 34-page
opinion dismissing the tax case against Hubbell gave Starr's
doubters some significant and fresh material.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hubbell had already served 17 months in prison after
pleading guilty in an earlier case brought by Starr involving
Hubbell's defrauding his former law firm, the April indictment of
Hubbell and his wife on tax charges last April was viewed by some
as overly harsh treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just days after Starr filed the tax charges against the
Hubbells, he got Mrs. McDougal indicted on three counts of criminal
contempt and obstruction of justice for failing to answer questions
from his grand jury. Like Hubbell, Mrs. McDougal had already been
severely punished, having completed an 18-month jail term for civil
contempt on the same charges.
</P>
<P>
   Given that both actions came as the Arkansas Whitewater grand
jury seemed to be was running out of time and steam, both
supporters and critics saw Starr's moves against both Hubbell and
Ms. McDougal as efforts to increase the pressure on them to provide
embarrassing information about the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both instances he seems to be wielding the hammer of Thor
to swat at mosquitoes,'' said Richard Ben Veniste, a Washington
lawyer who has represented prominent Democrats and was a Watergate
prosecutor and Senate minority counsel. ``Judge Robertson's action
will give further credence to the critics of Starr that he has been
overly aggressive in pursuing individuals who would not otherwise
be prosecuted simply to be able to get some information from them
that he can use against president and Mrs. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ginsburg, a litigator at Patton, Boggs &AMP; Blow, disagreed.
``This is what prosecutor's do,'' he observed. `` Hubbell was a key
source of information who was reluctant to talk. It was a pressure
point that Starr was applying.''
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic act of defiance, Hubbell and his wife appeared
outside their modest home on the day of the indictment as Hubbell
declared, ``The independent counsel can indict my dog, they can
indict my cat, but I'm not going to lie about the president.'' Mrs.
McDougal also used strong language after her indictment on May 4,
saying, ``It is true that no man is above the law, but neither
should any man be asked to break the law in order to buy his
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   If one of Starr's points in pursuing Hubbell and Mrs. McDougal
was to win a war of wills against them, he appears to have lost.
Hubbell, declaring himself ``grateful'' for today's court decision,
is out of the independent counsel's sights for the time being. And
Ms. McDougal, enjoying a respite of freedom after another federal
judge granted her release last month on health grounds, faces trial
on the contempt charges in the fall. But she has repeatedly said
she will not tell Starr anything.

PLATE RACING AT `NIGHTONA' PROMISES FIREWORKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking his cue from a higher power _ network TV _ NASCAR
president Bill France Jr. has said let there be light.
</P>
<P>
   And don't sweat the electricity bill at the Daytona
International Speedway this weekend. Winston Cup racing is
scheduled to go prime time from NASCAR's hometown on Saturday, when
the 40th Pepsi 400 officially becomes the first auto race broadcast
live at night by a major network.
</P>
<P>
   That is a promotional mouthful, and a fine historic distinction,
when you consider that five other Cup events are carried live at
night by cable networks. Those races, topped by The Winston
all-star event at Charlotte Motor Speedway, have proven to be
wildly popular with NASCAR's drivers, fans, corporate sponsors and
the cable carriers.
</P>
<P>
   That's because night racing is an easy sell.
</P>
<P>
   Practically every Cup driver can relate to trading paint on
Saturday night, as he did on some local bull ring at the start of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, temperatures are lower for everyone at night, even in
Florida in early July.
</P>
<P>
   Illuminated by Musco Lighting's tried-and-true electrical
system, one producing 3.5-million watts of power per hour and
reflected by 2,600 square feet of mirrors, the cars and their
flashy paint jobs typically produce spectacular theater at speeds
approaching 200 mph.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is counting on it.
</P>
<P>
   But the element that will separate the Pepsi 400 from those
other night races is that wafer-thin piece of NASCAR-mandated metal
known as the carburetor restrictor plate. This is ``plate race''
No. 3 of the season, following the season-opening Daytona 500 won
by Dale Earnhardt at the 2.5-mile DIS in February and the DieHard
500 won by Bobby Labonte at the 2.66-mile Talladega Superspeedway
in Alabama in April.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona and Talladega are the only high-banked speedways on the
Cup circuit where NASCAR requires use of the plate to restrict the
flow of air and gasoline into the engine, thereby reducing
horsepower and speed. Plate racing has been part of the NASCAR
landscape since 1987. But this will be the first time that the
elements peculiar to the genre _ and its bone-breaking consequences
_ will be stirred up at night.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, there are questions about pack racing on Daytona's
steep, 31-degree banked turns, and the possible effects of shadows
at speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is everybody adjusting to being in a pack,''
said Dale Jarrett, a two-time winner of the Daytona 500. ``Even
though we race fast at a lot of other places, we're not normally in
a 30 or 35-car pack for that period of time. We usually get strung
out, but that doesn't happen at Daytona with the restrictor plate.
That's the only adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Geoff Bodine, winner of the 1986 Daytona 500, said he has
concerns after having tested under the lights at DIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were down there testing, we all ran by ourselves
because of this crazy qualifying thing we have to do,'' said
Bodine, referring to tonight's time trials. ``We still don't know
how it's going to be out there running with other cars, around
other cars, behind other cars. I'm optimistic how it's going to be.
But there were some shadows down there and the lighting people and
NASCAR said they were going to try to fix that.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip, a three-time Cup champion and winner of the
1989 Daytona 500, said shadows of any length could create a
distraction once the engines get wound up and the drivers get to
racing side-by-side.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the other lighted tracks that we race on,''
Waltrip said, ``there certainly isn't a lot of side-by-side racing.
And there certainly isn't a lot of racing in groups like we do at
Daytona and Talladega. I'm concerned about how the cars and how the
drivers are going to react to the lights when we're eight or 10
cars deep and two and three cars wide as we're going around the
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending Pepsi 400 champion John Andretti believes the lower
track temperatures at night will eliminate the chassis setup
guesswork normally associated with this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you can probably just put the Daytona 500 setup in
there,'' Andretti said. ``Now there's little question you can stay
wide open all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least for three spectacular hours of prime time. Network
TV _ and Bill France Jr. _ are counting on it.
THE BUZZ
IRL
</P>
<P>
   The career paths of Pep Boys Indy Racing League drivers Billy
Boat and Greg Ray of Plano could be linked soon. Boat, lead driver
for Houston's A.J. Foyt, is expected to be sidelined for eight
weeks after undergoing surgery Monday for a broken left femur
sustained in a crash Sunday during the New England 200 at New
Hampshire International Speedway. Boat was reported in good
condition and walking on crutches yesterday at Methodist Hospital
in Indianapolis. Boat's recovery period, as projected by Dr. Kevin
Scheid, would keep him out of the No. 11 Conseco Dallara/Aurora for
the next four races. Boat, who also sustained a fractured pelvis,
could return for the Lone Star 500K at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort
Worth on Sept. 20. In the meantime, Ray confirmed that he has
approached Foyt about the ride. ``I spoke with A.J. and \Rteam
manager\S Tommy LaMance Monday,'' said Ray, who was on the road
Tuesday working on a sponsorship deal for 1999. ``They're trying to
figure out what they're going to do. I'd very much like to drive
for A.J. at Dover Downs \Ron July 19\S and maybe at Charlotte Motor
Speedway \Ron July 25\S. I'd like to drive, if he'd let me.'' Boat
won the True Value 500K night race at TMS on June 6 by
0.928-seconds over Ray, whose Thomas Knapp Motorsports team has
been sidelined by lack of corporate sponsorship. ``A.J. knows that
we're not in championship contention, and that we're working on a
program for next year and we've done a good job,'' Ray said. ``I
think we might be able to do something good for him.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   The ``crowd'' for Sunday's New England 200 was announced at
20,000 _ or 5,000 fewer than track owner/promoter Bob Bahre said he
needed to break even financially. Bahre's three-year contract with
IRL founder Tony George ended with Sunday's race, and Bahre said he
might not renew for an event that lost title sponsor Pennzoil and
reportedly cost him $700,000. Ray, who attended the race at Loudon,
N.H., as a spectator, said dumping the event would not be a blow to
the series. ``I don't think anyone _ either the drivers or the
series _ wants to go there again, because he \RBahre\S does not
promote it,'' Ray said. ``It's apparent that he hasn't. The whole
time I was there, I saw nothing on billboards, radio, newspaper _ I
saw nothing.''
NASCAR
</P>
<P>
   Early ``silly season'' guesses on the makeup of the 1999 Winston
Cup schedule call for an addition of one race, to be awarded to the
reconfigured Metro-Dade Motorsports Complex in Homestead, Fla. That
would increase the schedule to 34 events, and nudge NASCAR
president Bill France Jr. closer to his latest cutoff point.
Speaking before The Associated Press Sports Editors annual
convention last week in Richmond, Va., France acknowledged that the
schedule ``perhaps can be expanded a small amount'' as the sport
barrels into the next century. Pressed for a maximum number of
races, France said ``36 or 37, maybe. You might be able to add a
couple, but you need to do it gradually. You don't want the
sponsorship to drop.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   France, whose appearance before the sports editors coincided
with the celebration of NASCAR's 50th anniversary season, also
floated the novel idea of two-driver teams _ each featuring
specialists on different types of courses who would alternate
behind the wheel and earn points for the team, instead of as
individuals. ``I'm not saying it's unrealistic to have two
drivers,'' said France, 65, the son of NASCAR founder Bill France
Sr. ``You have two tire-changers, two truck drivers, why not two
drivers? It would be more of a team-type championship. That would
let \Rthe main driver\S have a weekend off. You wouldn't have to
race every race. That would take a little heat off the driver.''
...
</P>
<P>
   Loy Allen is scheduled to replace Todd Bodine in the No. 35 Team
Tabasco Racing Pontiac Grand Prix at the Pepsi 400, beginning with
qualifying tonight at the Daytona International Speedway. Team
owner Bob Hancher said Bodine has not been released from his
contract, as Allen has been signed to a one-race deal. Allen won
the pole for the 1994 Daytona 500 and qualified on the outside of
the two-car front row for the Pepsi 400 that same year. Bodine has
qualified for only eight of 16 Cup races this season. ...
</P>

   Canadian Ron Fellows boosted his NASCAR stock with a victory in
the Lysol 200 Busch Grand National event on the road-course at
Watkins Glen (N.Y.) International on Sunday. A former regular in
the Sports Car Club of America Trans-Am Series, Fellows won the
Grand Prix of Dallas street race in 1994 and 1996.
FAST LAPS
Switching allegiances
</P>
<P>
   Former Texan Steve Earwood is taking Rockingham (N.C.) Dragway
back to its International Hot Rod Association roots.
</P>
<P>
   Earwood and IHRA president Bill Bader have announced that ``The
Rock'' will play host to two Snap-on Tools Drag Racing Series
events in 1999, along with one of the IHRA's World Championship
Series points meets.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Rockingham no longer will play host to the
National Hot Rod Association's Winston Invitational non-points
all-star race. That event reportedly will resurface in July 1999 at
Bristol (Tenn.) Dragway, which is being refurbished by developer
Bruton Smith, whose properties include Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Winston Invitational was a major revenue source for the
track \RRockingham\S, but it certainly wasn't the only one,'' said
Earwood, former vice president for sales and marketing at the Texas
Motorplex in Ennis. ``We feel like the IHRA series has tremendous
growth potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockingham, which Earwood purchased in January 1992, has hosted
the NHRA all-star race for 10 years. Rockingham will operate as an
NHRA-sanctioned track through the end of the season.

 Cori Ellison is a singer and the dramaturg at the New York City
Opera. 
By CORI ELLISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We should all be as lively and robust in our 900th
year as Hildegard of Bingen. Unless you've been dwelling under a
rock, the name of this 12th-century German abbess should at least
sound vaguely familiar by now.
</P>
<P>
   Though never formally canonized, Hildegard, who was born in
1098, has achieved an eccentric sort of sainthood, having been
adopted as an icon by partisans of such renegade causes as Creation
Spirituality and feminism.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, her vivid prose, mystical paintings and
singular music, all conceived in visions said to have been induced
by debilitating migraines, have been whooshed from centuries of
monastic obscurity to New Age celebrity by a flurry of performances
and publications.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of recordings is at hand. In addition, this year
New York will see no fewer than three staged productions of
Hildegard's magnum opus, the musical morality play ``Ordo
Virtutum'' (``The Company of the Virtues''), in wildly varying
styles.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Tuesday, as part of the Lincoln Center Festival, the
esteemed medieval-music ensemble Sequentia, which is based in
Cologne, Germany, and has performed and recorded Hildegard's music
for nearly two decades, will stage ``Ordo Virtutum'' at the Church
of St. Paul the Apostle, as it might have been performed by the
women in Hildegard's convent, according to the advance publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, also in the festival, a decidedly downtown ``Ordo'' will
follow at Lincoln Center's Clark Studio Theater. Cooked up by the
Hildegurls, a consortium of four New York women who compose as well
as sing, it will fuse Hildegard's Latin texts and melodies with
computer-generated sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in November, the respected Camerata of the Mannes
College of Music will offer a musically orthodox interpretation in
modern dress.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hildegard's scores, consisting of single monophonic lines,
offer no tangible clues to niceties like rhythmic shape, tempo,
dynamics, vocal distribution or instrumentation (if any), much less
expression, interpreters today must make major choices. The growing
body of Hildegard recordings, ranging from the sublime to the
bizarre, demonstrates how astonishingly different those choices can
be, even when shaped by scholarship and taste.
</P>
<P>
   The latest recordings are led by two versions of ``Ordo
Virtutum,'' by Sequentia (whose earlier recording of the work, for
Deutsche Harmonia Mundi in 1982, is now on Editio Classica), and
Vox Animae, a British medieval vocal ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Thought to be the world's oldest surviving music drama, ``Ordo
Virtutum'' is essentially one of Hildegard's colorful, apocalyptic
visions described in words and music. With its cast of allegorical
characters (Humility, Charity, Fear of God and the like), it
foreshadows later medieval morality plays like ``Everyman.'' The
plot concerns a Soul tempted away from a host of Virtues by the
Devil. Ultimately, the traumatized Soul returns to grace, and the
victorious Virtues bind and cast out the Devil.
</P>
<P>
   Neither recording claims to be a historical reconstruction,
since nothing is known of the work's performance history; indeed,
it it is not known whether the work was even intended for
performance. It may have been presented by Hildegard's sisters at
the consecration of their new convent on the Rupertsberg in 1152,
some suggest, with the single male role _ the Devil, of course _
taken by the monk Volmar, Hildegard's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is known that instruments played a part in musical life
at Hildegard's convents, each of the new recordings, like
Sequentia's earlier one, uses them in some way, And both versions,
again like Sequentia's first, occasionally add rudimentary harmony,
in the form of drones or parallel lines, which were probably
improvised in Hildegard's day.
</P>
<P>
   The Sequentia release (Deutsche Harmonia Mundi 05472-77394-2;
two CDs) proves preferable for its near-perfect balance of
thoughtful scholarship, imagination and brio. It uses a small
complement of instruments _ three fiddles, a flute and a
hurdy-gurdy _ and deploys them not so much to accompany the singers
and enhance characterization as to create mood and flow.
</P>
<P>
   Over some two decades of performing Hildegard, Barbara Thornton
and her crackerjack ensemble have gained even greater nuance and
fluency, and deepened their characterizations. They offer
luminously sung, impeccably synchronized, and spirited
performances. Franz-Josef Heumannskaemper's grouchy Devil is like
the scary neighbor of every child's nightmare. Harmony is applied
liberally and cogently.
</P>
<P>
   Vox Animae's version of ``Ordo Virtutum'' (Etcetera KTC 1203;
CD) immediately feels less expansive than Sequentia's, and not just
because it clocks in at about 69 minutes as against Sequentia's 92.
It is admirably learned and attractively performed, with 20 singers
accompanied by two harps, a recorder and a tad of percussion. Yet
its variety seems more calculated than organic. Much of the work is
chanted in even tones, the rest more freely. Several choral
sections are cast in marchy measured rhythms. Instruments are used
meagerly and none too creatively, and drones and parallel motion
are added sparingly, only after the Virtues' victory.
</P>
<P>
   The vocalism is of the white, hooty, spottily blended variety
that long gave early music a checkered name. Evelyn Tubb, who
directs the ensemble with Michael Fields, contributes the most
professional and musical singing, as Humility. The Devil's speech
is stilted and singsong. The recorded ambiance is a bit
disembodied; the overall effect, rather austere and deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Vox Animae has also released a video version of ``Ordo
Virtutum'' (Etcetera KTCV 101; VHS cassette). Taped at the Priory
of St. Bartholomew the Great in London and at Bayham Abbey in
Sussex, it shares all the musical assets and liabilities of its
audio cousin. Ferenc van Damme, the director, pulls out many
cinematic stops, busily dissolving and superimposing (never
cutting) shots of the evocative Romanesque architecture, fluffy
clouds, candles and Hildegard's illuminations, all bathed in a
golden light.
</P>
<P>
   The players amble about with earnest, glazed looks, often
breaking into stiff, hieratic semaphore. In a burst of reductive
symbolism, the Soul is tantalized by a masher of a Devil clad in a
tuxedo (complete with red tie and cummerbund), who nuzzles her and
offers her pearls, and she sheds her snow-white cassock to reveal a
skimpy black slip dress. When the prodigal Soul finally comes
crawling home to the Virtues, one of her spaghetti straps is
meaningfully askew.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vox Animae's video is ultimately asphyxiated by its reverential
air. A group with such palpable love and respect for Hildegard
might place greater trust in the momentum of her music and the
passion of her poetry. More telling stage pictures, a more specific
facial and physical vocabulary, and more imaginative flights on the
words and music would go farther in telling her story than artsy
camera work and heavy-handed symbolism. But the video is graced
with clearly, eloquently translated and perfectly timed subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Of the steadily multiplying CD's of Hildegard's other works,
several merit recommendation. Pride of place must go to ``A Feather
on the Breath of God'' (reissued as Hyperion CDA 66039), a
pioneering album from 1981, which did much to spearhead the
Hildegard revival. The small English vocal ensemble Gothic Voices,
directed by Christopher Page, shares the bleached tone, spotty
blend, dry acoustic and sober sensibility of Vox Animae but turns
in a livelier performance; indeed, ``O Ecclesia,'' a sequence hymn
honoring St. Ursula, goes twice as fast here as in most other
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal ``O Ecclesia,'' as well as splendid accounts of 17
other Hildegard chants to St. Ursula, may be found in ``11,000
Virgins'' (Harmonia Mundi France 907200), the newest release by
Anonymous 4, a quartet of New York women specializing in medieval
music. These singers, sounding like one bionic voice, seem to have
the most instinctive grasp of Hildegard's wide-ranging, quirkily
chromatic, extravagantly melismatic music. They capture her fevered
lyricism in masterly fashion, with their characteristic
intelligence, suppleness, spontaneity and a quality that can only
be called spiritual affinity.
</P>
<P>
   Two other New York-based groups that specialize less in early
music offer honorable efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Voices of Angels'' (Delos DE 3219), by the Voices of
Ascension led by Dennis Keene, 12 women, variously deployed, give
stately but fluid, solidly blended and expressive performances of
14 Hildegard chants.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Monk and the Abbess'' (BMG Catalyst 09026-68329-2), Musica
Sacra, directed by Richard Westenburg, prefaces works by Meredith
Monk with four Hildegard selections. They use the largest forces
and the most ``modern'' approach _ 13 women producing a
full-bodied, altoish sonority at majestic tempos, with bold accents
and insistent ritards _ yet the style is surprisingly idiomatic.
</P>
<P>
   France's orthodox and austere Ensemble Organum, directed by
Marcel Peres, weighs in impressively with ``Laudes de Ste. Ursule''
(Harmonia Mundi France 901626). The group uses no instruments _
indeed, nothing but antiphony (nary a drone) to vary the texture.
Still, buoyed by an earthy, chesty yet impeccably blended timbre,
these singers are never dull.
</P>
<P>
   For the designation ``most eccentric Hildegard recording,'' the
field is getting crowded. On ``Early Music'' (Nonesuch 79457), by
the Kronos Quartet, a string arrangement of Hildegard's ``O virtus
sapientiae'' shows up in the unlikely company of John Cage, Harry
Partch, Arvo Paert, Moondog and others. The intriguing
``Oriente/Occidente'' (Materiali Sonori 90084) pairs the
world-music guru Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan with the ensemble Novum
Gaudium in music of Hildegard.
</P>
<P>
   And the popular but peculiar ``Vision'' (Angel 55246) offers the
abbess' music, straightforwardly if drably vocalized by Sister
Germaine Fritz and Emily van Evera, pureed with Richard Souther's
grotesque accompaniments, a synthesized fusion of jazz, rock and
New Age. It would doubtless have given poor Hildegard one of her
famous migraines.

<P>
   HONG KONG _ When President Jiang Zemin of China leaves here on
Thursday after celebrating the first anniversary of Hong Kong's
handover, he will be the first passenger to take off from the new
$20 billion Hong Kong International Airport. Unfortunately for Hong
Kong, there will be nowhere near as many people following him as
originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   The airport, the last and grandest monument here to British
colonial rule, was pushed through at a time when Asia was riding
high. Second in cost only to Kansai International Airport in Osaka,
Japan, it also includes _ beyond its two runways and a 45-acre
terminal building that is the world's largest _ a vast network of
highways, bridges, tunnels and railways to transport people the 21
miles into town.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, the airport project was the world's largest,
employing 20,000 laborers and more than half the world's dredging
fleet to create a man-made island in the waters off Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built this airport at the wrong time,'' said Jim Eckes,
an aviation consultant at Indoswiss Ltd. in Hong Kong. ``It should
have been built when Hong Kong's economy was suffering and opened
when it was strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicting economic cycles is a fool's game, of course. And in
the fullness of time, Hong Kong's airport may come to be seen as a
wise investment in the future. But for now, it is coinciding with a
bust in air travel. The number of tourists visiting Hong Kong fell
24 percent in the first quarter, and the airport seems likely to
fall far short of its capacity of 35 million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong is only one of several Asian cities that are investing
heavily in new airports. Malaysia opened its $2.5 billion Kuala
Lumpur International Airport on Tuesday. Over the next six years,
Seoul, and Guangzhou in China, plan to open huge new airports,
while Singapore, Taipei and Manila are adding terminals to their
existing airfields. Bangkok may also build a new airport.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, overall passenger traffic declined in Thailand
and Korea in 1997, while it slowed dramatically in Hong Kong and
Singapore. The International Air Transport Association, in a highly
unusual move, slashed its five-year forecast of the annual growth
in traffic for the region to 3.7 percent from 7.7 percent. As with
so many other industries here, Asia's airports are entering an era
of potentially severe overcapacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really couldn't be happening at a worse time, but that's
the breaks,'' said Tony Tyler, director of corporate development at
Cathay Pacific Airlines, the flagship carrier at Hong Kong's
airport, which has invested $1 billion in a new headquarters, staff
hotel and flight-training center.
</P>
<P>
   While airport planners in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong insist that
their projects will pay off in coming decades, they acknowledge
they will fall well short of their passenger targets for the first
few years. And that will put a pinch on everyone from the airlines,
freight carriers and shop owners to the governments, which took on
billions in debt to pay for the projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Malaysian government will have to stretch out the repayment
of loans to banks, according to Clifford Herbert, the executive
chairman of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Hong Kong's Airport Authority should have no
trouble repaying its first set of bank loans, which come due in
2001. But the steep cost of the project has forced the airport to
demand high prices for everything from the landing fees it charges
to the rent for duty-free shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly the most expensive airport I'm aware of in
Asia and it is more expensive than any airport in Europe,'' said
Ross Allen, the operations director of DHL Worldwide Express in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Airports are potent symbols of civic pride, and Hong Kong and
Kuala Lumpur spared no expense to create glittering gateways.
Though brand new, these projects are symbols of an era in which
Asia's economic growth and the ambitions of its political leaders
knew no bounds.
</P>
<P>
   On a lush site 45 miles from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian
government built a futuristic terminal with sweeping glass walls
and an atrium with a tropical rain forest. It also installed a
modern computer system that integrates every function of the
airport, from baggage carousels to elevators. With the capacity to
handle 25 million passengers a year, the new airport is palatial
compared to the cramped, somewhat shabby quarters of its
predecessor, which will remain in only limited service.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert believes Malaysia, which began planning the airport in
1992, will eventually use every inch of the new facility. But he
conceded that ``if the recession had set in,'' when the airport was
being planned, ``we would have had to scale it down, and the
architecture would have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Brown, the president of GE Southeast Asia in Singapore,
defended the airport's size, noting, ``Asia has always been chasing
the curve in terms of infrastructure. Building this airport ahead
of demand is not a bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts said Kuala Lumpur's airport had a glaring
weakness in that it opened without a high-speed rail link to the
city. That could mean two-hour trips to Kuala Lumpur on
traffic-clogged roads. The train will not be ready for two years,
and the government will not allow municipal taxis to take
passengers into the city because it has signed a contract with an
airport taxi service.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's new airport, complete with railway, was conceived by
the British government in 1989 as a statement of confidence in Hong
Kong's future after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Britain chose a
site off Lantau Island, west of Hong Kong. That required chopping
the hills off two small islands and filling in the water between
them to create a giant platform.
</P>
<P>
   As Phillip Bruce, a spokesman for the Airport Authority, likes
to put it, ``We built something the size of Heathrow out of the
sea.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rearranging the topography was expensive: Bruce said the airport
itself cost $6.3 billion, while the roads, bridges and tunnels cost
another $13.7 billion. As an airport alone, Kansai was more
expensive, at $14 billion. Most analysts treat Hong Kong's related
projects as part of the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The epic scale of the airport caused a rift between the British
and the Chinese, who were already feuding over the terms of the
handover. China accused Britain of depleting Hong Kong's reserves
to build a project that enriched British design and engineering
firms. When the invitations went out for Thursday's dedication
ceremony, Hong Kong's last British governor, Chris Patten, was left
off the list _ as he was for other anniversary events _ even though
he had championed the project.
</P>
<P>
   Like any huge investment in infrastructure, the airport pumped
money into Hong Kong's economy. But Ian Perkin, the chief economist
at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said Hong Kong's
economy would have run full tilt with or without the project. In
fact, he said the airport may have squeezed out some private-sector
development because so much of Hong Kong's construction resources
were being soaked up by the project.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hong Kong could use an economic jolt. But most of the
main spending is finished. The man-made island has room for a
satellite terminal, which would expand capacity to 87 million
passengers a year from 35 million. But given that the airport will
be lucky to draw the 29 million people that passed through close-in
Kai Tak Airport last year, Hong Kong is unlikely to break ground
soon.
</P>
<P>
   These days, people involved in the project find themselves on
the defensive. Sir Norman Foster, the renowned British architect
who designed the terminal, said the building, which has an
undulating roof-line and swooping wings that resemble a giant
pterodactyl, came in on budget. It was even cheaper per square foot
than other terminals, he said, because it used prefabricated
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Norman said he was frustrated that economic concerns were
overshadowing what he called an extraordinary engineering
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   When money begins flowing again here, Hong Kong International
will scoop up as much of it as it can. The terminal has a vast
shopping center, called Sky Mart, with 143 stores, including a
Chinese tea shop and an Irish bar. Clinton Leeks, the corporate
development director, said the airport hoped to generate 63 percent
of its revenue from nonairline activities _ an unusually high
percentage for an airport outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The airport's large hotel and shopping mall also gives it the
chance to serve as a regional hub within Asia so that, say, a
passenger traveling from Bangkok to New York could change planes in
Hong Kong. The hub market has been dominated by Singapore's Changi
Airport, which has amenities such as a hotel within the terminal
complex. But Hong Kong is better situated geographically than
Singapore, since it can be reached from most European and North
American cities with a nonstop flight.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, though, may be in danger of pricing itself out of the
market. Landing fees, depending on the size of the plane, will be
anywhere from 20 percent to 60 percent higher than at Kai Tak,
which will be shut down this weekend when the new airport opens for
normal traffic. The one-time fee to land a 747 is set at more than
$3,000. And since Cathay Pacific uses a lot of 747s, Tyler said it
would be unprofitable to add many extra flights unless the fees
come down.
</P>
<P>
   Leeks said the airport would re-evaluate its landing fees after
a year. But it is holding the line against retailers, who have
tried to renegotiate rich multiyear leases now that it is clear
that traffic will fall far short of the forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   With the spate of new airports in the region, Asia may soon see
a dogfight between airports not unlike that waged between airlines.
Kuala Lumpur has set its landing fees below those of neighboring
Singapore. And in a direct challenge to Hong Kong, the nearby
Portuguese colony of Macao cut fees in half for late evening
flights at its new airport.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for passengers in southern China will only intensify
further when Guangzhou, which operates the third-busiest airport in
China, opens a new field sometime after 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would view this as the first step in severe airport
competition in this region,'' Eckes of Indoswiss said.
</P>
<P>
   If only people would start flying again.

PRESIDENT ORDERS RELEASE OF 500 POLITICAL PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ With little fanfare, President Kim Dae-jung
ordered the release on Wednesday of some 500 political prisoners.
This appears to be all the political prisoners being held by South
Korea, if human rights groups' estimates are correct.
</P>
<P>
   The release includes those who refuse to renounce their
ideological beliefs. Just when the release would occur was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   According to local press reports, the man widely regarded as the
world's longest-serving political prisoner, Woo Yong-gak, will be
among those freed in an amnesty celebrating the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the South Korean government.
</P>
<P>
   Woo has spent almost 40 years in solitary confinement, losing
his teeth and suffering various illnesses but refusing to renounce
his commitment to North Korean doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   That commitment prevented him from being eligible for an amnesty
announced in March, which led to the release of 2,300 prisoners,
including 74 political prisoners who signed statements renouncing
their ideological beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In total, that amnesty affected 5.5 million people, sweeping
away the records of past traffic violations and expunging notices
of demotion from the personnel files of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is a former political prisoner, so his action has a
particular resonance in a Korea that is throwing off its
heavy-handed political past.
</P>
<P>
   The government has decided to scrap the longstanding practice of
requiring all political prisoners to sign letters in which they
renounce their beliefs. The local press quoted Justice Minister
Park Sang-cheon as saying, ``Requiring violators of the National
Security Law to abandon their ideology and beliefs goes against
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government will still require violators of the security
law to abide by it. The law has been used to jail labor leaders and
those caught listening to North Korean radio broadcasts or
distributing leaflets about Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists said that requirement undercuts the
government's amnesty plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no fundamental difference between the current policy
of denouncing one's ideological beliefs and the proposed policy of
receiving pardon by agreeing not to violate Korean laws,'' said Seo
Joon-shik, a former political prisoner who heads the Sarangbang
Group for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Seo also asserted that the government was trying to use the
release to turn attention from the nation's economic troubles,
including record rates of bankruptcy, bank closures and
unemployment, which is rising at an average rate of 8,000 people a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Woo's case had become something of a cause celebre among rights
activists. One of eight North Koreans caught in the act of
espionage, Woo has been tortured and deprived of the most basic
human necessities, including companionship, rights groups say.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to obtain a renunciation of his beliefs, the South
Korean government once allowed an uncle to visit him, but to no
avail. The uncle was Woo's only visitor during his long stay in
prison.

TWO STATES OUTLINE SANCTIONS ON SWISS BANKS IN HOLOCAUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York and California outlined sanctions Wednesday
against two Swiss banks, after negotiations collapsed over how much
money the banks and Swiss government will return to Holocaust
survivors and heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite State Department objections, Treasurer Matt Fong of
California said his state would not do any more business with two
banks, Credit Suisse and UBS.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and New York City
Comptroller Alan Hevesi said they would outline Thursday morning a
series of sanctions that would begin taking effect in 45 to 60 days
unless a settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions were made after all sides of the dispute had spent
a day before a committee of state and local finance officials who
had until now recommended holding off sanctions, because the talks
had appeared headed toward a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the first step is most likely to be the rejection
of bids for overnight deposits of surplus government money,
followed by banning the banks from underwriting government bonds.
Ultimately the state and city pension funds could sell their shares
of Swiss companies. The funds are the second and third largest
public employees' pension funds in the country, with combined
assets of $188 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The three officials, as well as others from Pennsylvania and
Delaware, said at City Hall in Manhattan they would recommend to
800 other state and local finance officials that they begin
applying sanctions to prod the Swiss government into joining new
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that the sides are not that far apart and
that the problem is with the Swiss government,'' Hevesi said.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse and UBS proposed last month to put $600 million in
a ``rough justice fund'' to help Holocaust survivors, in addition
to paying whatever sums a commission led by Paul Volcker determined
were due based on bank records.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs proposed last week to settle for $1.5 billion,
provided that the Swiss government and the Swiss National Bank
joined in the agreement, Mel Weiss, a lawyer from New York who
represents the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said outside the closed
session.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.5 billion is far less than lawyers for survivors and
heirs, and for charities designated to represent those who died
heirless, have been seeking. Those people were engaged in a
two-step process in which a settlement would first be made with the
commercial banks and then the talks would to the Swiss government.
</P>
<P>
   The banks and government said that sanctions were not warranted
and that imposing them would make it more difficult to settle the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will review all of our options,'' said Roger Witten, a
lawyer from Washington who is the lead negotiator for the banks.
``But a gun at our head is not conducive to progress in these
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``State and local sanctions in this matter are wrong both in
principle and practice,'' Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat
said in a statement to the officials. Eizenstat later said he hoped
that ``the parties will resume their talks as soon as possible in a
noncoercive atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi said the impasse ``gives us no choice'' but to begin
taking business from the banks to prod them and the government to
settle. &QL;

LOOKING AT THE LAWN, AND BELOW THE SURFACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)    (For release Sunday, July 5)  
(mk) 
 By   HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something awful is happening to the planet Earth. It has been
invaded by the Earth-snatchers. It is being turned into a pod
planet, one lawn at a time. Thirty-two million acres have been
snatched thus far on the North American continent alone. More land
is now occupied by lawns than is given over to the cultivation of
wheat, corn or tobacco. It costs $750 million annually to seed this
turf. Another $25 billion is invested each year in mowers,
clippers, gardening gloves, hoses and other do-it-yourself tools.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the pod planet can be delightful, especially in the
month of July. You can lie on your back on the lawn and stare at
the sky. Make a grass kazoo. Cut open a maple seed and stick it on
your nose. Season your jeans with grass stains. Become a Cheever
character and run out sobbing into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Lawn: Surface of Everyday Life,'' a corker of a
show at the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal (through
Sept. 27), begins with a ride on a lawn sprinkler. Or at least the
video depiction of one. Back and forth the camera swings, scanning
the archetypal patch of grass, oscillating between peripheral
glimpses of equally iconic neighbors on either side: the
no-nonsense lady trimming her hedge to clipped perfection, the cool
kids hanging out by the garage. In the background, water hisses.
</P>
<P>
   The video is projected onto the floor, and you hesitate to step
on it. Your shadow might block the projection. Thus the show
stylishly connects two kinds of transgression: one associated with
land, the other with museums. Keep Off. Don't Touch. That kind of
elegant connection occurs throughout this show.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably best seen as one large piece of multimedia design,
in which ideas ricochet among artworks, aerial satellite
photographs, squares of sod, television news footage, solar-powered
robot lawn mowers, even a pink flamingo or two.
</P>
<P>
   The lawn is a natural subject for a summer show, if also a
highly perverse one. Even those who don't own a lawn might wish to
preserve that small plot of green as a symbolic escape from
civilization. This show plunges us into history, economics,
sociology, psychology and other cold-weather pursuits. The lawn is
our last little shred of Eden. Trees of Knowledge are no more
wanted here than weeds. Can't we please keep thinking off the
grass?
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Lawn'' gives little quarter to innocence. There
are no pictures of kids leaping through sprinklers. No shots of
lovers discovering splendor in the grass. But the show does confer
innocence upon the visitor, for we are left feeling that there is
everything yet to learn about the everyday world we live in.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Elizabeth Drew wrote a beautiful article for The New
Yorker about the mood of the country on the Fourth of July in the
bicentennial year. She describes how the news media, the
politicians and the salesmen have done everything within their
power to appropriate the event, and in the process nearly killed it
off. But they didn't kill it off. People found ways to act
spontaneously. They ate burgers, drank beer, paraded in small-town
marching bands, cheered displays of fireworks as if the spectacle
expressed a set of values to which they still subscribed.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring authority may be one way to resist it, but this show
rests on the democratic principle that it's better to be informed.
</P>
<P>
   The curators start with the premise that the lawn represents the
fusion of two traditions: the ``cultivated'' model of great
European estates and private parks, and the ``vernacular'' example
of the small colonial garden. This distinction, first analyzed by
the historian John Kouwenhoven, held firm until the late 19th
century. With the emergence of suburban communities, this
distinction began to collapse into the continental green tapestry
of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cultivated'' takes on a literal meaning here. In the
forthcoming catalog, Georges Teyssot writes that ``certain
horticulturalists like Sara Stein have come to consider the lawn a
surface that while vegetal is artificial in that it attains its
emerald splendor only when subjected to perpetual torture.
`Continual amputation is a critical aspect of lawn care,' Stein has
observed. `Cutting grass regularly _ preventing it from reaching up
and flowering _ forces it to sprout still more blades, more
rhizomes, more roots, to become an ever more impenetrable mat,
until it becomes the perfect lawn, the perfect sealant through
which nothing else can grow.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lawn care, in other words, is much like road care and serves a
similar purpose. ``Like the interstate highway system,'' Michael
Pollen has observed, ``the lawn has served to unify the American
landscape.'' But differences, conflicts and nature itself are not
as easily mowed down as grass.
</P>
<P>
   The architectural historian Reyner Banham used to horrify
professional audiences by declaring that architecture is that which
changes land use. But the truth of that statement becomes ever more
apparent with the daily expansion of urban sprawl. ``The American
Lawn'' is about land use. There are ideas behind the cultivation of
wheat, corn and tobacco, and tension lurks beneath the two-inch
layer of green stuff on which Americans have staged their placid
dreams for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Lawn'' is the last in an ambitious cycle of shows
on ``The American Century'' organized by Phyllis Lambert, the
Canadian Center's dynamic director. The whole series has been a
triumph, but the inaugural show, ``Scenes From the Life To Come,''
and the present exhibition are examples of curatorial brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   It was organized by a stellar team: Teyssot, Allesandra Ponte,
Mark Wigley, Beatriz Colomina, Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo
Scofidio. Mark Wasiuta and Gwynne Keathly assisted the team. Diller
&AMP; Scofidio Architects, of New York, designed the installation.
</P>
<P>
   Since cultural values tend to coax up their opposites, a space
dedicated to harmony and independence can easily become a
battlefield. Is an overgrown lawn a protected form of speech? How
about Christmas ornaments on the lawn? Or a cross-burning? Does the
Postal Service have right of way when delivering the mail?

   Excerpts from court cases in which lawns figured as contested
terrain are featured in one gallery, along with a row of
stereopticons. Each of these contains a 3-D image of the border
between two neighboring lawns. In one shot, it is clear that one
neighbor is a fastidious raker while the other has allowed a
half-dozen picturesque leaves to gather, the slob. In another, a
well-watered plot abuts a parched one. The groomed and the
neglected strike a recurring theme, played out across the continent
in contrapuntal variations. Sometimes, the grass is less green.
Often, it is brown.
</P>
<P>
   In a section on the competitive lawn, the contest at first looks
more sporting. The focus here is on the intricate patterns mowed
into the grass in sports stadiums. But there is greater competition
here than meets the eye. What's at stake is not just victory in a
game but lucrative broadcasting contracts. To make sports events
more telegenic, stadium managements have commissioned increasingly
elaborate designs for animating the playing surface, including
plaids, swirls and sunburst motifs. These video lawns are vying for
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Another kind of contest is documented by photographs of golf
courses in desert climates like Arizona. The contest here is
between nature and our visual image of it. These artificially
created terrains have already altered local weather patterns, and,
if chaos theory is correct, their impact could well be global. But
aren't they beautiful, these emerald islands adrift in what looks
like a giant sand trap of planetary proportions? Is this a preview
of coming attractions?
</P>
<P>
   The Power Lawn is represented in two formats, corporate and
governmental. In the 1960s, as corporate headquarters relocated to
the suburbs, their International Style headquarters were typically
surrounded by grandiose grass plinths. These served as moats,
visual statements of intimidation. This retro-feudal form is
handsomely represented by professional black-and-white
architectural photographs of the period. These lawns are so stark,
so flat, so blatantly designed to hold the world at bay that it
would be shocking to pollute them with anything as capricious as
color.
</P>
<P>
   The North Lawn of the White House, by contrast, is a backdrop
for chaos: the unruly spectacle of political protest. Not that it
was designed for that, but here democracy has happily appropriated
one of its major symbols. Rallies are presented in television news
footage, screened on small monitors suspended from sleek metal arms
down the center of the gallery. Another monitor displays scenes of
presidential arrivals and departures by helicopter on the South
Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   By now our eyes are so primed to notice sheared surfaces that we
may detect a resemblance between a neglected lawn and the
autumn-haze mink coat Pat Nixon wore when she and her husband took
off for China. On the other hand, in a contrast that recalls one of
those stereopticon views, Mrs. Nixon's hair style is luscious and
as beautifully tended as a French garden, while the president's
hair is patchy.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-painted glass slides line the perimeter of a gallery on
``Idyll and Anxiety.'' Drawn from a collection assembled in the
1920s and '30s by the Garden Club of America, they depict scenes as
ravishing as pastorals by Boucher and Fragonard. Ah, the poplars,
the willows, the urns bulging with moss atop balustrades wrapped
around terraces on which visions of loveliness, graceful ladies and
their escorts, will momentarily appear!
</P>
<P>
   It is unnerving to think that many of them were painted during
the Dust Bowl years.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of this reverie is projected on a screen that
slices into the gallery's center: clips from movies in which the
dark subconscious of pastoral bliss punches through the thin green
crust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Velvet,'' naturally, but also a great comic sequence from
the 1956 version of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' in which
Kevin McCarthy tries to persuade a reluctant neighbor that she
should consult a psychiatrist about her wild suspicion that
something awful has happened to Uncle Ira (shown obsessively mowing
the lawn next door).
</P>
<P>
   Pod person or mental patient, what's it going to be?
</P>
<P>
   Lawns have their pathology, too: fungi, viruses, nematodes,
insects, air pollution, dog urine. Color photographs of these and
other afflictions are mounted on one wall, the particular strain
identified below in a Latinate script of old botany prints.
</P>
<P>
   These are clearly offered for our viewing pleasure with a degree
of gleeful relish: They convey a city dweller's delight over
trouble in suburban paradise. But these pastoral sores are also
easy on the eyes. Even if the artist Mel Chin (not represented in
the show) had not called attention to the esthetic dimension of
ecological imbalance, the resemblance of these images to abstract
painting would be impossible to miss.
</P>
<P>
   This is a visual and philosophical show, not a scientific or
ecological one. While it observes the environmental impact of the
suburban way of life, it does not preach the virtues of recycling
or condemn our failure to adopt methods for sustainable urban
growth. The show documents and analyzes. It fertilizes the cultural
terrain from which even environmental issues draw meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the disease wall there's a vitrine displaying square
samples of grass, natural and artificial. Both types have been
engineered to enhance desirable qualities, like springiness, color
or resistance to weather. The point of the display is to suggest
not that there is no difference between nature and artifice but
that modern life has rendered the contrast less extreme. Once,
cultural meaning revolved around the polarity dividing the two.
Now, it has moved deeper into the space between.
</P>
<P>
   Diller and Scofidio's work occupies a middle space, too: between
theory and conventional practice. Though they have published
several books, and a housing project of theirs is nearing
completion in Gifu, Japan, the team is best known for temporary
installations, like those created for the Museum of Modern Art, the
Walker Art Center and the Creative Times public-art program on 42nd
Street. The two are not paper architects. They enjoy making things
too much, and their pleasure shows.

OVERFLOWING CUP
<TEXT>
<P>
   After first 21 days, tournament filled with unforgettable
moments
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ On the 22nd day, the World Cup rested.
</P>
<P>
   It was by most accounts a well-deserved break for a tournament
that has captivated the world.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Quadrennium Madness. As the World Cup began a two-day
break Wednesday before beginning quarterfinals play Friday,
millions of fans could only step back, catch their collective
breath and marvel at a tournament that so far has been among the
most hotly contested and entertaining ever.
</P>
<P>
   The first 21 days of group and round-of-16 play ended near
midnight local time Tuesday night with an unforgettably dramatic
ending to the Argentina-England elimination match.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that had some of everything that the World Cup has
offered thus far.
</P>
<P>
   There were terrific individual efforts, numerous shots on goal,
colorful scenes in and out of the stadium, great goal play, penalty
shots, hooligans, remarkable comebacks and the ever-increasing
presence of officials pulling yellow and red cards from their shirt
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   And when Argentine goalkeeper Carlos Roa finally knocked away
England's last shootout attempt after 120 minutes of play, sealing
the 4-3 win and sending Argentine fans into a frenzy, it ended 21
days that fans should hope are matched on the way to the World Cup
final July 12.
</P>
<P>
   It was 21 days of high-flying soccer and low-life hooligans. It
was 21 days of a new, larger 32-team field bringing new, thrilling
names and games to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Reggae Boyz of Jamaica thrilled fans with their style and
finally got a win in their last first-round game. South Africa made
an appearance in the tournament for the first time. Croatia,
somehow, got all the way to the quarterfinals and is still kicking.
And Iran got the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It was 21 days of close games and close calls _ 152 goals were
scored, and there were plenty of names and moments to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert had the bark of a
bulldog and a biting game to match. Mexico's Luis Hernandez had his
nation's heart on a string, sending four goals into the net and
nearly carrying his team to an upset of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   England teen-age star Michael Owen had maybe the goal of the
championship so far in the Argentina game.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Christian Vieri, with five goals in four games and his
team still alive, has lived up to expectations. Brazil's Ronaldo
has not. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   It was 21 days of some teams stunning the world and others
flopping.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland and its loyal Tartan Army of fans came within one game
of finally getting past the first round, only to be eliminated by
Morocco. Spain, a pre-Cup contender, was little more than another
face in the crowd, ousted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia never seemed to get going. Cameroon looked old. And the
United States blew the game against Iran and a great chance to
finally capture the fancy of fans back home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was England, often cast as a villain in the world's
eye because of the few hooligan fans who follow the team, playing a
remarkable game against the odds and a man short against Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   There was Mexico, which limped into the tournament but stood
tall on the way home after four inspired games and a near miss
against Germany. There were Chile and Paraguay making a statement
for South American soccer and surprising the experts by making it
into the second round.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the host, France, playing probably the most
consistently strong games of anyone and sailing into the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   It also was 21 days of individual moments that surely will be
remembered for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Roberto Baggio, the once-fallen star, rose again with a
last-second penalty kick to pull out a tie and possibly stave off
elimination against Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Cameroon's Pierre Njanka wove through half a dozen Austrian
defenders to score a rocket shot that will be among the
tournament's best goals no matter what happens the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   France's Laurent Blanc, the unheralded defender, flashed through
the Paraguayan defense in the 115th minute of an elimination game
and won it with a ``Golden Goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Hernandez, just 15 seconds before the final whistle,
fought off two defenders and chipped in a game-tying goal against
the Netherlands. Four days later, Germany's Oliver Bierhoff broke
Mexican hearts with a powerful header in the 86th minute of an
elimination game that kept the Germans alive.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was England's David Beckham losing his temper in
the opening moments of the second half against Argentina. Beckham
kicked an Argentine player, and his red card got him thrown out of
the game, which severely hurt England's chances.
</P>
<P>
   It was a play that the English will remember forever, but it was
a no-brainer call for referee Kim Nielson of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several other calls over the first 21 days of the
tournament were more questionable, after international soccer
federation president Sepp Blatter early on ordered referees to
crack down on back tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Nielson made two questionable penalty-kick calls for both sides
earlier in the England-Argentina game. In other games, Cameroon
alleged racism after Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner red-carded two
Cameroon players. Croatia advanced to the quarterfinals on a
questionable penalty call by Argentina's Javier Castrilli.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it was a memorable 21 days. There are 11 days and
eight games to go.
</P>
<P>
   France, Italy, Germany, Croatia, Holland, Argentina, Brazil and
Denmark remain alive. The Madness continues Friday.

 UNDATED: pleasure shows. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The American Lawn'' is not as chillingly analytic as it may
sound. It's true that the curators come out of the academy, and
their thinking owes much to post-structuralist philosophy. But the
show pulsates with such intelligence, wit and even glamour that it
can't be taken as a lecture room performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden Club slides, for example, are not set up to be
mocked. They are gorgeous fantasies, to be cherished as such. The
notion that suburban normalcy represses difference might seem
obvious if the exchange with Uncle Ira were less enjoyably
hilarious. One can admire the stark beauty of Ezra Stoller's
architectural photos while recoiling from the meaning of the lawns
he depicts.
</P>
<P>
   Diller and Scofidio know how to entertain as well as edify.
Though they rely extensively on dialectic, the technique seldom
becomes oppressively schematic. And the team always creates
seductive hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Little magnifying glasses to highlight passages of text in a row
of old gardening books. The thinnest metal vermicelli cable to hold
the stereopticons. A glass table, supported atop the soles of
athletic foot gear, to demonstrate the changing shape of grip. A
red zipper LED sign flickers mysteriously behind the reflection of
grass in a two-way mirror.
</P>
<P>
   There's a bright shimmer to this exhibition, an aura of energy
and delight that you may associate more with walks in the country
than with trips to museums. If I had to account for this shimmering
effect, I would say that Diller and Scofidio's main concern is the
differentiation of meaning and that for them, this process is
inseparable from image, space and form.
</P>
<P>
   Diller and Scofidio's work is now much imitated. You can't lead
unless you're willing to tolerate followers, and a critic should
not cringe each time he encounters a superficial emulation of this
pair's visual and intellectual effects. Still, leaders and
followers are not of the same cultural order of being, and seeing
the real thing is a pleasure. I came away from ``The American
Lawn'' convinced that intelligence is as generous, merciless and
playful as nature, and no less increasingly rare.

ISRAELIS NOW, BUT CARRYING ON RUSSIAN FLAIR FOR FIREWORKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 5) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Making theater in Israel would seem a
daunting task, what with a history more intense than any drama, a
potpourri of cultures that have resisted melding and a life forever
mired in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these are the very ingredients that Yevgeny Arye has
conjured to propel his Gesher Theater to a predominant position in
Israel in less than seven years, a troupe that has received raves
both inside the country and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Actors at the Gesher, initially composed entirely of Russian
emigres, performed in Hebrew before they had mastered the language
and rehearsed their first production under the scream of Iraqi
rockets. Their plays daringly grasp at the very heart of Israeli
history.
</P>
<P>
   Take the two the Gesher is taking to New York as part of Lincoln
Center Festival '98, opening on Tuesday: one invokes the Holocaust
through a circus in a madhouse in the Negev desert; the other
portrays a pioneering Jewish settlement, before the State of Israel
was proclaimed, as seen through the eyes of a youthful naif who
travels through space and time on a carousel. All this is done in
that grand Russian tradition of high passion and a swirl of light,
music and motion, and in both Hebrew and Russian to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Such heady concoctions have proved wildly popular in Israel. At
the converted warehouse in the old Arab port of Jaffa where the
Gesher performs, productions are generally sold out three months in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Success has also come abroad. In its relatively short life, the
Gesher _ the word means bridge _ has traveled, among other places,
to New York, Berlin, London and Avignon in France. Later this year,
Arye (pronounced AHR-yay) plans to take the troupe to Russia, where
he and most of his actors were born and brought up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their first show, in 1991, burst upon an astounded theater
public literally like a rocket taking off, like fireworks,'' said
Helen Kaye, the theater critic for The Jerusalem Post: ``Critics
went mad, audiences went mad, because nobody had ever seen this
kind of passionate, committed, utterly marvelous theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The commitment arises largely from the venerable Russian
tradition of a theater company as a ``personality cult'' _ to
borrow a concept from Stalin _ a collection of permanent actors
completely dedicated and subject to the vision of their director. A
theater in Russia is often inseparable from its director and is
often known by the director's name, just as the Gesher is known
among Russian Israelis as ``Arye's theater.''
</P>
<P>
   An intense, bearded man of 50 who admits that his Hebrew is
still a full third behind his Russian and English, Arye doesn't see
how a theater can be shaped any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the main difference between us and Cameri,'' he said,
referring to one of the best-known theaters in Israel. ``They're
not a company. They bring in actors and directors for each new
play, and they stage 10 to 11 new productions a year. So their
actors are not part of a theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in this at all. I believe a theater is built
on a company. The director is the leader around whose personality
the theater is built.''
</P>
<P>
   Each new play, he said, is also part of the development and
evolution of every actor and of the company. The result is the
intense realism of classic Russian theater, with each gesture, each
intonation, each pause choreographed for maximum effect and
exhaustively rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no 9-to-5 here, no union hours. If Arye so demands,
rehearsals go on for 12 hours. The Gesher's first production, Tom
Stoppard's ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' in a Russian
translation by Joseph Brodsky, was rehearsed during the Persian
Gulf war, with interruptions for Iraqi rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The war and the complexity of the play were something of a
baptism of fire for the actors, most of them, like Arye, recently
arrived from Soviet Russia. The complex drama, Arye said, enabled
the troupe to show what it was capable of. ``It also let us
demonstrate to the level of theatergoer for whom it was intended,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The production, presented as a kind of stylized, ominous circus,
was seen in 1992 in New York at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Arye, a graduate of Moscow University in psychology (``I was
there before the 1967 war, when they still accepted Jews''), says
he always knew he wanted to direct. After college, he went to
Leningrad to study and then work under the celebrated director
Georgy Tolstonogov.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Moscow, he applied to emigrate to Israel.
That led to a year and a half without any work. Eventually, he did
some directing at various theaters and on television, finally
leaving in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   His first stop was New York, but Natan Sharansky, the former
Soviet dissident who was then the head of a private group assisting
emigres, found some money and persuaded him to move to Israel and
form a theater. Those were years when Russian Jews were leaving by
the tens of thousands, and Arye was swamped with applications from
professional actors. He chose 15, and the Gesher was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many foes then, many people who felt that forming a
Russian theater would maintain a ghetto,'' Arye said. ``People felt
we should assimilate. I felt that forming an exclusively Russian
theater could have been fatal, so from Day 1 we provided a
translation into Hebrew. Within a year we shifted to Hebrew.''
</P>
<P>
   Of working in two languages, Arye said: ``It's a very
interesting process. The plays come out completely different in
Russian and Hebrew. I didn't realize how much a language changes
the play. The humor is different. Sometimes we even have to change
the text.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of Hebrew also brought success. Attending the Gesher
became the rage as Israeli theatergoers, culturally attuned to
temperament and passion in their theater, fell under the spell of
the intensity and professionalism of their new fellow countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   True, the oldest Israeli theater, Habimah, also descended from a
Russian-Jewish troupe of the 1920s, traced its heritage directly to
Stanislavsky. But audiences and critics now found it was no longer
innovative.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, a group of young Israeli actors had founded
the Cameri Theater to introduce a more modern, Anglo-American
tradition, establishing what remains one of Israel's major
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Haifa Municipal Theater, rebelling against the
largely imported content of the Habimah and Cameri, which worked in
the 1970s and 80s to introduce an Israeli-based repertory.
</P>
<P>
   But all of these theaters were organized around seasonal
subscribers, which required a constant flow of new productions,
with a correspondingly uneven quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our tradition is very young,'' said Joshua Sobol, a veteran
Israeli playwright whose ``Ghetto'' was seen at Circle in the
Square on Broadway in 1989. Sobol's ``Village'' is one of the two
plays the Gesher is bringing to New York. ``You can say Israeli
acting and directing are based more on instinct than on acquired
professions. I believe we've had some quite remarkable
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``One difference is that the Gesher did not rely on subscribers,
but on open box-office sales. It proved that you can reach a `free'
audience, so to speak. I hope this is also a lesson for the other
theaters. It liberates the theater from a total dependence on a
captive audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite much praise for the Gesher, there have been dissenting
voices. Novel and exotic as it has been to Israeli audiences, the
Gesher is essentially an Israeli version of the classic Soviet or
Russian theater, a close cousin to the Taganka, the Moscow Art
Theater and the Maly in Moscow, whose extensive use of intense
emotion, symbol, stage gimmickry, dramatic lighting and music has
both entranced and irritated Western audiences, especially American
and British theatergoers accustomed to a more subtle approach.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Handelzalts, the theater critic and book review editor
of the Haaretz newspaper, recently created something of a storm
among the Israeli intelligentsia when he panned a Gesher production
of Chekhov's ``Three Sisters,'' the first play that Arye staged in
only one language _ Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the Gesher's popularity that Handelzalts
devoted part of his review to justifying why he dared criticize
Arye at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought a breath of fresh air to the Israeli theater
scene,'' Handelzalts acknowledged in an interview. ``They're very
talented, dedicated, well-schooled; the abilities of their
director, Arye, are very great. But if you've seen Russian theater,
you know they did not invent the wheel. They work within a very
strong tradition, but not the most exciting one. Israel is not
familiar with Russian theater, and so they assume they're God, but
they're not, which I dared say about `Three Sisters.' After the
dissenting view was published, I was looked upon as an enemy of the
people, as almost a traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The plays selected by Lincoln Center have all the ingredients
for which Arye has been lionized and criticized. Both works are
intrinsically Israeli and were created especially for the Gesher.
In that, they add a new element to the art of Arye and his actors:
an interpretation by Russian emigres of the central themes and
myths of their new homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Sobol's ``Village'' (its six performances _ in Hebrew with
simultaneous translation _ begin on Tuesday at Alice Tully Hall) is
the story of a hamlet in Israel in the 1940s, of the loves and
anxieties of its inhabitants, as witnessed by a naive youth named
Yossi.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with amorous affairs, business deals and local
arguments are echoes of major events outside: the battle of El
Alamein, the Nazi death camps, the United Nations vote creating
Israel. The central device is a rotating path, along which Yossi
leads the audience through time and space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in just such a village, in Tel Mond, in the center
of the Sharon Valley,'' Sobol said. ``I grew up in the village in
the early 40s, so the play is based on my memories. For a long time
I wanted to write a play about that period in my life, but it was
contact with Arye that triggered the writing.''
</P>
<P>
   The other play Arye is bringing, ``Adam Resurrected,'' also
deals with the past, but a far more terrible one, and in a far more
arresting and controversial manner. (The six performances begin on
July 14 under a tent in Damrosch Park; there will be four in Hebrew
and two in Russian, with simultaneous translation.)
</P>
<P>
   The production juxtaposes the Holocaust and an Israeli circus
through the mad mind of a German Jew, a former clown who survived a
concentration camp by playing the role of a man-dog for the Nazi
commandant. Now in an asylum in the Negev desert, he relives the
past through scenes that are equally grotesque, terrible and funny.
</P>
<P>
   The play is based on a book by Yoram Kaniuk, an Israeli-born
painter and writer, which was called ``Adam Son of Dog'' in Hebrew
and created a major stir when it was first published in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   As recounted by Kaniuk, 68, the production was a case study in
the integration of the Israeli book and the Russian theater. ``Arye
read the book in English, and he loved it, and he thought it would
make a good production,'' Kaniuk said. ``The only person he thought
could adapt it was a friend of his in Russia, Alexander Chevinsky,
so Chevinsky wrote it in Russian based on the English. Then it was
translated into Hebrew and I went over it. Then it was translated
back into Russian, and when it was done it was translated into
Hebrew.''
</P>
<P>
   For the director and the author, ``Adam Resurrected'' was a
plunge into a horror that neither had experienced directly but that
each had had to confront.
</P>
<P>
   Arye's major innovation was to introduce a circus tent into the
asylum where Kaniuk's action takes place. ``It's not easy to
understand,'' Arye said. ``The circus is all in the feverish mind
of a sick man.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaniuk recalled his youth. ``I worked on ships that brought
refugees here, Holocaust survivors,'' he said. ``I was a typical
young Israeli of the time, and suddenly I met the real Jews. I was
overwhelmed. There was a kind of humor they had about themselves.
They thought they survived maybe because they did something wrong.
They were talking about it all the time. I talked to young people
who grew up in Auschwitz, and knew nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, as an artist in New York, Kaniuk heard of an
instance in which a suicidal man and a boy who behaved as a dog
came together in an insane asylum and brought each other to sanity.
The theme merged with stories he had heard from survivors, and he
began work on his novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 10 years to write,'' Kaniuk said. ``It's my best
book. The critics loved it, while people are kind of shy about
reading it. But in a play, they are mesmerized. I've seen it in
Berlin. It was the most important moment in my life. My father used
to play the violin behind the scenes for the silent movies in
Berlin, and right there they put a tent and Germans were sitting
there shaking, afraid to laugh. I love the production. Not because
it's my book _ I see it as something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still creates a problem: How can you talk about the
Holocaust in that way? But I'm not talking about the Holocaust. I'm
talking about survival. Jews always tell jokes about survival. You
laugh, otherwise you have to cry.''

MAN WITHOUT AN ACT DOESN'T NEED ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nomar doesn't need a tissue box, so why should you?
</P>
<P>
   Making the All-Star team is not exactly high on the list of
Nomar Garciaparra priorities. ``I really don't care,'' he insists.
``It doesn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if Player X or Player Y were to say that, it would
definitely be eye-rolling time. Most players care very much, even
if they pretend otherwise. Most players can quickly switch from
being something resembling a regular guy to what we can refer to as
their Act. Not Nomar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar doesn't have an Act,'' says Jim Corsi. ``He's just a
regular schmoe.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure regular schmoes play a four-star major league
shortstop while slugging .534 (and climbing by the hour), but you
get Corsi's point. The Man Without An Act can live without going to
the major league All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to accept recognition when I know other
people had a lot to do with it,'' he says. ``It's a team game.
That's been my attitude growing up, my whole life. Is it just me,
or is it my teammates? That's tough to judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he belong there? Well, sure. But the three shortstops who
will represent the American League also belong there. That's life,
so get over it. Nomar already has.
</P>
<P>
   Some guys are like that. To them, All-Star Games are fluff. Dave
Cowens was like that. Larry Bird was another one. I rather like the
idea of our star shortstop thinking like those two guys.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar might feel differently about things if you could show him
just exactly what playing in an All-Star Game has to do with
winning a championship. And don't be foolish enough to mention
anything about a ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather have an All-Star ring or a World Series
ring?'' Nomar inquires. ``I'll tell you which one I want to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Nomar, I have no sense of outrage over his absence from the
1998 All-Star team, but for a different reason. Mike Hargrove was
in a lose-lose situation. He was looking at four totally deserving
shortstops, and there was no way he could take more than three.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez was the appropriate fan favorite. Next question.
New York's Derek Jeter is a great player. And then there was Omar
Vizquel, the perennial Gold Glove winner, who just happens to play
for Hargrove's Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guy who's flirting with .300, who is a tough out and
who has made one error since last Aug. 19. He's also a terrific
guy. There's nothing wrong with taking Omar Vizquel.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams understands why Omar Vizquel is on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If if it were Lou Piniella,'' says Williams, ``he'd take
Rodriguez. If it were Joe Torre, he'd take Jeter. If it were me,
I'd take Nomar. You can't go wrong with any of 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Accept that it was going to be Rodriguez and Vizquel. Then it's
down to Jeter and Nomar. Who's better? Think Magic (Jeter) and
Larry (Nomar). In New York they'll always think it's Jeter (Magic).
In Boston, people will always think it's Nomar. (Take it one step
farther, and ARod is Michael). If you haven't guessed already, we
are clearly living in the Golden Age of Shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned scout extraordinaire Grover (Deacon) Jones is in town,
and his full sympathies lie with Hargrove. ``I wouldn't want to
make that choice,'' he says. ``I'd say you make it. Or else, flip a
coin.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar has the power edge, but Jeter is a very reliable hitter
who has made only three errors all season. It is also very possible
Hargrove felt that it was important to homor as many Yankees as
possible, since the team that could conceivably establish the best
winning percentage of all-time does not have a man in the starting
lineup. Only a serious Red Sox zealot would complain about that
line of reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   You really have no idea how little Nomar cares about this
All-Star business. The first All-Star Game he ever saw, live or on
the telly, was last year's, and the only reason for that was that
the league insisted he come as a participant. He has little
interest in seeing next Tuesday's. ``I watch a game every day,'' he
says. ``Every day. Why do I want to see another one?''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, how does anyone expect Nomar to have his mind on
baseball next Tuesday? I mean, c'mon. Tuesday will be the first
World Cup semifinal game.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar is into this World Cup stuff. Big Time. He had pictured
himself in Marseilles, in person. Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``How close did you come to going?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very close.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You had the flights and everything?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally decided against it. Just too much traveling. But he
was aching to be there. On Tuesday afternoon he'll be watching the
soccer game. On Tuesday evening he'll probably be watching the
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar's not even the worst All-Star omission. How about Brian
Jordan? He's leading the National League in hitting. He's slugging
.585. He won't be in Coors Field, either.
</P>
<P>
   On a scale of All-Star omissions, Nomar's is about a 7. You want
a 10, I'll give you a 10. Try these All-Star break numbers:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HR $ RBI $ Runs $ Hits &QL;
</P>
<P>
   25 $ 100 $ 68 $ 101 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was Detroit's Hank Greenberg in 1935. He did not make the
All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. _ The Tigers won the 1935 World Series. You think Hank
Greenberg was thinking about the All-Star Game while he was sipping
that champagne?

VISION OF ONE-STOP SHOPPING PROPELS MERGER OF PHONE, CABLE, TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (th) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometime before the end of the century,
high-speed Internet access and low-cost phone calls alike will make
their way into American homes as streams of digital 1's and 0's
over television cables.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, as executives of AT&AMP;T and
Tele-Communications Inc. have scrambled to sell Wall Street and the
American consumer on the wisdom of their ambitious $31.8 billion
merger, one fact has become clear: The technology will tread a
costly path on its way from the laboratory into the home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $1.8 billion TCI will spend to upgrade its
one-way cable network to a two-way service capable of carrying
digital video and sound to its 10.5 million customers, AT&AMP;T will
need to persuade customers to buy advanced set-top boxes that have
connectors for video, computer and telephone, and it will have to
install a new generation of advanced Internet routers capable of
offering clear voice quality, at its own expense.
</P>
<P>
   So, beyond that first $1.8 billion, the final cost for the
entire project could run another $10 billion or more based on an
initial per-customer cost of $750. That cost could eventually fall
as low as $200 per customer sometime after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The actual amount will vary depending on what percentage of
households decide to switch service from their existing phone
company and on how quickly the cost of new Internet telephone
technology falls.
</P>
<P>
   But even assuming that the cost of the AT&AMP;T-TCI scheme allows
any real price competition on telephone calls, consumers will face
sundry logistical problems once the digital telephones arrive in
their homes. For example, most set-top boxes are in living rooms _
the one room often not wired for a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   None of this phases David Nagel, AT&AMP;T's unflappable chief
technology officer, who points out that the nation's largest phone
company has a decade's worth of experience working with the cable
industry on the challenges of digital telephony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys have crawled all over the cable networks, and the
problems are very solvable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, AT&AMP;T has been welcomed as a conquering hero by the cable
industry, which five years ago promised a future of 500 channels
and interactive television only to back off when daunting costs and
consumer apathy dulled that vision with a stubborn coating of
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if it takes five years, AT&AMP;T is going to make
this work,'' said Paul Kagan, president of Paul Kagan &AMP; Associates,
a cable industry research firm in Carmel, Calif. Alluding to TCI's
chairman _ and the cable industry's most ambitious salesman _ he
added, ``There's more here than John Malone trying to make his
stock go up.''
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledges that a steep investment lies ahead and
several technical challenges must be overcome, others are less
sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've found with technology is that CEOs don't have a clue
about what really needs to be done,'' said Andrew Seybold, a
computer and communications industry analyst and publisher of
Andrew Seybold's Outlook, a newsletter based in Boulder Creek,
Calif. ``The problem is that the technology always takes longer
than people expect.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seybold worries particularly about reliability, citing the
aftermath of California's North Ridge earthquake in January 1994.
While telephone service was restored in 24 to 48 hours, he said,
cable did not begin to come back for a week and in some cases two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the San Francisco region, TCI's largest service area,
with 1.5 million customers, roughly 10 percent of subscribers have
been upgraded to two-way cables. The company says that figure will
be 50 percent by the end of the year and 90 percent by the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   For each city it serves, the first step in an upgrade is for
engineers to cover every inch of the network on foot looking for
older, one-way amplifiers that must be replaced with two-way
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the placement of fiber nodes _ the intersection points
where fiber-optic cables meet the coaxial cables that stretch past
each home _ is adjusted to a ratio of approximately one for every
500 to 1,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the network more resistant to large-scale failures
and reduces the capacity requirements for the digital networks that
will carry data, voice and video.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, equipment will be added to the central cable plant, or
``head end,'' that will connect the thousands of homes to the
Internet and, in some cases, to traditional telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco area, switching from today's cables to a
digital system promises significant cost savings for the network.
TCI owns a powerful fiber-optic ring that encircles the Bay Area,
which it now uses to distribute television programming. In the
future, the huge capacity of that network will make it possible for
AT&AMP;T to economically centralize its switching and routing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Once the network is in place in each city, AT&AMP;T will immediately
be able to offer old-fashioned ``circuit-switched'' telephone
service over the cable system.
</P>
<P>
   However, by the fall of 1999, a second generation of cable boxes
should be available through consumer electronics outlets
nationwide. Based on a yet-to-be determined standard, these boxes
will permit the complete integration of voice, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of using circuit switching, which requires a
separate copper-wire path for each call, these will employ ``packet
switching,'' which allows many kinds of information, including
telephone calls, to travel down the same wire at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It is at that point, industry analysts say, that AT&AMP;T will begin
to realize the cost savings that will permit competition with local
phone companies, plus a range of new services, including CD-quality
music and distinctive ringing tones for each member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kagan said, the phone company has a powerful financial
weapon as it buys its way into these converged technologies: the
cable franchises will remain monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the secrets of this whole deal,'' he said, ``is that
AT&AMP;T is going to make a bunch of money offering traditional cable
television.'' &QL;

COURT RULES AGAINST STATES ON PATENT SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Texas, Calif., Fla.)   (af)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court has ruled that a New Jersey bank can sue
the state of Florida over the state's unauthorized use of a
college-savings program, saying that states can be sued for
infringing the patent owned by an individual or a company.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington was
welcomed by some patent lawyers, who had worried that a 1996
decision by the U.S. Supreme Court could allow states to use
companies' patents without suffering any legal consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The worries escalated recently when another federal appeals
court cited the Supreme Court's decision in ruling that the
University of Houston, a state school, could not be sued for
publishing the works of an author without her permission.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the three-judge appeals court panel in
Washington ruled against Florida, which had argued that it could
not be sued by the College Savings Bank in Princeton, N.J., in
federal court. The bank owns a 1988 patent on the method it uses to
administer prepaid college tuition accounts, which allow parents to
set aside money for their children's education.
</P>
<P>
   The bank contends that the state of Florida is using the
patented method illegally in its state-run prepaid college tuition
program, which has about $2 billion in deposits and is the largest
such program in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Hubener, an assistant attorney general for Florida, said
that he had not yet seen the decision and could not comment in
detail. But he said there was a ``strong probability'' that the
state would appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The case had been closely watched by experts on intellectual
property and also by states, state universities and other state
institutions, which had argued in the past that they could not be
sued in federal court under the 11th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes to the heart of federalism,'' said Gerald Dodson, a
lawyer representing the regents of the University of California,
which had filed a brief supporting Florida in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision and the earlier decision that prevented an
author from suing the University of Houston, are among the first to
interpret the 1996 Supreme Court ruling that had curbed the
authority of Congress to subject states to lawsuits in federal
court. In that case, a divided Supreme Court said that the federal
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was an unconstitutional incursion on
state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the state of Florida relied on that 1996 Supreme
Court decision to argue that another law passed by Congress in 1992
was also unconstitutional. That law allowed private parties to sue
states for patent infringement.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's decision, the appeals court said that Congress had
acted within its power when it passed the 1992 patent law.
</P>
<P>
   ``A state found to have infringed a patent is subject to the
same consequences as a private party infringer, namely damages
subject to trebling, attorney fees and injunctive relief,'' Judge
Raymond Clevenger III wrote in his opinion for the unanimous panel.
The other judges on the panel were William Curtis Bryson and
Randall Rader.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the lawyers involved in the case said that the Supreme
Court will likely have to take up the issue again because Tuesday's
ruling conflicts with that of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
earlier this year. That court found that University of Houston
could not be sued for copyright infringement by Denise Chavez, the
author of a book who claims the public university published the
book without her permission.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Circuit panel said that Congress could not limit a
state's immunity to lawsuits involving copyright infringement
because it would be an end-run around the 1996 Supreme Court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals said that
the decision in the University of Houston case and a similar
decision by another court ``miss the mark.'' The court said that
the 14th Amendment empowers Congress to prevent states from taking
private property, including patent rights, without the due process
of law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision was clearly a boost for College Savings Bank
in its long-running battle with Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Peter A. Roberts, the bank's chairman, said that he believed
about a dozen states could be violating the bank's 1988 patent. But
he said that the biggest infringer was Florida and the state's
Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, which administers
its college tuition program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made a quarter of a million dollars in profits off
our invention,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida denied that it had infringed the bank's patent.

   ``Cities of the Plain''
</P>
<P>
   By Cormac McCarthy
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Knopf, $24
</P>
<P>
   Cormac McCarthy finally gained a measure of rightful recognition
by winning the 1992 National Book Award for ``All the Pretty
Horses,'' a stirring saga of love and loss in the borderlands of
the Southwest and Mexico. It aroused perhaps unrealistic
expectations, for it was the first of a planned trilogy. Could
author possibly deliver two more books of comparable achievement?
</P>
<P>
   Although McCarthy had produced five novels of unparalleled depth
and beauty beforehand, he had gone virtually unnoticed even by
serious book people, and some critics questioned his sudden
ascension into the upper rank of writers in his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crossing,'' the second installment in the ``Border
Trilogy,'' was widely perceived as somewhat inferior to ``Pretty
Horses.'' Even supporters wondered if McCarthy could again measure
up to his masterwork. With ``Cities of the Plain'' he supplies a
resounding answer to friend and foe alike.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a book more profound and more lyrical than any of
McCarthy's seven previous novels. It is set in 1952 on a New Mexico
ranch being encroached upon from the north by the military at
Alamogordo. Looming to the south are the mountains of Mexico. It is
there that fate has thrown together John Grady Cole, of ``Pretty
Horses,'' and Billy Parham, of ``The Crossing'' _ two of the great
protagonists of modern literature.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pretty Horses'' passion and heartbreak were wrapped in
strong adventure. If ``The Crossing'' suffered from lack of romance
at its core, romance is back in ``Cities of the Plain.'' For John
Grady Cole, more's the pity; once again, he is hopelessly entangled
with an inappropriate love interest on the wrong side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   She is a 16-year-old prostitute who speaks not a word of English
and is owned by a pimp who also loves her. What's worse, the pimp
is a master at taking a man apart with a pocket knife. John Grady
seems overmatched. Their stunning showdown is a descriptive
masterpiece recalling Hemingway detailing a bullfight or the epic
struggle in ``The Old Man and the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is at his best when the issue is the subtle combat of
men talking among themselves. A fellow cowboy questions John
Grady's love for horses and whether horses can think or know the
difference between right and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   John Grady: ``''I think you can train a rooster to do what you
want. But you won't have him. There's a way to train a horse where
when you get done you've got the horse. On his own ground. A good
horse will figure things out on his own. You can see what's in his
heart. He won't do one thing while you're watching and another when
you ain't. He's all of a piece.''''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Parham and John Grady Cole have a deep love for the scrub
ranch land of the Southwest that is becoming economically
unfeasible for earning a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you'd of liked to of lived back in the old days?''
John Grady asks Billy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No I did when I was a kid. I used to think rawhidin' a bunch
of bony cattle in some outland country would be just as close to
heaven as a man was likely to get. I wouldnt give you much for it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   On the futility of competeing with John Grady at chess comes the
observation: ``He's beat me like a rented mule.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, a man asked if his brother will take a drink replies:
``Quicker than a minnow can swim a dipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Great as were the preceding volumes of the trilogy, both
suffered from the limited world view of their protagonists. Here,
both have greatly matured. They have suffered; they know men and
animals good and bad; they understand that it's hopeless, even
foolish, to wish for the past.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, and greater _ probably worse _ change is
ahead for them, for the animals and for the land they have come to
love despite its shortcomings. At last, neither can accommodate the
changes needed within him to cope with the changes without. More
likely, they choose not to.
</P>
<P>
   With this graceful keystone in place, McCarthy's haunting
trilogy becomes a sum greater than its spectacular parts, an epic
canvas of the monumental changes in the society and the land
brought about by World War II and its aftermath. Cormac McCarthy
isn't concerned about modern life overtaking the grand old days of
cowboying, but he is worried that it has cost us our souls.

A SERIES A SEASON IS ENOUGH, STEINBRENNER SAYS OF THE METS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner likes playing the Mets once a
year, but the Yankees' principal owner indicated Wednesday that he
would fight a tentative plan in which the teams would play six
games next year, three at Yankee Stadium and three at Shea. ``It's
just too much,'' Steinbrenner said. ``One series is enough. Once a
year, that's just right. If you do more than that, you're going to
dilute it. I think it should stay like it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner can express his opposition to a home-and-home
series with the Mets by voting against the 1999 schedule when it is
presented for approval at an owners meeting next week in Chicago.
But Steinbrenner is only one of 30 votes, so unless a significant
number of owners feels the way he does, he will probably be unable
to alter what now seems to be moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The players association also has to approve the 1999 schedule,
but it has not expressed any opposition to the home-and-home
interleague concept, which already exists.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees played host to the Mets in 1997, the inaugural year
of interleague play, and last weekend, the Mets played host to the
Yankees at Shea Stadium, drawing 160,740 over three days.
Steinbrenner wants to continue the current format, rather than
expand the number of interleague games, believing that it's
important to maintain the integrity of the intraleague rivalries,
against teams like Boston and Baltimore. Pursuing the World Series
should be the pervasive theme, he said, rather than just winning
city bragging rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets blew that thing into too big of a deal,''
Steinbrenner said. ``I think they did a wonderful job promoting the
thing. They did some things maybe to embarrass me, but I accept
that. I'm happy I was able to help fill their ball park, but next
year it's my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner was not specific about how he believes the Mets
embarrassed him, but officials for both teams chortled over the
Mets' decision to ask Yogi Berra _ the former Yankee star and
manager who has said he won't go to Yankee Stadium as long as
Steinbrenner owns the team _ to throw out the first ball before the
first game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not have done anything intentionally to embarrass
Steinbrenner,'' Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the Yankee organization said the team has nothing to
gain by expanding the series _ other than three guaranteed sellouts
every season _ and everything to lose. The Yankees, one official
said, are the dominant team in New York right now and are expected
to beat the Mets, while the Mets would gain notoriety currently
absent from their organization if they won a series against the
Yankees, and at least temporarily altered their little brother
image. Joe Torre said before last weekend's series that he looked
forward to getting the three days over with.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said he disagreed with the Mets' decision to market
ticket packaging plans in conjunction with the games against the
Yankees. Within one limited plan, fans who agreed to buy a ticket
to the Yankees-Mets games last weekend were also required to
purchase a handful of tickets to other games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's forcing people to buy tickets,'' Steinbrenner said,
``and I just don't think that's a good idea.''

SORENSTAM, BACK IN STRIDE, AIMING TO REDUCE PRESSURE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Annika Sorenstam has learned to avoid mistakes.
She has also learned to grow from them.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the United States Women's Open in both 1995 and
1996, Sorenstam arrived at last year's national championship intent
on making history.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of becoming the first woman to win three consecutive
Opens, Sorenstam missed the cut, weighed down by the expectations
and the self-inflicted pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when this year's United States Open begins on Thursday at
Blackwolf Run, Sorenstam will be in the spotlight once again. She
has won her last two starts, including last week's ShopRite LPGA
Classic in Absecon, N.J. In 11 starts on the Ladies Professional
Golf Association tour this year, Sorenstam has a remarkable 10
top-10 finishes. However, after last year's humbling experience at
the Open, Sorenstam has vowed to take each day this week as it
comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot last year, so I'm just going to be calm,''
said Sorenstam, who is the most consistent women's player in the
world at age 27. ``I really wanted it badly last year and it just
didn't work,'' she said. ``It's a special week, but if I don't keep
my same routine, I won't play the same. It is easy to get too
anxious, easy to overpractice, easy to get away from the normal
things that I do at a normal tournament. I get more nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sorenstam is one of the favorites, Donna Andrews,
Liselotte Neumann, Karrie Webb and Pat Hurst are among those who
are playing well entering the third women's major of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult for this year's tournament to surpass the
drama of last year's Open at Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club in Cornelius,
Ore., when Alison Nicholas won by a stroke over Nancy Lopez, once
again denying Lopez the title she wants the most. Lopez missed a
15-foot downhill putt for birdie on the final hole that would have
forced an 18-hole Monday playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about three months to get over it,'' said Lopez,
who has finished second at the Open four times. ``I watched the
video for a few months and just kept thinking, `What could I do
different, what did I not do right?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez will be the sentimental favorite again this year, but
there are many compelling story lines. Donna Andrews, who leads the
LPGA money list, would love to continue her best season with a
victory in a major. ``I don't think anybody has noticed I'm at the
top of the money list yet,'' said Andrews, who has won $559,407 so
far this year. ``I sort of snuck up there, and nobody was paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nicholas has been somewhat overlooked since her
victory last year, and has been unable to play consistently. A
chest infection hampered Nicholas for several months earlier this
year, and she would love to use this week as a springboard to
strong second half of the season. ``I don't feel that much pressure
to repeat,'' said Nicholas, a native of England. ``I have been ill
and haven't played that much. I am not expecting a great deal this
week, but I wasn't this time last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Measuring 6,412 yards, Blackwolf Run is one of the longest
courses ever to host a United States Women's Open, and it features
huge, undulating greens that should produce many three-putts and
four-putts. Nicholas' winning score last year was 10 under par, but
that will be difficult to equal this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hole has a different personality,'' Lopez said. ``This
golf course is going to take a lot of patience, probably more than
any U.S. Open course I have played in a long time.''

JUDGE ADMONISHES STARR IN DISMISSING TAX CHARGES AGAINST HUBBELL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Wednesday dismissed tax evasion
charges against Webster Hubbell, and rebuked independent counsel
Kenneth Starr for overreaching his authority and violating the
rights of the former assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Saying Starr's prosecutors were on a ``quintessential fishing
expedition,'' U.S. District Judge James Robertson threw out the 10
tax-related charges after finding that the case was built on
records Hubbell turned over with the understanding they would not
be used to prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's use of the documents ``violates the immunity
given to Mr. Hubbell'' and thus turned him ``into the primary
informant against himself,'' Robertson said in his ruling, the most
recent in a series of court setbacks for Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, who was appointed to the bench by President Clinton,
also dismissed related charges against Hubbell's wife, Suzanna,
accountant Charles Owen and tax lawyer Mike Schaufele.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ruled that Starr had failed to get proper
permission through Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate the
tax-related case. The charges against Hubbell ``neither relates to
nor arises out of'' the various subjects involving Clinton that
Starr had been authorized to investigate, Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed more than four years ago to investigate the
president's business dealings in Arkansas, Starr's mandate has been
expanded to include firings at the White House travel office, the
misuse of FBI files by Clinton operatives, the death of deputy
White House counsel Vincent Foster and the alleged presidential
affair and cover-up involving Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling said Starr ``has identified no common
witnesses, described no similar patterns of conduct, cited no
similar applicable law'' related to his other areas of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's ruling came less than a week after a hearing at
which he voiced discomfort with the case and told prosecutors they
have a ``very scary'' view of the Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell expressed surprise late Wednesday over the quickness of
Robertson's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very grateful and hopeful that this is the end of
a long process that has lasted five years,'' Hubbell told reporters
outside his Washington home. ``Now maybe you folks won't have to
come out here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying other court decisions conflict with Robertson's opinion,
Starr said he ``will seek prompt review of the ruling'' by an
appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton learned of the decision in China, where he is winding up
a nine-day tour. ``This decision speaks for itself, but I'm happy
for Webb and Suzy and their family, Mike and his family and Charlie
and his family,'' Clinton said through White House spokesman Mike
McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, a golfing buddy of the president and former law partner
of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was indicted in late April.
The indictment accused Hubbell of not paying taxes on ``hundreds of
thousands of dollars in consulting fees'' he had received after
resigning from the Justice Department in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1994, Hubbell pleaded guilty to tax evasion and mail
fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with Starr's investigation of
the Clinton's involvement in the failed Whitewater development and
their relationship to owners of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan.
Hubbell subsequently was unable to recall details considered key to
Starr's investigation of the Clintons' business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   While Hubbell was serving 19 months in prison, Starr went after
his tax records as part of an investigation into whether Clinton
friends and supporters paid Hubbell ``hush money'' in the form of
consulting fees for little or no work so he would remain silent
about the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell argued that turning over the records, which indicate
that he underreported his income when calculating his federal
taxes, would violate his right to avoid self-incrimination. A
federal judge in Arkansas granted Hubbell immunity from prosecution
and ordered him to turn over more than 13,000 pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subpoena served on Mr. Hubbell was the quintessential
fishing expedition,'' Robertson said in the opinion issued
Wednesday. ``The independent counsel freely admits that he was not
investigating tax-related charges when he issued it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the dismissal of the tax charges against Hubbell is upheld on
appeal, Starr's inquiry into Mrs. Clinton's controversial work for
Madison Guaranty could be hampered. Also cast in doubt by this
decision is Starr's ability to go forward with his investigation
into billing practices while she was a member of the Rose Law Firm
in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's decision comes less than a week after the Supreme
Court ruled that a lawyer for Foster, the late deputy White House
counsel, does not have to turn over to prosecutors his notes of
conversations with Foster.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the high court recently refused an emergency
hearing on Starr's efforts to compel grand jury testimony from
Secret Service officers and White House counsel Bruce Lindsey in
the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a federal judge last week released from prison former
Clinton business partner Susan McDougal, who was serving time on a
contempt charge brought by Starr.

HEADS OF VOLVO AND VOLKSWAGEN HOLD TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Sweden)  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Volvo AB of Sweden confirmed Wednesday that
its chief executive had discussions last Friday with the chairman
of Volkswagen AG, Ferdinand Piech, as the stock prices of both
companies jumped on speculation of a possible alliance or merger.
</P>
<P>
   But while Volvo executives discouraged suggestions that any kind
of agreement was imminent, the company has long acknowledged that
it is seeking strategic partners. And Volkswagen, which is buying
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, has made no secret of its desire to acquire
a truck business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can confirm that Piech was here on Friday, but they have
regular meetings from time to time,'' said Stefan Lorentzson, a
spokesman at Volvo's headquarters in Goteborg, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Piech had
initiated the meeting with Leif Johansson and that Volkswagen's
primary interest was in Volvo's truck business.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Volkswagen and Volvo climbed on the news. VW leaped
73.50 marks, to 1,816.50; Volvo rose 19.5 kronor, to 257.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified by strong sales and $11 billion in cash and short-term
securities, Volkswagen has been on a buying spree in the last
several months. After a brutal bidding war against BMW AG, the
company struck a deal last month to acquire Rolls for $703 million.
Since then, Volkswagen has announced that its Audi unit will
acquire Lamborghini SpA, the Italian manufacturer of
high-performance sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   But Piech has also said he would like to expand in the truck
industry, and there has been speculation for months that Volkswagen
might try to reach a deal with Scania AB of Sweden, MAN AG of
Germany or Volvo. Though Volvo's biggest business is in
automobiles, trucks generated sales of 51 billion kronor, or $6.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen made about 263,000 trucks last year, a minuscule
slice of the 4.25 million vehicles it produced. In a recent
interview with a German newspaper, Piech said he hoped to add one
or two truck brands.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen already has business relationships with both Scania
and Volvo. Scania markets Volkswagen and Audi cars in Sweden. Volvo
buys engines for some of its cars from Volkswagen's Audi unit.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo executives have acknowledged that they are looking for new
partnerships, because they remain a small player in a market
increasingly dominated by behemoths. Daimler-Benz AG's agreement to
take over Chrysler Corp. for $39 billion ignited a storm of
speculation about the future of Europe's smaller car companies,
including Renault and Peugeot of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a niche player,'' acknowledged Lorentzson of Volvo,
which makes about 400,000 vehicles a year. ``We think we can
survive as an independent company, but we have said we need
partnerships with other companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wednesday that a merger of Volvo and Volkswagen
would present few conflicts between their product lines. Although
Volvo and Volkswagen's Audi unit both produce comparatively upscale
automobiles, Volvos are marketed primarily as family cars while
Audis appeal to sportier and faster tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are competitors to some degree, but they are positioned
very differently,'' said Georg Sturzer, an automobile analyst at
Bayerische Vereinsbank in Munich. ``There isn't much overlap.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also noted Wednesday that Volvo could be more
accessible to Volkswagen than other companies. Scania is controlled
by the Swedish holding company Investor AB, which is controlled by
Sweden's Wallenberg family. Wirtschaftswoche, a German business
magazine, reported last month that Investor would not sell Scania
for less than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo stock, by contrast, is broadly distributed among investors
and is therefore more vulnerable to an unsolicited offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volvo is still very much a small player in a large pool of
sharks,'' said Stephen Reitman, an auto industry analyst at Merrill
Lynch in London. Though Volvo could once take comfort at being of
similar scale as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz or BMW, that is no longer
true. BMW has expanded through growth and its acquisition several
years ago of Rover Group of Britain. When it merges with Chrysler,
Daimler will produce more than 4 million vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is going to happen to Volvo in the next few years,''
Reitman said.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Seeking to sidestep months of grinding
litigation, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal asked a
judge Wednesday to immediately rule that tobacco companies have
violated the state's consumer trade law by lying about the health
effects and addictive nature of tobacco. He also demanded that the
court freeze at least $10 billion of the companies' assets to
guarantee that they would be able to pay damages.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the action, Blumenthal requested that Superior Court
Judge Michael Sheldon in Waterbury order the companies to stop
marketing their products to teenagers, to cease selling cigarettes
from vending machines, to no longer claim that there is
``scientific controversy'' whether smoking causes diseases and to
take several other steps to reduce tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
   The move is significant, because it would be the first time that
a court would rule on the legality of the tobacco industry's past
business practices. While the industry settled four suits brought
by states for Medicaid claims in Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi
and Texas, none of those agreements affect cases in other states. A
ruling in the Connecticut case could establish an important
precedent for the 36 other states waging cases against tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Several legal experts said that the state's attempt to get this
ruling on the narrow issue of violations of trade law was
promising.
</P>
<P>
   But these lawyers cast a doubtful eye on Connecticut's bid to
freeze some industry assets, a measure no other state has
attempted, saying that a court would have trouble seeing why it
needed to take such a drastic step to insure that this wealthy
industry would have the resources to honor any future decisions.

<P>
   Blumenthal's action comes two weeks after the tobacco industry
succeeded in derailing legislation in Congress that would have
regulated tobacco sales, restricted advertising and forced the
industry to reimburse states for millions of dollars in medical
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The motion that Connecticut filed Wednesday was a dramatic shot
across the industry's bow, signaling that the battle has once again
shifted back to the states and that the cases brought by the
attorneys general will be heating up in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives Wednesday dismissed Blumenthal's step
as little more than posturing by a politician who faces an election
in November. ``AG stands for attention grabber,'' remarked Richard
Verheij, general counsel for U.S. Tobacco Co., which is one of the
companies named in Wednesday's motions. And Gregory Little,
associate general counsel for Philip Morris, also named in the
motion, added that Blumenthal's news conference this morning was
further proof ``that the most dangerous place in Connecticut is
between Dick Blumenthal and a camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal insisted that the effort was prompted solely by the
collapse of the Congressional tobacco legislation last month and
his concern that any longer delay in this case would allow hundreds
more people in Connecticut to become addicted to cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The state does not have a trial date scheduled, though it
launched its suit against tobacco companies for Medicaid
reimbursement almost two years ago. Wednesday, Blumenthal said that
he wanted to ``fast track'' the legal process by first having the
court rule on just one aspect of the state's initial case: whether
the companies violated the State Unfair Trade Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   The state contends that the industry broke that law when it
marketed cigarettes to minors and provided inaccurate information
about the health effects of cigarettes. If the judge agrees to
consider this issue first _ to ``bifurcate'' the case _ the law
would require the judge to decide the matter without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Under Blumenthal's plan, Sheldon would first decide whether to
order the companies to cease this behavior and begin running
anti-smoking programs. Next he would determine whether any money
was due to the state under the trade law. Finally he would convene
a jury to consider other aspects of the case, which could lead to
damages of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached a turning point in our lawsuit, now that our
hopes for a meaningful national settlement have been dashed and
prospects for Congressional action are dim,'' Blumenthal said this
morning. ``We must stop Big Tobacco from cultivating its real cash
crop _ unending fields of newly addicted children _ to preserve its
financial empire.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added that if the state could win some ``specific legally
binding judicial findings that the defendants' misconduct has
created a public health crisis in this state,'' those rulings could
establish precedents across the nation in other state and federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University who tracks
tobacco litigation, called Connecticut's move ``eminently sensible
litigation strategy'' to quickly win the various anti-smoking
measures that were lost when the federal legislation foundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can establish in this case that the companies behaved
fraudulently, it could make all other cases a lay down slam dunk,''
Coffee added, noting that this could be the first final court
ruling on this matter.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Coffee and other lawyers said that the effort to force
the companies to put up a bond of $2 billion each was ``dubious.''
Given the extensive financial resources of the companies, they
said, there was no reason to require companies to put up such money
as security in the event that the court awarded damages.
</P>
<P>
   And the tobacco companies were even harsher in their assessment
of Blumenthal's approach.
</P>
<P>
   The case seeks to freeze some assets of Phillip Morris Inc.,
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
Lorillard Tobacco Co. and U.S. Tobacco Co., and several of the
companies Wednesday issued statements that the idea was absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Blumenthal today entered the fairy tale land of Lewis
Carroll's Queen of Hearts who said, `Sentence first, verdict
afterwards,''' said Thomas McKim, assistant general counsel of R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco, noting that it made no sense ``to freeze $10
billion of tobacco company assets on the theory that his case might
hold up, if it ever reaches trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Several tobacco industry lawyers said that anti-smoking
advocates had lost recent cases, a point that their opponents
dispute, and that Blumenthal was acting desperately because of his
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   And Verheij of U.S. Tobacco said that judges would be reluctant
to break the case in half and deal immediately with the trade
practices issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bifurcation tends to be very inefficient in terms of judicial
resources,'' Verheij said. ``You end up covering a lot of the same
ground twice.''
</P>
<P>
   And he questioned why such a step was suddenly necessary.
``Blumenthal filed the case almost two years ago, and you have to
ask what is different today that you suddenly need this
extraordinary remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   And the tobacco companies were even harsher in their assessment
of Blumenthal's approach.

EDITORIAL: THE PRESIDENT AND THE DALAI LAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 2:
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton discussed Tibet with Chinese leaders in
recent days, he did so with the support of an invaluable ally, the
Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader. That has enabled Clinton to
raise the issue in ways that may prove productive with Beijing
while insulating himself against criticism in Washington that he
treated Tibet too gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to know if Clinton's approach will work, but his
alliance with the Dalai Lama has been one of the more striking
aspects of his visit to China. President Jiang Zemin responded
encouragingly to Clinton's call for a dialogue with the Dalai Lama,
and the exiled Tibetan leader is now hopeful that discussions can
soon begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama advocates autonomy for Tibet within China. He
commands a wide following among Tibetans, although support is
growing for radical groups that want a violent independence
struggle. Chinese talks with the Dalai Lama would be an important
step toward ending China's harsh repression of Tibetan religion and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese troops marched into Tibet in 1950, reasserting a
sovereignty China has intermittently exercised over many centuries.
Since 1959 Chinese authorities have suppressed Tibetan Buddhist
culture, driving the Dalai Lama into exile and evicting hundreds of
monks and nuns from their monasteries. Many Tibetan believers have
been jailed, and Beijing has promoted the migration of ethnic
Chinese into Tibet, threatening to make Tibetans a minority in
their own land.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama long ago conceded Beijing's sovereignty over
Tibet. Though a symbol of courageous resistance to China's human
rights abuses, he concluded that Clinton's policy of engagement
with China was more likely to benefit Tibet than a policy of
confrontation, and offered his support to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's remarks seem to reflect a more moderate approach to
Tibet that has been under discussion within the Chinese leadership
for the past 18 months. American policy calls not just for dialogue
with the Dalai Lama but also for respect for human rights,
religious freedoms and Tibet's distinctive culture.
</P>
<P>
   By politely but publicly promoting the Dalai Lama and giving
international exposure to the issue of cultural repression in
Tibet, Clinton may help contribute to a more enlightened Chinese
approach. That would be a welcome outcome, one that would not be
possible without the help of the Dalai Lama. &QL;

   AS EXPECTED, FED LEAVES INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED
</P>
<P>
   After a two-day meeting, the Federal Reserve Board, as expected,
decided not to change interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Several new economic reports indicate that the economy is
cooling, which might be the reason for the move. The National
Association of Purchasing Management index for June fell to 49.6
from 51.4 in May, the first time in two years that the level has
dropped below 50.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department also reported that construction slumped
1.5 percent in May, the worst drop in more than four years, and the
Conference Board's indicator of future economic activity remained
unchanged from April to May at 105.2.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. manufacturers have slowed production to the lowest rate of
growth since 1995, the clearest effect so far of the Asian crisis
on the American economy. Production is slowing in large part
because stockpiles of unsold goods have surged, but also because
companies are becoming worried that economic growth cannot continue
at the brisk pace of the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING REPORT BOLSTERS SHARES
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Boeing rose 6.45 percent after the company gave a
glowing report on its recovery to analysts and reporters. The jet
maker said that it delivered 61 airplanes in June, the highest
one-month total ever, and was on course to meet its goal of
delivering 550 jets this year. Even so, many Wall Street analysts
remain bearish on Boeing, citing price competition with Airbus, its
European rival, continuing weakness in Asia and the specter of
rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   DOW CLIMBS BACK ABOVE 9,000
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.1 percent, closing above
9,000 for the first time in three weeks. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index set another record, jumping to 1,148.56.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond remained at 5.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   STOCK RALLY CONTINUES IN JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese stock market extended its rally for a sixth
consecutive day, logging its third-largest single-day gain this
year, on expectations that the government's plan for cleaning up
the nation's problem loans will spur an economic revival.
</P>
<P>
   STAR BANC TO ACQUIRE FIRSTAR
</P>
<P>
   Star Banc announced plans to acquire Firstar for stock worth
about $7.2 billion. The deal would create a banking company with
$38 billion in assets and outlets in 10 states, mostly in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   VOLVO CONFIRMS VW TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Volvo of Sweden confirmed that its chief executive had
discussions last Friday with the chairman of Volkswagen amid
speculation of a possible alliance or merger between the two
automakers. Although Volvo executives discouraged suggestions that
any kind of agreement was imminent, the company has long
acknowledged that it is seeking strategic partners. And Volkswagen,
which is buying Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, has made no secret of its
desire to acquire a truck business. The stock prices of both
companies surged.
</P>
<P>
   A STRONGER FOCUS ON WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of companies are marketing directly to women
the products and services that were once pitched almost exclusively
to men, because they want to let women know they want their
business.

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal district judge threw out the tax evasion
case against Webster Hubbell on Wednesday, ruling in a powerful
critique of the independent counsel's tactics, that Kenneth Starr
had both exceeded his authority and reneged on a promise to grant
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, James Robertson, found that the criminal case was too
far removed from Starr's original mandate of 1994 to investigate
the business dealings of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton in Arkansas more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ruled that prosecutors, having granted immunity
to Hubbell to force him to produce 13,120 pages of records, then
used those records to make a case against him, in violation of his
rights against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment.
Robertson called the subpoena that led to the immunity agreement a
``quintessential fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   With the dismissal of the indictment of Hubbell, Starr could
lose the leverage he had hoped to use with one of Clinton's oldest
and closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, handed up two months ago, had accused Hubbell,
his wife, and two tax advisers of scheming in the last four years
to avoid paying taxes and penalties of more than $850,000.
Prosecutors had contended that much of the taxes owed on embezzled
money and hundreds of thousands of dollars in income were steered
to Hubbell, a former associate attorney general and longtime
Clinton friend, while prosecutors were seeking information against
the President and Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson ruled that the charges lodged against Hubbell in
April were too far afield from the original investigation over
which Starr was appointed to preside. Starr's original mandate was
an inquiry begun in 1994 to examine the ties of the president and
first lady to a corrupt savings association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent counsel's explanation of how this indictment
is `connected with' the original grant was a recitation spanning
six degrees of relationship,'' Robertson wrote. ``He has identified
no common witnesses, described no similar patterns of conduct,
cited no similar applicable law.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell appeared shocked and relieved by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good day,'' he said at the doorstep of his home here.
``I don't know how to react. It's been five years.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-paragraph statement that was issued by the independent
counsel's office but not signed by Starr said the decision would be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pleadings and oral arguments to the District Court reveal
our respectful disagreement with the district judge's decision,''
the statement said. ``We will seek prompt review of this ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, privately jubilant over the wide-ranging
criticism of Starr, which included a characterization of his
constitutional views as ``scary,'' were nevertheless taciturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else do you say when a federal judge has used words like
`scary' and `fishing expedition?''' said Rahm Emanuel, a senior
adviser to Clinton. ``It speaks volumes about that office and the
investigation itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In China, President Clinton said that he was pleased with the
outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision speaks for itself, but I'm happy for Webb and
Suzy and their family, Mike and his family and Charlie and his
family,'' he said in a remark relayed by Mike McCurry, the
presidential press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, who had also been a partner of Mrs. Clinton's at the
Rose law firm in Arkansas, had served nearly 17 months in prison
for bilking his former law partners and clients before he was
charged in April in the tax case.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have said that Hubbell had failed in the
first criminal case to live up to an agreement to be fully candid,
while Hubbell's supporters have said that the second indictment was
simply a further effort to pressure him unfairly into making false
incriminating statements against the Clintons. The tax indictment
suggested that some of the income he had failed to report to the
Internal Revenue Service might have been to discourage him from
being more candid with investigators, a suggestion that he had
vigorously denied.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robertson first hinted that he was leaning against the
independent counsel at a hearing last Friday when he referred to
one prosecutor's arguments on immunity as ``scary'' and was dubious
about links another prosecutor tried to make between the tax case
and Starr's original charter.
</P>
<P>
   The judge joined the bench in 1994, an early appointee of
President Clinton. He had been a seasoned corporate litigator and
partner at Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering, one of Washington's largest
law firms. While his clients included a number of large
corporations, the judge had also distinguished himself for playing
a leading role in civil rights causes in the United States and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue in his ruling on Starr's jurisdiction was the
delicate balance between the judiciary and the executive branch in
enforcing the independent counsel law and the proper role of the
special court that appoints such counsels and oversees their work.
The court, known as the Special Division, consists of three federal
appeals judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Created by the independent counsel law, the Special Division
serves as a kind of hybrid institution, performing some functions
normally left to the executive branch and others similar to those
of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   In January the special division, acting at the request of Starr,
issued a secret order giving the Whitewater independent counsel the
authority to investigate Hubbell's taxes. The precise question
presented by Hubbell and the other defendants was whether the
special division had the authority to expand Starr's jurisdiction
in the absence of a request by the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Two other federal district court judges ruled last year that the
special division had such authority in criminal cases brought
against peripheral defendants by the independent counsel
investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. Those judges
had written that they were reluctant to second-guess the decisions
of the special division, particularly since they are all appeals
court judges.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday Robertson said he disagreed with those district
court judges. Robertson found that although the special division
consisted of Federal appeals judges, the panel ``in fact is not a
court of appeals.'' Rather by constitutional limitations imposed
upon it by the Supreme Court, the special division performs
``essentially ministerial'' acts that can be reviewed by a district
court.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Robertson wrote, the special division ``may interpret
the independent counsel's original grant. It may not expand the
independent counsel's jurisdiction without the consent of the
attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This limitation is constitutional, and, if it is to mean
anything at all, must be enforceable upon a proper challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that his reasoning ought not to affect Starr's
jurisdiction to pursue the investigation of Monica Lewinsky because
the attorney general had specifically recommended that the
independent counsel examine that matter.
</P>
<P>
   After finding that he had the authority to review the special
division's order conferring authority on the independent counsel to
investigate Hubbell's taxes, the judge concluded that the order was
not ``demonstrably related'' to the attorney general's application
for the appointment of Starr when he was appointed.
</P>
<P>
   In the immunity section of his decision, Robertson rejected the
independent counsel's argument that the agreement that led to the
production of Hubbell's business records should be narrowly
construed. Prosecutors had maintained that the immunity that they
had granted meant only that they could not tell a jury that they
had received the documents from Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hubbell's compelled production of documents allowed the
independent counsel to build a case against Mr. Hubbell different
in all material respects from the case for which they had been
subpoenaed,'' the judge wrote. ``Mr. Hubbell was thereby turned
into the primary informant against himself.''

EDWARD EDDY, 77, EDUCATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Pa., N.Y., Mass., Colo., N.H.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Danforth Eddy, an educator, college administrator and
frequent commentator on women's education and educational
excellence, died June 28 at his home in South Kingstown, R.I. He
was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, according to the Avery-Storti
Funeral Home in Wakefield, a village in South Kingstown.
</P>
<P>
   In his last academic post, Eddy was president of the University
of Rhode Island, where he served from 1983 to 1991. Since then, he
was engaged in community affairs and served as chairman of the
Providence Blueprint for Education, or Probe, and as a catalyst for
improvements in public education throughout Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy was an authority on land grant colleges. His history of
such institutions, ``Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land Grant
Idea in American Education'' (Harper &AMP; Row, 1957), remains a
classic on the subject and was issued in French and Spanish
editions.
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of ``The College Influence on Student
Character'' (1959), a study he conducted for the American Council
on Education. Financed by the Ford and Calkin Foundations, it
concluded, essentially, that a climate of intellectual excellence
builds character.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy also wrote studies that compared private colleges in
Pennsylvania in terms of quality, costs and faculty appointments.
In addition, he contributed many articles for national
publications.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the executive board of HERS/Mid-Atlantic. The
organization, Higher Education Resource Services, promotes
opportunities for women who are college students.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy was born in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He graduated from
Cornell University in 1944 and received a master of divinity degree
from Yale University in 1946 and a Ph.D. from Cornell in 1956. He
started his career as associate director of Cornell's interfaith
office in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   From 1949 to 1960 he was associated with the University of New
Hampshire, serving as acting president in 1954 and 1955 and as
provost and a vice president from 1955 to 1960. He then served as
president of Chatham College in Pittsburgh and as provost of
Pennsylvania State University before moving to Rhode Island in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Mary Schurman Eddy; two
sons, Edward Eddy III of Los Angeles, and David Eddy Spicer of
Cambridge, Mass.; two daughters, Mary Eddy of Denver and Catherine
Hahn of Ashland, N.H., and seven grandchildren.

KNICKS' HOUSTON GETS GOOD REPORT AFTER SURGERY  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After playing through the Knicks' playoff run with a
sore left knee, guard Allan Houston underwent arthroscopic surgery
Wednesday to remove a piece of loose cartilage in order to
alleviate the minor problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' team physician, Dr. Norman Scott, performed the
procedure at Beth Israel Hospital North Division.
</P>
<P>
   Houston will begin a three- to six-week rehabilitation process
beginning Thursday at his home under Scott's guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgery was a complete success,'' the Knicks' president,
Ernie Grunfeld, said. ``We expect a full and quick recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston will not be able to rehabilitate his knee at the Knicks'
practice facility because of the National Basketball Association
lockout. If labor peace had been reached before Tuesday's midnight
deadline and a lockout had been averted, Houston would have
probably waited to have the surgery until after the world
championships, July 29-Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was selected to the USA Basketball team, but like the
other NBA players involved, he will not participate as a result of
the lockout.

EDITORIAL: CAUTION FLAGS AT THE FDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 2:
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of two prescription drugs from the market
suggests that the Food and Drug Administration may be having some
trouble balancing political demands to speed up the drug approval
process while maintaining its tradition of rigorous safety review.
Jane Ellen Henney, President Clinton's nominee to head the FDA,
will face the tough job of improving the agency's efficiency while
resisting pressures from Congress and the drug industry that can
undermine the cause of public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the painkiller Duract was removed from pharmacy
shelves after just 11 months on the market because it caused dozens
of cases of serious liver failure and four deaths in people using
the drug longer than 10 days. Earlier in June, Posicor, a drug used
to treat high blood pressure, was pulled following disclosures that
it can be lethal if taken in combination with other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Both drugs, approved in 1997, underwent FDA reviews that lasted
more than a year. The agency's administrators insist that rigorous
safety standards were met, and attribute the bad results to the
failure of doctors and consumers to follow warning labels. Critics
say that pressure to get more drugs to market may be creating an
atmosphere in the agency that tilts it toward approving products
that might have been held up for more study in earlier years.
Ninety-two new drugs were approved in 1996 and 1997, compared with
50 in the preceding two years. FDA officials say the higher number
merely reflects the agency's ability to process more drug
applications due to recent increases in its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the troubling spate of recent drug recalls,
including the diet drug Redux and its cousin Pondimin last
September, makes this an appropriate time for the FDA's leadership
to review agency safeguards. There is good reason to speed up
review for new drugs for cancer and other life-threatening
illnesses for which there are no substitutes on the market. But
breakthrough drugs actually account for only 20 percent of the new
drugs approved. The majority of approvals are for drugs, like
Duract and Posicor, that treat ailments for which there are other
drug therapies available. In such cases, there is little public
benefit from speedy approval of new products that might expose
consumers to harm.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA moved to take Duract and Posicor off the market because
they are not lifesaving drugs and because there are other options
that do not pose the same safety risks. That standard might best be
applied before the drugs are sold. &QL;

BOEING NOW TO FOCUS ON BUILDING PLANES EFFICIENTLY, BOOSTING
PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing's top brass said Wednesday they finally have a
handle on the company's commercial jet production problems and will
now shift the focus to boosting overall profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a tough nine months here,'' Boeing Chairman Phil
Condit told analysts in a conference call Wednesday. ``It is
something I never want to repeat.''
</P>
<P>
   While the company's biggest challenge the first half of this
year was to get its bottlenecked assembly lines running smoothly,
Condit said the next six months will be devoted to ``getting the
cost down and starting to return some good (financial)
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   During a progress report on the company's aircraft production
status, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group President Ron Woodard
impressed analysts by reporting 61 airplane deliveries for the
month of June, bringing its second-quarter total to 139.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been struggling for months to fill its airplane
orders on time and is still running about a month behind schedule
on deliveries. But last month's numbers show a dramatic turnaround
in both the pace of aircraft production and delivery to airline
customers.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing didn't meet its target of delivering 142 airplanes
in the second quarter, it was better than many analysts had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of this year, Boeing delivered 247 airplanes,
keeping the company on track to reach its goal of 550 for the year,
compared with 375 last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate conference call to the news media, Boeing
officials said the company has met the production goals it set last
October, when parts shortages, a lack of trained workers and other
glitches caused assembly line backups and behind-schedule
manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was forced to shut down certain assembly lines for a
month to help clear the bottlenecks. The problems hit just as
Boeing was trying to raise production to unprecedented levels to
meet rising demand from a financially strong airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly more stable than we were in October, and we
are in better shape on all fronts,'' Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors welcomed the news, sending Boeing's stock up $2.875 to
$47.44 on the New York Stock Exchange, still well below the peak of
$60.50 hit last July.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's production problems have cost the company $3 billion so
far and led to last year's loss of $178 million _ the first annual
loss in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Woodard said manufacturing improvements have been
made in all areas. Boeing's percentage of overtime hours fell to
14.1 percent in June from 14.7 percent the previous month, yet was
still shy of the goal of 13.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing officials are still closely monitoring production
of the next generation 737 models _ which has been the most
troubled assembly line _ Woodard said the number of jobs behind
schedule on those models fell to 4,751 in June from 7,767 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's companywide employment has remained relatively stable,
but the payroll will now begin to decline, Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of job cuts this year is still not known but
officials said it will most likely be lower than the 12,000
commercial division job cuts originally projected in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get better and better on production, we will be focusing
on our headcount,'' Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to release new employment projections July
23 along with second-quarter financial results.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Boeing's recent success in getting a high number of
airplanes built and delivered, the biggest challenge now is to
prevent 1998 from ending up as a year of ``profitless prosperity,''
said Paine Webber analyst Jack Modzelewski.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Boeing can build airplanes quickly ... the
big question is can you build them profitably?'' Modzelewski asked
Condit during the conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Condit acknowledged that Boeing is in no position to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be satisfied with where we are,'' he said.
``We have a lot of production efficiencies to get into our
plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing still faces a big production increase on the next
generation 737 models. The company currently produces 14 of those
models a month but will increase that to 21 in October.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're reporting good (delivery) numbers but until they get
their 737s up to the full (production) rate, I won't be
comfortable,'' said analyst Paul Nisbet with JSA Research in
Newport, R.I. ``Their costs are still not coming down.''
</P>
<P>
   Another dark cloud hanging over Boeing is the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it has 19 commercial airplanes in storage, many
of which are earmarked for Asian airlines that can't afford to take
delivery of the planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to closely watch the developments in Asia with
concern,'' Woodard said. ``If the situation continues to worsen we
can expect further softening of wide-body demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said last month it will cut production of jumbo 747s by
30 percent next year because Asia's economic slowdown prompted
airlines to delay delivery and order smaller planes.

CLINTON REVIEWS CHINESE STEPS TO IMPROVE ECOLOGICAL RECORD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUILIN, China _ President Clinton flew to this famous nature
spot Thursday to play enviro-tourist and review Chinese attempts to
stem decades of ecological degradation.
</P>
<P>
   The scenic stop contrasted with Clinton's two full days in
bustling Shanghai, the country's commercial capital, where the
president was surrounded by skyscrapers, hard-charging
entrepreneurs and a stock market at the heart of China's growing
economy. But the message for both locales was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go forward, we must ensure that economic development
does not lead to environmental catastrophe,'' Clinton told U.S. and
Chinese business leaders Wednesday in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returned to the issue in an interview with Central
Chinese Television, the national government-owned network, which is
to air Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way to grow the economy and replenish the
environment,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Sino-American ecological initiatives include the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency working with the Chinese on
assisting in a nationwide air quality monitoring project.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton predicted that in 10 years people will say the
environmental cooperation is ``one of the biggest things they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his eight-hour visit to the Guilin region, in
south-central China, by discussing environmental issues with U.S.
and local specialists, whom Steinberg called ``a very activist
outspoken group.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said the Chinese have ``a growing sense of citizens
being able to be active'' in issues such as environment quality
without fear of reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   An industrialist was also scheduled on the program, a Guilin
brewer whom Steinberg credited with sound environmental techniques,
including wastewater disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned an afternoon boat ride down the Li River to
wonder at stone formations that have been the favorites of Chinese
painters and poets for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Li, like other major Chinese rivers, for years was
treated as virtually an open sewer. And some of the hills along the
president's route were stripped of trees by villagers desperate for
firewood.
</P>
<P>
   The river has been the focus recently of a clean-up program, and
some local residents now turn animal and farm waste into bio-gas
for cooking and fuel so they do not need to denude nearby forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a real sea-change in attitude,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   After his ride on the river in a motorized yacht, Clinton was to
fly on to Hong Kong, the final stop of his nine-day tour of China,
for meetings with political leaders in the former British colony,
which reverted to Chinese rule a year ago this week. Clinton was to
make a bit of history by being the first foreign leader to fly into
Hong Kong's new international airport, Chek Lap Kok, three days
before its official opening.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned a trip-closing news conference Friday before
leaving on his 17-hour flight back to Washington, plus a refueling
stop in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, Clinton ticked off the alarming data that frame
China's environmental challenges, including the fact that
respiratory illness from air pollution is the nation's biggest
health problem. Steinberg said China has five of the 10 most
polluted cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every major body of water is polluted,'' Clinton said. ``The
water table is dropping all over the country. China is about to
assume the unfortunate distinction of replacing the United States
as the largest emitter &UR;  &LR; of greenhouse gases that are dangerously
warming our planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, however, that sound environmental policy and
slower economic growth did not necessarily go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have example after example after example of countries whose
economies are doing well as they adopt more sensible environmental
and energy practices,'' Clinton said. ``And energy companies in the
United States are making a significant share of their profits
through conservation and the implementation of technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   James Steinberg, Clinton's deputy national security adviser,
pointed out the obvious: ``This is an issue which is on the
president's mind.'' Pollution may also have played a part in
Clinton's sometimes raspy voice after five days in Beijing and
Shanghai, where there is almost always a haze in the air, caused at
least in part by industrial and automotive exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   More than six million Chinese travel annually to Guilin to take
the Li cruise, famous for the limestone outcroppings known as
``karsts.'' The formations jut up to 600 feet above fruit orchards
and rice fields and bear such evocative names as ``Painted Hill of
Nine Horses'' and ``The Frog Crossing the River.''

EDITORIAL: A WARNING FROM THE FED 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 2:
</P>
<P>
   Banks are lending out cash a bit too easily, with too little
regard for the risks that will come if the economy stumbles into
recession. So says the Federal Reserve in an unusual letter sent to
all banks last week and released to the public this week.
</P>
<P>
   That the Fed should be worried about easy credit now is merely
the latest indication that the American economy is out of sync with
many other world economies. Most of Asia is in the midst of a
severe credit crunch, as suddenly cautious banks try to get back
the money they were lending out so willingly as recently as last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's letter, based on a detailed analysis of a sample of
loans made by large banks across the country last year, falls well
short of an indictment of bank lending practices. But the tone is
one of caution, and there are specific warnings that credit
standards may have slipped in certain areas, among them loans to
real estate investment trusts and media companies. The Fed is also
concerned that banks may be charging too little on loans to
corporate customers. It is a concern that some top bankers
privately say is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent the Fed's warnings are taken to heart by bankers,
the letter might serve as a mild drag on the American economy,
something some Fed officials would like to see. The Fed has been
unwilling to accomplish that through the usual means, raising
interest rates, because of concerns that such a move would
exacerbate the Asian economic crisis. No one was surprised that
this week's meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee ended
without a decision to raise or lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   In good times bankers vie to make loans, and are sometimes
willing to use overly optimistic assumptions to justify those loans
both to management and to regulators. Then, after errors become
apparent, bankers grow too cautious, as may be happening now in
Asia. If the Fed's letter does help to hold down excessive optimism
now, it could help to reduce or forestall the pain that will be
felt if the American economy does suffer a setback. &QL;

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Doctor's note: Engrossed as I am by my intensive research into
the specific molecular composition of the perfect margarita, I
thought I'd step back and let the readers write this week's column.
Don't worry. I'll be right here in italics if you need me. Now,
what happened to all the Triple Sec?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking for good uses for old CD-ROMs, but this
one is stretching it a bit:''
</P>
<P>
   A friend and CEO of a corporation who has been a Microsoft
developer for many years ``(And that's supposed to make him
credible?)'' takes his CDs and places them in the microwave for
three seconds. The resulting corona flash was amazing, and the
result is the most wonderful crinkle pattern. He then hangs them on
the wall as art. ``(No accounting for taste, I guess.)'' It's
awesome to enter a room filled with Microsoft CDs burned at the
stake. _ Tron
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have made this next one up even on a good day:''
</P>
<P>
   The lapidary world is finding that CDs make GREAT polishing
discs for faceting gems. I'm not kidding! They are coated ever so
slightly with a bit of carnauba wax and then ``charged'' with
diamond dust, and they work great. So, if one were to really want
to recycle the darn things, they could bundle 'em up and donate
them to their local rock and mineral club. _ Suzette
</P>
<P>
   ``And the winner is ...''
</P>
<P>
   Two words: ``PULL! BLAM!'' _ Frank
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to one woman's letter about her husband's snooping
into what she was doing on a chat channel, I recently asked if
anybody knew of a specific way it could be done. These responses
should make everybody a little more paranoid:''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hubby'' might be using a key-logger _ a hacker's tool used for
recording keystrokes (usually used for the purposes of obtaining
passwords). Most likely he is using the IRC client's own
logger,.MDBR/.MDNM/ though. Whichever way, the guy's a jerk. ``(No
argument about that.)'' _ Michael Spencer
</P>
<P>
   There is a simple script that can be used in mIRC, one of the
popular chat programs out there, and I'm sure that with very little
change it would work with Pirch and many other chats. No, I'm not
anal and don't have such a line in my remotes. ``(Sure.)'' I am
just responding to your request. ``(I'd include the script here,
but it would scare the nongeeks. Besides, I don't want any more
snooping than there already is.)'' For more on chat scripting, you
can come to Dalnet, channel \ mIRC4Dummies. _ Ron
</P>
<P>
   There are many utilities that will track your every move on the
computer. One of my clients thought his salesman was spending too
much time at Pyro Pete's Porn Page ``(not that there's anything
wrong with that)'' instead of working on his sales reports, so he
had me install a client that he bought that tracks every keystroke.
But why would you want to? The lady who wrote you left out one
important piece of information. Why does the husband feel it's his
duty to check up on her? Maybe she's caused him no end of grief. I
would suggest that he divorce her, but she'd probably get the
computer. Good women are a dime a dozen, but a good computer, now
that's something worth hanging onto. _ Tom
</P>
<P>
   ``Owww. Remember, as you sit down to write your angry letters, I
was busy with the blender and didn't know what was going on or who
was saying what. Hmmm, too much lime, not enough tequila.''  &QL;

REED AND LEITER, AT LEAST, GET GOOD NEWS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ On a miserable afternoon for Mets pitchers, there were
at least two bright spots: Rick Reed was selected to the National
League team for next Tuesday's All-Star Game, and there were signs
that Al Leiter might be sidelined a lot less than four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who tore a tendon in his left knee while pitching
against the Yankees last Friday night, had been hoping he could
return in fewer than the four to six weeks that doctors originally
estimated he would miss.
</P>
<P>
   At first the tear was believed to be 50 percent, and surgery was
an option. Now the Mets have been told it is closer to 15 percent,
and surgery appears unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Leiter, the Mets' best starter this season, could
rejoin the rotation next week, General Manager Steve Phillips said,
``I'm not planning on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was injured, Leiter seemed a sure bet to be selected
for the All-Star Game. Now, Reed and catcher Mike Piazza will be
the Mets' representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' said the 32-year-old Reed, who has
gone from being a replacement player during the 1995 strike to
being named an All-Star. ``I'm looking forward to it, I'm excited
about it. It's been a long road with a lot of bumps. To be involved
in something like this, to be in the same locker room with those
guys, I'll probably just sit back in the corner and just admire
everything. Heck, that's what I do here.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Reed, who is 9-5 this season with a 2.71 earned
run average, was something of a surprise considering that he is
scheduled to pitch in Atlanta on Sunday. The National League
manager, Jim Leyland of the Florida Marlins, had indicated he would
pass over anyone throwing the day before the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought he would be able to pitch on Tuesday on
one day's rest, Reed did not hesitate. ``Heck, yeah,'' he said.
``It will be my side day. If I only face one hitter, it doesn't
matter to me.''

WILLIAMS IS BACK, BUT FOR HOW LONG?  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams shook more hands in the Yankees'
clubhouse than grooms do at weddings as teammates welcomed him back
from his rehabilitation assignment in Tampa, Fla., and
congratulated him for being one of the five Yankees chosen for the
American League All-Star team Wednesday. But there are indications
that those salutations could turn into goodbyes once the 1998
season ends.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Williams' agreeing to an $8.25 million contract and
avoiding arbitration, he requested that the Yankees have no
negotiations with him or Scott Boras, his agent, during the season
and stressed that he wanted to gauge interest when his pact
expires, a person familiar with the conversations said Wednesday.
General Manager Brian Cashman confirmed that Williams explicitly
asked to be left alone and that the Yankees have honored this by
not talking with him or Boras for more than four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that he didn't want to negotiate during the season
and that he didn't want it to be a distraction,'' Cashman said.
``He told me that he wants to test the free-agent market. I told
him I could speak for myself about that, but I couldn't speak for
my owner. If he changes his mind, we'd love to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is not likely to change his mind and Boras is
interested in getting his client on the open market to see how much
a team will pay a switch-hitting center fielder with power who hits
.300, who is two-time All-Star and who won a Gold Glove award.
Williams brushed aside questions about his free agency Wednesday
and said that ``things will take care of themselves.'' Still, it
has become more obvious that Williams is curious to see what life
is like outside of Yankeeland and the request for no dialogue is
the first step toward leaving an organization he has been with
since he was 17 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed a desire to stay here, but he expressed an
extreme desire to see what his value is on the market,'' said
Cashman, who said he would defy the no-negotiation request if
George Steinbrenner ordered him to. ``He's earned that right. We
would love to have him back.''

CHALK UP 5.3 MILLION FOR MALLET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ If you break down the numbers, it works out to
$530,000 per word. Or $353,333.33 per syllable. Or $132,500 per
letter.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what you get once you cut out all the legal
mumbo jumbo, the self-serving pronouncements and the half-baked
attempt at social engineering. None of that means a thing.
</P>
<P>
   What's important is the $5.3 million settlement and a 10-word
phrase that almost gets lost in the paperwork:
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is liable for the death of Edward Mallet.''
</P>
<P>
   As statements go, it's as obvious now as it was the moment
paramedics lifted Mallet's lifeless body off the pavement at a
Circle K at 27th and Campbell avenues on the hot evening of Aug.
27, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That night, a man with no drugs, no gun and no legs was killed
for resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else is cow flop. The city's hired hands have been
spreading it thick and deep for five years, stinking to high
heaven, costing you a bundle and putting the family of a dead
25-year-old through an unnecessary ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's over.
</P>
<P>
   But at what cost?
</P>
<P>
   Getting the city to own up to a botched arrest took a lawsuit, a
five-week jury trial, court costs, lawyers fees and, finally, a
multimillion-dollar settlement.
</P>
<P>
   All that to admit a mistake everyone recognized but the police
department's arrogant top brass, the namby-pamby politicians
running city government and the by-the-hour legal gunslingers hired
to do their bidding.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a civil trial in March, during which the city's
lawyers said police had done nothing wrong, a jury awarded the
Mallet family $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our earnest hope that the findings of this jury will
have the appropriate impact on law enforcement agencies that have
the responsibility to serve and protect the diverse citizens of the
community,'' Doug Anderson, a juror from Mesa, read from a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   They had heard testimony about how the one-time gang-banger and
part-time motivational speaker was been pulled over by police that
August night.
</P>
<P>
   About how Mallet steered his fancy low-rider into a convenience
store parking lot in which another patrol car already was parked.
(Not exactly the spot a dangerous criminal would pick.)
</P>
<P>
   They heard about the shouting match between Mallet and officers
when Mallet refused to submit to arrest. About the wrestling match
that followed, and about how one officer wrapped an arm around
Mallet's neck.
</P>
<P>
   They heard that his body lay motionless on the pavement for six
minutes, and that no one bothered to check him until paramedics
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   They heard a respiratory therapist who was pumping gas at the
store say he'd offered to assist Mallet but that police told him to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   They heard, in other words: ``The city is liable for the death
of Edward Mallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Only now is the city admitting it, though, and only to whittle
down the $45 million jury award to $5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are other aspects to the deal, including a $500,000 Edward
Mallet Diversity Center, which the family hopes will teach
tolerance and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   They mean well, but it's kind of place that'll most likely
attract people who already are tolerant and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Police also agreed to intensify police training and
``sensitivity to cultural diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that can only happen if the people at the top believe
in it, and in the Mallet case all they did was deny, deny, deny.
They denied responsibility so often you got the feeling they'd
convinced themselves it was true.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's an old-fashioned grade-school lesson in that kind
of stubborn repetition.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should set up a chalkboard and make the big shots most
responsible for this atrocity write on it: ``The city is liable for
the death of Edward Mallet.''

EDITORIAL: LABOR'S ABUSE OF THE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 2:
</P>
<P>
   The construction workers who clashed with police and tied up
midtown Manhattan for hours on Tuesday turned a lawful rally
against the use of nonunion contractors into an illegal assault on
civic life. No union, or its members, should be allowed to take the
constitutional right to protest and turn it into a license to
paralyze the city and rough up civilians and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders have issued an apology and offered restitution for
injury and property damage. But their statements seemed so grudging
and mechanical that the rank and file could easily conclude that
their leaders were really winking at their misconduct. If the
unions repeat their roughhouse tactics, arrests and heavy fines
will be warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Locally and nationally, unions are becoming more aggressive in
asserting their interests. That is all to the good in a democratic
society. But Tuesday's lawlessness pushed the issue that prompted
the rally offstage. The rally's main sponsor, the Building and
Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, believes that the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority erred in selecting Roy Kay
Inc., a nonunion contractor from Freehold, N.J., as the lowest
responsible bidder for a $32.6 million project.
</P>
<P>
   In the unions' eyes, city and state laws governing the award of
contracts on publicly financed projects to the lowest responsible
bidder fail to adequately define what ``responsible'' means. The
unions would like the city and state to adopt legislation that
would require bidders to meet new financial, safety and performance
criteria in order to be deemed responsible. They have also
submitted evidence suggesting that Roy Kay intentionally misled
state officials about safety and wage issues. Such charges should
be thoroughly investigated by responsible officials, not
adjudicated on the streets by lawless demonstrators eager to bully
city and state agencies into using only union contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue in Tuesday's demonstration was who will get jobs
on publicly financed projects. In a rebounding city economy, unions
want as many projects as possible to go to companies that use union
crews. Public agencies, most of which already rely heavily on union
contractors, want to hold down construction costs. Awarding
contracts to the lowest responsible bidders, some of whom may be
nonunion contractors, is a means to that end.
</P>
<P>
   If the unions want to change the legal requirements for a
``responsible'' bidder, they should do so through the normal
political process. Although they put plenty of energy into their
street demonstrations Tuesday, not one union raised the issue
during the authority's board meeting that same day. &QL;

HORSE SHRUGS OFF BRAWL AS WORKER FACES CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related article, NY-WORKERS-PROTEST)  
(af) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To his handlers, he is known as Snewser, and for a
horse, he has had quite a career: riding in Yankee Stadium after
the team won the 1996 World Series, and patrolling Rockefeller
Center for ``Today'' broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could compare to his day at work on Tuesday, when,
the police said, he found himself on the wrong end of an angry
construction worker's fist. The confrontation landed the worker,
James Hornacek, in jail, and was cited by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as
a prime example of the boorish behavior of construction workers at
their rowdy demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   They were protesting the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's
use of a nonunion contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The horse could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but his
handler, Officer John Reilly, said he was recovering nicely. ``He's
due to retire this summer,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   The horse's supreme boss, Police Commissioner Howard Safir, was
similarly reassuring. ``We put a little ice on the horse,'' Safir
said. ``He's doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek, 33, of Hazlet, N.J., may not have it so easy. His
lawyers are faced with defending him against the rare charge of
attacking a police horse, a misdemeanor for which there is little
legal precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not punch a horse,'' Hornacek said. He said that he is
an animal lover who has a cat and a fish at home, and that he
helped save a runaway horse just last week at a riding stable near
his home. ``Why on earth would I punch a horse?''
</P>
<P>
   According to a criminal complaint filed in court Wednesday, a
police officer stated that he saw Hornacek ``repeatedly punching a
police horse, then stepping out of the way to avoid being kicked by
the horse, then moving back in and punching the horse again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek was arraigned on charges of attempting to kill or
injure a police animal, obstructing government administration,
disorderly conduct and reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   He was released and given a court date in August, he said. But
insisting that he never struck the horse, he said he simply raised
his arm in self-defense when he found himself stuck between the
horse and the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Snewser, 19, whose given name is Daily News because he was
donated to the Police Department's mounted unit by that newspaper,
was back at his stable on West 42nd Street Wednesday.

COLUMN: SORRY, YOU'RE STILL TOO OLD TO JOIN THE FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though starting over is never easy, Michael Rosati
said that for him the choice was easy. He had always wanted to be a
police officer and suddenly it seemed that he might have the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the advent of laser surgery, Rosati was finally able
to have his disqualifying nearsightedness corrected. At the same
time, thanks to a fight in Congress, the longstanding age limits on
becoming a New York City police officer had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
   And so, at age 44, Rosati took the Police Department's written
exam and received a high score. He proceeded to pass the background
check, the psychological exam and the physical. He was told that he
could enter the Police Academy on April 15, 1997, once he had sold
his karate school in Franklin Square, N.Y. So he sold his store.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just four days before the start of classes, he was
informed that the age limits had been reinstated. No over-age
applicants would be admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like having a lottery number that wins and you lose the
ticket,'' he said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   The injustice, not to say the pathos, of Rosati's story and a
few dozen like it convinced the City Council that an exception
should be made. Earlier this year, the Council wrote a law
specifically allowing him and about 40 other older candidates their
chance to enter the Police Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Rosati showed up to try to register for the academy
Wednesday at 7 a.m., he and the other candidates over 35 were all
turned away at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say it's humiliating, but it is
embarrassing,'' Rosati said after finding himself once again shut
out. ``It's very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosati's hopes are yet another casualty of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's rigorous interpretation of his duties or, if you prefer,
his obstinacy.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the mayor made it abundantly clear that he
did not support the cause of the over-age police officers and did
not feel an exemption should be made for them.
</P>
<P>
   Though Giuliani's own celebrated truculence has, it is said,
launched a thousand lawsuits, the mayor maintained that he was
extremely worried about opening the city to litigation. If these 40
candidates were grandfathered in, other over-age candidates would,
he insisted, use it as an excuse to bring lawsuits against the city
and overturn the age limit entirely.
</P>
<P>
   City Council members rejected his argument as legally dubious,
noting that exemptions to rules are made all the time for small
groups of people who, for one reason or another, seem to deserve
special consideration.
</P>
<P>
   While Council members said they agreed with the mayor that age
was a factor in policing, they pointed out that these candidates
had acted in good faith, giving up positions, selling businesses
and putting considerable strains on their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people changed their lives and left their jobs,'' said
Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for the City Council. ``Look, we did
this legislation because we felt it was just a question of
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Council approved the exemption in April, Giuliani
promptly vetoed it. Last month, the Council overrode his veto by a
vote of 43-4. Three of the Council's seven Republican members broke
publicly with the mayor to vote with the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Not willing to accept this clear and apparently straightforward
legislative defeat, the litigation-fearing Giuliani sued the City
Council himself. In papers filed in state Supreme Court on Tuesday,
the mayor argues that the Council's action represents an illegal
infringement on executive authority.
</P>
<P>
   Though Giuliani did not seek an injunction, he clearly
instructed the police commissioner to lock out the slowly dwindling
group of over-age candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Rosati, Paul Agli, 42, got up early Wednesday
morning, hoping that despite the mayor's opposition he would be
allowed into the Police Academy. For his shot at joining the force,
Agli had given up a job as a research technician at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center last year and found himself
unemployed for almost 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   It was, Agli said Wednesday, a painful business to watch the
doors close in his face. And not just because he himself was being
kept out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing the police violate the law is very disheartening,'' he
said. ``Either this is out of the ordinary or I am very naive.''

COURT-MARTIAL URGED FOR 2 IN MARINE JET IN SKI CABLE ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs 9th graf to change `and' to `or')  
 (ATTN: Italy, Calif., N.Y., Ind., Colo.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A hearing officer has recommended a court-martial
for the pilot and the navigator of the Marine jet that hit a ski
lift cable in the Italian Alps in February, a military official
said Wednesday. The Marine Corps planned to announce the
recommendation after notifying defense lawyers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Ronald Rodgers, a Marine Corps judge who conducted
seven days of hearings in May and June, will recommend that two
Marine officers in the rear seat of the plane not be charged, said
the military official, who did not want to be further identified.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers' report is a recommendation to the commander of U.S.
Marine Corps Forces on the Atlantic Coast, Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, who
could take any step, ranging from dismissing the case completely to
ordering that all four officers be court-martialed.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, an EA-6B Prowler, severed the cable, sending 20
people in a cable car plunging to their deaths. Italian officials
have urged prosecution of the jet's crew.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, an electronic warfare jet on a low-altitude training
mission, was flown by Capt. Richard Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo,
Calif. Seated next to him in the forward cockpit was Capt. Joseph
Schweitzer, 30, of Westbury, N.Y., who had no flight controls but
functioned as the navigator and was actively involved in mission
planning.
</P>
<P>
   Two Marine aviators in the rear cockpit had no flight controls
or view out the front. They were Capt. Chandler Seagraves, 28, of
Nineveh, Ind., and Capt. William Raney, 27, of Engelwood, Colo. In
March a Marine Investigation Board recommended charges against all
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers heard testimony that the Prowler squadron kept outdated
and inaccurate information for mission planning, and that the pilot
might have brought his plane too low because of an optical illusion
created by flying from a narrow mountain valley into a broader one.
</P>
<P>
   The military official said he did not know what charges the
hearing officer had recommended. Official spokesmen for the Marines
refused to comment. The investigation board had said in March that
two charges were possible: negligent homicide, which carries a
sentence of up to three years, or involuntary manslaughter, an
offense that involves ``culpable negligence,'' and carries a
sentence of up to 10 years, which could be imposed for each victim.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Schweitzer, David Beck, said: ``If charges are
dismissed against anybody, I would think that's wonderful. If
charges are referred against anybody, we will prepare for them.''
Speaking in a telephone interview, he said he did not know what the
recommendation was..
</P>
<P>
   Pat Schweitzer, Schweitzer's mother, said in a telephone
interview that no one in her family knew, either. ``We heard it on
the news,'' she said, referring to a television report. ``We were
told we would be informed tomorrow through our lawyers. This has
been horrendous, horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, the pilot, told The Associated Press that he had not been
formally informed of the recommendation, but had heard that he
faced a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just amazes me, the recommendation,'' he said in a
telephone interview with the news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Spinner, who represents Ashby, also said he did not know
what was in the recommendation.

IN UMBRIA, A WORLD OF POTTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 5)  
 (JT)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best way to find Mastro Paolo is to ask the attendant at the
gas station just south of Orvieto for directions. A few hundred
yards away, wedged between the highway and the railroad tracks, the
63-year-old potter Paolo Cosenza shapes and paints his bowls and
plates in a small, crumbling gray building with no air-conditioning
and a lot of noise from the passing cars and trains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in an undershirt and jeans, he is shy and unaccustomed
to visitors. His studio _ if it can be called that _ is a warren of
smallish rooms dirty with clay dust and adorned with spider webs,
old newspapers, bags of paint powder and pieces of broken pots. For
more than 40 years, Cosenza has experimented with the gray-brown
clay that he fell in love with as a child, molding it into modern
versions of ancient shapes and painting them with bands of color.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I fell in love with his shop about 15 years ago, when I lived in
Rome and visited Orvieto for the first time, and again on my latest
visit last August. After passing shop after shop displaying pottery
decorated with the traditional Umbrian designs dating back to the
Renaissance, one comes upon Mastro Paolo, as the shop is called,
across the piazza from Orvieto's magnificent Duomo. It is a welcome
change. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mastro Paolo knows that he sells something original. And his
creations don't come cheap. An angular espresso cup and saucer are
$23, calculated at 1,695 lire to the dollar. But the clay he uses
is of such good quality it does not chip easily; the saucer is
really a small plate that can be put to other use, and the cup
feels just right in one's hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The modern approach to handmade Italian pottery has also begun
to seep into nearby Deruta, a semi-industrial town whose economy
depends on ceramics production. There, two sisters, Laura and Gina
Giometti, opened a shop last July that sells nothing but modern
designs _ all at terrific prices.
</P>
<P>
   At Ars Artigiana Deruta, as the store is known, are wonderfully
shaped cups and saucers for $6; a matching soup tureen in yellow,
turquoise, white and cobalt blue for $57, and dinner plates for $15
each. Simple small white plates with blue and red trim are only $3.
The shop is so small that the sisters use the gift store next door
to wrap the purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to use American designers but their prices were
astronomical and we couldn't sell them,'' said Laura Giometti. So
the sisters turned to Swedish designers who think of themselves
less as artists and more as craftsmen. ``That way we can sell our
work at about half the price _ not much higher than wholesale,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   The clientele for modern pottery is not for the most part
Italian. ``They say, `I can't eat pasta on a plate like that,'''
said Gina Giometti. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hill towns and back roads of Umbria are so clogged with
pottery stores that even the most passionate admirer gets dizzy.
The only cure is a wonderfully long and indulgent lunch on a
terrace somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the designs here is of extraordinary variety.
Just about every child living in towns like Deruta, Orvieto and
Gubbio has painted classical figures on pieces of clay, much as
American children do poster-painting. The ubiquitous Umbrian golden
figure representing the wind can be painted from one to three times
on a coffee cup, either very well or very badly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A good way to set out on a shopping foray is to stop by the
Museo della Ceramica e Pinacoteca, a tiny museum of ceramics and
paintings in Deruta's central piazza. The museum, which doubles as
Deruta's town hall, houses some of the finest and best-preserved
examples of Umbrian pottery _ dating as far back as the 14th
century. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best way to buy is not to stop in every shop but to focus on
what catches your eye in the window and turn the visit into a
chance to meet the proprietor (who many times is the potter as
well) and learn about the craft.
</P>
<P>
   One of the highest-quality and most creative shops is Deruta
Placens, a small two-story family enterprise on the edge of
Deruta's main piazza. The potter, Giovanni Mordenti, who founded
the business with his wife, Novella Nicolini, paints his bowls and
platters in a corner of the store as he waits for customers. Last
year, their 27-year-old daughter, Annalisa, decided she loved pots
more than the law, abandoned her practice and joined the family
business.
</P>
<P>
   The rich use of color and intricate patterns give the pieces
more of a Middle Eastern than Italian feel. Prices are high. The
shop's shipping slips show where the family's customers are:
Brooklyn, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Denver. One
customer from Washington, D.C., had spent $1,475 on place settings
for eight, including serving platters and bowls _ and an extra $210
to ship it by air.
</P>
<P>
   GeRibi across the piazza and down the street offers sensational
ceramic tables. But my favorite items there are the whimsical,
colorful, more primitive pottery with borders of animals and
flowers taken from the designs of Vietri, 30 miles south of Naples.
American department stores have carried the now ubiquitous blue,
white and red pottery with chickens around the borders from Vietri
for years. In Deruta, the prices are slightly higher, but the
quality of the painting and the glaze is much better. A dinner
plate sells for $12. Shipping 12 plates to the United States costs
about $110. I carry mine in my hand luggage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients have seen the low prices of Vietri and we need to
stay competitive,'' said the proprietor and potter, Gerardo
Ribigini. Ribigini has his own Web site, which offers information
on designs, prices and shipping; he communicates with customers by
e-mail.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most down-to-earth shop in Umbria is not really a shop at
all but a small, low-tech factory called Terrecotte Berti in a tiny
working-class town called Ripa Bianca, just outside Deruta. There,
for four generations, the Berti family has made large and small
decorative terra-cotta pots, fountains and other ornaments for the
garden. Now the three brothers _ Carlo, Eugenio and Remo, who still
make pots by hand every day _ run the factory.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine stumbled on the Berti brothers a decade ago
when she bought a Berti clay pot from a local merchant in the
nearby hill town of Todi. When she asked for a match, which he
didn't have, he generously sent her to his source. The second pot
cost half the price.
</P>
<P>
   The parking lot is filled with large urns and vast blocks of raw
clay sealed in plastic for indoor and outdoor pieces. The urns can
be ordered with initials, leaf or ribbon decorations and family
crests. A rounded four-foot-high planter sells for about $150. The
Bertis will crate and ship the urns _ a bit pricey, perhaps,
because it doubles the price, but then, they are big. And there are
very few places, even in Umbria, that still produce handmade garden
planters.
</P>
<P>
   Berti's also has wonderful odd bits and pieces _ small,
house-shaped clay chimneys for $72 that can be used for citronella
candles in the summer, small fountains for $60, an elegant
oval-shaped white soup tureen for $15.
</P>
<P>
   Another place that is not usually considered a pottery center by
tourists is the lovely hill town of Gubbio, where shards of shiny
black pottery and coral red vases dating back to the fourth century
have been uncovered. Here, two shops are musts. One is La Fornace
del Bucchero, which makes reproductions of ancient Greek ceramics
and Etruscan Bucchero and sells them in two locations in Gubbio
(Bucchero is a black shiny ceramic with a coal-like base). In
addition to classical designs with bronze-colored inlays of people
and animals, the Morelli family, which owns the factory and shops,
also makes Bucchero bowls and vases in angular modern shapes, from
$100.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Ceramiche Aldo Fumanti. For more than a decade, the
husband and wife team of Aldo Fumanti and Antonia Cerbella has
designed and painted pottery. Their shop, built into the side of a
13th-century grotto and opened just last August, is a brightly
lighted art gallery and ceramics store with marble floors and
spanking white walls. The copies of 16th-century pharmacy and spice
jars between 7 and 14 inches _ with the names in Italian _ are
particularly well done. They start at about $30 the pair.
</P>
<P>
   The tackiest, and most eclectic, shop in Umbria is Torretti, set
back from the main highway leading north to Deruta, next door to
the Hotel Melody. It's easy to spot: a life-size ceramic Snow White
and her seven dwarfs are cemented to the roof.
</P>
<P>
   And is it ever fun! Should you need a life-size leopard or
Dalmatian for your garden, a giant creche, or your house number in
ceramic glued to a wooden base, this is the place. I have always
loved the ceramic vegetables, although the style is definitely not
for everybody. I once gave a platter of ceramic eggplants,
cauliflowers, zucchini, mushrooms, leeks and artichokes to a friend
in Rome. He centered them proudly on his dining table. A few months
later, they were hidden away in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum is Deruta's U. Grazia, the
giant of potters in the region that overwhelms all the others in
terms of volume and clientele, shipping to major department stores
and gift shops worldwide. The Grazia family has donated so many
pieces to the pottery museum in Deruta that a booklet has been
published on them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Set behind a wrought-iron gate in an elegant stone building,
with ceramic vases set into the brick, it is a good place to find
spectacular modern designs as well as the widest variety and
biggest inventory of classical designs of any shop in Umbria. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But I have always found the shop intimidating. For one thing,
there are no prices on the merchandise. For another, there are
never enough salespeople; the few who are there _ usually members
of the Grazia family _ are not eager to answer questions and are
sometimes downright rude. They know they don't need the walk-in
trade, and a peek into the shipping room shows why: there are
scores of orders to be sent to stores and individuals around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   On my last visit, I asked one of the shop's two employees on
duty (in Italian) to tell me the price of a few pieces of a pattern
of plates I had bought years ago for a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I speak English,'' he replied tartly.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I have never considered my Italian _ first learned in bits
from my Sicilian-dialect-speaking grandparents _ particularly
poetic. But really.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is my Italian that bad?'' I joked (in Italian).
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied. ``It is.''
</P>
<P>
   He walked away without answering my question. This was not the
fun it should be. So I bought my gifts elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Here are my favorite shops in Umbria. Most take credit cards and
traveler's checks and ship. Some give discounts for cash.

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S TIME FOR THE HALL'S VOTERS TO STAND UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When news got out that John Thompson, head coach at Georgetown,
was passed over for induction into the Hall of Fame, the reaction
was less one of surprise that he hadn't made it, but that he wasn't
in already.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a no-brainer,'' said Mike Krzyzewski, head coach at
Duke and president of the National Association of Basketball
Coaches. ``If you ask people in the basketball community, they'll
say: `John Thompson? Isn't he already in the Hall of Fame?'''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jim O'Brien, the president of the Hall, in Springfield,
Mass., seemed a bit red faced Wednesday that one of the game's
luminaries had been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave Gavitt is the chairman of the board of trustees of the
Basketball Hall of Fame,'' he said. ``I'm the president of the
Basketball Hall of Fame. John Thompson is a personal friend of both
of ours; as basketball fanatics we would both espouse that John
Thompson be in the Basketball Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Thompson's second consecutive rejection, and he has
apparently been the victim of someone's political torpedo.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be truthful, he's very close,'' O'Brien said. ``Without
question John Thompson has Hall of Fame credentials, and that over
the course of time cream comes to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``In due process, he will be elected to the Hall of Fame, but I
couldn't guarantee anyone that in a million years.''
</P>
<P>
   The screening committee can propose a nominee to the honors
committee five times. If the candidate is not elected in five
years, he or she must sit for three years and then be nominated by
the veterans committee.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches spend their careers in public; their records are out
there for the world to see. Then, at the crucial point of their
careers, they are judged by a secret panel that throws bouquets _
or darts _ at them and then hides behind a veil of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Who are these people? Who is this gang of 24 that decides which
coach, which player, gets the final cherry on an outstanding
career? O'Brien wouldn't divulge the names, but he said everyone is
``a credible basketball person.''
</P>
<P>
   What bothers Krzyzewski is the secrecy. ``There should be
diversity but there shouldn't be anonymity,'' he said. ``Not having
to be accountable for your decisions is not a good stage. If there
are 24 people, you should know who those 24 people are.''
</P>
<P>
   How much expertise can they have if they keep John Thompson out
of the Hall of Fame? They have now done it not once, but twice.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, what kind of Hall is it that excludes a coach
who has won a national title, played for the national championship
three times and sent three outstanding centers _ Patrick Ewing,
Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo _ to the National Basketball
Association? Can you imagine a Country Music Hall of Fame without
Willie Nelson?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Thompson has his share of critics. Some of them don't
like the position he took in 1990 when he walked off the court to
protest the increased use of standardized tests for incoming
freshmen. Some don't like the news media-unfriendly Georgetown
locker room. And some may dislike Thompson simply because he is an
African-American who doesn't seem to know his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the person gets to ballot time, subjectivity is
involved,'' O'Brien said. ``For anyone to say racism, I would vote
strongly against that because of the makeup of our classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said, ``If you said to me John Thompson is a very strong
personality and there are people out there in the media who would
take affront in one way shape or form, yeah, that could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't. The Hall of Fame is the creation of the National
Association of Basketball Coaches. Many of the first wave of
inductees were college coaches and referees. But there has recently
been a greater emphasis on professionals.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said the Hall's uniqueness is that it encompasses high
school, college, professional and international. But the time has
come for each constituency to be an entity unto itself. O'Brien
said that Gavitt has set up a panel to look into the voting
process.
</P>
<P>
   Professional basketball, the women's game and the international
game have all soared in popularity in 40 years. The Hall has not
expanded fully with the times. Of its 210 male members before this
year's selections, 113 have been players, 55 have been coaches and
42 have been contributors. Twelve women have been elected.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Hall of Fame will move into a lavish new facility in
Springfield, a facility helped greatly by coaches like Thompson,
who in 1984 became the first African-American to win a Division I
national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Progress for the Hall of Fame is essential because the game
has progressed,'' Krzyzewski said. ``But with progress, you don't
forget about the citizens who first inhabited the town. The Hall of
Fame was started by college coaches. Somehow, maybe that's been
forgotten.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pilobolus Dance Theater is up to its new tricks in
``The Hand That Mocked, the Heart That Fed,'' a quirky and uneven
premiere choreographed to a score by the experimental jazz composer
Maria Schneider. Both music and dance were commissioned by the
American Dance Festival and the Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts in a joint venture, the Doris Duke Millenium Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilobolus piece, which opened the company's four-week season
at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night, is the first of six
premieres in a project, financed largely though the Doris Duke
foundation, that matches jazz composers and choreographers.
Although the company will present two other new works at the Joyce
(175 Eighth Ave., at 19th Street), ``The Hand'' is of special
interest because it is the first entry in this unusual series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hand,'' in fact, has all the earmarks of a dance work
choreographed on assignment. Jazz, even the avant-garde sort, is
not in Pilobolus' musical vocabulary and Ms. Schneider has posed a
challenge to the troupe, which is a choreographers' collective. As
a dance company, it has never been anything but experimental in its
own right. But the sophistication of Ms. Schneider's score, heard
in a recording by the Maria Schneider Jazz Orchestra, has a range
and seriousness that make Pilobolus' fun-and-games imagery look
unduly narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hand That Mocked, the Heart That Fed'' (the title comes
from Shelley) is one of Pilobolus' narrative works without
narrative. It has a vaguely tantalizing edge and a firm structure:
The opening image recurs several times and suggests a family
portrait held askew.
</P>
<P>
   In each grouping, a dancer (but not the same one each time) is
positioned horizontally across the nape and shoulders of a standing
man while another dancer (but not the same one each time) is upside
down, supported by two others kneeling in front of the standing
man.
</P>
<P>
   The sepia tones of Neil Jampolis' wonderful lighting and
Angelina Avallone's costumes with an Edwardian tinge (petticoats
for the women and vests or suspenders for the men in trousers)
evoke a photographic style in the pose that recurs. The audience is
invited to look at an ever-changing picture.
</P>
<P>
   But Robby Barnett, Michael Tracy and Jonathan Wolken, who
choreographed the piece (with the usual credit given to
collaboration from the dancers) never fully define that picture. At
best, they offer a ghost story with Gothic touches (a woman steps
on the temple of a reclining man).
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Anderson and Tamieca McCloud spend much of their time
floating in the air, swooped up and down by the men, Matt Kent,
Gaspard Louis, Trebien Pollard and Mark Santillano. These swift
arcs create marvelous illusions of flight, and there are surreal
vignettes involving couples and trios. Toward the end, some of the
dancers take off their shoes and skate across the floor in their
socks. The women are often yanked around, and at one point Ms.
Anderson takes off into space with surprising speed.
</P>
<P>
   When the women, sandwiched between pairs of men, break out into
cartwheels, there is a liberating moment. At the end, three
characters let go of the hands of three others who sink to the
floor in squares of light: three characters who have confronted
their inner selves?
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the dance images ignore the occasional fury
or excitement of Ms. Schneider's orchestrated chaos. To work
against the music is a time-honored technique but to end this piece
with an anticlimax is a pity.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the program was solid. ``Solo,'' choreographed by
Alison Chase, had Ms. McCloud obviously bringing the knowing
mischief of her personal style to this exhilarating outburst from a
behind a paper curtain. The dancing all evening was first-rate. The
men showed off the linked and leveraged groupings typical of
Pilobolus' gymnastic style in the solemn ``Gnomen,'' choreographed
by Barnett and Wolken.
</P>
<P>
   The sudsy curtain calls (dancers propelling themselves across
watery strips of linoleum) were worth the wait after the New Age
tribal rite ``Day Two.''

JAPANESE STOCK MARKET EXTENDS RALLY TO SEVEN DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Expands and updates earlier story.)  (lb) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese stock market extended its rally Thursday
for the seventh consecutive day, on expectations that the
government's plan for cleaning up the nation's bad loans will spur
an economic revival.
</P>
<P>
   The yen has also been rising. On Thursday morning it cost 138.15
yen to buy a dollar in Tokyo, compared with a level of 145 a couple
of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the government's plan is the use of so-called
bridge banks to take over the business of failed institutions so
that creditworthy borrowers would not be left in the lurch if their
main bank goes under.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the plan is by no means certain. But for the last
few days, investors have begun to raise their hopes that it might
actually start to chip away large chunks of the nation's mountain
of bad and doubtful debt, estimated to be at least $560 billion.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing sense that because of world pressure the
governing Liberal Democratic Party and the government are
addressing the problem, although some of the effort is timed to
their campaigning for parliamentary elections on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's real,'' said Richard Medley, a principal of the
New York-based Medley Global Advisors, after talking with Japanese
politicians in Tokyo this week. ``These guys realize that the pain
of delaying reform is actually worse than the pain of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues rose early Thursday to
16,599.55, or 1.45 percent from Tuesday's close. The index has
risen in the last seven days, with volumes surging. Reports that
the government might also cut income taxes by nearly $30 billion
have sent investors rushing into the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happened is you've got this policy machine, and
it's working pretty well _ they've really got it together,'' said
Craig Chudler, a strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo.
``Portfolio investors have become less negative. Instead of being
supernegative, they're just negative.''
</P>
<P>
   The bridge bank plan will give wide powers to two government
bodies, the Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Financial Supervisory
Agency, a new agency of about 400 people split off from the Finance
Ministry last month to inspect the banks. As each institution
fails, its business will be transferred to a bridge bank, which
will be set up by an umbrella holding company under the Deposit
Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Deposit Insurance Corp. will draw on public funds
from the February bank bailout of 30 trillion yen, or $217 billion,
some of which has already been disbursed to the nation's largest
banks to increase their capital.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the Supervisory Agency will play the pivotal role
in the plan. One critical question will be whether it can hire
qualified people and expand enough to accomplish the task. It will
essentially be in charge of closing insolvent institutions and
appointing new management teams to run the business of the failed
banks.
</P>
<P>
   It will also determine which loans in the failed bank are bad
and which are good. Then it will transfer the bad loans to the
Resolution and Collection Bank, another entity set up to collect
bad loans, and transfer the good loans to the bridge bank, which
then may extend loans to those borrowers as a bridge until they
find a new banker.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Critics have argued that any bailout plan will create a moral
hazard, in which private institutions have little incentive to
improve, because they think they will be rescued by the government.
Partly to prevent this, the bridge banks are expected to last about
two years, during which time they are expected to find financially
healthy banks to take on the restructured business.
</P>
<P>
   This period could be extended up to five years. After that, any
bad debt still left will be transferred to the Resolution and
Collection Bank, and the bridge bank will be dissolved.

FRANK ROWLETT, 90, EXPERT IN MAKING AND BREAKING CODES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Fla., Va.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Byron Rowlett, one of the foursome who started the Signal
Intelligence Service of the U.S. Army in 1930, died June 29 at the
Wilson Health Care Center in Gaithersburg, Md. He was 90 and moved
to the center last year from a retirement home in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlett came to the rarefied world of cryptology without
practical experience. But he was trained to be a mathematics
teacher with knowledge of chemistry, physics, Latin and German and
made important contributions to the nation's Signals Intelligence
and Security system in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   His proudest achievement was Sigaba, the encryption machine that
was the most secure device of its kind in the American arsenal
throughout the war.
</P>
<P>
   He also led the team of cryptanalysts who broke Purple, the
machine that encrypted Tokyo's messages to and from the Japanese
Embassy in Berlin. By deciphering the code, U.S. intelligence was
able to spy on crucial aspects of Japanese diplomacy as well as
German intentions and capabilities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Rowlett was born in Rose Hill, Va., and graduated in 1929
from Emory and Henry College. The next year, his academic
credentials led to his recruitment by the father of modern American
cryptology, William Friedman, as one of his original three junior
cryptanalysts.
</P>
<P>
   Together they made up the fledgling Signal Intelligence Service.
With the U.S. entry into World War II, Rowlett was commissioned
into the Army and rose to the rank of colonel. After the war he led
the intelligence division of the Army Security Agency, an SIS
successor.
</P>
<P>
   He later joined the CIA and the National Security Agency, the
super-secret branch that was created in the early 1950s to make and
break codes for the Defense establishment. He became a special
assistant to the director of the security agency in 1958 and
retired in 1965 as commandant of the National Cryptologic School.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, he was honored by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who
presented him with the President's Award for Distinguished Federal
Civilian Service. After Rowlett retired, Johnson awarded him the
National Security Medal for breaking the Japanese code 25 years
earlier. The National Security Agency's highest awards for
achievement by an individual and an organization in the field of
Information Systems Security were named in his honor in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlett is survived by a son, Thomas M., of Frederick, Md., four
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His first wife, to
whom he was married for 50 years, Edith King Rowlett, died in 1980.
His second wife, Alice Creech Rowlett, died last year.

ANTHONY AVENA, 83, SHOESHINER WHO BECAME NYC FIXTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anthony Avena, a shoeshiner of 75 years whose shop
became a Queens institution and who successfully fought the city to
save it, died on June 22. He was 83 and lived in Whitestone,
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was bladder cancer, said Helen Avena, his wife of
nearly 58 years.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a sophomore at St. John's University in 1937, Avena
abandoned his dream of becoming a lawyer after his father, an
immigrant from Italy, died unexpectedly, leaving six young children
and the shoeshine shop. ``He had to take over the business,'' Mrs.
Avena said. ``He had to feed the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tiny shop, directly below the elevated tracks of the Long
Island Rail Road in downtown Flushing, Queens _ through two world's
fairs and four wars _ he came to know thousands of commuters and
residents. ``The heart and soul of Flushing,'' is how Brian
McLaughlin, a state assemblyman and Democrat from Flushing,
described the 200-square-foot area occupied by Avena's shoeshine
stand and the flower and key-duplicating stands he added later.
</P>
<P>
   With a lawyer's gift of persuasion, Avena talked local boys into
completing school; he got the powerful Metropolitan Transit
Authority to lower his rent, and enlisted Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
support for his case. Along with Giuliani's help came public praise
for Avena's shoeshine as the best the mayor had ever had.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago, during Avena's 73rd year of shining shoes,
that the MTA announced that it was raising the rent on his shop, at
Main Street and Kissena Boulevard, to more than $6,000 a month,
from $750. It was far more than he could afford, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Townsend got excited,'' said Mrs. Avena, referring to a
corporate vice president at Club Med whom Avena had persuaded to
finish high school and to go on to college. Townsend called friends
with influence in public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The news media picked up the story and a short time later Mayor
Giuliani stopped by to reassure him. ``And the MTA gave my husband
a three-year lease'' at a figure he could afford, Mrs. Avena said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won,'' she added. ``He was so proud. It was a kind of glory
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the deal with the MTA, a representative from St. John's
University presented Avena with a plaque, she said, and offered him
free tuition if, at 82, he wanted to complete his degree, an offer
that Avena declined.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Avena had successfully pleaded his
case directly to a mayor. More than 50 years earlier, after the
intercession of a friend, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia ushered Avena
into his office to hear Avena's complaint: the city, which had
bulldozed the Avena family home for construction of the 1939
World's Fair, was two years late with the payment. ``La Guardia
said, `Send him right in,''' said Mrs. Avena, recounting a familiar
family story. ``In 10 minutes he had the check.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Avena is survived by a son, Michael, of
East Northport; a daughter, Geraldine Mazza of Flushing; a brother,
Gerard, of Bohemia; a sister, Grace Barone of Whitestone, five
grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Avena closed the shoeshine shop last year when he became ill,
his wife said. Family members still run the floral and
key-duplicating shops, though, and will continue to do so, it
seems. At the wake for her husband, Mrs. Avena said, Giuliani
pulled her aside and said, ``Any trouble from the MTA, you let me
know.'''

   WASHINGTON _ Suharto, the former president of Indonesia, is
maneuvering to re-establish a political power base to shield his
family's financial empire from scrutiny by future governments,
according to Clinton administration officials and Western
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   There is no direct evidence that the Suharto family has tried to
bribe political or military leaders, the officials say. But they
add that Suharto and his six children are offering to underwrite
the political campaigns of legislators who vow loyalty to the
family, which has a fortune in the billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and diplomats agree that Suharto does
not appear to be seeking reinstatement as president. He resigned in
May after tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of
Indonesia's largest cities demanding his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they say, intelligence reports reaching the CIA, the
State Department and the Defense Department show that he is making
use of his riches and his ties to the military to help his children
retain their businesses and their top posts in the ruling political
party, at a time when the political moorings of Indonesia are
fraying.
</P>
<P>
   Next week the party, known as Golkar, is holding a special
national congress to pick new leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto remains chairman of the party's board of patrons, and
two of his children have been appointed to the seven-member
organizing committee for the congress. Four of his children are
members of the nation's highest legislative body, the People's
Consultative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   That Suharto, 77, retains close ties to the military, the
nation's most powerful institution, was in evidence in June when he
accompanied several powerful army generals to Islamic prayers held
in military mosques in Jakarta, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suharto has been very active, rounding up support wherever he
can find it,'' said a senior Clinton administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Another administration official said Suharto ``knows that he
can't be president again, but he is going to make sure that his
kids and his cash survive whatever comes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daniel Lev, a professor of political science at the University
of Washington and an expert on Indonesia, said the Suhartos ``are
doing what comes very naturally: they have the wherewithal to buy
political support, and I suspect that is in fact what they are
trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent collapse of the Indonesian currency, the
Suharto family is still widely believed to be among the richest on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   After his resignation on May 21, Suharto went into seclusion for
a few weeks, rarely emerging from his Jakarta home and seeing few
visitors apart from his six children. He was reported to be
depressed and shocked at his ouster after 32 years of iron-fisted
rule.
</P>
<P>
   But Western diplomats in Jakarta and administration officials
with access to intelligence reports say that his isolation is over
and that he has worked aggressively behind the scenes to restore
his contacts with political, military and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that Suharto would seek a return to public life _ and
might even try to take power again as president with the help of
the army _ have swirled through Jakarta virtually since the day he
stepped down. Military leaders have been forced to make public
statements denying that they are helping him return to power.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday, Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces
commander, acknowledged that he and other senior military officers
remained ``close'' to Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiranto insisted that that situation does not ``imply the
existence of secret or hidden ties,'' nor the suggestion that the
military would help Suharto return to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto was succeeded by his vice president, B.J. Habibie. While
Habibie was considered a protege of the former president, it is
unclear what sort of relationship exists between the two.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Habibie has taken some actions that appear to be
favors to his predecessor, including his decision last month to
dismiss Attorney General Sujono Atmonegoro after Atmonegoro
announced that he was organizing an investigation of the
unexplained wealth of former government officials, apparently
including Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   But other actions by Habibie appear to be snubs, including his
order this week to expel several of Suharto's closest friends from
the Legislature, including Bob Hasan, a timber tycoon who is
Suharto's favorite golfing partner and who helps manage the former
president's fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Suharto recently requested a
secret meeting with Abdurrachman Wahid, the leader of a
30-million-member Muslim society in Indonesia and the nation's most
influential religious leader. While the purpose of the meeting was
not known, the officials presume it had political overtones. Wahid
has been close in the past to Suharto's eldest daughter, Siti
Hardiyanti Rukmana. &QL;

TEXAS INVESTIGATORS EXAMINE NEW LEADS IN BURNING OF BOY, 8 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By PAUL McKAY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPLENDORA, Texas _ Montgomery County investigators were
examining new leads Wednesday in their efforts to determine who
doused a boy with a flammable liquid on his eighth birthday and
burned him over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ray Middleton remained in critical condition at Shriners
Burns Hospital-Galveston as detectives in Montgomery County said
they were following up on fresh clues and reviewing statements they
have gathered since Sunday, when Robert suffered third-degree burns
over 99 percent of his body.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities would not elaborate on the new information they said
they have obtained.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome incident occurred near the boy's rural home, a few
miles northwest of Splendora, as he was heading down a wooded trail
to a friend's house around 5:45 p.m. The boy had not gone far into
the woods before he was burned near a spindly tree, which was
blackened by the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The hard clay ground around thetree also was scorched.
</P>
<P>
   Robert ran from the woods and was found by neighbors about 40
yards from his house. A 30-year-old neighbor who rushed to his aid
told investigators that Robert had given the first name of an older
boy who he said had doused him with gasoline because he was angry
at him.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Sgt. David Moore reiterated Wednesday that the
Splendora-area teen who was named, and subsequently suspected by
some of the neighbors, had what appeared to be a solid alibi.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moore said, the teen-ager was ``not completely cleared _
not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he was down on the San Jacinto River with a bunch of
people, including several adults, who are adamant that he was with
them,'' Moore said. ``They are adamant that they had piled into a
truck and went fishing and swimming at the river together Sunday,
and the river is nowhere close (to the neighborhood).''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that ``anything is possible,'' Moore said it
is unlikely that Robert could have somehow set himself on fire
accidentally, since no fuel containers, matches or lighters were
found around the site of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been presumed that gasoline was poured on the
boy, Moore said soil samples are being tested to determine whether
the fuel could have been some other flammable liquid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, Robert can't tell us what happened,'' Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert, who is breathing with the aid of a ventilator, was
unable to speak by the time medics reached him in the street in
front of the home of 67-year-old Billie Reed. She said she had seen
smoke rising from the wooded trail just as she and her husband were
arriving home Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman also claimed to have seen two teen-agers _ including
the one supposedly named by Robert _ dart into the woods after the
boy was burned.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheriff Guy Williams said late Wednesday that ``some of the
initial information doesn't appear to be right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten some other information and we're trying to put a
case together,'' Williams said. ``We're making progress, getting
calls and getting information that we're having to sort through.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could interview Robert for just two minutes we would
have it made, but that little boy is fighting for his life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The episode has left a pall over the close-knit east Montgomery
County neighborhood about 35 miles north of Houston, where
residents who are fond of the boy and his family say they are
keeping closer watch on their own children.
</P>
<P>
   Robert's parents, Bobby Ray and Colleen Middleton, both 35, work
for a glass company in nearby Kingwood. They have a daughter,
Heather, 13, and another son, Clint, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in this neighborhood and it's a good neighborhood,
where everybody looks out for everybody else and their children,''
said Regina Tanton, 23, who noted that her 4-year-old son Joseph
was close to Robert.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a crime neighborhood; it's not a gang
neighborhood,'' said Tanton, whose husband, Billy, was the first
adult to reach Robert after the boy emerged from the woods. ``The
street is like a community where everybody is family. We're very
concerned, but there's no way we could not be concerned about
something so devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to watch our kids if they walked down to somebody
else's house. Now, we walk with them.''

PRESIDENT ORDERS RELEASE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs grafs 1-3 to recast lead and provide additional information) (sw) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ With little fanfare, President Kim Dae-jung
on Wednesday ordered the release of political prisoners, even if
they do not renounce their ideological views.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups estimate that some there are some 500
political prisoners, and government officials indicated that a
large number of them would be released, but would not be pinned
down as to the actual number.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners are to be released by Aug. 15, which is the 50th
anniversary of the end of the Japanese occupation and of the
founding of the Seoul government.
</P>
<P>
   According to local press reports, the man widely regarded as the
world's longest-serving political prisoner, Woo Yong-gak, will be
among those freed in an amnesty celebrating the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the South Korean government.
</P>
<P>
   Woo has spent almost 40 years in solitary confinement, losing
his teeth and suffering various illnesses but refusing to renounce
his commitment to North Korean doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   That commitment prevented him from being eligible for an amnesty
announced in March, which led to the release of 2,300 prisoners,
including 74 political prisoners who signed statements renouncing
their ideological beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In total, that amnesty affected 5.5 million people, sweeping
away the records of past traffic violations and expunging notices
of demotion from the personnel files of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is a former political prisoner, so his action has a
particular resonance in a Korea that is throwing off its
heavy-handed political past.
</P>
<P>
   The government has decided to scrap the longstanding practice of
requiring all political prisoners to sign letters in which they
renounce their beliefs. The local press quoted Justice Minister
Park Sang-cheon as saying, ``Requiring violators of the National
Security Law to abandon their ideology and beliefs goes against
constitutionally guaranteed freedom of conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government will still require violators of the security
law to abide by it. The law has been used to jail labor leaders and
those caught listening to North Korean radio broadcasts or
distributing leaflets about Communism.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists said that requirement undercuts the
government's amnesty plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no fundamental difference between the current policy
of denouncing one's ideological beliefs and the proposed policy of
receiving pardon by agreeing not to violate Korean laws,'' said Seo
Joon-shik, a former political prisoner who heads the Sarangbang
Group for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Seo also asserted that the government was trying to use the
release to turn attention from the nation's economic troubles,
including record rates of bankruptcy, bank closures and
unemployment, which is rising at an average rate of 8,000 people a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Woo's case had become something of a cause celebre among rights
activists. One of eight North Koreans caught in the act of
espionage, Woo has been tortured and deprived of the most basic
human necessities, including companionship, rights groups say.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to obtain a renunciation of his beliefs, the South
Korean government once allowed an uncle to visit him, but to no
avail. The uncle was Woo's only visitor during his long stay in
prison.

AT YOSEMITE, TIME TO BE LIBERATED FROM YOUR CAR
</HEADLINE>

By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOSEMITE _ Even if you were content never to leave the inside of
your car, a driving tour of Yosemite Valley would provide a
stunning profile of the world's best-known example of a
glacier-carved canyon.
</P>
<P>
   But wouldn't it be a shame to visit the home of such celebrated
landmarks as Half Dome, El Capitan and Bridalveil Fall without
having an (begin ital)outdoors(end ital) experience?
</P>
<P>
   Soon you may not have a choice.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, a ban on personal day-use vehicles is earmarked for
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overarching goal is to provide a more natural experience
for visitors to the valley,'' said Yosemite National Park spokesman
Al Nash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Yosemite Valley... it is 7 miles long and 1 to 2
miles wide. There are a finite number of places where we can put
vehicles,'' Nash said. ``Over the Fourth of July weekend, we will
have at some point in time bumper-to-bumper traffic of people
looking for a place to park. People don't come for that purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   With an average of 4 million visitors a year, including a
single-month record of nearly 722,000 in August 1997 and 60,000
last Fourth of July weekend alone, ``the Incomparable Valley'' can
take only so many cars.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, a public-transit system _ originating at the valley's
west entrance or outside the park entirely _ is planned to ship
visitors in by the busload and reduce traffic to a quarter of what
it is now.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, tighten up your bootlaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly look forward to a time when you will be even more
inclined to walk about the valley than you are now,'' said the
understated Nash.
</P>
<P>
   I guess not having cars will do that to visitors. And no time
like the present to get started on those famous footpaths.
</P>
<P>
   Following are a half-dozen Yosemite Valley ``cakewalks'' that
even those most attached to their cars can consider.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, slowly walk away from the vehicle. You can do it. So
effortless are these day hikes that you'll be back in the comfort
of your air conditioning and plush leather interior in less than an
hour, having hardly broken a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   All hikes described are wheelchair-accessible, with assistance
recommended for bumps, potholes and other inconsistencies in the
trails. Pathways with trailheads along the east valley's
shuttle-bus route are so noted with bus-stop numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Bridalveil Fall
</P>
<P>
   Starting point: Bridalveil Fall parking area.
</P>
<P>
   Distance: Half-mile round-trip.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking time: 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: A wonderful short hike to a spectacular cataract with
a spray that brought the image of a wedding headdress to mind for
early visitors. Plan on getting misted, or downright wet, at
trail's end during the height of runoff in April through June...
and, this year, well into July, due to El Nino's snowy fury.
</P>
<P>
   Lower Yosemite Fall
</P>
<P>
   Starting point: Yosemite Falls shuttle stop No.7.
</P>
<P>
   Distance: Half-mile round-trip. (Can be made into a
three-quarter-mile loop.)
</P>
<P>
   Hiking time: 20 minutes. (Half-hour for loop.)
</P>
<P>
   Comments: At 2,425 feet, Yosemite Fall is North America's
tallest _ and unparalleled when in season. The lower segment (320
feet) is easy to reach and offers refreshing summer coolness.
Extend the traditional out-and-back hike to a loop by taking the
short extension west of the fall that passes a placard flagging the
site of John Muir's first Yosemite Valley cabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miwok in Yosemite''
</P>
<P>
   Starting point: Yosemite Museum; Visitor Center shuttle stop
No.6.
</P>
<P>
   Distance: Loop of less than a quarter-mile.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking time: 15 minutes, but plan at least twice that to read
interpretive signs and visit displays.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: A place to go more to learn than to walk, the
self-guided historical trail introduces visitors to a reconstructed
Miwok-Paiute encampment in the Indian village of Ahwahnee. ``We
tend to forget that the earliest people here probably lived in much
greater harmony with nature than we tend to,'' said park spokesman
Nash. ``We have the tendency to either tame the environment or to
shield ourselves from it; that is the exact opposite of the first
people who were here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Changing Yosemite''
</P>
<P>
   Starting point: Visitor Center shuttle stop No.6.
</P>
<P>
   Distance: 1-mile loop.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking time: Allow at least 45 minutes to explore.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Did you know that ancient Lake Yosemite was 5{ miles
long and, in places, several hundred feet deep? It has long since
been filled by mud, sand and rock in a natural silting process _
one of the many ways in which Yosemite Valley has been altered.
Changes in fire management, how bears are no longer fed and what a
black oak woodland will look like in 125 years are also profiled
along the interpretive self-guided trail.
</P>
<P>
   Mirror Lake and Meadow
</P>
<P>
   Starting point: Mirror Lake/Meadow shuttle stop No.17.
</P>
<P>
   Distance: 2-mile round-trip.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking time: 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: No longer environmentally correct to dredge and
artificially manage as it was until the early 1970s, Mirror Lake
has all but become a meadow, just as Yosemite Lake did. When
filled, its pretty pond offers great photographic reflections at
the base of Half Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Floor Loop
</P>
<P>
   Starting point: Yosemite Falls shuttle stop No.7, but any of the
numerous vehicle pullouts along Southside and Northside drives will
do.
</P>
<P>
   Distance: Technically, a 6.5 mile half-loop and 13-mile full
loop, but only the most dedicated need make this anything but a
leisurely stroll along one or more short portions.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking time: 2.5 to 3.5 hours for half-loop, 5 to 7 hours for
full loop or as long or short as you wish.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: ``We don't necessarily look at the Valley Loop as
something that someone would do in a day,'' Nash said, ``but you
can get out and away from people and cars and traffic quickly.
There isn't a bad spot to pull out and get on a trail. Even if it's
only a few minutes, it will enhance your visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Arrive at the park early, by 10 a.m., and give yourself
enough time to complete all the trails you wish to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite Valley is 4,000 feet above sea level, the air is thin
and hikers are more exposed to the sun's rays. Use sunscreen and
drink at least two quarts of water for a day of trekking.
</P>
<P>
   There is no time limit on day-use parking, as long as you don't
sleep overnight. The two primary day-use parking areas are in the
east valley at Curry Village and near the Village Store, but any
open space is a fine place to start hiking.
</P>
<P>
   Entry to Yosemite National Park is $20 per vehicle, good for
seven consecutive days. A $50 Golden Eagle Pass is good for a year
at any national park.
</P>
<P>

recorded message line at (209) 372-0200 or its information service
at (900) 454-9673; write to Yosemite Association, Box 230, El
Portal, CA 95318; or visit its Web site at www.nps.gov/yose &QL;

COMPANIES CAN SHARE YEAR 2000 DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government signaled Wednesday that companies would
be allowed to cooperate and share information about how to fix the
year 2000 bugs in their computer systems without violating the
United States' antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department stated its policy in response to a
proposal by the securities industry to let Wall Street firms and
their computer-services suppliers share information on how to
handle the so-called millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was welcomed by the head of the President's Council
on Year 2000 Conversion as important for business in general.
``This is a significant action that is an important signal for
other industries,'' said John Koskinen, who was appointed earlier
this year as the nation's ``year 2000 czar'' by the White House.
``This removes a major obstacle to cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem is that on Jan. 1, 2000, millions of
computers that keep track of years as two-digit numbers will roll
over from 99 to 00 and treat the new year as 1900, not 2000. As a
result, countless day-to-day computer-based transactions, from
stock trades to the issue of Social Security checks, are in danger
of being disrupted, according to many computer-industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of using two digits instead of four for denoting
the years in dates originated in the early days of computing, when
electronic storage was scarce and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   How great a challenge the year 2000 problem will prove to be is
a matter of debate. Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche
Bank Securities, predicts that there is a 60 percent chance that
the millennium bug will precipitate a global recession.

 CHINA-CLINTON-COX   -1STLEDE  CLINTON HEADING SOUTH FOR SCENIC
ECO-TOUR, FLYING HOME FOR JULY 4
 &HT;     EDS: Jumps dateline to Guilin, where Clinton has now landed,
and reworks lede. Rest of story stands.
 &HT;     With CHINA-HISTBOX
 &HT;     By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUILIN, China _ After flying 800 miles south from Shanghai,
President Clinton landed here on Thursday for an eco-tour of the
mist-shrouded mountains and winding rivers that many Chinese
consider the most beautiful spot in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Floating in a riverboat along the Li River, the president and
his entourage were expected to celebrate China's gains toward
cleaning up the fouled waters of one of China's most poetic tourist
spots.
</P>
<P>
   With American TV cameras rolling, Clinton was due to discuss
global warming with Chinese environmental specialists, then board
the boat to visit carefully chosen villagers along the river route
that has inspired legions of Chinese poets.
</P>
<P>
   If image-conscious Chinese authorities have their way, Clinton
will press the flesh with peasant optimists _ people like Gao
Quanghong, 50, who told the official Chinese news agency Xinhua 10
days ago: ``With the river getting cleaner, many fish are coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Chinese and Clinton, who has openly criticized human
rights conditions in his host country, were determined to close out
his trip without generating new controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The White House confirmed that the guest list for Clinton's
meeting in Guilin with prominent Chinese environmental specialists
will not include the author Dai Qing, the country's best-known
environmental critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get everyone into this (meeting), but certainly we
are in contact with her,'' White House deputy national security
adviser James Steinberg told a briefing for the traveling White
House press.
</P>
<P>
   Dai, a longtime critic of the government plans to build the
Three Gorges Dam, was jailed for some months for her environmental
writings after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. When finished
in 2003, the Three Gorges project along the Yangtze River will be
the most powerful hydroelectric dam in the world. But the dam will
result in 66,700 acres of farmland being covered with water, and
almost 1.9 million people will be displaced.
</P>
<P>
   If the Li River boat trip goes off as scripted, Clinton will
hear how scores of polluting factories sprang up along the
riverside during and after Mao Tse-tung's 1958 ``Great Leap
Forward'' campaign to spread industrialization across the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But since Mao's death in 1976, provincial ``reform'' communist
leaders have closed 49 of the worst water polluters along the Li.
They have also built sewage plants that already treat 40 percent of
Guilin's waste water, according to an official Chinese tally.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's theme for his eight day in China was that ``the
Chinese must be a part of any solution to global environmental
problems,'' as briefer Steinberg put it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to expand on an idea he first enunciated in
his Monday speech at Beijing University: ``In the near future, if
present energy use patterns persist, China will overtake the United
States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases which are
the principal causes of global warming.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his daytrip to Guilin, Clinton was scheduled to wind
up his China visit in Hong Kong on Friday. On Friday night, he is
due to board Air Force One for the trans-Pacific flight that will
bring him to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington in time to
watch the dawning of the American Fourth of July on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign that the White House staff is already thinking forward
to American controversies, Press Secretary Mike McCurry allowed
himself the first riposte on Chinese soil about the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   When a correspondent asked at a briefing about Linda Tripp's
grand jury testimony, McCurry cracked: ``The president has been
concentrated on one trip, and it's China, not Linda.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry also announced an ambitious month-long round of Clinton
travel in America, taking him from the heartland to celebrityland.
It starts with a July 9 day-trip to Atlanta and Miami, then
continues with trips to Little Rock, New Orleans and Norfolk. His
last two announced trips are to Aspen, Colo., on July 25, and to
New York's Hamptons on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was taking steps to make Clinton's day in Hong
Kong Friday as bland and non-controversial as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Though the president was due to meet pro-democracy legislators
who are considered the opposition in Hong Kong, the White House
refused requests by CNN and other networks to let television
cameras record all or part of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In the most sensitive encounter, Clinton was scheduled to meet
Martin Lee, Hong Kong's leading democratic politician. Then he will
meet with a larger group of pro-democracy figures who seek to
protect the freedoms left by Britain when it handed Hong Kong back
to China one year ago after 156 years of British control.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting opposition leaders privately, without cameras ``is more
or less our standard practice,'' insisted briefer Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was among the 20 members of the Hong Kong Legislative
Council who were selected in democratic elections this spring.
Although democrats swept the elections, only one-third of the total
council members are elected. The majority are appointed by
pro-Beijing professional and social organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Shanghai, Clinton steered his way through one
more lengthy appearance on mainland Chinese television, this one a
low-key performance that was taped for airing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made several vague references to freedom and democratic
principles, but he didn't repeat last Saturday's sharp critique of
the 1989 Chinese crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this whole democratic process, in my view, is very,
very important to make society work when things are changing as
quickly as they are now,'' Clinton said at one point.
</P>
<P>
   When queried on America's role in the world, Clinton said that
one of his most difficult tasks is handling the nation's post-Cold
War power role ``which is temporary _ it won't last forever _ as
the only superpower in the world.''

TESTIMONY OF DYING MAN MAY BE TAPED, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In a decision that could broaden the use of
technology in criminal trials in New Jersey and eventually other
states, a judge ruled Wednesday that prosecutors can videotape the
testimony of a dying medical examiner who may not survive to
testify in seven murder cases, including four in which the
defendants face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Barnett Hoffman of Middlesex County Superior Court,
said that the testimony of Dr. Marvin Shuster, who is Middlesex
County's chief medical examiner and who is terminally ill with
cancer, was ``extremely central to the cases.'' Without that
testimony on videotape, the judge went on, the prosecution would
suffer a ``manifest injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   While videotaping testimony in civil cases is routine and
eyewitnesses in criminal cases have provided taped testimony, an
expert witness has never testified on video before the start of a
trial, legal experts say. If Hoffman's decision is upheld by higher
courts, experts say it could have a far-reaching effect on evidence
introduced in criminal cases around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman based his opinion on a New Jersey criminal practice
rule, common to many states, that allows testimony to be taken in
advance of a trial if material witnesses are unable to appear in
person because of death or disability. He wrote that county
prosecutors should be permitted to videotape Shuster because he is
the sole witness qualified to give first-hand testimony about the
cause of death in the various cases, one of the most convincing
pieces of evidence to prove that a murder has occurred. The jury,
Hoffman wrote, ``should hear directly from the person who performed
the autopsy when the results are such a significant issue in the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Iacullo, a lawyer for David Serio, an Edison, N.J., man
who was charged in 1996 with shaking his four-month-old son to
death, said he would appeal Hoffman's decision on the grounds that
the coroner is not a material witness in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution has retained at least four expert witnesses
aside from Dr. Shuster to testify on Shaken Baby Syndrome in our
case,'' Iacullo said. These other witness would not only offer the
same testimony as Shuster, Iacullo said, but would be physically
present in court to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers had also argued that pretaped testimony and
cross-examination would force them to decide what defense strategy
to pursue far in advance of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one case, we're not scheduled to go to trial for almost a
year,'' said Robert Obler, who plans to appeal the decision on
behalf of his two clients, both of whom face the death penalty.
``We're going to have to guess on what cross-examination to pursue
depending on what the evidence will be like in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman acknowledged in his ruling that a capital case was ``the
most serious case a lawyer can undertake.'' But, like many defense
attorneys in murder cases, those in the cases at hand have had
their files for at least a year, he noted. ``There is no reason why
an attorney who has been assigned a murder case, much less a
capital murder case, for over one year,'' he wrote, ``should not be
able to adequately cross-examine the state's medical examiner.'' nn

DOUBLE BILLING CITED WITH NEW YORK'S METROCARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a slap at the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority and its Metrocard system, Speaker Peter Vallone of City
Council released a report Wednesday asserting that nine out of 10
riders have problems using the electronic fare cards and that some
are double-charged when they switch to another turnstile.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Please Swipe Again, and Again, and Again and
Again,'' is based on 1,068 interviews with subway riders conducted
by City Council investigators, and showed that the vast majority
did not know they could be charged twice if, after unsuccessfully
trying to swipe their card in one turnstile, they tried it in a
second.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge
Gov. George Pataki, accused the MTA of underplaying the scope of
the double-charging problem and said the agency, which he pointed
out is controlled by Pataki, was blaming riders for very real
problems with the Metrocard system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transit authority needs to do much more to educate people
about the Metrocard,'' Vallone said at a news conference with
officials from the City Council's Office of Oversight and
Investigation. ``Riders should be warned that they can be bilked
out of an extra fare and told how to avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials acknowledged the double-charging problem, but
said printed material and a turnstile message warned customers to
``try again'' only at the same turnstile. (The possibility of being
double-charged is not mentioned by the turnstile message, however.)
They added that 70 percent of the subway system's riders used the
Metrocard and that fewer than one in 10,000 users complained.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kelly, a spokesman for New York City Transit, the unit of
the MTA that runs the city's bus and subway system, said Vallone
had exaggerated the extent of the double-charging problem. He said
exact figures for the problem were not available Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any new product, certain difficulties are expected,''
Kelly said. ``We have never blamed our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly suggested that Vallone was motivated by his political
ambitions. ``It is sad that Peter Vallone would politicize the
discount program that has saved our customers hundreds and hundreds
of dollars and has proven to be a universal success,'' he said.
``It is that time of year again; it's that season of the year to
try to win political points.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a
subway riders' advocacy group, said the MTA had made strides in
correcting the problem. ``It is clear that many people have to
swipe twice,'' he said. The agency ``did manage to minimize the
problem,'' he said, by changing the turnstile message from ``Swipe
again'' to ``Please swipe again at this turnstile.'' He added that
the agency ``could do more through brochures and things like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But when unlimited-use Metrocards are available, he said, ``this
problem will evaporate for a very large percentage of riders,
because you will have unlimited swipes.'' The MTA is to start
offering those new Metrocards, at $17 weekly and $63 monthly, in
three days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   City Council investigators said Vallone was supported by an
April 1 letter from David Goldenberg, the MTA's acting senior vice
president for customer services, to Catherine McAlvey, director of
the council's investigation office, saying: ``We have not performed
a double-deduction analysis, because we do not believe that one is
necessary. Only a small percentage of the customer contacts we
receive regarding Metrocards pertain to reported double
deductions.''

 &HT;    Three men's biggest servers advance
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Three men with the biggest serves in the
game _ and the man charged with mending England's wounded heart _
all advanced to the Wimbledon quarterfinals in straight sets
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Top seed Pete Sampras, the only American left in the men's or
women's singles draws, defeated unseeded Mark Philippoussis 7-6
(7-5), 6-4, 6-4. Ninth seed Richard Krajicek recovered from a knee
injury to breeze past Italian Davide Sanguinetti 6-2, 6-3, 6-4,
while 14th seed Goran Ivanisevic needed three tiebreakers to defeat
unseeded Jan Siemerink of Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time finalist Ivanisevic won 7-6 (12-10), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6
(8-6).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always difficult for me to play another lefty,''
Ivanisevic said. ``He is tough to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Henman might have been playing with the biggest burden.
England was eliminated from the World Cup in penalty kicks on
Tuesday night, and fans throughout the grounds were somber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think Tim will win?'' one woman asked. ''Seeing how we
lost the soccer match, we should win something.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans cheered for Henman, but still seemed in mourning. By
Friday, when he meets Sampras in the semifinals, the country should
have recovered to cheer the first British man to reach the
Wimbledon semis in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this position before, playing Boris Becker in
Germany,'' Sampras said. ``It will be tough. This event will
obviously be watched all over England and all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Seles, Davenport ousted: Top seed Martina Hingis reached the
semifinals and was joined by three players at least nine years
older than her.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seed Lindsay Davenport and emotional favorite Monica
Seles both were upset by older players Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteenth-seed Nathalie Tauziat beat Davenport easily, winning
6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I didn't play my best, but that's by far the best
she's ever played against me,'' said Davenport, who was pleased
with her best Wimbledon performance since 1994,
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried for about two minutes and then I took a shower, and I
came out and sat down. There was nothing I could do today.''
</P>
<P>
   Unseeded Natasha Zvereva upset Seles 7-6, 7-4, 6-2. Seles was
somber about the loss, saying she got tense early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't put two points together today from the start of the
match, and it never got better after that,'' Seles said.
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva and Tauziat play in the first semifinal today, followed
by Hingis against doubles partner Jana Novotna. Hingis defeated
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lobs: In mixed doubles, Serena Williams and Max Mirnyi
defeated Brian MacPhie and Davenport 4-6, 7-4 (7-4), 6-2, and Venus
Williams and Justin Gimelstob beat Devin Bowen and Rika Hiraki 6-3,
6-4. ... Lauren Kalvaria of Indiatlantic, who trains in Boca Raton,
lost her first-round match in girls singles.

NO HIDING FOR METS' ROJAS IN 15-10 LOSS TO BLUE JAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Last Friday night, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine walked
to the mound in the top of the seventh inning and summoned reliever
Mel Rojas. The Mets were leading the Yankees, 4-3, but there were
two runners on base, only one out and Paul O'Neill was at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough assignment, and Rojas responded by allowing a
three-run home run on his first pitch, putting the Yankees ahead
for good and leaving Valentine to endure a weekend of questions
about why he used the struggling Rojas in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Valentine tried again. With the Mets leading Toronto,
8-7, on Canada Day, he brought Rojas in to start the bottom of the
eighth. And in his first appearance since the Yankee game, Rojas
responded by allowing a three-run home run to shortstop Alex
Gonzalez that put the Blue Jays ahead for good in an eventual 15-10
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the third time is a charm, but Valentine isn't prepared to
find out. As he surveyed the wreckage after Wednesday's game,
Valentine said he would not be calling on Rojas in another key
situation any time soon, and that he had already told the
31-year-old right-hander that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until we see some better quality out of him,'' Valentine
said of a player on whom the Mets had pinned considerable hopes
this season. ``He has to re-earn his stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas faced five batters Wednesday and retired none of them,
giving up two singles, a walk, a hit batter and the home run. He
was relieved by John Hudek, who endured his own misery as Toronto
went on to score eight runs in the eighth and turn a seesaw game
into a rout.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen was supposed to be a source of strength for the Mets
(43-36) this season. But on a day when starter Hideo Nomo had to
leave after three innings because of a lower back strain, the Mets'
relievers combined to squander three leads, give up 12 runs and
reinforce the notion that the team does not have enough capable
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been a bigger disappointment in this regard than
Rojas, who was a premier reliever for several seasons with the
Montreal Expos, had a nightmarish 1997 with the Chicago Cubs and
Mets and was expected to rebound and become the dependable setup
man for closer John Franco this season.
</P>
<P>
   That, obviously, isn't what's happening. Instead, in his last
six appearances, Rojas (3-2) has allowed 13 earned runs in just
four and two-third innings, which translates into an earned run
average of 25.07. For the season, Rojas' ERA is now 5.23.
</P>
<P>
   No one on the Mets has an adequate explanation of why Rojas is
pitching so poorly, and the reliever himself didn't stay around
after Wednesday's game to talk to reporters. But it seems clear
that ever since the Mets traded the right-handed reliever Greg
McMichael to the Dodgers on June 4 as part of the deal to acquire
Nomo, there has been more pressure on Rojas to perform, and that he
has not responded well.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if Valentine has much to choose from at the moment.
On the days his starters cannot get games to Franco, the Mets, who
have now lost four of their last five games, have usually lost. &QL;

EXCERPTS FROM COURT'S DISMISSAL OF HUBBELL TAX EVASION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Wednesday's ruling by
Judge James Robertson of U.S. District Court here dismissing the
tax evasion case that was filed by Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr against Webster Hubbell, a former Justice Department
official and a friend of President Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Before this Court are four motions challenging the indictment in
this tax evasion case.
</P>
<P>
   One of the motions seeks dismissal of the entire case and will
be granted: The charges in the indictment neither relate to nor
arise out of the subject of the original grant of jurisdiction to
the independent counsel, and the referral order under which the
independent counsel is proceeding impermissibly expands that
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   A second motion, dispositive only as to defendant Webster L.
Hubbell, will also be granted: The independent counsel concedes
that he built his case against Mr. Hubbell using 13,120 pages of
records that Mr. Hubbell was compelled to produce under subpoena.
That use violates the immunity given to Mr. Hubbell by the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants' third and fourth motions are to dismiss the mail and
wire fraud charges and to dismiss a single charge of violation of
the ``omnibus'' provision of the criminal tax code. Those motions
will be denied.

<P>
   I. MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT AS BEYOND THE AUTHORITY OF
</P>
<P>
   THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel's Authority &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsels are appointed pursuant to the Ethics in
Government Act. Congress carefully limited their authority, as well
as that of the special division that appoints them. Those very
limitations were identified by the Supreme Court as critical to the
constitutionality of the Ethics in Government Act. The defendants
in this case assert that the special division exceeded the
statutory and constitutional limits on its authority by referring
the subject matter of this case to independent counsel Kenneth
Starr. They are correct.
</P>
<P>
   This independent counsel was appointed by the special division,
upon the application of the Attorney General, on Aug. 5, 1994. The
appointing order (the original grant) gave him authority to
investigate (W)hether any individuals or entities have committed a
violation of any Federal criminal law, . . . relating in any way to
James B. McDougal's, President William Jefferson Clinton's, or Mrs.
Hillary Rodham Clinton's relationships with Madison Guaranty
Savings &AMP; Loan Association, Whitewater Development Corporation, or
Capital Management Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The original grant also gave the independent counsel the
authority to investigate other allegations or evidence of violation
of any Federal criminal law . . . by any person or entity developed
during the independent counsel's investigation referred to above
and connected with or arising out of that investigation. The
original grant gave the independent counsel further authority to
investigate any violation of 28 U.S.C. 1826, or any obstruction of
the due administration of justice, or any material false testimony
or statement in violation of Federal criminal law, in connection
with any investigation of the matters described above, as well as
the activities of any co-conspirators and/or aiders and abettors
involved in any of the matters described above. Finally, presumably
in order to ensure that the independent counsel was given all the
authority he must have under the Ethics in Government Act, the
special division recited the exact language of 593(b)(3): (The
special division) shall assure that the independent counsel has
adequate authority to fully investigate and prosecute the subject
matter with respect to which the Attorney General has requested the
appointment of the independent counsel, and all matters related to
that subject matter. Such jurisdiction shall also include the
authority to investigate and prosecute Federal crimes . . . that
may arise out of the investigation or prosecution of the matter
with respect to which the Attorney General's request was made,
including perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence,
and intimidation of witnesses. . . .
</P>
<P>
   One month after the original grant . . . the independent counsel
requested, and the special division granted, the referral to his
office of certain matters dealing with defendant Webster L.
Hubbell. Specifically, the special division expressly expanded the
independent counsel's jurisdiction to include: (W)hether Webster L.
Hubbell . . . violated any Federal criminal law (including mail
fraud and criminal tax violations) in his billing or expense
practices while a member of the Rose Law Firm, and all matters
arising from that investigation to the same extent as all other
criminal matters arising under the jurisdiction set forth in the
original order.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel thereafter brought charges against Mr.
Hubbell for fraudulent billing while he was in the private practice
of law in Little Rock, Ark., and for income tax evasion. Mr.
Hubbell pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud and tax evasion
on Dec. 6, 1994. He was sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment and
was incarcerated from Aug. 7, 1995, to Feb. 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 6, 1998, the special division granted another request by
the independent counsel for referral of matters involving Mr.
Hubbell. It is this second Hubbell referral that gives rise to the
present case and this motion. It gave the independent counsel
authority to investigate (i) whether Webster L. Hubbell or any
individual or entity violated any criminal law, including but not
limited to criminal tax violations and mail and wire fraud,
regarding Mr. Hubbell's income since Jan. 1, 1994, and his tax and
other debts to the United States, the State of Arkansas, the
District of Columbia, the Rose Law Firm, and others; and (ii)
whether Webster L. Hubbell or any individual or entity violated any
criminal law, including but not limited to obstruction of justice,
perjury, false statements, and mail and wire fraud, related to
payments that Mr. Hubbell has received from various individuals and
entities since Jan. 1, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury in this District handed up this indictment of Mr.
Hubbell, his wife, his accountant, and his tax lawyer, on April 30,
1998. All 10 counts of the indictment relate to an alleged scheme
to avoid paying the taxes Mr. Hubbell agreed to pay as part of his
1994 guilty plea and taxes on income Mr. Hubbell received after
leaving the Department of Justice in 1994. ..... The independent
counsel's first response to this motion was to challenge
defendants' right to question his authority. He said in his written
response, using the language of standing, that defendants had
identified no concrete harm that has accrued (or will accrue) to
them because the independent counsel is prosecuting this matter,
rather than the Department of Justice. The scope of this argument
was limited by the independent counsel's concession, at oral
argument, that a criminal defendant is indeed harmed by an ultra
vires indictment and that these defendants would have had standing
to challenge the independent counsel's jurisdiction if the special
division had not issued the tax referral. What remains of the
independent counsel's standing argument, accordingly, is the
assertion that the special division's tax referral is unreviewable,
or, at least, that it is not reviewable by a United States District
Court.
</P>
<P>
   That core argument requires analysis of the exact nature of a
referral order under 594(e) of the Ethics in Government Act: Is it,
as this independent counsel asserts, a nonreviewable discretionary
act? Is it, as two judges of this court have suggested, controlling
authority in this circuit, or at least precedent flowing from the
proper exercise of an appellate courts Article III powers? Or is it
a ministerial act, flowing from the special division's Article II
or III powers, that is reviewable on a proper challenge? . . .
</P>
<P>
   The special division in fact is not a court of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The special division hears referral applications ex parte, as
judges hear wiretap applications. And, like wiretap orders,
referral orders could not be immune from collateral attack or
appellate review. If they were, the effect would be to make binding
on affected individuals rulings that were never litigated in an
adversarial proceeding. . . .
</P>
<P>
   If the special division's 594(e) referral function is an Article
III function, it must be ministerial, rather than ``supervisory''
or ``executive,'' or it violates Article III. The special division
thus may interpret the independent counsel's original grant. It may
not expand the independent counsel's jurisdiction without the
consent of the Attorney General, which consent is required by
another part of the act. This limitation is constitutional, and, if
it is to mean anything at all, must be enforceable upon a proper
challenge. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The special division may authorize an independent counsel to
investigate matters that are demonstrably related to the Attorney
General's application for appointment. Morrison v. Olson. It
follows, and is undisputed, that the ``demonstrably related'' rule
governs referrals as well. The special division itself has stated:
A matter referred by this court, rather than by the Attorney
General, has to meet an apparently higher standard of being
``demonstratably related.'' . . . Relatedness for purposes of
referral under 594(e) depends upon the procedural and factual link
between the O.I.C.'s original prosecutorial jurisdiction and the
matter sought to be referred. . . . In the present case, however,
the reasons for the special division's decision to issue the tax
referral are unstated. It is impossible to tell whether the same
analysis was applied or what record was before the special
division. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In any event, and bearing respectfully in mind that it is only
the independent counsel that has intimate knowledge of the course
of the investigation, including witness statements, and of other
proceedings that may be ongoing before the grand jury, I must
determine whether the independent counsel has shown that the tax
referral is demonstrably related to the original grant. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Madison-Whitewater matters that were the subject of the
original grant and the tax matters that are the subject of this
case have nothing in common, nothing, at least, that appears on
this record except Webster Hubbell. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the independent counsel offered any real resistance to
defendants' submission that this case involves violations of other
criminal statutes outlawing a different category of conduct and
occurring on different occasions than those set forth in the
(original grant) of jurisdiction. The independent counsel's
explanation of how this indictment is connected with the original
grant was a recitation spanning six degrees of relationship. I find
the asserted connection too attenuated and conclude that neither
the tax referral order nor the indictment is connected with or
demonstrably related to the original grant. . . .
</P>
<P>
   When pressed to demonstrate the relationship between the tax
referral and the original grant, indeed, the independent counsel
always returns to what seems to be his default position: that he
has always been authorized to investigate obstruction of his
original investigation; that, pursuing that line, he investigated
Mr. Hubbell's post-conviction consulting income from entities
associated with the Clinton Administration at a time when Mr.
Hubbell clearly was under investigation, and known publicly to be
an important witness regarding Madison Guaranty/Whitewater matters,
and that he discovered these tax charges in the course of that
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   That default position relies directly upon the original grant
and effectively jettisons the tax referral order. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The argument is that, so long as the independent counsel is
investigating obstruction, he may prosecute whatever crimes he may
come across, committed by whomever he may come across, regardless
of whether the charges or the individuals are demonstrably related
in any substantive way to the original grant, and regardless of
whether he has found any obstruction. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It is not disputed that the independent counsel has jurisdiction
to investigate and prosecute such conduct. But his argument here is
that he is entitled to investigate matters that arise out of
investigation of matters that arise out of the original grant.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The controlling constitutional principles articulated in
Morrison would be offended by permitting the independent counsel to
tack these tax charges onto the original grant on the theory that
they arose out of an apparently unsuccessful investigation of
allegations that Mr. Hubbell was involved in an obstruction of the
original Whitewater investigation. Defendants have argued, without
any effective response from the independent counsel, that his
position, if adopted, would allow the independent counsel to stray
in as many directions and . . . as far in any given direction as
(his) energy and zeal might take him. . . . (T)he Attorney General,
when ceding a piece of the Justice Department's jurisdiction, would
have no way of knowing how much jurisdiction the independent
counsel might later take.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrable relationship requirement will not support the
prosecution of factually unrelated charges whose only connection to
the original grant is that they arose out of an obstruction
investigation, which in turn arose out of the original grant.
</P>
<P>
   Had the independent counsel applied for a referral from the
Attorney General under 594(e), . . . or asked the Attorney General
to petition the special division to expand his jurisdiction under
593(c), as he did in the investigation of the matters involving
Monica Lewinsky, he might have received proper authority or at
least unreviewable authority to prosecute these charges. As it is,
however, the indictment must be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, 1996, after the independent counsel had successfully
prosecuted Webster Hubbell under the billings referral, and while
Mr. Hubbell was still in prison, the independent counsel served him
with a subpoena commanding the production of all his business,
financial, and tax records from Jan. 1, 1993, to the date of the
subpoena. Mr. Hubbell refused to comply, invoking his Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The independent
counsel thereupon moved for, and the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Arkansas granted, an order compelling
production of the documents. . . . The order also granted Mr.
Hubbell immunity to the extent allowed by law. Mr. Hubbell complied
with that order and produced 13,120 pages of documents to the
independent counsel. While the original purpose of the subpoena was
to investigate allegations of obstruction of justice, the
independent counsel brought no obstruction charges. Instead, and
the independent counsel concedes this important point, he used the
contents of these documents to identify and develop evidence that
led to this prosecution. Webster Hubbell now invokes the use
immunity given to him with the order to compel production and moves
to dismiss the charges against him or, in the alternative, for a
Kastigar hearing to determine whether the independent counsel has
impermissibly used any of his immunized testimony against him.
</P>
<P>
   The use and derivative use immunity statute provides that, where
a witness validly asserts the privilege against self-incrimination
and is given use immunity, the witness may not refuse to testify,
but no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or
any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony
or other information) may be used against the witness in any
criminal case except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false
statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The requirement of 6002 that ``no information directly or
indirectly derived from (immunized) testimony or other information
(gained through a grant of immunity)'' may be used against an
immunized witness, and Kastigar's prohibition on any use of
immunized testimony, have been strictly adhered to in this circuit.
. . . In United States v. North, the court held that the
prosecution of Oliver North might be infirm even though the
prosecution had sealed its evidence with the court before the
defendant gave his immunized Congressional testimony. The problem,
the court held, was the possibility that witnesses against the
defendant might have seen his immunized testimony on television and
allowed it to taint their own trial testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel has indicated that a Kastigar hearing is
unnecessary because he will make no bones about the fact that (he)
did use the information provided by Mr. Hubbell pursuant to the
production immunity. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's argument in opposition to the motion
to dismiss starts, not with 6002 or with Kastigar, but from the
premise that the contents of voluntarily prepared documents are
never protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege.
</P>
<P>
   From this premise, which is beyond dispute, the independent
counsel contends that only Mr. Hubbell's act of producing the
documents needed to be immunized, that, to the extent allowed by
law, language of the immunity order extended only to the act of
production, and that it was accordingly legitimate for the
independent counsel to use the documents themselves, and their
contents, to discover and build his case against Mr. Hubbell. He
asserts that all the documents, and all the information derived
from them, may be used against Mr. Hubbell at trial and that the
United States is free to use the records' contents to create a link
between the defendant and the records, but only so long as the
factfinder is never told that it was Mr. Hubbell who produced the
documents. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel does not claim that he knew any of the
facts relevant to the charges in this indictment at the time of the
subpoena: He conceded at oral argument that he learned of the
Bridgeport Group, the F.B.O. account at the Pulaski County Bank,
and the pension account check swap charged in the indictment only
through the documents. The subpoena itself was so broad as to belie
any previous knowledge of those allegations. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the independent counsel was not even pursuing tax
evasion charges at the time of the subpoena. The independent
counsel does not and at oral argument conceded that he could not,
claim that these documents would have been obtained by means of a
search warrant based on probable cause. Independent counsel
asserted at oral argument that he could have gotten a Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet on Mr. Hubbell, subpoenaed the individual banks . . .
gone to the papers he filed with the IRS . . . the accountant . . .
(and) his credit card companies. He did not explain, however, how
he would have known what to look for in order to find such things
as the Pulaski County Bank account, which was not even in Mr.
Hubbell's name. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Amendment implications of compliance with a subpoena
like the one in this case were discussed in United States v. Fox.
There, the court held that a broad-sweeping summons seeking all
books and records of a sole proprietorship . . . appeared to be an
``attempt to compensate for (the prosecutor's) lack of knowledge by
requiring (the witness) to become the primary informant against
himself. It is precisely this sort of fishing expedition that the
Fifth Amendment was designed to prevent. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena served on Mr. Hubbell was the quintessential
fishing expedition. The independent counsel freely admits that he
was not investigating tax-related charges when he issued it.
Instead, he learned about the unreported income and other crimes
from studying the records' contents. His application for authority
to investigate potential tax violations by the Hubbells was not
filed with the special division until Dec. 31, 1997, 14 months
after the subpoena had issued.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hubbell's compelled production of documents allowed the
independent counsel to build a case against Mr. Hubbell different
in all material respects from the case for which they had been
subpoenaed. Mr. Hubbell was thereby turned into the primary
informant against himself.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to dismiss all counts against defendant Webster
Hubbell must be granted.

SHARKS GRAB SUTER AS TEAMS GO ON THE PROWL

<P>
   The Rangers say they are still trying to sign Mike Richter, now
that their veteran goalie has become an unrestricted free agent.
But they are hedging their bets by also negotiating with Curtis
Joseph, another veteran goalie, who is a free agent from the
Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Don Meehan, the business agent for Joseph, confirmed that
conversations took place with the Rangers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll talk to them again tomorrow,'' he said. ``Just initial
discussions, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of those all over the map Wednesday, but only
one big deal was officially announced. It came in San Jose, where
the Sharks signed defenseman Gary Suter to a three-year contract
that will pay him about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Suter, 34, earned $1.6 million last season with Chicago before
becoming an unrestricted Group 3 free agent. His contract is likely
to drive up the salaries of other National Hockey League veterans,
particularly other free agents who play his position.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them, Uwe Krupp and Jyrkki Lumme, are bargaining with the
Rangers. Krupp earned $1.5 million last season with Colorado; Lumme
$1.535 million with Vancouver. Krupp's agent, Roland Thompson, said
that the Rangers were among the ``six or seven'' teams that
interested Krupp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is comfortable with the management and with the coaching
staff,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Krupp played for Ranger Coach John Muckler when both were in
Buffalo in the early 1990s. As for the negotiations with General
Manager Neil Smith, Thompson said: ``Neil and I have chatted. He is
a player who fits the Rangers' needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Having played with the Islanders for three seasons after leaving
Buffalo, Krupp, 33, is comfortable with the thought of relocating
to the New York area, his agent said. But salary is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to supply and demand,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also are engaged in a bidding competition with the
Islanders and possibly other teams for Geoff Courtnall, a left wing
who earned $2.4 million last season with St. Louis and who will
turn 36 on Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Rangers have begun discussions with
representatives of the forwards Scott Fraser, Doug Gilmour and Ron
Francis. Fraser last played for Edmonton, Gilmour with the Devils
and Francis with Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, who earned $2.3 million last season as the Edmonton
goalie, reportedly turned down a multiyear offer from the Oilers
that would have paid him $4 million a season. Richter, who earned
$3.9 million last season, reportedly turned down a multiyear offer
from the Rangers that would have paid him $5 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-salaried goalie in the league is Buffalo's Dominik
Hasek, who will earn a base salary of $8 million plus a signing
bonus of $1 million next season. Hasek last week won the Hart and
Vezina trophies for the second consecutive year as the best goalie
and most valuable player in the NHL.
</P>
<P>

   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Gary Suter's signing with San Jose had a curious wrinkle.
Although he was thought to be property of Chicago until July 1, his
rights were traded last weekend by the Blackhawks to the Sharks for
a ninth-round draft choice, a deal that was not announced. This
gave the Sharks exclusive rights to negotiate with him before the
midnight deadline. Dean Lombardi, general manager of the Sharks,
said: ``Nobody knew we had the rights to him. The league told me
that in the future they wouldn't allow this.'' &QL;

JUDGE BLOCKS NYC RENT INCREASES, ASSAILING OVERSIGHT BOARD'S
CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chastising a mayoral appointee for what he called
secrecy and ``cynical maneuvering'' in withholding a report on the
impact of new rent laws, a Manhattan Supreme Court judge Wednesday
blocked rent increases that were to take effect for a million
stabilized apartments and lofts in the city in the year beginning
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Louis York ruled that the report _ a survey of tenants
who have moved to new apartments since the state Legislature scaled
back rent protections last summer _ should have been taken into
consideration when the city's Rent Guidelines Board voted last week
to increase stabilized rents by 2 percent for one-year leases and 4
percent for two-year leases.
</P>
<P>
   York stopped short of ordering the release of the report,
however. Instead, he gave both sides seven days to prepare for a
second hearing on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the rent board, Edward Hochman, has withheld the
report, which was completed by his staff in late May, on the ground
that it was flawed by using numbers from 1996, before the
Legislature made its changes, to gauge the increase in some rents.
The 1996 numbers were the most recent made available by state
officials, who record stabilized rents.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 rent figures were expected last month but have still
not been released.
</P>
<P>
   Hochman has also argued that the report was not necessary to
help the eight-member board make its decision because it simply set
increases for tenants renewing leases, not for those moving into
new apartments.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, the two tenant representatives on the
Rent Guidelines Board have accused Hochman, who was appointed by
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, of more political motives.
</P>
<P>
   The tenant representatives, Kenneth Rosenfeld and David Pagan,
say Hochman has suppressed the report because it could show sharp
rent increases in many parts of the city and prove politically
damaging to Giuliani's fellow Republican, Gov. George Pataki, who
is running for re-election this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the fight in Albany over the future of rent regulations,
Pataki advocated eliminating protections on all apartments once
they became vacant.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was not accepted, but landlords won a compromise
that allows them to increase rents by about 20 percent when
apartments change hands.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision Wednesday, York cited a section of the city's
Administrative Code that mandates that the rent board consider data
_ such as landlords' expenses _ that it is required by law to
collect and all ``other data as may be made available to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The report in question,'' he wrote, ``is precisely the kind of
report that the board should consider under this provision.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reference to the Giuliani administration's
reputation for exercising strict control over public information,
York noted that ``at a time when the legislative trend is to open
the deliberations of public agencies to public scrutiny by enacting
open-meetings laws, sunshine laws and freedom-of-information laws,
the trend in governmental agencies is toward further secrecy.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made it clear that he did not condone a maneuver by
Hochman in which, after declining to release the report at a recent
board meeting, he voted for its release after determining that his
vote would not affect the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The move was an apparent slap at the two vocal tenant
representatives, who later took Hochman to court to force the
release of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Goldfeder, the lawyer for Rosenfeld and Pagan, called
Wednesday's decision ``a victory for open government.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Taussig, a lawyer for the city's corporation counsel,
said the city had not decided whether to appeal.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ MAYOR RUDOLPH GIULIANI cannot complain that New York
magazine's latest batch of bus advertisements take his name in
vain. Unlike the ones the mayor wanted removed last year,
trumpeting the magazine as ``possibly the only good thing in New
York Rudy hasn't taken credit for,'' the new ads do not mention the
mayor. Not even by nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's a need to,'' said ELLIS VERDI,
president of DeVito/Verdi, the agency that created the new ads.
``In this case, New York magazine didn't seem to need the name of
the mayor, but the ads may speak to or imply his presence.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain the thinking behind this ad, which Verdi said
would begin appearing on buses next week: ``No dancing in bars. No
sex shops. No hot-dog vendors. So what do you do for fun around
here?'' Or this one: ``Worth jaywalking to the newsstand for.'' Or
a third: ``How a city full of know-it-alls got that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time around, the mayor and the magazine went to court.
The magazine said that the ads were an affectionate joke and that
the wording was constitutionally protected speech. Lawyers for the
city said that the use of the mayor's name without his consent
violated his privacy and was not protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Shira Scheindlin of U.S. District Court in Manhattan
rejected the mayor's argument, saying, ``Who would have dreamed
that the mayor would object to more publicity?''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Giuliani's press secretary, COLLEEN ROCHE,
declined comment, saying she had not seen the ads. When the one
that mentioned jaywalking was read to her, she said: ``That's not
exactly good grammar. Sounds like they need an editor.'' The
publisher of New York, AMY CHURGIN, did not return a call for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Unsung Talent
</P>
<P>
   WOODY HARRELSON, who went from playing the hapless second-fiddle
bartender in ``Cheers'' to action-oriented movies like ``The Money
Train,'' can sing too. Harrelson, a guest at a wedding reception on
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., grabbed the microphone and began a
rendition of ``Jailhouse Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He sang it like a pro in a funny, Elvis-y kind of way,'' said
JERRY BENNETT, the band leader. ``He was in tune, on time and
really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ono and Tibet
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ YOKO ONO was in the spotlight twice on Tuesday. First
she announced that she was giving $100,000 to Victim Services, a
nonprofit group that offers emergency assistance to victims of
domestic violence. She made the donation in memory of Linda
McCartney, who died in April.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ms. Ono appeared at the World Artists for Tibet benefit, at
the Day for Night Studios on the 18th floor of a building on West
26th Street, and rang a bell for peace.
</P>
<P>
   She began by facing the audience of 450 and saying that one way
to make a difference in the world was to make a wish. ``So I
brought my old wishing bell,'' she said, ``and I'll ring the bell
three times, and we will wish together.'' The crowd was silent.
</P>
<P>
   For those who preferred the sound of voices, there were
speeches. ROBERT THURMAN, a Columbia University professor who heads
Tibet House, a New York organization devoted to preserving Tibet's
culture, drew applause when he said that President Jiang Zemin of
China should meet with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is destroying itself by destroying Tibet,'' he said.
``It can save itself a lot of money, a lot of disgrace, and Jiang
Zemin can get himself a Nobel Peace Prize if he pulls out the
military and invites the Tibetans to develop Tibet.''
</P>
<P>
   RINCHEN DHARLO, president of the Tibet Fund, which supports
exiled Tibetans, said he was thrilled with President Clinton's
China trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is for President Jiang Zemin to reciprocate,''
he said.

VALLONE REVISES CAMPAIGN FINANCE MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, has revised
and expanded his plan to overhaul the city's campaign finance
rules, trying anew to forge a consensus after an earlier version
divided the Council's leadership and was criticized by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani as too tepid.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker is to introduce new legislation Thursday that would
lower the contribution limits for city campaigns, require
transition and inaugural committees to abide by many of the same
rules as campaign committees, and prohibit elected officials from
appearing in city-financed advertisements when they are up for
election.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone has also sought to fashion a compromise on his earlier
proposal to prohibit candidates from accepting contributions from
corporations, a measure that had been opposed by some Council
members, who said it would greatly hinder their fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Under his new plan, the city would not ban corporate
contributions, but candidates who agree not to collect them would
get extra matching funds from the city treasury for their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration declined to comment on the plan,
saying it had not yet received it. The mayor has said in recent
months that he favors tightening the law, but has declined to say
how far he would go. But given the current enmity between the mayor
and the speaker, it is not clear whether Giuliani will support the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has set up a commission to propose revisions to the
City Charter, and commission members have said they are considering
changing the campaign finance regulations. So the mayor might be
loath to back Vallone's legislation if doing so might render some
of the work of his Charter commission unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's legislation had stalled earlier this year, hampering
his effort to cast himself as a reformer as he seeks the Democratic
nomination for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In reviving it, he has added provisions that some advocates for
toughening the laws have long sought, including the measure that
would provide additional city financing for campaigns. If adopted,
the plan would be the biggest change in the city's campaign finance
system since it was approved in the late 1980s in response to the
municipal corruption scandals earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dramatic step by Speaker Vallone and good-government
groups to make elections more accessible to the average person and
to keep undue influence out of the political process,'' said
Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   The city's campaign finance system is voluntary; candidates who
take part in it receive matching funds in return for agreeing to
ceilings on their spending and fund-raising, as well as strict
disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocacy groups hailed the new plan, saying it would
encourage candidates to focus more on small donors, rather than on
wealthy individuals who might have an interest in actions by the
city government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for democracy in the city,'' said Gene
Russianoff, a senior lawyer at the New York Public Interest
Research Group who is an expert in election law.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Schrader, director of Citizen Action of New York
City, attacked the plan. Schrader, whose group is helping to
spearhead a petition effort to put a more far-reaching proposal on
the ballot in November, said the contribution limits were still too
high.
</P>
<P>
   Under Vallone's plan, for example, the contribution limit for
the three citywide offices would drop to $5,000 per donor, from
$8,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal is weak, and the $5,000 maximum is woefully
inadequate,'' Schrader said.

NEW YORK DETAINING MORE YOUTHS BEFORE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An increasing number of New York City youths accused
of crimes are being locked up while they await trial, causing
overcrowding at juvenile detention centers and prompting officials
to begin holding boys as young as 10 on a prison barge designed for
adult inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The number of youths in detention is growing even though
juvenile arrests have declined sharply. Juvenile-justice officials
say fewer accused youths are being released after their arrests,
because judges and prosecutors fear they will disappear or commit
new crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the city turned the hulking Vernon C. Bain
Barge, anchored in the East River a few hundred yards from Rikers
Island, into a processing center for accused juveniles and a way
station for boys awaiting transfer to upstate prisons after being
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the move was meant as a temporary solution to a
problem that was not anticipated until a few months ago: The
population in the city's juvenile detention centers has swelled to
315 in recent months and on some days to 400, from an average of
276 youths a year ago. The barge is expected to hold up to 100 boys
from 10 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has used barges before to handle periodic
overflows of detainees from its jails. Although prisoners'
advocates have complained about conditions on the barges, they have
been used for adult prisoners as recently as 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, arrests of juveniles in New York City have declined in
recent years, according to state criminal justice records, and
there has been a steep drop in prosecutions of teenagers for
robbery, assault and drugs _ the three most common offenses _ since
1995, said Peter Reinharz, the city's chief prosecutor of Family
Court cases.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Hernandez, commissioner of juvenile justice, said the
population of youths in detention is growing because judges are
increasingly declaring children ineligible for release to their
parents' supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for prisoners said the increased detention reflected a
change in attitude by both judges and prosecutors, who are taking a
harder line with accused teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But Reinharz, who has overseen prosecutions of juveniles since
1987, said a growing number of accused teen-agers are simply
believed likely to commit more crimes, or to fail to show up in
court, if they are released.
</P>
<P>
   The recent overcrowding has complicated plans to shut the
dilapidated, 42-year-old Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx,
which has long been dogged by complaints ranging from abuse by
guards to vermin infestation.
</P>
<P>
   Two new detention centers, designed more than a decade ago, have
been built to replace the 290-bed Spofford center. One, in the
Bronx, opened in January; the second, in Brooklyn, is to open by
early August, when Spofford is to close permanently. But the two
have room for just 248 youths.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the overflow while the city enlarges each of those new
detention centers, the Department of Juvenile Justice has leased a
section of the 800-bed prison barge, which is managed by the
Department of Corrections. It will house up to 100 boys between the
ages of 10 and 16, said Hernandez.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He stressed that the agreement is a temporary one _ the lease
expires in 18 months _ and that children will stay on the barge for
no more than 10 days. Nonetheless, Hernandez said, the 625-foot
barge is in far better physical condition than Spofford.
</P>
<P>
   But child-welfare advocates criticized the use of a barge
designed to hold adult inmates. ``It's a prison,'' said Nancy
Rosenbloom, a juvenile-rights lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, one
of several critics who were given a tour of the barge last week.
``These cells are horrendous. You've got a heavy door clanking
shut, with a little, tiny space to look out, which will be too high
for some of the smaller children to see through.''
</P>
<P>
   From the inside of a cell, she added, ``it looks like Attica.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenbloom said the layout of the two cell blocks being used
would make it difficult to segregate newly arrested children from
convicted youths awaiting transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that we want to say anything good about Spofford, but at
least if kids are coming into the system for the first time,
they're kept apart and treated differently from kids who have been
convicted already,'' she said. ``Imagine putting 10-, 11-,
12-year-olds who've never been in the system before, with
15-year-olds who've been convicted of very serious acts.''

SURFERS HANG ON FORECASTER'S WORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD COUCH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON BEACH _ Sean Collins has surf forecasting down to a
science. And if his calculations are correct, Southland surfers are
in for a swell summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Seal Beach surfer and his partner, Jerry Arnold of
Melbourne, Fla., are the masterminds behind Huntington Beach-based
Surfline/Wavetrak, a surf information and prognosticating service
that provides daily wave data for surfers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   With information culled from weather service and marine charts,
satellite pictures, Navy reports, computer models, buoy readings
and a hundred surf reporters, Collins and his Surfline researchers
have set the standard in the specialized profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started off as a hobby,'' said Collins, 46, who grew up
surfing and sailing. ``I wanted to surf and travel. But a lot of
times we'd go to Mexico and there were no waves.''
</P>
<P>
   He began his first forecasting experiments in the 1970s,
compiling information from different sources. He built a reputation
and was hired by Surfing magazine, providing editorial staff,
photographers and surfers with inside information on where the best
waves were.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he helped start up Surfline and soon realized he had
the potential to turn it into a business. And business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Surfline services include subscriptions to Wavefax _
twice-weekly reports of specific areas via fax machine _ and
telephone lines with recorded information that is updated three
times a day. Last year more than 1 million callers paid for
Surfline reports.
</P>
<P>
   Surfline's most dynamic offering is its Web site,
www.surfline.com, which is checked out by more than 14,000 people a
day. In addition to nationwide and international surf reports,
live-video ``surf cams'' are mounted at some of the world's most
famous beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The all-weather, securitylike cameras created by Surfline
provide images of waves on both coasts of the continental United
States, in Hawaii, Mexico, Costa Rica and many other locations. The
lines of swell that one surf cam captured at Topanga State Beach in
early June were a sight to see on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's made a huge change in the way surfers look at the
sport,'' Surfer magazine editor Steve Hawk said of Surfline. ``It
used to be, 15 to 20 years ago, if I was going to go on a weekend
surf trip down to Baja, I'd hope there was going to be a swell. Now
it's turned that upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you can see things up to 10 days in advance. It's
maximized surf time.''
</P>
<P>
   Marine meteorologist Bob Burke oversees surf reporting and
forecasting for the National Weather Service in Oxnard. The Weather
Service puts out two surf reports a day for the area from San Luis
Obispo County to San Diego County. But Burke concedes that surf
reports provided by Surfline and other independent forecasters are
just as or more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean Collins does forecasting on a full-time basis,'' Burke
said. ``We put out a wider range of products and don't have one
person assigned to surf forecasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins' work is not only important to surfers. As a public
service, Collins helped some coastal cities _ Seal Beach, in
particular _ prepare for the onslaught of El Nino storms, perhaps
preventing property damage last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a leader and the pioneer in his field,'' Hawk said. ``He
invented the science and was the first to perfect combining
sources. He keeps extensive records of waves and their
characteristics. He's even trained some of the Navy's
meteorologists.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has developed remarkable accuracy, Collins has been
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes. There's an error factor,'' Collins concedes. ``There's
a ton of information out there. Each source can be different, and
it's tough for us to sort through data.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as his theories for the summer, Collins said, ``Southern
Hemisphere storms are a primary source and we're off to a good
start. There's been significant swell the past three months.
Indications show we can look forward to more of the same. We'll
also get good waves from hurricanes from the tropics off Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins went to college for two years but never imagined he
would become a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I taught myself to be one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Current events: &UR; !off! &LR;  Baseball has its Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y., and football honors its heroes in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing legends are hailed along the Huntington Beach Surfing
Walk of Fame, which will hold its fifth annual induction ceremony
July 30.
</P>
<P>
   The inductees for 1998, including home towns and induction
categories: the late Chuck Dent, Huntington Beach, Local Hero; John
Heath ``Doc'' Ball, 91, Eureka, Surf Pioneer; Peter ``PT'' Townend,
Huntington Beach, Surf Champion; Jack O'Neill, Santa Cruz, Surf
Culture; and Frieda Zamba, Flagler Beach, Fla., Woman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, which honors those individuals who have made
significant contributions to the sport and culture of surfing in
Southern California, will take place at 11 a.m. in front of Jack's
Surfboards on the corner of Pacific Coast Highway (1) and Main
Street in Huntington Beach. The public is invited. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ It was three in the morning last Sept. 6, on the street
outside Westminster Abbey. Thousands of people were sitting,
standing and sleeping on the pavement eight hours before the
funeral of Princess Diana would transfix the world from that same
spot.
</P>
<P>
   An American television reporter, who had flown in for the
funeral, stood on the sidewalk rehearsing for the biggest moment of
her professional life. Later that morning, she said in a voice
dripping with drama, the ``parade'' would pass right where she was
standing before Diana's body entered the medieval cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The parade, she kept repeating, the parade, as people who had
gathered nearby listened to her practice the standup routine. Her
words grated like red, white and blue finger nails scratching on a
tidy English blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   I listened in astonishment as the American way of turning
tragedy into carnival slammed into the English demeanor of stiff,
dignified formality.
</P>
<P>
   As she practiced, the reporter finally realized the mistake and
her parade became Diana's funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
   But at that unforgettable moment in history the reporter touched
on a phenomenon that both frightens and excites the English, Scots
and Welsh, whom Americans lump together as Britons _ but of course
Britons and British are a political fiction created for imperial
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Americanization of Britain, which the blond, beautiful and
photogenic Diana inadvertently had promoted, is speeding ahead with
all the torque that modern technology, economic power and pop
culture can generate.
</P>
<P>
   When I left Jerusalem and Middle East reporting five years ago
to become the Cox Newspapers European correspondent based in
London, the Washington-London relationship was rubbed raw. The
problems were personal and political between Bill Clinton and
then-British Prime Minister John Major.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as I leave London for Florida to become an editor of
foreign and national news at The Palm Beach Post, a Cox newspaper,
Clinton and the new prime minister, Tony Blair, are mates and the
old fault lines have evaporated. But more complex differences have
slipped to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hidden diplomatic battles rarely exposed to public
view, Anglo-American differences are now fought on business,
technological, music and film fronts that reach from boardroom to
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Like most modern countries, Britain (the country of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland is real enough, but it's people are
not ethnically British) is caught in a crossfire between tradition
and revolution. And the United States is to some the villain and to
others the stimulus behind the changes that seem irresistible if
not always welcome.
</P>
<P>
   As many inhabitants of the British Isles rail against the
invasion of raw American commercialism, 96-channel cable television
and noisy displays of emotions, many others quietly embrace those
termites eating away at their culture, either because they realize
how inescapable those forces are or because they like them.
</P>
<P>
   The Mother Country across the pond, as the English refer to the
Atlantic, is changing whether the people there like it or not. Tony
Blair, the prime minister, is dragging his country into Paris,
Berlin, Rome, Amsterdam and Madrid because there is nowhere else
for Britain to go.
</P>
<P>
   Diana offers the most dramatic example of change. The way London
merchants and other scalawags hawk cheap Diana trinkets isn't quite
up-to-the-minute New York style, but Londoners are closing the gap.
Yet it is always helpful to remember that London isn't England
anymore than New York is the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of evolution, the monarchy is more like the Papacy than
democracy, but it too is changing to accommodate the changes in
society. And Diana in life and in death plays a large part in
awakening the royal family from its secluded slumber, and in making
society itself realize just how much it is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans who visit England for the first time expect to
find an extension of the United States. They are either
disappointed or excited by the differences they find. I was excited
by all those differences, some subtle and some stark, and I always
will be.
</P>
<P>
   What bothers Americans most is money or, to be more precise, the
currency exchange and prices.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as an American hits the ground his impression of England
is prejudiced by the fact that his dollar is effectively worth 50
cents. Consumer goods cost roughly twice as much as in the United
States, so buying power is cut again.
</P>
<P>
   I have an English friend who shops at hardware stores in
Nashville when he visits a relative in Tennessee. On a recent trip
he bought a ``For Sale'' sign for $6. He said a similar sign would
have cost him about $185 in a rural area southeast of London.
</P>
<P>
   Those circumstances alone are enough to send many Americans
packing before their scheduled return to their comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   The language, so close and yet so far from Americana, is another
irritant. A pervasive kind of bureaucratic formality nettles, until
it becomes clear that this is a fraying shield which allows
institutions to control the chattel and permits people to keep
their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, what passes for English reserve is really
small-town or insular shyness. You may have to initiate a
conversation, but usually when you do you will be rewarded with
stimulating information and insights.
</P>
<P>
   The subtleties of language rather than the obvious differences
are difficult to master and to grasp them requires a good ear and
attentiveness to reactions.
</P>
<P>
   To an Englishman a dinner that is ``quite'' good isn't good at
all, but to an American that would be better than average.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to carve a niche in any foreign country. It takes
time to know people and for them to get to know you. But there is
no point in working abroad if you don't try to know and understand
the people everywhere you live and travel.
</P>
<P>
   I lived in the Swiss Cottage area of North London for two years,
and it took a whole 12 months before the newsstand owner where I
went every morning to buy newspapers would say anything more than
``hello'' or ``mornin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Swiss Cottage is filled with foreigners, people who come and go,
so the newsagent figured I would vanish in a few months. He didn't
want to waste time talking to a transient.
</P>
<P>
   Even my attempts to break down that wall of reticence were fun.
And when we finally connected, I made a friend who told me about
his life and travels and who wanted to hear about mine.
</P>
<P>
   After I moved to the Isle of Dogs, also called the Docklands, in
East London, I used to stop by the Swiss Cottage news shop whenever
I was in that area just to have a friendly conversation and find
out what was new in North London.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the southern tip of the Isle of Dogs, on the north
side of the Thames River across from the old London village of
Greenwich, where I learned to love the English.
</P>
<P>
   The Thames, with its 22-foot tidal wash on each bank, throbs
like an aorta as it pushes through London and pumps life into the
city life. At high tide it's a moving lake rushing westward from
the North Sea. At low tide, it's a modest river flowing from gentle
western hills to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that to love the English you must know them first and
that knowledge comes through their pubs, the lifeline of English
society, and for that matter of Scottish, Welsh and Irish societies
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Pubs are not simply drinking places, although for sure they are
that. They are confessionals, and homes for people whose drinking
mates are often closer than family. They are places where people
with cracks in their lives go to heal before moving on, to another
pub.
</P>
<P>
   Pubs are operated by guv'nors, or publicans, like Reg, Eliza and
their wonderful daughter, 10-year-old Emma, who live upstairs at
the Ferry House Pub on the Thames across from Greenwich Mean Time
on the Isle of Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard customers say they consider the pub the guv'nor's
front room or parlor, and anyone who starts to raise hell had
better watch out for the clientele because trouble isn't tolerated
in the guv'nor's house.
</P>
<P>
   Pubs have other rules, too, and these are understood
instinctively by everyone, except foreigners who must learn them.
</P>
<P>
   It is taboo to discuss either politics or religion in a pub. Not
even harmless discussion is permitted because, everyone agrees,
nothing about those two subjects remains harmless when suds are in
the mix.
</P>
<P>
   East London is rich in history, in language, people and trouble,
poorer in material terms, but it's the wealth that's unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Irish, East Londoners love nicknames, and irony is
their second language. ``Here's a question for the Yank.'' This is
``Lofty'' speaking at the Ferry House Pub. Lofty is excited because
he's somehow found an advance copy of the questions for Quiz Night.
</P>
<P>
   Quiz Night arrives each Monday in the winter, when teams from
neighborhood pubs travel to other pubs to engage in a formal
intellectual competition, complete with prepared questions and
answers, league standings and grub for the evening. Quiz Night is
far more popular than darts.
</P>
<P>
   Lofty wants to know which U.S. presidents are carved on Mt.
Rushmore. I tell him (you can look it up), and Lofty and his mates
applaud. I am asked all the questions about America, and when I
answer questions about English history, Lofty is so impressed he
buys me another Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lofty comes up with a tough one. Who was the English poet
laureate in 1968?
</P>
<P>
   This sends everyone into deep thought. The pub is quiet for a
couple of minutes. Then Steve, the truck driver who with his mate
Richie ought to be a comedy team on television, says he has the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Cooper,'' Steve pronounces with a chuckle that makes him
bounce off his bar stool.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughs because Henry Cooper was a British heavyweight
boxer in the long ago, and everybody knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're wrong,'' says Lofty, with an air of informed wisdom.
``It was Alice Cooper,'' and everyone bursts into laughter again.
</P>
<P>
   The English can make a joke and they can take one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Why, I was frequently asked, didn't the Yanks get into the war
earlier? Why did we, the English, have to fight the Nazis alone for
so long? (The war, in England, is always World War II.)
</P>
<P>
   The question is asked with a mixture of humor and seriousness,
as if to say the United States let England down, that it was a long
time ago yet it's not entirely forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   I developed a stock answer to take the edge off, and it always
got a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   You guys, I say, weren't ready to fight with us in the big time.
You needed more training to raise the level of your game.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the worst sin you can commit in Great Britain and
Northern Ireland is to lump the English, Scots and Welsh together.
Although millions of Irish live in Great Britain, the Irish are
usually considered barely a cut above the Germans and the French.
</P>
<P>
   The Scots and Welsh have more in common with the Irish than with
the English, and they will be the first to tell you so.
</P>
<P>
   The only place you will ever hear anyone in Great Britain say
that he or she is British is among the pro-British Unionists in
Northern Ireland, and they are mostly Scottish Presbyterians.
</P>
<P>
   And the only reason the Unionists say they are British is they
don't want to be united with the Republic of Ireland, they are no
longer Scots and so in search of an ethnic identity they call
themselves British.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you travel to Great Britain or any foreign land,
go with an open mind and at least one empty suitcase that you can
fill with new ideas, impressions and cultural baggage that can be
useful anywhere and anytime.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It was three in the morning last Sept. 6, on the street
outside Westminster Abbey. Thousands of people were sitting,
standing and sleeping on the pavement eight hours before the
funeral of Princess Diana would transfix the world from that same
spot.
</P>
<P>
   An American television reporter, who had flown in for the
funeral, stood on the sidewalk rehearsing for the biggest moment of
her professional life. Later that morning, she said in a voice
dripping with drama, the ``parade'' would pass right where she was
standing before Diana's body entered the medieval cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The parade, she kept repeating, the parade, as people who had
gathered nearby listened to her practice the standup routine. Her
words grated like red, white and blue finger nails scratching on a
tidy English blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   I listened in astonishment as the American way of turning
tragedy into carnival slammed into the English demeanor of stiff,
dignified formality.
</P>
<P>
   As she practiced, the reporter finally realized the mistake and
her parade became Diana's funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
   But at that unforgettable moment in history the reporter touched
on a phenomenon that both frightens and excites the English, Scots
and Welsh, whom Americans lump together as Britons _ but of course
Britons and British are a political fiction created for imperial
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Americanization of Britain, which the blond, beautiful and
photogenic Diana inadvertently had promoted, is speeding ahead with
all the torque that modern technology, economic power and pop
culture can generate.
</P>
<P>
   When I left Jerusalem and Middle East reporting five years ago
to become the Cox Newspapers European correspondent based in
London, the Washington-London relationship was rubbed raw. The
problems were personal and political between Bill Clinton and
then-British Prime Minister John Major.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as I leave London for Florida to become an editor of
foreign and national news at The Palm Beach Post, a Cox newspaper,
Clinton and the new prime minister, Tony Blair, are mates and the
old fault lines have evaporated. But more complex differences have
slipped to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hidden diplomatic battles rarely exposed to public
view, Anglo-American differences are now fought on business,
technological, music and film fronts that reach from boardroom to
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Like most modern countries, Britain (the country of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland is real enough, but it's people are
not ethnically British) is caught in a crossfire between tradition
and revolution. And the United States is to some the villain and to
others the stimulus behind the changes that seem irresistible if
not always welcome.
</P>
<P>
   As many inhabitants of the British Isles rail against the
invasion of raw American commercialism, 96-channel cable television
and noisy displays of emotions, many others quietly embrace those
termites eating away at their culture, either because they realize
how inescapable those forces are or because they like them.
</P>
<P>
   The Mother Country across the pond, as the English refer to the
Atlantic, is changing whether the people there like it or not. Tony
Blair, the prime minister, is dragging his country into Paris,
Berlin, Rome, Amsterdam and Madrid because there is nowhere else
for Britain to go.
</P>
<P>
   Diana offers the most dramatic example of change. The way London
merchants and other scalawags hawk cheap Diana trinkets isn't quite
up-to-the-minute New York style, but Londoners are closing the gap.
Yet it is always helpful to remember that London isn't England
anymore than New York is the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of evolution, the monarchy is more like the Papacy than
democracy, but it too is changing to accommodate the changes in
society. And Diana in life and in death plays a large part in
awakening the royal family from its secluded slumber, and in making
society itself realize just how much it is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans who visit England for the first time expect to
find an extension of the United States. They are either
disappointed or excited by the differences they find. I was excited
by all those differences, some subtle and some stark, and I always
will be.
</P>
<P>
   What bothers Americans most is money or, to be more precise, the
currency exchange and prices.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as an American hits the ground his impression of England
is prejudiced by the fact that his dollar is effectively worth 50
cents. Consumer goods cost roughly twice as much as in the United
States, so buying power is cut again.
</P>
<P>
   I have an English friend who shops at hardware stores in
Nashville when he visits a relative in Tennessee. On a recent trip
he bought a ``For Sale'' sign for $6. He said a similar sign would
have cost him about $185 in a rural area southeast of London.
</P>
<P>
   Those circumstances alone are enough to send many Americans
packing before their scheduled return to their comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   The language, so close and yet so far from Americana, is another
irritant. A pervasive kind of bureaucratic formality nettles, until
it becomes clear that this is a fraying shield which allows
institutions to control the chattel and permits people to keep
their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, what passes for English reserve is really
small-town or insular shyness. You may have to initiate a
conversation, but usually when you do you will be rewarded with
stimulating information and insights.
</P>
<P>
   The subtleties of language rather than the obvious differences
are difficult to master and to grasp them requires a good ear and
attentiveness to reactions.
</P>
<P>
   To an Englishman a dinner that is ``quite'' good isn't good at
all, but to an American that would be better than average.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to carve a niche in any foreign country. It takes
time to know people and for them to get to know you. But there is
no point in working abroad if you don't try to know and understand
the people everywhere you live and travel.
</P>
<P>
   I lived in the Swiss Cottage area of North London for two years,
and it took a whole 12 months before the newsstand owner where I
went every morning to buy newspapers would say anything more than
``hello'' or ``mornin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Swiss Cottage is filled with foreigners, people who come and go,

want to waste time talking to a transient.

FERRY TO GO FROM NEW JERSEY TO FOXWOODS CASINO

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ The LeFrak Organization of Queens, in New
York City, and the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation have agreed to
offer a high-speed ferry from the Jersey City waterfront to a port
near the tribe's Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut, officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, the Jersey City Planning Board permitted Newport
Associates, a LeFrak subsidiary, to provide ferry service from
LeFrak's sprawling Newport development along the Hudson River to
New London, Conn., on Long Island Sound, about 10 miles south of
the casino, which is in Ledyard.
</P>
<P>
   The service could begin by late this month, said Yessenia
Correa, a Jersey City spokeswoman. The service has been approved
for three years, and the Planning Board also permitted a temporary
waiting area and gangway. Ms. Correa said additional stops are
planned for Glen Cove, N.Y., and Martha's Vineyard, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wissemann, a project engineer for Newport Associates, said
the ferry could travel up to 55 mph and would make the trip in two
and a half hours. The pier where the ferry will dock is three
blocks from the Newport PATH train station.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pequots said he could neither confirm nor
deny plans for the service. In March, the tribe announced that it
would run a ferry from the Chelsea Piers in New York City, but New
York state officials blocked the deal, declaring it a violation of
the pier's lease.

some distasteful strategies. Two or three years ago, he considered
selling part of his land to suburban-style developers the way
farmers have done all over the nation. He also considered turning
the farm into an agrarian Disneyland, inviting the public to pick
their own fruit and gawk at the vanishing ways of farmers. But he
rejected that, too. Now, Fraleigh has been able to shrug off such
possibilities because a white knight in June paid him hundreds of
thousands of dollars to bind himself to farm his 125 acres until he
retires, then pass it on to another farmer. By Joseph Berger.

mother, a nurse, had died of cancer at 51, and the house, in the

Miller and her siblings, all in their early 20s, had to move out.
That was in 1981. Ordinarily, that would have been the end of it.

YANKS' WILLIAMS IS BACK, FOR HOW LONG? 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams shook more hands in the Yankees'
clubhouse than grooms do at weddings as teammates welcomed him back
from his rehabilitation assignment in Tampa, Fla., and
congratulated him for being one of the five Yankees chosen
Wednesday for the American League All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   But there are indications that those salutations could turn into
goodbyes once the 1998 season ends.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Williams' agreeing to an $8.25 million contract and
avoiding arbitration, he requested that the Yankees have no
negotiations with him or Scott Boras, his agent, during the season
and stressed that he wanted to gauge interest when his pact
expires, a person familiar with the conversations said Wednesday.
General Manager Brian Cashman confirmed that Williams explicitly
asked to be left alone and that the Yankees have honored this by
not talking with him or Boras for more than four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that he didn't want to negotiate during the season
and that he didn't want it to be a distraction,'' Cashman said.
``He told me that he wants to test the free-agent market. I told
him I could speak for myself about that, but I couldn't speak for
my owner. If he changes his mind, we'd love to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is not likely to change his mind and Boras is
interested in getting his client on the open market to see how much
a team will pay a switch-hitting center fielder with power who hits
.300, is two-time All-Star and won a Gold Glove award.
</P>
<P>
   Williams brushed aside questions about his free agency Wednesday
and said that ``things will take care of themselves.'' Still, it
has become more obvious that Williams is curious to see what life
is like outside of Yankeeland and the request for no dialogue is
the first step toward leaving an organization he has been with
since he was 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed a desire to stay here, but he expressed an
extreme desire to see what his value is on the market,'' said
Cashman, who said he would defy the no-negotiation request if
George Steinbrenner ordered him to. ``He's earned that right. We
would love to have him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is on the disabled list with a strained right
knee, was joined on the All-Star team by David Wells, Paul O'Neill,
Scott Brosius and Derek Jeter. Wells, Brosius and Jeter are
first-time All-Stars; O'Neill made the team for the fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   Wells started against the Phillies on Wednesday night and is
scheduled to start Tuesday night for the American League.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely Williams will play in the game since he is still
strengthening his knee and since Steinbrenner would be incensed if
the 29-year-old got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who participated in batting practice and outfield
drills while wearing an elastic brace around his knee, has not
played since June 10. Cashman said the Yanks have planned for
Williams to rehabilitate at Class AAA Columbus or Class AA Norwich
on Sunday and Monday, which leaves open the possibility of
pinch-hitting in the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be really funny,'' said Williams, when asked about
the possibility of his first game back being the All-Star Game.
``But I think I probably have to get back all the way to playing
and being functional.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre said: ``I'm sure he wants to go. The first
priority is the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Williams knows the second half of the season is more
important than one All-Star Game. Whether or not Williams gets the
chance to appear in another one as a Yankee is uncertain since
there have been no telephone calls, no faxes and no formal or
informal discussions about a new contract. The Yankees offered
Williams a 5-year, $37.5 million deal before he signed for one
year. Boras wants $10 or $11 million a year for seven years. The
advantage the Yankees supposedly had in re-signing Williams by
being able to negotiate with him during this season does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, this takes the heat off us,'' said Cashman. ``I
can't talk to him. He won't let us talk to him. If he doesn't want
us to talk to him, we won't talk to him.'' &QL;

LAWYER FOR ASSEMBLYMAN SAYS ACTIONS WERE LEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The lawyer for Dov Hikind, the Brooklyn assemblyman
who is on trial for charges of receiving illegal payoffs from a
social services group, told jurors in his closing argument
Wednesday that prosecutors had concocted a false case by turning
``perfectly appropriate acts by an elected official'' into supposed
criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their claim of benefits to Dov Hikind and members of his
family are not supported by the facts,'' the lawyer, Gustave
Newman, said at the state legislator's trial in U.S. District Court
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's assessment clashed sharply with that of a prosecutor,
Elisa Liang. In her closing argument on Tuesday, after six weeks of
testimony, Ms. Liang contended that Hikind, D-Borough Park, and
another defendant, Rabbi Elimelech Naiman, had used the largely
government-financed social services group ``as their personal piggy
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Naiman is the former employment and training director of the
group, called the Council of Jewish Organizations of Borough Park.
The council was once powerful and politically connected, and until
the case that led to the trial, it ran programs like job training,
services for businesses and immigrants, and aid to the elderly and
to children.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the council by its widely used acronym, COJO, Ms.
Liang, an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, contended that
Hikind and Naiman ``were siphoning money out of COJO for themselves
and those close to them.'' She said the money was ``supposed to be
used for aiding the poor, lifting up the needy and helping those
who could not help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument on Tuesday and Wednesday, Naiman's
lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told the jury that there had been ``no
corrupt intent'' in any of the rabbi's activities when he was an
official of the council and ``no proof before you of any kind left
in this case that Rabbi Naiman personally benefited'' from the
council's money.
</P>
<P>
   Hikind, who has been an assemblyman for 16 years, is accused of
receiving about $40,000 of the council's money in return for
obtaining hundreds of thousands of dollars in state money for the
council. The prosecution says the payoffs to him were in the form
of payments for items like school tuition for his children and
expenses for family trips abroad and political campaign and
fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the trial judge, Charles Sifton, significantly scaled
back the case against Hikind by dismissing four of the six charges
against him: two for conspiracy and two for fraud. Sifton agreed
with the defense that the prosecution had failed to back the
charges with sufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also pared down one of the remaining charges, removing
accusations that Hikind had stolen or fraudulently obtained money
from the council. The judge retained in that charge only the
accusation that Hikind had ``misapplied'' the money.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge left untouched another major charge: that Hikind
had corruptly solicited and accepted payoffs from the Council of
Jewish Organizations of Borough Park. Conviction on that charge is
punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Liang on Tuesday had shown the jury a series of checks that
she said were evidence of payoffs. Newman, Hikind's lawyer, went
over the same checks Wednesday and challenged Ms. Liang's
characterization before a gallery packed with spectators, including
many of the defendants' Orthodox Jewish supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Newman contended, for example, that one check that Ms. Liang had
said was payment for tuition at a Jewish school for a child of
Hikind's had in fact been a permissible grant to the school that a
council employee had mistakenly listed as tuition. He held that
some of the council payments that prosecutors had said were made
for Hikind's political benefit had really been for nonpartisan
voter-registration activities that the council had been permitted
to participate in.
</P>
<P>
   Newman is expected to complete his closing argument Thursday
morning.

SHARPTON LAWYER EMPHASIZES CIVIL RIGHTS IN BRAWLEY TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ In his summation in the Tawana Brawley
defamation case Wednesday, the lawyer for the Rev. Al Sharpton
evoked the memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and
described the trial here as a test of the rights of civil rights
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been here for a greater purpose,'' said the lawyer,
Michael Hardy. He told the jurors that their verdict would
influence the extent to which leaders can criticize officials as
King did and, he said, as Sharpton did a decade ago when he spoke
for Ms. Brawley. ``Rev. Sharpton's business, if you will, `` he
said, ``was the business of civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy repeatedly referred to a Supreme Court ruling, which
governs the Brawley case, that protects public criticism of
officials by making it difficult for them to prove defamation. That
decision, the landmark case of The New York Times vs. Sullivan, he
reminded the jurors, came in 1964 in the midst of the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Reverend Sharpton did was what he always does, what he has
done for a long time,'' Hardy said. ``He came to the aid of a
family in need _ a young girl in particular _ and made a call for
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Steven Pagones, was an assistant district
attorney when Sharpton and two other Brawley family advisers
accused him of having raped Ms. Brawley in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Pagones was exonerated by a grand jury and filed his
defamation suit against Ms. Brawley, Sharpton and the two advisers,
C. Vernon Mason and Alton H. Maddox Jr. Ms. Brawley has never
appeared in the current trial, and it is the three advisers who are
fighting the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, in the first of what is expected to be four days of
closing statements, portrayed Sharpton as a noble leader and
Pagones as a vengeful man bent on undermining the advisers' civil
rights work.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating a characterization he has used throughout the case,
Hardy said that statements Pagones saw as outrageous slanders were
nothing more than an advocate's protection of Ms. Brawley, whom
Hardy repeatedly referred to as ``a 15-year-old girl,'' which she
was at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Hardy said, was trying to harm the civil rights
movement. Race, he told the jurors, had been part of the Brawley
case from the first moments when she was discovered after vanishing
for four days in 1987. And race, he said, remained in the case as
it was nearing a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about politics,'' he said. ``About Mr. Pagones'
own agenda to pay back Rev. Sharpton for having come to Miss
Brawley's aid and for having called for Mr. Pagones' arrest.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After seven and a half months, more than 100 exhibits entered
into evidence and dozens of shouting matches, the first of the
summations seemed to show that the participants are worn out by the
passions of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, who can be aggressive, was relatively subdued Wednesday,
and Pagones' lawyer, William Stanton, made few objections. Judge S.
Barrett Hickman spent most of the day deep in his swivel chair,
with his back turned to the jurors and his eyes closed. When a
court officer nudged the judge to say the jurors wanted a brief
recess, Hickman appeared startled.
</P>
<P>
   But with Sharpton sitting at the defense table, Hardy never
strayed far from the central message he has been trying to deliver
throughout the case: that this is a defamation case, not a rape
case, and that under the ruling from the Supreme Court Pagones can
win his case only if Sharpton knew that his words were false when
he uttered them or if he acted with reckless disregard of whether
his statements were true or not.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what he knew when he called for Pagones' arrest, the
lawyer said, Sharpton was ``reasonable and justified.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has done throughout the trial, Hardy sidestepped the
question of whether Pagones committed a rape. He called the grand
jury report ``questionable and in some respects a whitewash'' and
he left open the question of whether Sharpton might have been given
misinformation by Ms. Brawley's family or by the other advisers.
</P>
<P>
   One question for the jurors, he said, was ``did he know with a
high degree of probability that everything he was being told was a
lie?''

 &HT;    Florida fires could close roads to race
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH _ The smoke that smothered the Daytona area in
recent weeks has thinned and is expected to have no effect on
Saturday night's Pepsi 400 NASCAR race.
</P>
<P>
   However, roads leading to the track could be closed with little
advance warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to speculate on when we'll get this thing
under control,'' said Dora Maxemow, public information officer for
Largo Fire Rescue in St. Pete. ``Most of the fires are south of
Daytona, below New Smyrna to the Brevard County line. I don't
believe the race will be affected by the fires, other than some
fans may not be able to get here because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans have been here several days, their cars, trucks,
motorcycles and bicycles lined near the track, awaiting today's 6
a.m. stampede for choice spots within the 2.5-mile tri-oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't no fires and smoke going to keep us from this race,''
said Jerri Wilson, who arrived here Wednesday from Jacksonville
with 22 others in an old school bus. ``This is big, the first night
race ever here. Can't miss that.''
</P>
<P>
   The air at the track was smokey during the early morning hours
on Wednesday, track officials said, but the situation had improved
by 9 a.m. Fans are calling daily for updated information, said John
Story, the speedway's public relations director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are calling in droves about the fires,'' Story said.
``The perception outside of Florida is that the fires are around
the track. We tell them they're not close to the track but that
there could be isolated road closings.''
</P>
<P>
   One such closing occurred Wednesday morning, a section of I-95
below New Smyrna to the Brevard County line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most serious situation, involving fires, ever in
the state,'' Maxemow said. ``The first strike came on Father's Day
weekend, and we've had a thousand people involved in this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoke won't be a problem, although the smell is likely to remain
in the air, Maxemow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the Atlantic Ocean breezes, the smoke should drift
out of the area well before the race,'' she said. ``The smell,
though, probably will linger in this area for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR president Bill France Jr. said officials will keep close
watch on the situation, but he doesn't expect problems. And Story
said all systems are go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If race fans were in any danger,'' Story said, ``we would not
have the race.''

<P>
   RED HOOK, N.Y. _ Fraleighs have been farming the land here ever
since John Adams was president, forming part of an enduring rustic
tapestry of grazing cows, languid country roads and trees sagging
with fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet discouraging economics and mounting debts have at times
forced Dave Fraleigh, an apple and peach grower, to ponder some
distasteful strategies. Two or three years ago, he considered
selling part of his land to suburban-style developers the way
farmers have done all over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He also considered turning the farm into an agrarian Disneyland,
inviting the public to pick their own fruit and gawk at the
vanishing ways of farmers. But he rejected that, too. ``I enjoy
growing fruit; I don't enjoy being in entertainment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Fraleigh has been able to shrug off such possibilities
because a white knight in June paid him hundreds of thousands of
dollars to bind himself to farm his 125 acres until he retires,
then pass it on to another farmer.
</P>
<P>
   For Fraleigh, the instant infusion of cash will allow him to pay
off debt and buy 93 more acres. For Red Hook, it may mean something
far more valuable: one more lasting farm to help sustain a rural
sense of place far into the future.
</P>
<P>
   The white knight, in Fraleigh's case, was an environmental group
called Scenic Hudson, but similar programs have existed in 20
states for many years. Local and state governments and private
preservation trusts have been buying development rights to
farmland, permanently limiting the use of the land to agriculture,
to sustain their locales' pastoral character.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Scenic Hudson's program noteworthy is that rather
than preserving farms scattershot, the organization is spending
$2.5 million to preserve a cluster of seven Red Hook farms with
1,000 acres _ 16 percent of the town's farmland _ on the theory
that a rural area needs a critical mass of farms to resist
development pressures. Fraleigh, 44, said he would not have kept a
farm if everyone around him had sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to have a farm in the middle of suburbia,'' said
Fraleigh (FRAY-lee), who does not yet know whether his children _
Peter, 10; Steven, 8, and Sarah, 5 _ will want to farm.
</P>
<P>
   What the government and private preservationists do is have
farmland appraised for what it would be worth on the open market,
then for what it would be worth if it could be used only as
farmland. They pay the farmer the difference, sometimes more than
50 percent of a parcel's value.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if land in Dutchess County is worth $5,000 an acre
unencumbered but only $3,000 if limited to farming, then the farmer
would be paid $2,000 an acre. The farmer keeps the land, but unless
a court intervenes, the deed to the farm is restricted with a
provision that forever prohibits residential or commercial
development.
</P>
<P>
   New York state, in a program less than 3 years old, is now
spending $5 million for farmland preservation, providing grants to
selected municipalities willing to shoulder 75 percent of the cost
of development rights.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, which started its program in 1973, has spent $168
million preserving 234 farms, and Connecticut has spent $75 million
on protecting 169 farms. Some of the programs make use of a $35
million federal pot of matching funds created in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One million acres of the country's 945 million acres of farmland
are swallowed up every year, transformed into homes and malls,
according to the American Farmland Trust, a conservation group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Southern Dutchess County, about an hour and 15 minute drive from
the New York City line, was not too long ago a sleepy backwater of
milk farms and orchards. Like Red Hook farther north in the county,
it was the kind of place where, as Fraleigh's wife, Karen, likes to
say, ``I can't go into the grocery store without running into four
people I know on a first-name basis.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, the arrival of two huge IBM plants and the
emergence of corporate office parks around White Plains created a
thirst for housing, particularly in southern Dutchess. From 1969 to
1995, the last year for which figures are available, one of every
four farming acres in Dutchess vanished, leaving 615 farms with
113,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a farm has been sold, it never comes back,'' said Dave
Tetor, agriculture program leader of Cornell Cooperative Extension
in Dutchess County, which furnishes farmers with research.
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing of IBM earlier this decade gave a reprieve to
Dutchess' farmers, but the booming economy has made them brace for
the likelihood of another developer onslaught. Anticipating that
invasion, Scenic Hudson tapped $2.5 million it received from the
Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund for the Hudson Highlands and
used it for buying development rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger generation is seeing the cards stacking up against
them,'' said Steven Rosenberg, Scenic Hudson's director of land
preservation. ``They'll say: `What am I going to do? Go into mom
and dad's farm or go to business school?' If the cards continue
stacking up the way they do, they go to business school.''
</P>
<P>
   The preservation programs have helped not only landowners like
Fraleigh, but also prospective landowners like John Hardeman.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman, 45, owns a tiny seven-acre orchard with a roadside
produce stand just outside the village center. He could not afford
to buy substantial orchard land in Red Hook, where the prospect of
development had pushed prices above $5,000 an acre. So in 1989, he
bought land in Livingston, 15 miles north, and became what he calls
``a commuting farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   But that commuting may soon end. In June, Scenic Hudson bought
the development rights to most of the farm near the roadside stand,
173 of Dave Lown's 250 acres, reducing its value to the point that
Hardeman could afford to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Lown, 70, a fourth-generation farmer, is ready to retire and his
son and daughter have no interest in farming. He could have made
more money selling the land to a developer. But he says that he is
gratified that he can help keep the land the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather see it stay a farm,'' he said. ``I like to look at
trees and open land instead of all houses and traffic. It makes for
a nice rural area.''

 NETS FOCUS ON NEWARK FOR ARENA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With new ownership in place, the New Jersey Nets can turn their
attention to a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   A site has been selected in Newark that would support an arena,
said Sam Crane, president of the Regional Business Partnership, an
organization involved in the revitalization of Newark. With a 2004
escape window in the Nets' lease at Continental Arena in the
Meadowlands, Crane is confident that the city would be able to have
the arena completed by then.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark site is adjacent to Penn Station-Newark and
accessible by Broad Street and McCarter Highway, said Crane, who
scouted the MCI Center in Washington, the Palace of Auburn Hills in
Michigan, the Core States Center in Philadelphia and Gund Arena in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we looked at was the existing capacity of the streets and
rail lines to support the arena, plus other improvements that are
already funded and in place,'' Crane said. ``They don't need a new
highway, a new rail, or even new rail service. They are already
sufficient to support an arena today. They don't have to build a
new transportation infrastructure, which is a huge public cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ownership group, put together by the real estate
developers Finn Wentworth and Stanley Gale of Florham Park, N.J.,
now includes David Gerstein, who is a majority owner among the
Nets' current seven-member ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   Nets president Michael Rowe said the team will resume
discussions with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority
concerning an extension of their lease, which runs through 2030,
and the ways that Continental Arena could be upgraded, but admitted
that the new ownership, with the support of the New Jersey
businessman and philanthropist Raymond Chambers, will pursue the
Newark site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes years to build buildings, years to locate locations,
years to finance them,'' said Rowe, who added that the arena would
likely be both publicly and privately financed. ``We're going to be
here for a while. We know the initiative of the new group is to get
a new arena. They would like one in an area with a lot of mass
transportation, that is more than just an arena. The downtown
environment fits. They'd love to have an arena in Newark.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowe's description of an ideal arena describes the plans in
place for the Newark arena and would seem to rule out Continental
Arena, which has been hampered by a lack of mass transportation. A
Hoboken site, favored by the New Jersey Devils' hockey team owner
John McMullen, is likely to need a new road structure to
accommodate the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Crane said: ``There are a lot of questions of Newark versus the
Meadowlands, but my take is that Newark is a solution to the
Meadowlands. That complex could be more successful with development
around it. The Meadowlands would still be an entertainment and
sports complex; it would just do it differently.''

MOOG MERITS SERIOUS HALL CONSIDERATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, Andy Moog can wear a Fort Worth Brahmas
sweater to his Hall of Fame induction.
</P>
<P>
   A night like that won't come any sooner than three years from
now, but by then, Fort Worth might be that deep in the heart of the
man who is trying to boost hockey ``Where the West Begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the time between now and 2001, there will be much
debate on whether the former Stars goalie, who announced his NHL
retirement last month after 18 seasons, should go into the Hall of
Fame at all. The NHL has been nothing if not inconsistent
throughout its history, and that ``Garage League'' feeling has
caused more than just a few rifts. The fact that former league
president Gil Stein was inducted into the Hall on a controversial
vote in 1993 that later was overturned has forced the Hall to
toughen its standards, and there's a feeling Moog might get washed
out because of the stricter standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question that the standards have
been toughened and that everything is being watched very closely,''
said Scott Morrison, Hall of Fame president and one of the people
who will be able to nominate Moog for entry. ``That said, I think
Andy Moog is a definite candidate who will receive a very serious
look.''
</P>
<P>
   Moog deserves at least that. In fact, he deserves to be let in
on the first vote. The numbers of the cherub-cheeked goalie from
Penticton, British Columbia, say as much. The stories behind the
numbers say even more.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Moog finished his career with 372 victories _ seventh on
the all-time list. His winning percentage of .621 is tops among
goalies who have won 300 or more games. Moog appeared in four
All-Star games, once helped his team win the Jennings Trophy for
lowest goals-against average (Boston in 1990) and three times was a
member of a Stanley Cup champion (Edmonton in 1984, '85 and '87).
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is those Stanley Cup championships that will have
most voters turning a critical eye toward Moog's entry. In one
Cup-winning postseason (1984), he shared the goaltending duties. In
the other two postseasons, he was the backup behind Grant Fuhr. In
1985, he played in just two playoff games. In 1987, he also was
involved in just two decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Had Moog let that stand, had he finished his career as a backup
to Fuhr, then one could question his place in the Hall. It didn't
matter that he was winning more than 25 games each season if he
didn't play in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Moog couldn't live that way. Even though the NHL was pretty
much a dictatorship offering players almost no leverage, Moog found
a way to break free. While holding out between contracts, Moog
struck a deal with a grocery-store chain in Canada that paid him
$100,000 to play for the Canadian Olympic Team in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this creative escape, Oilers general manager Glen
Sather was then forced to trade Moog to the Boston Bruins. There,
Moog helped the Bruins to the Presidents' Trophy in 1990 for the
league's best record and also helped snatch the Jennings Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Moog also posted the lowest goals-against average in the
playoffs that season at 2.21.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing preventing perfection was that the Oilers
defeated the Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals, ruining Moog's
chance for revenge. Moog took the Bruins to the Eastern Conference
finals the next season and posted a career-best 37 victories in
1992-93. He then put together four strong seasons with the Stars,
including a career-best 2.15 goals-against average at the age of
37.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his time, Moog was always outspoken, always a leader,
always someone who looked out for the game. A vice president for
the players' association, he was instrumental in helping the
players win concessions during the 1994 lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just strikes you as a guy who really cares about hockey and
about the NHL,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, it will be the league's turn to look out for
Andy Moog. He'll probably still be down in Texas, where he is part
owner of the Western Professional Hockey League's Fort Worth
Brahmas, trying to fashion the club into a champion, or possibly
working with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   If _ no, make that when _ the Hall of Fame comes looking for
him, they know where to find him.

STARS KEEP CARBONNEAU, LUDWIG; WOO VETERAN CLARK 
HEADLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Stars announced yesterday they will be keeping two of their
veteran players. And it seems only a matter of time before they add
another veteran to the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Both Guy Carbonneau and Craig Ludwig have agreed to terms for
one-year contracts with the Stars, who spent much of the first day
of unrestricted free agency yesterday wooing veteran Wendel Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau, 38, and Ludwig, 37, found fresh legs and new drive
as part of a Stars team that won the Presidents' Trophy and
advanced to the Western Conference finals before losing to the
Detroit Red Wings. The Stars are hoping they can do the same thing
with Clark, a 31-year-old who has been hampered by injuries for the
past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see in him, potentially, a guy who could get back up to
where he was, if he's surrounded by the right people,'' Stars
general manager Bob Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was drafted first overall in 1985 by the Toronto Maple
Leafs and had his best seasons with that team, scoring 34 goals in
1985-86, 37 in 1986-87 and 46 in 1993-94. After stints with the
Quebec Nordiques and New York Islanders, he returned to Toronto in
1996 and hoped to end his career with the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Toronto's management told Clark, an unrestricted free
agent who made $2.3 million last season, to look around and get
back to them in a couple of weeks in hopes of getting Clark to take
a lower salary.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have decided not to re-sign either Benoit Hogue ($1.25
million) or Greg Adams ($1.55 million), giving the team money to
work with in that left wing slot. So, the thought is the Stars
would be willing to pay more for Clark than Toronto or the Edmonton
Oilers, who also are interested.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's agent, Don Meehan, said yesterday Clark is interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to talk more \Rtoday,\S but, yes, I think he has a
great intereset in Dallas,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Stars don't expect to go crazy in free agency.
While they made a call to Mike Gilles, the agent for St. Louis
Blues left winger Geoff Courtnall, it's clear the Stars are not
interested in giving the soon-to-be 36-year-old winger the
three-year contract or the $3 million per season he desires. What
the Stars likely will do is wait for Clark to decide if he wants to
leave Toronto and at the same time see if the asking price on
Courtnall goes down. Either way, Gainey sees free agency taking a
much slower pace this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems that people are being more cautious,'' he said.
``There's no impulse buying.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose Sharks were the only ones to jump in the big water
yesterday, signing Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Gary Suter to a
three-year deal for $10 million. Suter made $1.6 million last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks also re-signed Bryan Marchment, ensuring the rivalry
started in the playoffs will continue next season when the Stars
move to the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Ludwig and Carbonneau to the Stars on one-year
contracts was somewhat expected, with both performing well last
season. Carbonneau received a raise from $750,000 to $1.1 million,
while Ludwig bumped up from $750,000 to $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both had better seasons than they did the year before, and I
think that's an indication of their determination and the fact that
we as a team are fighting for a championship,'' Gainey said. ``They
both have a good grasp on what we want from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig, an alternate captain, said returning to the Stars is a
matter of taking care of unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a part of this team through all the \Rbad\S times,''
he said. ``I want to be here through the good times. With the
exception of a couple of injuries, this team was right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing a player like Clark, who has nursed various injuries
throughout his career and last season played in just 47 of 82 games
while scoring 12 goals, seems a problem for the injury-prone Stars.
But with the support of young wingers like Jamie Wright, Jason
Botterill and Juha Lind stepping up, Clark could be the veteran
goal-scorer (294 career goals) the Stars need.
</P>
<P>
   It appears clear that goal-scorer isn't Brett Hull. The
All-Star, who is being courted by the Chicago Blackhawks and
Washington Capitals, is not among the Stars' choices, Gainey said.

FULL SPEED AHEAD FOR SKIP AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Skip Away, home from the West with his seven-race winning streak
and his $8.9 million bankroll, was reunited with Sonny Hine
Wednesday at his barn at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   And the trainer indicated with satisfaction that it was full
speed ahead on his itinerary to make Skip Away the richest horse in
racing history.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away got $600,000 closer to the goal on Sunday in the 34th
start of a grinding four-year career when he outran Puerto Madero
and Gentlemen in the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup, winning the
acclaim that Hine felt was long owed to his 5-year-old gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in training for four straight years, and he
overcomes everything,'' Hine said.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer said he was still considering three or four more
races for his superstar, with the prime purpose that of making Skip
Away the first $10 million winner in racing. Cigar holds that
throne at the moment with $9,999,815 million. Skip Away's total is
$8,906,360.
</P>
<P>
   There is some question whether he will return to California for
the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar on Aug. 15, where he
could meet Gentlemen, Puerto Madero and Silver Charm. Hine has also
taken aim at the $500,000 Woodward at Belmont Park on Sept. 19; the
$1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 10 at Belmont, and the $4
million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on Nov. 7.

SELE, WETTELAND NAMED AS ALL-STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Aaron Sele was planning to spend the All-Star
break at home in Washington state. In fact, he had already bought
plane tickets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove changed those plans, selecting
both Sele and Rangers reliever John Wetteland to the American
League All-Star team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reserves and pitchers were announced yesterday for both the
American and National leagues and Oakland outfielder Ben Grieve, a
graduate of Martin High School and son of Rangers announcer Tom
Grieve, also made the American League team. But Cubs pitcher Kerry
Wood, a graduate of Grand Prairie High, was left off the National
League team for the game, which is scheduled Tuesday night at Coors
Field in Denver. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sele and Wetteland join catcher Ivan Rodriguez and outfielder
Juan Gonzalez to give the Rangers four All-Stars for the first time
since 1989. But the Rangers were still disappointed that pitcher
Rick Helling was left off the team despite a record of 11-4 and a
4.25 earned-run average. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said all along, there were going to be people not make
it who deserve to be there,'' Helling said. ``It would have been
hard for us to have five guys on the team. I'm surprised we have
four, but that shows Mike Hargrove has a lot of respect for our
team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sele is 11-5 with a 4.26 ERA, almost identical numbers to
Helling. But two factors worked in his favor. Helling is pitching
Sunday, two days before the game, and Hargrove left off both David
Cone and Chuck Finley because they're pitching Sunday as well. Sele
also had his best game against Cleveland, beating them 1-0 on May
17 when he allowed five hits and two walks in eight innings,
striking out nine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This means I'm playing for a good team,'' said Sele, who is
making his first trip to the All-Star Game. ``This is a reflection
of the team. They've played hard, scored a lot of runs, played good
defense and have hung in there against Anaheim.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Wetteland was selected. He went to the
1996 game in Philadelphia while with the New York Yankees but did
not pitch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big,'' Wetteland said. ``I don't want to downplay it;
it's certainly wonderful. But I don't place a lot of attention on
personal performance. I pitch for the Texas Rangers and this is a
result of that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>

RESEARCHERS HOPE TO GET OK FOR AIDS TREATMENT EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GENEVA _ If ethics committees approve, researchers in Boston and
Geneva will soon do the crucial AIDS experiment: Stop all antiviral
drugs in a group of patients who began treatment soon after they
became infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
   AIDS specialists attending the 12th World AIDS Conference here
hope the experiment will show that HIV infection does not
necessarily sentence individuals to a lifetime of costly and
onerous triple-drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that these early-treated patients are cured. In fact,
scientists know that about one million AIDS viruses still lurk in
each patient's system, even though the most sensitive tests can
detect none in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of viral infection, that is a tiny amount. But it is
more than enough to kindle a raging infection if either antiviral
drugs or immune defenses cannot keep HIV suppressed to such low
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to see if these patients' immune systems have revived
enough to keep the AIDS virus under permanent control, just as most
people's do with the chickenpox, Herpes simplex, or Epstein-Barr
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see if the virus rebounds without drug treatment and
if the immune system can handle it,'' Dr. Bruce W. Walker of
Massachusetts General Hospital said in an interview here Wednesday.
``It's a question we're compelled to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker and his colleagues have identified 19 patients who were
treated soon after they acquired HIV infection, before the virus
had time to damage their immune systems irreparably. They will be
asked if they are willing to halt treatment while doctors monitor
their blood for signs that HIV has returned in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, doctors will immediately resume triple-drug HIV
treatments. Recent studies indicate that resumption of treatment
should once again suppress HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Hirschel of University Hospital in Geneva, chairman
of this week's massive AIDS meeting, said a similar group of
early-treated patients here will stop therapy if the hospital's
ethics committee approves. ``I think it will be accepted,''
Hirschel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike others, patients who started treatment during very
early infection have undetectable levels of HIV in their blood even
with tests capable of detecting as few as five copies of the virus
per cubic millimeter,'' he said. ``This suggests an essential
difference between patients treated early and those treated
later.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate set of experiments that will get under way this
summer in Boston and New York, Walker and New York AIDS researcher
David Ho will give two different experimental vaccines to patients
infected with HIV to see if they can ``tweak'' the immune system
into generating cells capable of keeping the virus under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients are lined up and we're ready to go,'' Ho said.
``We'll see if the vaccine will enhance the immune response.'' That
trial in New York will involve 10 patients who were given maximal
anti-HIV therapy within 90 days of infection and have been
successfully treated for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston vaccine experiment will enroll a different group of
HIV patients _ those who have been chronically infected but have
chosen not yet to begin antiviral drugs. After six months of potent
treatments, they will be given a vaccine invented by the late Jonas
Salk that consists of killed HIV that has been stripped of its
outer coat.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine experiments are expected to yield crucial
information about the feasibility of an HIV vaccine, both for
preventing and treating infection.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of experiments should show if the immune responses
that successfully treated patients generate are enough to keep the
virus suppressed indefinitely. ``We don't believe it's necessary to
eradicate the virus,'' Walker said. ``But it would be profoundly
disappointing if this isn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago at the last international AIDS meeting in
Vancouver, Ho made headlines with a similar proposal to stop potent
antiviral drugs in a small group of promptly treated patients after
their virus was no longer detectable for some months by the most
sensitive tests of that day.
</P>
<P>
   Ho never did that experiment _ which was based on demonstrating
that the patients had been cured of HIV infection _ because
subsequent research showed that even the earliest and most potent
drug therapy could not rid any patient of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   New tests, capable of detecting as few as 50 copies of HIV in a
15th of a teaspoon of blood, have shown that many patients had not
really cleared the virus from their blood. Subsequent research
showed that, even when the virus could not be found in the blood,
it could be teased out from certain ``resting'' immune cells if
they were activated.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the time is finally ripe for doing the
treatment-stopping trial because they now have proof that the
immune system eventually rebuilds itself among individuals who got
aggressive drug treatment within weeks or months of their HIV
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Other HIV-infected individuals who are not lucky enough to have
had early, aggressive drug treatment may also achieve what
scientists are calling ``immune reconstitution.'' But for now, the
early-treated patients represent the best that state-of-the-art
AIDS care can do in suppressing HIV and allowing the immune system
to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have provided proof that the immune system is not dead'' in
HIV-infected people, Dr. Brigitte Autran of the Petie Salpetriere
Hospital in Paris. ``It is capable of being restored, even late in
the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggressively treated HIV patients often show a reversal of the
decline in key ``orchestrator'' immune cells designated CD4 _ a
hallmark of the infection. But more important to immunologists is
new evidence that these reconstituted CD4 cells can recognize HIV,
and that there is eventual return of other immune cells called
cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) capable of recognizing and destroying
any cells infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Autran Wednesday reported that 80 percent of several hundred
French patients could generate such ``memory'' cells capable of
recognizing HIV, including many with advanced AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most infections are dealt with by strong CTL responses,''
Walker noted. But CD4 cells, also called ``helper'' cells, must
tell them what to do.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge threw out the tax evasion case
against Webster Hubbell on Wednesday, ruling in a powerful critique
of the independent counsel's tactics that Kenneth Starr had both
exceeded his authority and reneged on a promise to grant him
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Robertson found that the criminal case
was too far removed from Starr's original mandate of 1994 to
investigate the business dealings of President Clinton and Hillary
Rodham Clinton in Arkansas more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ruled that prosecutors violated Hubbell's right
against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   If upheld on appeal, Robertson's decision would remove any
pressure on Hubbell, a longtime friend of the Clintons and a former
associate attorney general, to provide incriminating evidence
against them. Hubbell has long contended that he knows of no such
information.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal, embodied in strong language, will resonate beyond
the legal case because it goes to the heart of criticism by the
White House and Clinton supporters. They have contended that the
Hubbell case had come to symbolize Starr's determined pursuit of
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Served a subpoena, Hubbell had refused to turn over 13,120 pages
of records and invoked the Fifth Amendment. The independent counsel
then gave him immunity from prosecution, forcing him to turn over
the documents. But instead, the records were used improperly to
build a case against him, the judge said. Robertson called the
subpoena that led to the immunity agreement a ``quintessential
fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the judge's interpretation of Starr's authority was a
major setback for the independent counsel, the judge himself noted
that his reasoning should not affect the Whitewater inquiry's more
recent expansion into the relationship between former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky and the president.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, handed up two months ago, had accused Hubbell,
his wife, Suzy, and two tax advisers of scheming in the last four
years to avoid paying taxes and penalties of more than $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had contended that much of the owed taxes stemmed
from money Hubbell had embezzled and from hundreds of thousands of
dollars in income from jobs referred by friends and supporters of
the president. The indictment said Hubbell did little work for
those jobs and suggested they might have been arranged to
discourage him from cooperating with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson ruled that the charges lodged against Hubbell in
April were too far afield from the original investigation over
which Starr was appointed to preside. Starr's original mandate was
an inquiry begun in 1994 to examine the ties of the president and
first lady to a corrupt savings association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent counsel's explanation of how this indictment
is `connected with' the original grant was a recitation spanning
six degrees of relationship,'' Robertson wrote. ``He has identified
no common witnesses, described no similar patterns of conduct,
cited no similar applicable law.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell appeared shocked and relieved by the decision to dismiss
the case against himself, his wife, his accountant, Michael
Schaufele, and his lawyer, Charles Owen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good day,'' he said at the doorstep of his home here.
``I don't know how to react. It's been five years.''
</P>
<P>
   A one-paragraph statement that was issued by the independent
counsel's office but not signed by Starr said the decision would be
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pleadings and oral arguments to the District Court reveal
our respectful disagreement with the district judge's decision,''
the statement said. ``We will seek prompt review of this ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, privately jubilant over the wide-ranging
criticism of Starr, which included a characterization of his
constitutional views as ``scary,'' were uncharacteristically
taciturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else do you say when a federal judge has used words like
`scary' and `fishing expedition?''' said Rahm Emanuel, a senior
adviser to Clinton. ``It speaks volumes about that office and the
investigation itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In China, President Clinton said that he was pleased with the
outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision speaks for itself, but I'm happy for Webb and
Suzy and their family, Mike and his family and Charlie and his
family,'' he said in a remark relayed by Mike McCurry, the
presidential press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, who had also been a partner of Mrs. Clinton's at the
Rose law firm in Arkansas, had served nearly 17 months in prison
for bilking his former law partners and clients before he was
charged in April in the tax case.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have said that Hubbell had failed in the
first criminal case to live up to an agreement to be fully candid,
while Hubbell's supporters have said that the second indictment was
simply a further effort to pressure him unfairly into making false
incriminating statements against the Clintons. The tax indictment
suggested that some of the income he had failed to report to the
Internal Revenue Service might have been to discourage him from
being more candid with investigators, a suggestion that he had
vigorously denied.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robertson first hinted that he was leaning against the
independent counsel at a hearing last Friday when he referred to
one prosecutor's arguments on immunity as ``scary'' and was dubious
about links another prosecutor tried to make between the tax case
and Starr's original charter.
</P>
<P>
   The judge joined the bench in 1994, an early appointee of
President Clinton. He had been a seasoned corporate litigator and
partner at Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering, one of Washington's largest
law firms. While his clients included a number of large
corporations, the judge had also distinguished himself for playing
a leading role in civil rights causes in the United States and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The central issue in his ruling on Starr's jurisdiction was the
delicate balance between the judiciary and the executive branch in
enforcing the independent counsel law and the proper role of the
special court that appoints such counsels and oversees their work.
The court, known as the Special Division, consists of three federal
appeals judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Created by the independent counsel law, the Special Division
serves as a hybrid institution, performing some functions normally
left to the executive branch and others similar to those of the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   In January the special division, acting at the request of Starr,
issued a secret order giving the Whitewater independent counsel the
authority to investigate Hubbell's taxes. The precise question
presented by Hubbell and the other defendants was whether the
special division had the authority to expand Starr's jurisdiction
in the absence of a request by the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Two other federal district court judges ruled last year that the
special division had such authority in criminal cases brought
against peripheral defendants by the independent counsel
investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. Those judges
had written that they were reluctant to second-guess the decisions
of the special division, particularly since they are all appeals
court judges.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday Robertson said he disagreed with those district
court judges. Robertson found that although the special division
consisted of Federal appeals judges, the panel ``in fact is not a
court of appeals.'' Rather by constitutional limitations imposed
upon it by the Supreme Court, the special division performs
``essentially ministerial'' acts that can be reviewed by a district
court.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Robertson wrote, the special division ``may interpret
the independent counsel's original grant. It may not expand the
independent counsel's jurisdiction without the consent of the
attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This limitation is constitutional, and, if it is to mean
anything at all, must be enforceable upon a proper challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that his reasoning ought not to affect Starr's
jurisdiction to pursue the investigation into the Lewinsky matter
because the attorney general had specifically recommended that the
independent counsel examine it.
</P>
<P>
   After finding that he had the authority to review the special
division's order conferring authority on the independent counsel to
investigate Hubbell's taxes, the judge concluded that the order was
not ``demonstrably related'' to the attorney general's application
for the original appointment of Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson rejected the independent counsel's argument that the
agreement that led to the production of Hubbell's business records
should be narrowly construed. Prosecutors had maintained that the
immunity that they had granted meant only that they could not tell
a jury that they had received the documents from Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hubbell's compelled production of documents allowed the
independent counsel to build a case against Mr. Hubbell different
in all material respects from the case for which they had been
subpoenaed,'' the judge wrote. ``Mr. Hubbell was thereby turned
into the primary informant against himself.''

LONE STAR REPORT SAYS TRACK IN WINNING FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie made
operating profits of $4.8 million last year and $3.8 million in
1996, according to a financial document the horse track filed last
month with the Texas Racing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The financial statement, audited for the TRC by accounting firm
Ernst and Young, indicates that Lone Star has avoided some of the
startup woes of other Texas tracks. Sam Houston Race Park in
Houston and Retama Park near San Antonio, the state's other Class 1
horse tracks, had betting revenues fall far short of expenses
during their first two years of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star earned $40.5 million in pari-mutuel wagering revenue
during 1997, with listed expenses of slightly less than $36
million. Virtually all of the pari-mutuel profits associated with
the track's 1997 season came from thoroughbred racing, Lone Star
president Bob Kaminski said. The fall quarter horse live season was
only a ``break-even'' proposition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent racing executive in another state who examined the
statement for the ``Star-Telegram'' pointed out what he said were
``red flags'' in the track's current cash-flow situation. But
Kaminski said that the questionable assets vs. liabilities portion
of the Lone Star Race Park Ltd. financial report is misleading. He
said the track's cash-flow situation is actually ``very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And this year you should see an improvement over last year,''
Kaminski said. ``Our commissions for the year-to-date are ahead of
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star opened for simulcasting in May 1996 and for live
racing in April 1997. The $96 million facility was largely financed
through $65 million in bonds sold by the city of Grand Prairie and
backed by revenues from a half-cent sales tax approved by voters in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Sales tax revenues are well ahead of projections, Kaminski said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, Lone Star reported $5.6 million in current assets
_ more than half reserved for bond debt and racing purses _ and
$13.1 million in current liabilities, including $7 million in
accounts payable.
</P>
<P>
   Taken alone, that portion of the statement could raise some
eyebrows. However, Kaminski said some track assets are carried
under the heading of LSJC Development Corp., and still other assets
are listed under MBLS Inc., which operates concessions at the
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a true picture of all the assets and liabilities, you
would need to look at a complete consolidated picture for all three
entities,'' Kaminski said.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he said, would reflect a healthy situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a pretty strong financial position,'' Kaminski said,
``especially considering that we paid for a number of capital
expenses last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a nice market return on equity. But
without the help from the city of Grand Prairie, it would be a
marginal investment. If we had an additional $50-$65 million of
debt, it would look a lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   Grand Prairie Councilwoman Teri Jackson said yesterday that a
separate audit of the track for the city's sports corporation
raised no red flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't turn up anything that we were worried about,''
said Jackson, who chairs the finance committee for the Grand
Prairie Sports Facilities Development Corp., which oversees the
financing and operation of the track and leases the facilities to
Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   TRC executive secretary Paula Flowerday said she also went over
the financial statement with Tim Craig, the commission's director
of finance and accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, the TRC is very pleased with Lone Star's
operations,'' Flowerday said. ``We hope that this is a signal for
continued improvement for the racing industry in the state.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ Not so long ago, I needed to find out how many cars
were registered in Shanghai, China's most advanced city. The
Vehicle Management Bureau of the city's police asked for the
question to be submitted by fax.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came in a follow-up phone call: ``This is a secret,
we cannot publicize it. If we want to know how many nuclear
warheads Britain has, the British government won't tell us either.
To us the number of cars is equally important as nuclear weapons.''
The official, a Mr. Chen, declined to give his full name.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in what President Clinton called his ``historic''
live Shanghai radio phone-in, the city's mayor and fellow guest, Xu
Kuangdi, inadvertently let out this important state secret.
Shanghai had 700,000 cars, he blithely revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, during his visit, Clinton said that he hoped his
visit ``would help to show a full and balanced picture of modern
China to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is the real China? Is it the one that set Clinton loose
on its airwaves over the past week, or is it the everyday China of
obstructive, hidebound, bureaucrats bred by a closed Communist
system?
</P>
<P>
   The messy reality lies somewhere in between. The danger is that
the upbeat images from the presidential road show are telling only
half the story.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to deny that an extraordinary event took place last
Saturday in Beijing when the joint press conference between Clinton
and President Jiang Zemin was broadcast live on Chinese national
television, including the U.S. president's comments that the June
1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square was ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese viewers were amazed to hear Clinton's uncensored
opinions, but also to see their own leader speaking
extemporaneously. Jiang normally talks for public consumption only
from a prepared script.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the frank debate about human rights was prompted by
a planted question from a Chinese state news agency reporter, to
which Jiang at first responded by reading a long prepared answer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. aides were ecstatic about Saturday's live broadcast and
those which followed at Beijing University and the Shanghai radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Mike McCurry, said: ``Extraordinary
things have happened.'' The broadcasts ``could likely have some
profound impact on the way the political culture of China adapts to
the changes that are underway here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, Mike. It is going to take a long time to take an
accurate seismic reading of the impact of Clinton's trip on Chinese
domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   As ever in China, no one _ including the U.S. president _ has a
clue about how decisions have been made by China's leaders over the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, China Central Television believed it was about to
broadcast a 30-minute statement and brief question session rather
than the good-natured 70-minute verbal joust that ensued.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Western perceptions of China tend to veer to
extremes. In the years since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre,
there has been justifiable concern about human rights abuses, but
too little interest outside China in the retreat of the Communist
Party from whole areas of people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the combination of the live broadcasts and
stage-managed tableaux of Clinton swinging through endless
photo-opportunities _ a rich village, an official church,
Shanghai's new stock market building, a fancy urban housing complex
_ risks tilting the balance of public perception too far in the
opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much that Clinton has not even glimpsed, and too
many questions he has avoided asking. No Chinese newspaper has
reported Clinton's remarks about human rights and personal freedom,
even when they have been broadcast on live television.
</P>
<P>
   He has repeatedly committed himself to more cultural exchanges
between the U.S. and China, but on the Shanghai radio phone-in he
failed to mention the most glaring example of mainland obstruction:
last week's decision by the city's ultraconservative Culture Bureau
to block this month's planned performance in New York by a local
Chinese opera troupe.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy degree of skepticism is needed by anyone on an
official tour of China. Sometimes the whoppers are obvious, such as
the claim by the Foreign Ministry that no dissidents had been
either arrested or detained during the Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the problem that the best policy intentions of
China's central government are frequently thwarted by the cadres
out in the provinces. Much of what Clinton has heard from President
Jiang about reforms is not actually being implemented on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a serious misreading for anyone to walk away
from this successful visit with the notion that China is about to
shift upgear on political change.
</P>
<P>
   At the highest level of China's government, not everyone will
agree that Jiang was right to allow the live broadcasts, and the
Chinese leader must deal with any domestic political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   As McCurry put it, ``We obviously want to try to help the `good
guys' as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, the fate of the various dissidents who
have raised their heads during the Clinton visit, including
high-profile interviews to the Western media, will help indicate
the way the wind is blowing.
</P>
<P>
   No one should imagine that the new friendship between Clinton
and Jiang provides any guarantee that China will be an easier
negotiating partner on issues of substance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the past week's warming, it proved impossible to secure
any significant Chinese concessions on such vexed issues as
protectionist trade barriers, weapons proliferation or, indeed,
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also received his first glimpse of a modernized China
that may not, as he predicted, eagerly embrace greater
``convergence'' with U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
   At Beijing University, a breeding ground for China's future
leaders, the aggressive questions from students showed that
tomorrow's elite envisage a China which puts its own stamp on the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Roth, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian
affairs, said: ``I think (at Beijing University) you saw real
evidence of the growing nationalism of the current generation in
China itself... I think that reflects a genuine trend that is out
there. And that is something that we have to deal with in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton kept on saying, there is much that America still has
to learn about China. And there is no guarantee that America will
feel wholly comfortable with what China eventually evolves into. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Not so long ago, I needed to find out how many cars
were registered in Shanghai, China's most advanced city. The
Vehicle Management Bureau of the city's police asked for the
question to be submitted by fax.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came in a follow-up phone call: ``This is a secret,
we cannot publicize it. If we want to know how many nuclear
warheads Britain has, the British government won't tell us either.
To us the number of cars is equally important as nuclear weapons.''
The official, a Mr. Chen, declined to give his full name.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in what President Clinton called his ``historic''
live Shanghai radio phone-in, the city's mayor and fellow guest, Xu
Kuangdi, inadvertently let out this important state secret.
Shanghai had 700,000 cars, he blithely revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Several times, during his visit, Clinton said that he hoped his
visit ``would help to show a full and balanced picture of modern
China to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But what is the real China? Is it the one that set Clinton loose
on its airwaves over the past week, or is it the everyday China of
obstructive, hidebound, bureaucrats bred by a closed Communist
system?
</P>
<P>
   The messy reality lies somewhere in between. The danger is that
the upbeat images from the presidential road show are telling only
half the story.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to deny that an extraordinary event took place last
Saturday in Beijing when the joint press conference between Clinton
and President Jiang Zemin was broadcast live on Chinese national
television, including the U.S. president's comments that the June
1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square was ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese viewers were amazed to hear Clinton's uncensored
opinions, but also to see their own leader speaking
extemporaneously. Jiang normally talks for public consumption only
from a prepared script.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the frank debate about human rights was prompted by
a planted question from a Chinese state news agency reporter, to
which Jiang at first responded by reading a long prepared answer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. aides were ecstatic about Saturday's live broadcast and
those which followed at Beijing University and the Shanghai radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Mike McCurry, said: ``Extraordinary
things have happened.'' The broadcasts ``could likely have some
profound impact on the way the political culture of China adapts to
the changes that are underway here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, Mike. It is going to take a long time to take an
accurate seismic reading of the impact of Clinton's trip on Chinese
domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   As ever in China, no one _ including the U.S. president _ has a
clue about how decisions have been made by China's leaders over the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, China Central Television believed it was about to
broadcast a 30-minute statement and brief question session rather
than the good-natured 70-minute verbal joust that ensued.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Western perceptions of China tend to veer to
extremes. In the years since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre,
there has been justifiable concern about human rights abuses, but
too little interest outside China in the retreat of the Communist
Party from whole areas of people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the combination of the live broadcasts and
stage-managed tableaux of Clinton swinging through endless
photo-opportunities _ a rich village, an official church,
Shanghai's new stock market building, a fancy urban housing complex
_ risks tilting the balance of public perception too far in the
opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much that Clinton has not even glimpsed, and too
many questions he has avoided asking. No Chinese newspaper has
reported Clinton's remarks about human rights and personal freedom,
even when they have been broadcast on live television.
</P>
<P>
   He has repeatedly committed himself to more cultural exchanges
between the U.S. and China, but on the Shanghai radio phone-in he
failed to mention the most glaring example of mainland obstruction:
last week's decision by the city's ultraconservative Culture Bureau
to block this month's planned performance in New York by a local
Chinese opera troupe.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy degree of skepticism is needed by anyone on an
official tour of China. Sometimes the whoppers are obvious, such as
the claim by the Foreign Ministry that no dissidents had been
either arrested or detained during the Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the problem that the best policy intentions of
China's central government are frequently thwarted by the cadres
out in the provinces. Much of what Clinton has heard from President
Jiang about reforms is not actually being implemented on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a serious misreading for anyone to walk away
from this successful visit with the notion that China is about to
shift upgear on political change.
</P>
<P>
   At the highest level of China's government, not everyone will
agree that Jiang was right to allow the live broadcasts, and the
Chinese leader must deal with any domestic political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   As McCurry put it, ``We obviously want to try to help the `good

 COYOTES COULD TRADE CAPTAIN TO AVOID STANDOFF

<P>
   PHOENIX - Imagine there's no No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy if you try, according to Rick Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you, I'll find it very hard to accept if
we end up trading Keith Tkachuk,'' said Tocchet, the outspoken
right wing for the Coyotes. ``He's too valuable of a player.
Besides, we're already thin at left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we've got no control. I could be traded tomorrow,
too. That's just part of the business. It could happen to any one
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it could happen to Tkachuk, the Coyotes' volatile
captain who wears No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   And it could happen sooner than later if things aren't resolved
quickly regarding a contract extension for one of the NHL's premier
power forwards and goal scorers.
</P>
<P>
   A Tkachuk trade became a real possibility this week when General
Manager Bobby Smith suspended negotiations indefinitely with
Tkachuk's agent, Bob Murray, and pulled the team's latest offer
from the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to trade Keith. I want him to play on our team,''
Smith said. ``Keith has made it clear he wants to be here, too. He
hasn't said, `Trade me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, however, may have no other choice as long as
Tkachuk continues to demand a restructured deal worth $8 million
per season. The team's latest offer, which Murray and Tkachuk
rejected on Monday, would have paid him an average of $6.5 million
per year over the next five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The total package, Smith said, was worth more than the
five-year, $27.5 million contract the Buffalo Sabres gave to goalie
Dominik Hasek. Murray says goal scorers like Tkachuk, however, are
worth more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, all I know,'' Smith said, ``is Dominik Hasek was just
named last week as the Most Valuable Player in the entire National
Hockey League _ for the second straight year. He also guided his
team into the Stanley Cup semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who never has led the Coyotes out of the first round of
the playoffs but has scored 142 goals the past three years, has two
options. He can report to training camp in September and honor the
final two years of his present contract, which is set to pay him
$2.8 million next season and $3 million the next. Or he can stage a
holdout, which he's done before.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting out for two full seasons, though, is virtually unheard
of. Neither he nor the Coyotes could afford that.
</P>
<P>
   So either the two sides try to meet in the middle, which doesn't
seem likely at this point, or the Coyotes must attempt to trade
him.
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet, one of the team's most vocal leaders, said he isn't
sure what to make of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He signed a contract and you're supposed to honor it, but
whether I agree with it or not, it's up to the individual,''
Tocchet said. ``I'm a player and I'd like to see him get his money
as much as anybody. He's a great player. My hope is that both
parties just get together and get this thing resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm selfish. I just don't want to get to another opening night
where the Coyotes and Keith Tkachuk are fighting. That happened
last year and it went on for a month. This could be worse. It
affects the whole team and creates nothing but one big
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading Tkachuk might not be as easy as it sounds. Only a
handful of teams could probably afford his salary demands, and
those teams might not necessarily have the kind of players Phoenix
would want in return.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely scenario is a straight up, one-for-one deal, such
as Tkachuk to Philadelphia for left wing and fellow 50-goal scorer
John LeClair. Or possibly Tkachuk to the Flyers for LeClair's
linemate, center Eric Lindros, a rumor that has surfaced before.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Tocchet said he only hopes it doesn't
drastically alter the Coyotes from last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is good enough,'' he said. ``With just a little
tinkering here and there, we would have beat Detroit in the
playoffs. We're pretty close. We're almost there. I just hope we
don't blow it.'' &QL;

   LONDON _ Scientists have detected potentially toxic man-made
chemicals in tissue samples taken from sperm whales _ which only
feed in the deep ocean _ indicating that the pollutants have spread
globally.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals, called polybrominated compounds, are similar to
the outlawed polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the pesticide
DDT, which were found to have accumulated to dangerous levels in
the fat deposits of wild animals over the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists warn that the discovery of polybrominated
compounds _ which cause many of the same effects as PCBs yet have
not been banned _ could result in a similar environmental disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The main use of brominated compounds is as flame retardants in a
range of everyday products, from computers and television sets to
clothing and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that the chemicals entered the
environment from both factories and waste disposal facilities.
</P>
<P>
   A study led by Dr. Jacob de Boer, of the Netherlands Institute
for Fisheries Research near Amsterdam, found significant traces of
the chemicals in the blubber of sperm whales that had become
stranded on Dutch beaches over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first indication that these compounds are in the
environment. They are very similar to PCBs which were, and to some
extent still are, a major environmental problem,'' Dr. de Boer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The research, published in the journal ``Nature,'' also found
brominated compounds in other sea mammals such as harbor seals, but
their presence in sperm whales, which feed exclusively on
deep-water fish, indicates more widespread pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. de Boer said that industry manufactures about 100,000 tons
of brominated compounds each year and production is expected to
increase in the next decade suggesting that ``an environmental
problem may be on its way.''
</P>
<P>
   Polybrominated compounds, like PCBs, are believed to cause
fertility problems in animals by disrupting the balance of sex
hormones in the body. They are also thought to be involved in
causing cancer. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE CZECH REPUBLIC _ Michael Roguz is 19 and comes from a small
Polish village on the border with Ukraine. Educated, articulate and
fluent in English, he could have been a translator or entered one
of the professions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he has chosen to take part in a unique experiment in car
production at the Skoda Auto plant at Mlada Boleslav, 60 kilometers
northeast of Prague.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of that experiment will appear in Britain this week
when the Skoda Octavia goes on sale. It is the most important Skoda
car launch since the Velvet Revolution swept communism away and the
Czech Republic's best-known export (after Budweiser beer) was taken
under the wing of Germany's Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the product which Skoda hopes will change its image
once and for all as the joke brand of the car market.
</P>
<P>
   If the car is as advanced as the method being used to
manufacture it, then Skoda has reason to be quietly confident.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, one of 3,000 ``guest'' workers at the plant, is paid
16,000 crowns a month for working an eight-hour shift with a
30-minute break. Although he only arrived at Mlada Boleslav three
weeks ago, he says he is enjoying life on the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   VW, which took a big gamble when it paid DM1.3 billion for Skoda
in 1991, would probably appreciate his enthusiasm but dispute his
assessment. For the Octavia line is anything but typical and, while
it may look simple, it is a showcase for some of the most advanced
techniques the car industry has ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a conventional production line, where components are
fitted to the shell of the car as it moves along, the Octavia plant
has been designed using the ``fractal'' assembly concept.
</P>
<P>
   This means that large parts of the car _ such as the dashboard
and the seat assembly and the rear axle _ are pre-assembled as one
unit and then bolted on as one.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half of the work force on the Octavia line are not
employed by Skoda at all but work for component suppliers. The line
itself is only about a third of the length of that in the sister
plant next door which makes the Skoda Felicia.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that inventories are kept to a bare minimum. This
is one step beyond ``just-in-time'' manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the automotive world is watching the experiment with
interest. Mazda of Japan is said to be planning a similar plant
while Mercedes intends to use the technique at its Swatch car
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Skoda is coy about how well the experiment is progressing.
Although the Octavia went into production in late 1996, output is
still in the buildup phase. The plan is to raise production from
90,000 to 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Farsky, director of communications, says: ``We had to have
a lot of discussions with the unions because they were afraid it
would take jobs away from them. Some people were against it because
they did not think it would work. But the experiment is succeeding.
We are producing the volume and the quality while cutting down on
lead times and costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof of the pudding is in Skoda's results. Last year it
produced after-tax profits of 1.9 billion crowns on sales of 90
billion crowns _ the first profit since VW took over _ and this
year the plan is to pay the first ever dividend to its German
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just down to advanced production techniques. Skoda
still has the lowest labor costs of virtually any car maker in
Europe. The monthly salary that Skoda workers earn is a third more
than the national average but it is still just one-eighth of the
wages in a German car plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lower labor costs are an advantage but they are not to
last forever,'' says Farsky. ``When we took over we assumed it
would give us a edge for 10 years. It looks like it will last
longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of man-hours per car we are not as efficient as we
might be but in terms of cost per employee per car we are ahead of
other European manufacturers and even the Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   VW's priorities when it took over Skoda were to keep the name,
maintain the work force at its current size (22,000 people), raise
capacity and add another model.
</P>
<P>
   It has achieved all that but some observers question how much is
left of Skoda that is identifiably Czech.
</P>
<P>
   The Octavia was designed by a Belgian brought in from VW's Audi
unit, 60 percent of its platform (power train, gearbox, engine,
drive shaft, suspension, floor pan) is the same as that on the VW
Golf and Audi A3 and many of the key components come from VW.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Van Braekel, who arrived at Mlada Boleslav as head of
design in January 1994 disputes that Skoda has become little more
than a ``badge'' company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you see, hear and feel here is 100 percent Skoda,''
he says. To prove the argument he points to the way he designed the
Octavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have tried to do is create a bridge to the past,
before the bad days of communist control, and draw on the strengths
from Skoda's long tradition. So for instance the grille is inspired
by pre-war Skodas and the silhouette is based on the Skoda coupes
from the 1950s and 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   VW intends to invest a further DM2.4 billion in the next four
years on top of the DM2.1 billion it has already sunk in the
business with the aim of raising production to 500,000 a year _
triple the level in 1990. There are also plans for a third model, a
large car in the Audi A6 bracket.
</P>
<P>
   To pull it off will depend on persuading the Czechs that a Skoda
remains a Skoda (the marque still accounts for 57 percent of the
domestic market) while convincing west European buyers that beneath
the Skoda skin lies a body of pure German technical sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for instance, Skoda has set itself a target of more
than doubling sales from 16,500 last year to 37,500 by the
millennium.

FIVE ARE HELD IN SEX ABUSE OF CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS and MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a dingy Brooklyn apartment filled with
pornographic videos and magazines, the New York City police
uncovered what they described Wednesday as a group of pedophiles
who repeatedly raped and sodomized their own and one another's
children, even while some of the children were being monitored by
the city's child-welfare agency.
</P>
<P>
   The police arrested five adults, most of them members of an
extended family, on charges of abusing four children, two
8-year-old boys and two girls age 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   The two adolescent girls and an 8-year-old boy had been
transferred to foster care last fall after child-welfare workers
found them living in the dirty, roach-infested apartment without
any food. But after three weeks in foster care, a family-court
judge sent the girls home, despite the objections of the
child-welfare agency, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And as police investigators tried to unravel the allegations of
incest, rape, sodomy and pedophilia Wednesday, officials from the
city's Administration for Children's Services conceded that they
had been closely monitoring the household for nearly a year but
failed to uncover any sign of sexual abuse, which the police said
had occurred for years and apparently continued until June.
</P>
<P>
   The case once again raised disturbing questions about the city's
monitoring of abused and neglected children under its watch.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say casework has improved since the overhaul of
the troubled child-welfare agency two years ago, and it was unclear
Wednesday whether the family's caseworker could have detected signs
of abuse, assuming she had visited the home as required. But the
horrific allegations of severe sexual abuse renewed concerns over
whether caseworkers are conscientious in making required visits and
can adequately assess risks to vulnerable children.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the caseworker assigned to the household and the
children should have seen each child at least twice a month,
interviewing them individually to determine whether they showed any
signs of mistreatment. It was unclear Wednesday whether the
caseworker made all the required visits. City officials said they
had no hint of the ongoing sexual abuse in the home.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations came to light only when the frightened
8-year-old boy finally described the sexual assaults to a new
foster mother, who reported the allegations to child-welfare
officials on Tuesday. He had been abused in the apartment earlier
in June when he was there on a visit with his father, police
investigators said. Investigators said that the arrests were based
in part on statements made by the suspects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the police said they were executing a search
warrant at another location where the children may have been
abused. And child-welfare officials said they were investigating
why the two girls were returned to their home from foster care and
whether the caseworker had followed up once they returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the allegations suggest extremely serious sexual
abuse of these children,'' said Nicholas Scoppetta, the
commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services. ``We
have an investigation of all the circumstances of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The case centers on an extended Brooklyn family, including
Daniel Robacker, 40, and his companion, Theresa Fremgen, 35, who
live in the apartment at 232 Linden St., in Bushwick, Brooklyn,
with their two daughters, ages 13 and 14. A close family friend,
Curtis Elam James, also lived there with his 8-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Those three adults were arrested, along with Theresa Fremgen's
brothers, Ezra, 25, and Vincent, 28, who lived nearby. But it
appears that much of the abuse occurred in the apartment itself,
which was also filled with cats, dogs and dozens of hamsters, said
an official who has worked on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Ms. Fremgen and Robacker were both
developmentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the household first came to the attention of
child-welfare workers in July 1997, when someone reported the
family to the state's child-abuse telephone line. Child-welfare
workers reported that they found a filthy house, with animal feces,
and a child with lacerations on the body.
</P>
<P>
   They decided to try to keep the household together by offering
intensive counseling services, and caseworkers monitoring the
family around the clock, starting on Aug. 27 and continuing until
Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   But officials involved in the case said the caseworker finally
ordered the three children put in foster care on Sept. 23 when it
became clear that Ms. Framgen and Robacker were not responding to
the city's help. As part of a routine medical examination, a nurse
asked each child whether he or she had ever been sexually abused.
They said they had not, a child-welfare worker said.
</P>
<P>
   And on Oct. 14, 1997, Family Court Judge Nora Freeman decided to
send the two girls home after the foster-care agency recommended
that they return, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency made the recommendation because the charge of
physical abuse had been discounted, leaving only a charge of
neglect for keeping the children in a filthy house.
</P>
<P>
   Officials working on the investigations said lawyers for the
Administration for Children's Services had urged the judge to keep
the girls in foster care, in part because they were worried about
their parents' mental state. The city, in fact, supposedly banned
such public disagreements in court last year, prohibiting the
private foster-care agency caseworkers from disagreeing with
child-welfare lawyers in open sessions. It was unclear why the
disagreement occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Freeman sided with the agency and sent the girls home.
She declined to comment when reached at home Wednesday night.

<P>
   THE CZECH REPUBLIC _ Michael Roguz is 19 and comes from a small
Polish village on the border with Ukraine. Educated, articulate and
fluent in English, he could have been a translator or entered one
of the professions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he has chosen to take part in a unique experiment in car
production at the Skoda Auto plant at Mlada Boleslav, 60 kilometers
northeast of Prague.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of that experiment will appear in Britain this week
when the Skoda Octavia goes on sale. It is the most important Skoda
car launch since the Velvet Revolution swept communism away and the
Czech Republic's best-known export (after Budweiser beer) was taken
under the wing of Germany's Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the product which Skoda hopes will change its image
once and for all as the joke brand of the car market.
</P>
<P>
   If the car is as advanced as the method being used to
manufacture it, then Skoda has reason to be quietly confident.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, one of 3,000 ``guest'' workers at the plant, is paid
16,000 crowns a month for working an eight-hour shift with a
30-minute break. Although he only arrived at Mlada Boleslav three
weeks ago, he says he is enjoying life on the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   VW, which took a big gamble when it paid DM1.3 billion for Skoda
in 1991, would probably appreciate his enthusiasm but dispute his
assessment. For the Octavia line is anything but typical and, while
it may look simple, it is a showcase for some of the most advanced
techniques the car industry has ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a conventional production line, where components are
fitted to the shell of the car as it moves along, the Octavia plant
has been designed using the ``fractal'' assembly concept.
</P>
<P>
   This means that large parts of the car _ such as the dashboard
and the seat assembly and the rear axle _ are pre-assembled as one
unit and then bolted on as one.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half of the work force on the Octavia line are not
employed by Skoda at all but work for component suppliers. The line
itself is only about a third of the length of that in the sister
plant next door which makes the Skoda Felicia.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that inventories are kept to a bare minimum. This
is one step beyond ``just-in-time'' manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the automotive world is watching the experiment with
interest. Mazda of Japan is said to be planning a similar plant
while Mercedes intends to use the technique at its Swatch car
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Skoda is coy about how well the experiment is progressing.
Although the Octavia went into production in late 1996, output is
still in the buildup phase. The plan is to raise production from
90,000 to 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Farsky, director of communications, says: ``We had to have
a lot of discussions with the unions because they were afraid it
would take jobs away from them. Some people were against it because
they did not think it would work. But the experiment is succeeding.
We are producing the volume and the quality while cutting down on
lead times and costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof of the pudding is in Skoda's results. Last year it
produced after-tax profits of 1.9 billion crowns on sales of 90
billion crowns _ the first profit since VW took over _ and this
year the plan is to pay the first ever dividend to its German
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just down to advanced production techniques. Skoda
still has the lowest labor costs of virtually any car maker in
Europe. The monthly salary that Skoda workers earn is a third more
than the national average but it is still just one-eighth of the
wages in a German car plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lower labor costs are an advantage but they are not to
last forever,'' says Farsky. ``When we took over we assumed it
would give us a edge for 10 years. It looks like it will last
longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of man-hours per car we are not as efficient as we
might be but in terms of cost per employee per car we are ahead of
other European manufacturers and even the Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   VW's priorities when it took over Skoda were to keep the name,
maintain the work force at its current size (22,000 people), raise
capacity and add another model.
</P>
<P>
   It has achieved all that but some observers question how much is
left of Skoda that is identifiably Czech.
</P>
<P>

RESEARCHERS HOPE TO GET OK FOR AIDS TREATMENT EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ If ethics committees approve, researchers in Boston and
Geneva will soon do the crucial AIDS experiment: Stop all antiviral
drugs in a group of patients who began treatment soon after they
became infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
   AIDS specialists attending the 12th World AIDS Conference here
hope the experiment will show that HIV infection does not
necessarily sentence individuals to a lifetime of costly and
onerous triple-drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that these early-treated patients are cured. In fact,
scientists know that about one million AIDS viruses still lurk in
each patient's system, even though the most sensitive tests can
detect none in their blood.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of viral infection, that is a tiny amount. But it is
more than enough to kindle a raging infection if either antiviral
drugs or immune defenses cannot keep HIV suppressed to such low
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to see if these patients' immune systems have revived
enough to keep the AIDS virus under permanent control, just as most
people's do with the chickenpox, Herpes simplex, or Epstein-Barr
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will see if the virus rebounds without drug treatment and
if the immune system can handle it,'' Dr. Bruce W. Walker of
Massachusetts General Hospital said in an interview here Wednesday.
``It's a question we're compelled to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker and his colleagues have identified 19 patients who were
treated soon after they acquired HIV infection, before the virus
had time to damage their immune systems irreparably. They will be
asked if they are willing to halt treatment while doctors monitor
their blood for signs that HIV has returned in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, doctors will immediately resume triple-drug HIV
treatments. Recent studies indicate that resumption of treatment
should once again suppress HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Hirschel of University Hospital in Geneva, chairman
of this week's massive AIDS meeting, said a similar group of
early-treated patients here will stop therapy if the hospital's
ethics committee approves. ``I think it will be accepted,''
Hirschel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike others, patients who started treatment during very
early infection have undetectable levels of HIV in their blood even
with tests capable of detecting as few as five copies of the virus
per cubic millimeter,'' he said. ``This suggests an essential
difference between patients treated early and those treated
later.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate set of experiments that will get under way this
summer in Boston and New York, Walker and New York AIDS researcher
David Ho will give two different experimental vaccines to patients
infected with HIV to see if they can ``tweak'' the immune system
into generating cells capable of keeping the virus under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients are lined up and we're ready to go,'' Ho said.
``We'll see if the vaccine will enhance the immune response.'' That
trial in New York will involve 10 patients who were given maximal
anti-HIV therapy within 90 days of infection and have been
successfully treated for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston vaccine experiment will enroll a different group of
HIV patients _ those who have been chronically infected but have
chosen not yet to begin antiviral drugs. After six months of potent
treatments, they will be given a vaccine invented by the late Jonas
Salk that consists of killed HIV that has been stripped of its
outer coat.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine experiments are expected to yield crucial
information about the feasibility of an HIV vaccine, both for
preventing and treating infection.
</P>
<P>
   Both sets of experiments should show if the immune responses
that successfully treated patients generate are enough to keep the
virus suppressed indefinitely. ``We don't believe it's necessary to
eradicate the virus,'' Walker said. ``But it would be profoundly
disappointing if this isn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago at the last international AIDS meeting in
Vancouver, Ho made headlines with a similar proposal to stop potent
antiviral drugs in a small group of promptly treated patients after
their virus was no longer detectable for some months by the most
sensitive tests of that day.
</P>
<P>
   Ho never did that experiment _ which was based on demonstrating
that the patients had been cured of HIV infection _ because
subsequent research showed that even the earliest and most potent
drug therapy could not rid any patient of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   New tests, capable of detecting as few as 50 copies of HIV in a
15th of a teaspoon of blood, have shown that many patients had not
really cleared the virus from their blood. Subsequent research
showed that, even when the virus could not be found in the blood,
it could be teased out from certain ``resting'' immune cells if
they were activated.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the time is finally ripe for doing the
treatment-stopping trial because they now have proof that the
immune system eventually rebuilds itself among individuals who got
aggressive drug treatment within weeks or months of their HIV
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Other HIV-infected individuals who are not lucky enough to have
had early, aggressive drug treatment may also achieve what
scientists are calling ``immune reconstitution.'' But for now, the
early-treated patients represent the best that state-of-the-art
AIDS care can do in suppressing HIV and allowing the immune system
to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have provided proof that the immune system is not dead'' in
HIV-infected people, Dr. Brigitte Autran of the Petie Salpetriere
Hospital in Paris. ``It is capable of being restored, even late in
the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggressively treated HIV patients often show a reversal of the
decline in key ``orchestrator'' immune cells designated CD4 _ a
hallmark of the infection. But more important to immunologists is
new evidence that these reconstituted CD4 cells can recognize HIV,
and that there is eventual return of other immune cells called
cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) capable of recognizing and destroying
any cells infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Autran Wednesday reported that 80 percent of several hundred
French patients could generate such ``memory'' cells capable of
recognizing HIV, including many with advanced AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most infections are dealt with by strong CTL responses,''
Walker noted. But CD4 cells, also called ``helper'' cells, must
tell them what to do.

HBO ADDING SIX LEWIS' BOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home Box Office announced Wednesday in London that it had
extended Lennox Lewis' contract to six fights, and it also made a
$20 million-plus offer for Evander Holyfield to meet Lewis in a
heavyweight title unification bout in December. But Jim Thomas,
Holyfield's lawyer, said the offer was sleight of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there is any offer,'' Thomas said. ``I believe
it's a media event to divert attention from the fact that they have
locked up Lennox Lewis to fight exclusively on their network, which
has made it harder to do the fight. The competitive forces in the
market can't operate now. We can't take the fight to Showtime, CBS,
ABC or Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he had not received any communication from HBO about
a possible unification bout.
</P>

something,'' Thomas said. Holyfield turned down $16 million for a

THEODORE BEAUBRUN, 79, HAITIAN COMIC AND ACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theodore Beaubrun, one of Haiti's leading comedians and actors,
died June 30 at his home in a Port-au-Prince suburb. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   He had been waging a long battle against Parkinson's disease,
said his wife, Ginette.
</P>
<P>
   Beaubrun, who was widely known as Languichatte, or cat's tongue,
captured a whole country's imagination with his comic portrayal of
everyday life in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned more than 40 years, Beaubrun delighted
generations of Haitians with his sardonic comedy on radio,
television and in films. His comedy transcended class and color
differences. He also was able to retain his popularity under the
various governments that came to power in Haiti, not a small feat
in a country where some artists were discredited and others killed
for their political associations.
</P>
<P>
   His early works were laden with political undertones, but under
the dictatorship of Francois Duvalier, Beaubrun shied away from
political satire and began to concentrate on Haitian social mores.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Port-au-Prince, the capital, on Dec. 26, 1918, Beaubrun
began his career in 1942 by publishing a weekly pamphlet of his
comic works. He later moved into theater writing and also performed
in various musicals and plays. In the 1960s, he created one of the
first Haitian television shows.
</P>
<P>
   One of his more famous routines depicted a typical middle-class
Haitian family, with the father sitting on a rocking chair reading
his newspaper, his wife sewing and his two children playing. The
father suddenly declares that if he wins the lottery his life would
consist of living in Paris, drinking champagne and courting
beautiful women. When the impertinent son asks what would happen if
the father doesn't win the lottery, the father replies, ``Well, it
would be Port-au-Prince, Haitian liquor and your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by nine children,
including his son Theodore Jr., the leader of Boukman Eksperyans,
one of Haiti's most popular bands, and eight grandchildren.

 By MICHAEL HARRISON  
 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE CZECH REPUBLIC _ Michael Roguz is 19 and comes from a small
Polish village on the border with Ukraine. Educated, articulate and
fluent in English, he could have been a translator or entered one
of the professions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he has chosen to take part in a unique experiment in car
production at the Skoda Auto plant at Mlada Boleslav, 60 kilometers
northeast of Prague.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of that experiment will appear in Britain this week
when the Skoda Octavia goes on sale. It is the most important Skoda
car launch since the Velvet Revolution swept communism away and the
Czech Republic's best-known export (after Budweiser beer) was taken
under the wing of Germany's Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the product which Skoda hopes will change its image
once and for all as the joke brand of the car market.
</P>
<P>
   If the car is as advanced as the method being used to
manufacture it, then Skoda has reason to be quietly confident.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, one of 3,000 ``guest'' workers at the plant, is paid
16,000 crowns a month for working an eight-hour shift with a
30-minute break. Although he only arrived at Mlada Boleslav three
weeks ago, he says he is enjoying life on the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   VW, which took a big gamble when it paid DM1.3 billion for Skoda
in 1991, would probably appreciate his enthusiasm but dispute his
assessment. For the Octavia line is anything but typical and, while
it may look simple, it is a showcase for some of the most advanced
techniques the car industry has ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a conventional production line, where components are
fitted to the shell of the car as it moves along, the Octavia plant
has been designed using the ``fractal'' assembly concept.
</P>
<P>
   This means that large parts of the car _ such as the dashboard
and the seat assembly and the rear axle _ are pre-assembled as one
unit and then bolted on as one.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half of the work force on the Octavia line are not
employed by Skoda at all but work for component suppliers. The line
itself is only about a third of the length of that in the sister
plant next door which makes the Skoda Felicia.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that inventories are kept to a bare minimum. This
is one step beyond ``just-in-time'' manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the automotive world is watching the experiment with
interest. Mazda of Japan is said to be planning a similar plant
while Mercedes intends to use the technique at its Swatch car
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Skoda is coy about how well the experiment is progressing.
Although the Octavia went into production in late 1996, output is
still in the buildup phase. The plan is to raise production from
90,000 to 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Farsky, director of communications, says: ``We had to have
a lot of discussions with the unions because they were afraid it
would take jobs away from them. Some people were against it because
they did not think it would work. But the experiment is succeeding.
We are producing the volume and the quality while cutting down on
lead times and costs.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof of the pudding is in Skoda's results. Last year it
produced after-tax profits of 1.9 billion crowns on sales of 90
billion crowns _ the first profit since VW took over _ and this
year the plan is to pay the first ever dividend to its German
owners.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just down to advanced production techniques. Skoda
still has the lowest labor costs of virtually any car maker in
Europe. The monthly salary that Skoda workers earn is a third more
than the national average but it is still just one-eighth of the
wages in a German car plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lower labor costs are an advantage but they are not to
last forever,'' says Farsky. ``When we took over we assumed it
would give us a edge for 10 years. It looks like it will last
longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of man-hours per car we are not as efficient as we
might be but in terms of cost per employee per car we are ahead of
other European manufacturers and even the Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   VW's priorities when it took over Skoda were to keep the name,
maintain the work force at its current size (22,000 people), raise
capacity and add another model.
</P>
<P>
   It has achieved all that but some observers question how much is
left of Skoda that is identifiably Czech.
</P>
<P>
   The Octavia was designed by a Belgian brought in from VW's Audi
unit, 60 percent of its platform (power train, gearbox, engine,
drive shaft, suspension, floor pan) is the same as that on the VW
Golf and Audi A3 and many of the key components come from VW.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Van Braekel, who arrived at Mlada Boleslav as head of
design in January 1994 disputes that Skoda has become little more
than a ``badge'' company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you see, hear and feel here is 100 percent Skoda,''
he says. To prove the argument he points to the way he designed the
Octavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have tried to do is create a bridge to the past,
before the bad days of communist control, and draw on the strengths
from Skoda's long tradition. So for instance the grille is inspired
by pre-war Skodas and the silhouette is based on the Skoda coupes
from the 1950s and 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   VW intends to invest a further DM2.4 billion in the next four
years on top of the DM2.1 billion it has already sunk in the
business with the aim of raising production to 500,000 a year _
triple the level in 1990. There are also plans for a third model, a
large car in the Audi A6 bracket.
</P>
<P>
   To pull it off will depend on persuading the Czechs that a Skoda
remains a Skoda (the marque still accounts for 57 percent of the
domestic market) while convincing west European buyers that beneath
the Skoda skin lies a body of pure German technical sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, for instance, Skoda has set itself a target of more
than doubling sales from 16,500 last year to 37,500 by the
millennium.

   TOKYO _ Even before the court ruling, Ennosuke Ichikawa III,
Japan's most famous kabuki actor, had always had a unique career.
As the hereditary successor to one of the country's most famous
acting names, he resuscitated the kabuki drama for a modern
audience.
</P>
<P>
   In his productions, the 350-year old plays become giant
theatrical spectacles, filled with sudden costume changes, jokes,
contemporary references and dominated by Ennosuke's presence as
actor, director, playwright and impresario.
</P>
<P>
   In some productions, he played as many as 18 separate roles
including demons, heroes, ghosts and women; his piece de resistance
was to ``fly'' across stage and audience supported by invisible
wires.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, the 60-year old Ennosuke broke another barrier
when he became the first Japanese ever to win legal redress against
a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   The sinister phenomenon which has dogged royalty, actors and pop
stars in the West has spread to one of Japan's most traditional
arts.
</P>
<P>
   For six and a half years, in the words of the judge, Ennosuke
``endured exceptional suffering'' from a female fan who tracked him
all over the country and obsessively followed his performances.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing him in 1992 on the southern island of Kyushu, she
followed him wherever he performed, always sitting in the front row
and wearing a brightly colored kimono.
</P>
<P>
   ``She stared at the actor, with a mask-like expression on her
face, even when other members of the audience cheered and
laughed,'' the judge, Masaharu Otani, said in his judgement in an
Osaka court.
</P>
<P>
   She told people in the audience that she was engaged to Ennosuke
and that they would soon be married. Then she began following him
on to trains and checking into the same hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Her obsessive attention, he claimed, was affecting his acting,
and in 1995 the woman was ordered to stay out of theatres where he
was performing. But the problem did not go away.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he brought a civil case against the stalker; on Monday,
Judge Otani upheld the theatre ban, ordered the woman to pay
500,000 yen compensation and forbade her from coming within 200
meters of the actor.
</P>
<P>
   Like many social problems, many people in Japan assumed until
recently that stalking was a phenomenon seen only in foreign
countries _ indeed until last year Japanese did not even have a
word for it.
</P>
<P>
   Then a young female lawyer named Fumi Akioka published the
translation of an American book on the subject. In the absence of a
native term, she used the English one in Japanized form _ the book
``Stoukaa'' was a best-seller and the word instantly entered the
language.
</P>
<P>
   Books, and television dramas with stalker story lines
proliferated, department stores sold anti-stalker merchandise and
for the first time the problem was recognized.
</P>
<P>
   There were high-profile arrests of stalkers, like the man who
was found to have a collection of 2,000 photographs of women, taken
secretly through peep holes in their homes, and a personal data
base of 2,600 names and addresses.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in May this year
revealed that one woman in four claimed to have been stalked, and
the subject was discussed in the Japanese Diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we had the word it made all the difference,'' says Fumi
Akioka, who founded the Society for Victims of Stalking. ``It
identified the problem and many people found it much easier to come
forward after that.''
</P>
<P>
   But _ until Ennosuke brought his civil case _ there was almost
nothing that the police could do, as long as the stalkers simply
followed their victims without resorting to threats or violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant progress,'' says Ms. Akioka, ``and it will
encourage other victims to take similar action. The problem is
partly one of perception _ Japanese think that stalkers go for
other people, when in fact it can happen to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is a remarkably unlitigious country and the question
remains whether the police, inexperienced in such things, can
effectively enforce the restraining order, But, for the time being
at least, it seems that the kabuki can go on. &QL;

INTRIGUE AND DEFECTION: A TALE OF 2 CO-OPS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two days after writer Joan Didion assumed the
presidency of the board of her prestigious Upper East Side co-op,
she was faced with the first crisis of her administration. The
building's superintendent, Thomas Riordan, announced that he had
been lured away by the Beresford, a larger and even more
prestigious co-op on Central Park West, home of Richard Holbrooke,
nominated as American representative to the United Nations, as well
as Beverly Sills, Tony Randall and, soon, Jerry Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't wait until she became president to resign,'' Riordan
said apologetically. ``It just happened that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ms. Didion was described by her husband, the writer
John Gregory Dunne, as too unhappy to come to the phone. ``There's
not a chance in the world that she will talk to you,'' said a
cheerful Dunne, who then assumed the role of Ms. Didion's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a spectacular super,'' said Dunne of Riordan. ``He
cleaned out the staff. He's got handymen who know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, members of the Beresford board responded to their
coup with more diplomatic caution than Holbrooke might have
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to be in a no-comment position at this point,''
said board vice president Mike Baker.
</P>
<P>
   But why? Isn't this an easy issue?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said soberly. ``It isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a peculiar but familiar New York story of ambition,
defection and betrayal, played out in the world of dinner parties
and best-selling books. At the center is the object of everyone's
affection, or affectations, the super super himself, who granted an
interview in his basement office at the East 70th Street
Didion-Dunne co-op last week. He starts the first week of August at
the Beresford.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, 42, seemed like a good guy, organized and just the
right kind of obsessive, with pictures of his four children tacked
onto the bulletin board alongside glossy photos of the co-op's new
roof. Two years ago, he midwifed its installation. ``It is
gorgeous,'' he said proudly, in his Irish lilt.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get to the point. Why is Riordan abandoning Ms. Didion for
the Beresford?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they offered me huge money,'' Riordan said.
``Money is very, very important, but for me, the Beresford, at this
point of my life, I believe is a career move. It's a bigger
challenge, it's a larger building. It's the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pantheon of New York buildings, the Beresford is indeed
on Mount Olympus. Riordan started in the foothills in 1981, when he
arrived in America as a licensed electrician from County Cork and
got a job mopping floors. He worked as a handyman and a doorman,
too. When his boss told him he might have an aptitude for
superintendent work, Riordan took courses and got licensed. Now he
has an air-pollution-control certificate, a No. 6 oil-burner
license, a standpipe certificate and a sprinkler certificate. He
also got management training.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're like the captain of a ship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Riordan worked his way up to superintendent. He
has been at the 70th Street co-op for nearly a decade. He has a
staff of 28 for 64 units, but at the Beresford will have 50 people
and 193 units. He seemed offended when asked if a threefold
increase in holiday tips affected his decision _ ``It really has
nothing to do with it'' _ and said he learned about the job from a
friend in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan had many opinions about what makes a good
superintendent, but they boil down to a cool head in a crisis and
constant attachment to a beeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be sitting right here,'' he said, ``and somebody
will say, `There's water pouring out of the elevator shaft.' And
you have to know how to respond to that without running up the
street and calling for help.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The hardest part, he said, is the lack of downtime. ``You're
constantly waiting for that phone call,'' he said. Not long ago in
Detroit, where he was attending a superintendents' association
dinner-dance, he got beeped over breakfast. No hot water at East
70th!
</P>
<P>
   Riordan talked the man on duty through the problem.
``Fortunately,'' he said, ``the boiler just needed to be reset.''
</P>
<P>
   Other qualifications are people skills. ``How do you deal with a
tenant who has just stepped into concrete?'' Riordan asked. (True
story from East 70th.)
</P>
<P>
   The wrong answer is telling the person he has just destroyed the
new sidewalk. The right answer is expressing deep concern over the
ruin of the tenant's shoes, even if you want to laugh. ``But you
can't,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, never tell a reporter the names of people in your
building, or be lured into questions about difficult residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Riordan. ``They're all wonderful people.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue now is whether Riordan will keep the retiring super's
Beresford Wall of Fame, a bulletin board of autographed photographs
of Beresford celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a burning question,'' said resident Jeff Moss, the
creator of Sesame Street's Cookie Monster. ``Will we have to
reapply?''

DANCE REVIEW: WAITING FOR A CHANCE TO TUMBLE  
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ The American Dance Festival loves to take risks,
which is why it keeps attracting dancers and audiences to its
performances on the campus of Duke University here.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, it took a big risk by offering the premiere of
``Triptych Humpty-Dumpty,'' a three-act work choreographed by David
Grenke, a member of the Paul Taylor Dance Company from 1989 to 1996
and one of this year's recipients of the festival's Doris Duke
Awards for New Work. As performed by Grenke's Thingsezisee'm
Dance/Theater at the Reynolds Industries Theater, the work was
sometimes exasperating, often compelling and always peculiar.
</P>
<P>
   Its greatest oddity was the way motionlessness became as
important as movement. For long periods, no one moved at all. And
when people did move, they didn't move much, except for moments
crammed with spasms of activity. But every outburst came to a
sudden stop.
</P>
<P>
   Although Grenke put Humpty Dumpty in his title, and Christopher
Plant's setting included a wall, there were no literal references
to that nursery rhyme character. But there were many instances of
falling.
</P>
<P>
   The taped accompaniment included a musical collage, plus new
music by Alan Lage Terricciano, played by the composer on the
piano. There were also texts by Michel Wilson Danek, Brian Frette
and two of the dancers, Mindy Cooper and Karl Herlinger.
</P>
<P>
   The first act opened with a song about suicide and murder played
while Herlinger and Grenke sat solemnly at a table and video images
by Dennis Diamond projected on the backdrop showed hands repeatedly
shifting a bottle, an ash tray and a hymnal.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Gibbons, Gina Paolillo, Elizabeth Williams and Ms. Cooper
entered, posed for long periods, then fell to the floor and rolled
like tumbleweeds. The text commented on problems of pain, loss and
the difficulties of raising children.
</P>
<P>
   The video images in the second act showed bits of the plastic
foam used to pad packages swirling like a snowstorm. The dancers
stood motionless. Yet they appeared to be expecting something.
Finally, Herlinger, keeping his back to the audience, made tiny
gestures. He scratched his brow and his neck. He raised and lowered
an arm. He crossed himself, as if in church.
</P>
<P>
   Other dancers also started moving. They slowly turned around,
tilted to the side and knelt on the ground. These deliberate
actions gave way to the tumbleweed-like rolls that were the work's
principal choreographic motif.
</P>
<P>
   While scenes of a boxing match were projected in the third act,
dancers hurled themselves at one another and against a wall or just
stood and fidgeted. And, of course, they also rolled about. The
text spoke of helplessness, the unavoidability of pain and the
death of parents.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the production, the long periods of inactivity were
disturbing. One kept wondering if anything would ever happen. When
things did happen, the actions were equally disconcerting, for the
characters now seemed rootless and adrift.
</P>
<P>
   Complete with two intermissions, ``Triptych Humpty-Dumpty''
lasted barely 90 minutes. Since that's less than many movies, one
can argue that the intermissions were unnecessary and the dance
should have proceeded without interruptions. The intermissions kept
breaking the choreographic mood, and instead of being caught up in
Grenke's visions, the audience had to keep returning to them.
</P>
<P>
   But when he successfully cast his spells, Grenke conjured up a
world in which vulnerable people eternally waited, perhaps for
Godot.

SKILES' KIND OF TOWN?  
 SUNS ASSISTANT COACH WILL TALK TO CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Chicago Bulls have asked the Suns for permission
to talk with assistant coach Scott Skiles about the Bulls' head
coaching position, league and Suns sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, contacted Wednesday in Indiana, declined to comment
about the Bulls or other teams that have contacted him this summer,
and he said he's not in any hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer, next summer, I'm not tied up into a time (to
become a head coach) or anything,'' he said. ``I'm just going
through it like everyone else does.''
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Keith Glass, would neither confirm nor deny that
Skiles has been contacted by the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put this in boldface with quotes _ No comment,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Suns officials also declined to comment. General Manager Bryan
Colangelo would only say that the club told Skiles when he was
hired that it would not stand in the way of his getting a head
coaching job if the opportunity arises.
</P>
<P>
   A Bulls spokeswoman said Wednesday that Chicago General Manager
Jerry Krause will not comment on prospective coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But sources said Skiles is among five or six candidates the
Bulls plan to contact or have contacted about the job. Others
rumored to be under consideration are Iowa State's Tim Floyd and
Kansas' Roy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, along with Indiana's Rick Carlisle and Cleveland's
Sidney Lowe, is considered one of the up-and-coming head coaching
prospects among NBA assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, who guided Chicago to six NBA championships in the
1990s, has announced that he will not return as Bulls coach.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Jackson's departure, the Bulls job could be the most
desirable in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Or the next coach could face a complete rebuilding job.
</P>
<P>
   League Most Valuable Player Michael Jordan is contemplating
whether to return, retire or play for another team.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan back, the Bulls will be a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial All-Star Scottie Pippen is a free agent who has
indicated that he probably will not be back. Dennis Rodman also is
a free agent, along with center Luc Longley and three-point
specialist Steve Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   If all return, the Bulls likely will be the team to beat again.
If they all leave, the Bulls will be in a rebuilding mode.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls aren't the only club interested in Skiles.
</P>
<P>
   Glass confirmed that the Los Angeles Clippers and Denver Nuggets
have inquired about the Phoenix assistant, who spent 10 years in
the NBA as a point guard and still holds the league record for
assists in a single game (30). He joined the Suns last season and
was Coach Danny Ainge's lead assistant.
</P>
<P>
   But Skiles, 34, was considered a hot property in coaching
circles even before that.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Suns, he served as head coach of PAOK, a
Greek professional club. He took over that team during midseason
with the club foundering and led it to the European Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been contacted directly and indirectly by some teams,''
Glass said. ``They expressed interest in various forms. I'm just
excited for him. People know what he's about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a great coach in the league. If it doesn't happen
this year, it will happen next year.'' &QL;
