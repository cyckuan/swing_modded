<P>
CAIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- German software company Logware has come to the
Middle East, opening its first offshore venture in Dubai of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) with Shafeen International as the
company's exclusive distributor for the Middle East and North
African market.
</P>
<P>
Ulf Grupe, Logware Middle East operations manager, said the
company hoped to have 500 installed systems in the Middle East by
next year, with the UAE and Saudi Arabia as the major markets for
its IT solutions aimed at retail businesses.
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East is a fast-growing market and we are confident
that we can handle the requirements for IT solutions in retail
businesses here," Grupe was quoted Sunday by the local media as
saying.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- A new 5-star hotel is under construction in the
emirate of Fujairah in the northeast of the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Saeed bin Saeed Al Sharqi, chairman of the Fujairah Tourism
Bureau, said at a tourism meeting held Sunday in the emirate.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, he also met representatives of more than 15
Russian travel agencies and discussed with them means of attracting
more Russian tourists to the emirate, reported the official WAM
news agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to introduce Fujairah to tourist representatives and
travel agencies in Russia to bring groups of tourists to visit
Fujairah," said Al Sharqi, adding that efforts are being made to
make Fujairah one of the important tourism destinations in the UAE.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The South Korean Power-Generating Authority (PGA) has
entered the tender for building a power-generating station in
northern Cairo according to the BOT system.
</P>
<P>
The PGA offer involves 600 million U.S. dollars for launching
the station, Al-Hayat daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's investments in Egypt did not exceed 130 million U.
S. dollars at present as they started a short time ago. And the
investment will hit 1 billion dollars in 2002, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will sign documents of four joint projects in the
areas of weaving, transport, communications and ship-building. The
deals involve 620 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states are
collectively studying the possibility of banning the import of
Firestone tyres due to global doubts over their technical
specifications after 63 deaths in accidents involving the tyre in
the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Saudi Arabia moved ahead of other GCC countries
by banning the import of Firestone tyres as well as new and used
vehicles fitted with them, local media reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Firestone's parent company, the Japanese group Bridgestone, was
forced to recall 6.5 million U.S.-made Firestone tyres earlier this

month. They were said to burst or peel off at speeds of 100 or 120
kilometers per hour.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes Somalia's Positive Steps Lead to End of Anarchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday expressed hope the
positive steps taken recently by the Somali people will help the
country usher in a new age that will realize national
reconciliation and end of anarchy.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the Foreign Ministry said that Egypt
will always support the Somali people and their efforts to
establish a central government and restore unity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been closely watching the developments of the Somali
national reconciliation conference held in Djibouti, the statement
said, urging the Somalis to discard differences and close ranks for
reuniting the country.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in division since 1991 when the former
president, Mohammed Siad Barre, was toppled.
</P>
<P>
Some 460 Somali representatives kicked off in May the country's
national reconciliation conference in Djibouti based on a
Djiboutian proposal. The conference established a 245-member
transition parliament on August 13, which elected Abdiqasim Salad
Hassan the Somali president. Both the parliament and the president
are the first in Somalia in a decade.

of West African States (ECOWAS) and Mali President Alpha Konare
has called for the "immediate and unconditional release" of the 12
soldiers abducted by a Sierra Leone rebel group.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by the secretariat of the 16-member
organization in the Nigerian capital Abuja, Konare condemned
vigorously the abduction of the soldiers, who wee serving under
the British training team in the war-torn west African country.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after reports that the Sierra Leonean
government and the United Nations were still in the process of
negotiating with the captors, who earlier set a number of
conditions for the release of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Konare appealed to all the parties concerned in Sierra Leone to
respect the framework of the Lome Peace Accord, signed by the
government and the rebels last July to end the country's eight-
year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, 11 Britons and one Sierra Leonean, were captured
by the rebel group, known as the West Side Boys, last Friday when
they were patrolling along the Freetown-Masiaka highway.

<HEADLINE> 13 Parties Sign Burundi Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen of the 19
Burundi warring parties Monday night signed a historic peace
agreement aimed at ending the seven-year-old civil war in Burundi
in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Among the signatories are the Burundi government, the Burundi
National Assembly, seven Hutu parties and four major Tutsi parties.
However, there are still six Tutsi parties which refuse to sign
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Burundi President Pierre Buyoya signed the 175-page Peace and
Reconciliation Agreement on behalf of his government.
</P>
<P>
The agreement contains five protocols on the nature of the
conflicts, democracy and good governance, peace and security,
reconstruction and development, and guarantees on agreement
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony at the Arusha International Conference
Center was witnessed by dozens of heads of state and government
including U.S. President Bill Clinton and representatives from the
United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
According to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who chairs the
signing ceremony, the signing of the agreement is open and any
party which has not signed yet is welcome to sign it.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, facilitator of the Burundi peace
talks and former South African president Nelson Mandela, Tanzania
President Benjamin Mkapa and Clinton all commended the concerned
parties over their achievement.
</P>
<P>
They called on the various parties to show far-sightedness and
courage and make choice in the interests of the majority of the
people. The international community will firmly support those who
seek peace in Burundi, they said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mandela strongly criticized some pro-Tutsi parties for
refusing to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, Mandela said
some pro-Tutsi parties are only concerned with their own interests,
regardless of those of the people and the nation.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks was initiated by former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere in June 1998 and have been beefed up by
Mandela since he succeeded Nyerere as the facilitator in December
1999 following the latter's death of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in
Burundi since civil war erupted in October 1993 when the country's
first democratically elected president Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu,
was assassinated by pro-Tutsi soldiers.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone, UNAMSIL Negotiate Release of Abducted Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government and
the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) have been
conducting busy negotiations with the rebel group for the safe
return of 12 abducted soldiers, according to a report reaching
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
UNAMSIL military spokesman Patrick Coker was quoted as saying
in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone that the UNAMSIL is still
continuing the dialogue with the rebel group for the release of
the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, 11 Britons and one Sierra Leonean, were captured
by the rebel group, known as the West Side Boys, last Friday when
they were patrolling along the Freetown-Masiaka highway.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers are reportedly well treated and currently "in good
conditions", Coker said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman kept his mouth shut tight over the
possibility that the UNAMSIL is prepared to use force if present
negotiations fail to secure the release of the abducted soldiers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Pays Maiden Visit to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton arrived in Tanzania on Monday afternoon for a brief yet
historic visit to the eastern African country, during which he met
President Benjamin Mkapa and witnessed the negotiations for a
peace agreement by various Burundian parties in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, the first U.S. incumbent president to visit Tanzania,
held brief discussions with his Tanzanian counterpart on issues of
mutual interest and cooperation between the two countries at the
VIP lounge of the Kilimanjaro International Airport shortly after
the touchdown of his plane.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who just finished a visit during the weekend to
Nigeria, praised Tanzania for its efforts in carrying out economic
reforms at home and bring peace to neighboring Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will encourage more foreign investment in
Tanzania, Clinton said, adding that it will also support Tanzania
in its efforts to deal with the current drought and refugee
problems.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mkapa briefed his U.S. counterpart on the
tremendous social, political and economic progress that Tanzania
has so far achieved.
</P>
<P>
These include the fiscal, financial and prudent budgetary
measures that Tanzania has continued to maintain as well as issues
related to austere steps to instill the rule of law and good
governance, especially the serious efforts taken to stamp out
corruption in the entire Tanzanian social fabric.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also witnessed the signing of an open skies
agreement between the two countries, under which each party should
grant planes of the other party the right to fly across its
territory without landing and the right to make stops for non-
traffic purposes.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania and the United States have enjoyed good relations for
many years. The American investment in Tanzania has reached 26
million U.S. dollars. Besides, the United States is rated as
Tanzania's leading single source market for tourism, with over 50,
000 American tourists coming to Tanzania in 1999, earning the
country over 55 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is Clinton's second leg of his three-nation African
trip. He left Arusha on Monday night for Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Attaches Importance to Mideast Peace Talks: Ecevit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey attaches "vital" importance
to the Middle East peace process and "is ready to do its best" to
contribute to it, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a joint news conference following his
talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who arrived in the
Turkish capital Ankara Monday for a brief working visit.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that Israel "is grateful" for Turkey's efforts and
initiatives within the framework of Mideast peace process, and will
take steps to further improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
But the two premiers did not elaborate about their talks that
diplomatic sources said focused on defense cooperation, the
Manavgat water project, through which Turkey wants to sell water to
Israel, and the faltering Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who is also defense minister,was due specifically to
discuss four major Turkish defense contracts for which Israeli
firms are bidding, his security advisor Danny Yatom said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The four projects, for which several foreign big companies are
competing, include the supply of Turkey's first spy satellite and a
fleet of 145 attack helicopters, the modernization of 160 U.S.-
built tanks, and the sale to Turkey of Israeli's airborne radar
system.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and its Jewish ally have carried out cooperations in
military training and Israeli firms have upgraded Turkish fighter
jets.
</P>
<P>
This was Barak's third visit to Turkey since he took office in
July last year. Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had visited Turkey earlier.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have exerted intensive diplomatic
efforts to to garner support in the wake of the collapse of the U.
S.-sponsored Camp David peace summit on July 25.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian summit failed to produce an agreement
maily because of the dispute over the fate of East Jerusalem,
claimed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem visited Gaza last Wednesday
and met with Arafat. The meeting was characterized by Palestinians
as "a very positive and constructive one."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has always asked Turkey to play a more
active and assertive role as a country which is heir to the Ottoman
Turks, who ruled the Middle East for almost four centuries.
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomatic sources said that Arafat had reminded Turkish
officials that the Ottoman Army's withdrawal from Jerusalem was
very recent, namely 83 years ago, in a bid to stress that Turkey
was by nature and definition an indispensable and more active
player in the region.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Arafat's remarks, Cem has indicated several times that
the status of Jerusalem "is an issue for the whole Muslims,"
certainly "a very important issue" for Muslim Turkey as well.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Barak wanted to be informed about the
Palestinian reaction to Turkey's proposals on the two thorniest
issues, including the status of Jerusalem and its holy sites, which
Cem had explained during his meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis declared that the United States is the sole
mediator on the issue of Jerusalem, obviously fearing that Turkey
will add its weight on the side of its Palestinian brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
Ankara maintains close relations with both Israel and Palestine.
Despite its diplomatic ties with the Palestinians, Turkey has also
built a strong alliance with the Jewish state since 1996 when they
signed a military cooperation deal.
</P>
<P>
The deal, causing unease among Muslim countries in the Mideast,
was viewed as part of attempts by the two countries to contain
their common rivals Syria and Iran in the region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Ankara is trying to pursue a balanced
position between its Muslim brotherhood Palestine and its Mideast
ally Israel.
</P>
<P>
During Arafat's visit to Ankara early this month, Turkish
leaders did not clearly express their supports for Arafat's would-
be unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
But they stressed Ankara's sensitivity over Jerusalem, urging
the Israeli government to review its policies over the holy places
in the city.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Set to Win in First Stage of Parliamentary Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The opposition camp, led by former
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, is set to pick up more than half of
the 63 parliamentary seats in northern and central Lebanon
provinces, local media said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Druze overlord Walid Jumblat has grabbed all eight seats
allotted to the Chouf region and most of the nine seats of the
Aley-Baabda constituency, Oriental radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government newspaper Nida Alwatan conceded defeat by
screaming "political, financial feudalism advance in first election
round," a reference to Jumblat and billionaire Hariri, pillars of a
opposition alliance swearing to oust Prime Minister Salim Hoss'
government.
</P>
<P>
The anti-government alliance, formed by Agriculture Minister
Suleiman Franjieh and Public Works Minister Najib Mikati, was
certain to win at least 13 of the 17 seats allotted to the Tripoli-
Zgorta constituency in northern Lebanon, An Nahar newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Some 600,000 voters turned out at the polls to elect a total of
63 deputies for northern Lebanon, the Christian heartland and the
Druze hinterland northeast and southeast of Beirut on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
No major security breaches were reported in most constituencies
during Sunday's 10-hour polling.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 army troops and 12,000 policemen were reported to
have guarded the polls in northern and central Lebanon as an
estimated average of 51 percent of the eligible voters cast their
ballots, undeterred by right-wing Christian calls for a nationwide
boycott to protest Syria's domination of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michel Murr said the turnout average was 46
percent in northern Lebanon and 57 percent in the Mount Lebanon
province.
</P>
<P>
In North province, 28 deputies will be picked up from 145
candidates while in Mount province 35 deputies from 141 candidates.
</P>
<P>
The rest of 65 parliament members will be chosen from the areas
of Beirut, the Bekaa Valley and the South on Sunday. The liberated
area in south Lebanon will see the fist election after a 22-year
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Official results of Sunday's parliamentary polls -- the first of
a two-stage election to fill the legislature's 128 seats -- were
expected to be announced later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is one of the few countries in the world whose elections
are run on sectarian lines, with the 128 parliamentary seats
divided equally among Muslims and Christians. The shares are also
sub-divided between each of the 18 recognized religious sects.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanese law, the current government will resign
after the formation of the new parliament. The president will
nominate a premier who has to be approved by the parliament. Then
the premier will form a new government in a month.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hit by Worst Drought in a Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Some Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) members have proposed ways to ease the severe water
shortage caused by drought, a report reaching here said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tariq Abed Lafta, head of the People's Affairs Committee in the
National Assembly, said that the legislators have suggested to cut
the water supply to garages and ice-making factories to save water.
</P>
<P>
Acute lack of water equipment has worsened the water shortage
problem, Lafta said, adding that Iraq is in urgent need of a large
number of generators to produce enough electricity to pump water to
areas lack of water.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has signed contracts with foreign countries to import water
pumps, pipes and other equipment to improve the situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the United Nations oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed
to export oil to import food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies to help offset the crippling impacts of the U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has complained that many contracts it signed with foreign
companies on purchase of equipment, materials and spare parts to
cope with drought have been put on hold by the U.N. Sanctions
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has suffered from drought for two successive years, but it
is widely believed that the drought this year is much worse than
that of the last year.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the drought this year is the most severe one
ever recorded in the past 100 years.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Reform Students Attacked in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of university students,
belonging to Iran's pro-reform student group -- the Office to
Foster
Unity (OFU), were attacked Monday by a number of assailants in
Borujere, a city in the country's western province of Lorestan.
</P>
<P>
The students were on their way back to Tehran from Khoramabad,
capital of Lorestan, where the OFU had held its seventh annual
conference in the past week.
</P>
<P>
The assailants threw stones and bricks to the buses carrying the
students, with some of them, both male and female, injured in the
attacks, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The police had to intervene in order to put an end to the
attacks, added the report.
</P>
<P>
A local official confirmed the incident and said the attacks
were organized. But he did not mention the identities of the
attackers.
</P>
<P>
The OFU, the country's most influential student group that
supports President Mohammad Khatami's reform programs, held its
annual conference in Khoramabad last week.
</P>
<P>
But the gathering resulted in a series of clashes between
supporters and opponents of the group. A policeman was reportedly
killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The group was forced to call off its meeting on Sunday, two days
before the scheduled date for ending the conference, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Rallies and demonstrations have become frequent in Iran as the
two major political factions in the country, namely the
conservative establishment and the nascent reformers, escalate
their struggle.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who are still in control of many key
government organs, have in recent months stepped up their efforts
to undermine the reformist campaign, which ended the long-time
conservative
domination of the Majlis (parliament) in February's election.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 20 pro-reform papers and journals have been
banned from publishing and a number of reformist figures have been
imprisoned on charges of violating Islamic principles and
advocating American-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, conservative radicals often disturb pro-reform allies
and launch violent attacks on pro-reform students and people.

<HEADLINE> Pleas to Lift Restrictions on UNFICYP Movement Ignored: U.N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Cypriots have so far
ignored pleas from the U.N. to lift the unilateral restrictions on
the movement of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP),
said an U.N. envoy here Monday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, U.N.
special representative in Cyprus Zbigniew Wlosowicz said that the
U.N. will draw its conclusion on the issue after evaluating all the
facts.
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure you that we have been trying to do all that we
can in order to change that. And I am still hoping we will be able
to change it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island following a short-lived pro-Athens
coup, engineered by the then Greek Junta against late President
Archbishop Makarios.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the UNFICYP has been patrolling along the dividing
line separating the Turkish troops and the Greek Cypriot National
Guards.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has taken measures in early July to
restrict UNFICYP's movement in northern Cyprus, to retaliate the U.
N. Security Council's renewal of the mandate of UNFICYP without
asking for its prior approval.
</P>
<P>
Wlosowicz said the restrictions are causing practical
difficulties to UNFICYP.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to get back to the normal way of operating and
the situation known before June 30," he said, stressing that
efforts are being made not only on the island but also at the U.N..
</P>
<P>
U.N. personnel, he said, now has to drive five to six hours
instead of 15 minutes because many of its crossing points are now
closed.
</P>
<P>
"We used to have 14 crossing points and now we have four. That
does not make our life easy and we are trying to change that,"
Wlosowicz said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Wlosowicz, who attended the
latest round of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus in Geneva
in July, is set to be in New York next month for the new round of
talks.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of indirect talks on Cyprus have been held between
the island's two sides, with an aim to prepare the ground for
substantive talks which may lead to a comprehensive settlement of
the Cyprus issue. The fourth round is due to start in New York on
September 12.

<HEADLINE> GCC FMs to Review Recent Gulf Situation: Kuwaiti FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states will review the latest situation
in the Gulf region at their 76th meeting due in Saudi Arabia next
Friday, Kuwaiti foreign minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said the meeting "will be topped
with position toward Iraq and the situation in the Gulf, the
Iranian occupation of UAE's three islands and the recent
development in the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
And the ministers will review Iraq's implementation of United
Nations resolutions related to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the GCC countries -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) -- are
unified in calling on Baghdad to implement all the U.N. resolutions
to pave the way for the lifting of the 10-year international
embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official also said the GCC position is united in
underlining the importance of Iraq's showing good intentions
towards its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting comes in a delicate period... we hope to reach
adequate recommendations to go hand-in-hand with this period,"
Sheikh Sabah said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the dispute over three Gulf islands between the UAE
and Iran, Sheikh Sabah said that the GCC foreign ministers will
review the latest developments in this issue, in light of the
efforts of a tripartite GCC committee instructed to work out a
mechanism for direct UAE-Iranian talks.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Pro-Tutsi Parties Refuse to Sign Burundi Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Facilitator of the
Burundi peace talks and former South African president Nelson
Mandela Monday night accused pro-Tutsi parties of being reluctant
to sign a historic peace agreement aimed at ending the seven-year-
old civil war in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, Mandela said
the pro-Tutsi parties are only concerned with their own interests,
regardless of those of the people and the nation.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks was initiated by former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere in June 1998 and have been beefed up by
former South African president Nelson Mandela since he succeeded
Nyerere as the facilitator in December 1999 following the latter's
death of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in
Burundi since civil war erupted in October 1993 when the country's
first democratically elected president Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu,
was assassinated by pro-Tutsi soldiers.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Member States Urged to Attract Direct Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Commerce, Trade and
Industry Minister William Harrington Monday urged the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) member states to
tackle the issues of low levels of direct investment and the
unequal distribution of inflows as a matter of priority.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day COMESA workshop on the establishment of
a regional investment facility here in Lusaka, Harrington said
investment inflow in Africa has been the lowest on a global scale
among the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It declined from 9.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 to 8.3
billion dollars in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the COMESA member states to strengthen political
and macro-economic stability in the region so that foreign direct
investment can be increased.
</P>
<P>
The continent remains a highly profitable investment
destination as companies receive rates of return on their
investments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier, COMESA Secretary-General Erastus Mwencha
commended the Foreign Investment Advisory Service, a joint
facility of the International Finance Corporation and the World
Bank, for organizing the workshop that aims at attracting
investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
This would also help in the joint tackling of poverty and
unemployment in the region as a whole, he said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Peace -- Melody of Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhao Yi
</P>
<P>
Djibouti, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Somalia, the Horn of Africa
country which has been under the cloud of civil war and anarchy
since 1991, is highly expected to return to peace and national
reconciliation because of the success of the on-going Somali Peace
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Former Djibouti president Hassan Gouled Aptidon told Xinhua in
an exclusive interview here on Monday that the Somali Peace
Conference, the 13th since 1991, is the final solution to end
anarchy in the country.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that the long-standing Somali problems are by
no means easy to be solved, Gouled indicated that all the disputes
among the different clans and factions can be solved through
dialogues and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"A strong desire for peace is prevailing in the country, and
has become an impetus to the process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gouled, who is well over 80, retired last year. He initiated
the first and second Somali peace conference in 1991, and devoted
himself to the Somali peace process when the neighboring country
was bogged down in turmoil after the downfall of former president
Mohamed Sirad Barre.
</P>
<P>
Somalia used to be a beautiful and rich country, but now many
people are suffering from starvation because of the civil war
provoked by warlords, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Somalis are disgusted at the turmoil situation in Somalia.
Between 80 and 85 percent of the Somalis have long been looking
forward to escaping from the controls of warlords who have been
creating chaos," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the on-going Somali peace conference, which
started on May 2 under the auspices of his successor, current
Djibouti President Ismael Omar Guelleh, Gouled expressed belief
that Djibouti has been the most appropriate country in helping
solving Somali problems.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti is the only country in the world where the people also
speak Somali language and inherit the traditions and social
customs of the Somalis, he said, noting that language barrier has
often discounted the result of the mediation.
</P>
<P>
"We communicate with Somali representatives with the same
language, thus having made each other well understood," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although we spent a lot for the meeting and encountered
numerous difficulties, we are glad to see that our efforts have
been crowed with success," he said. "Peace will come to realize in
the Horn of Africa country after the conclusion of the Somali
peace conference. We will see a stable Somali government
functioning in the country after four months."
</P>
<P>
The retired president rejected the predictions by some that the
new Somali government would unavoidably clash with the warlords
scattering from south to north in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a new round of civil war between the warlords
and the new government is imminent, because different clans and
parties in Somalia have started to narrow their differences
through the dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the independence of northern Somaliland,
Gouled said although Mohamed Ibrahim Egal declared many years ago
the independence of Somaliland, he did not have the right to split
the country.
</P>
<P>
The current confrontation between the north and the south
Somalis does not mean that their problems could never be solved,
he said. "So long as the leaders of the two sides speak out their
problems, we can surely help them solve the differences. "
</P>
<P>
Gouled also denied the possibility of war between the Rahanweyn
Resistant Army, a main military force under the newly established
parliament's control, and Hussein Mohamed Aidid, a well-known
warlord in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The parliament-elected Somali President Abdqasim Salad Hassan
and Aidid are from the same region and the same clan, and bear
relative relationship. It is quite possible for them to have a
peace talk and seek a common ground over reconciliation, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the overwhelming majority of the Somali people, men
and women, old and young, are opposed to any attempt of the civil
war, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that all the Somali war refugees inside and
outside Somalia are thinking about the resumption of peace and
returning home as early as possible, and the warlords have no way
to stop the demonstration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the future of Somalia, Gouled said "instead of
selling arms to the warlords, every country in the world should
make contributions to the reconstruction of Somalia."
</P>
<P>
He urged the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity
and the Arab League to deliver the reconstruction plans made by
the new Somali government to friendly donor countries as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old civil war have destroyed hospitals, schools,
roads and many other infrastructure of the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In concluding the interview, the retired president reiterated
that "I am not the God. But I can say the situation in Somalia is
very instrumental to peace process."

<HEADLINE> European Journalists to Help Correct Zimbabwe's Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of European journalists,
having seen for themselves what Zimbabwe has to offer as a tourist
destination, have taken the initiative to correct the country's
battered image and market it abroad.
</P>
<P>
The 10 nationals working for daily newspapers and tourist
publications from Austria, Switzerland and Germany have been in
the country for the past nine days, during which they visited
several tourist resorts including the Victoria Falls in
northwestern Zimbabwe, which is one of the seven wonders of the
world.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the eve of their departure, they held a meeting with
Zimbabwe's Environment and Tourism Minister Francis Nhema for one-
and-half hours, after which they pledged to repair the negative
perception with which Zimbabwe is being viewed abroad, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We want to tell Europe that Zimbabwe is not as bad as is being
portrayed. Because of the bad publicity, Europeans now think that
white farmers in Zimbabwe are not only being killed, but being
thrown out of the country as well," said Franz Josef Jedek, leader
of the group.
</P>
<P>
At least five white farmers were killed in violence leading to
the June 24-25 parliamentary election, but Jedek said the picture
created in Europe was much worse than what was on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, Zimbabwe's tourism sector generates
about 200 million U.S. dollars annually, but tourism officials
Monday said between 55 and 60 percent of the normal tourism
arrivals came into the country between January and August this
year.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Nhema noted that due to the bad publicity,
the perception overseas was that Zimbabwe was "burning".
</P>
<P>
"Many of these small incidents are over-dramatized," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We have had incidents of violence over land re-distribution,
but violence is not a policy of the government," he said, noting
that "it is difficult to share land, where for instance the land
has been unfairly distributed over the past 100 years."
</P>
<P>
Whites, who constitute 1 percent of the total population,
currently own 70 percent of Zimbabwe's best land.

<HEADLINE> S. African Defense Minister Slams Attack on Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Attacks on two senior South
African National Defense Force officers was a sign of a sick
society, said Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota in a statement on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Expressing shock and disgust at the attacks, Lekota said he had
instructed SANDF chief General Siphiwe Nyanda to urgently
institute an inquiry into the two incidents taking place on August
18 and Last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Sergeant-Major Moses Mangalo, who was
investigating the disappearance of 2000 AK47 rifles from the army,
was attacked under mysterious circumstances on August 18 and
admitted to a Military Hospital with a cracked skull.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, defense intelligence Brigadier Amos Lingisi, who
reportedly had information about those responsible for the theft
of the rifles, was also attacked in Durban and is still in a coma
at an unnamed hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Star newspaper reported on Monday that senior defense
officials believed the attacks on the two men were linked.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, colleagues, friends and family of Mangalo who
regained consciousness on Monday, expressed fear that he might be
poisoned in hospital.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Fire Service Confirms TV Tower Fire Put Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The fire raging in Moscow's
Ostankino television tower for over 24 hours has been extinguished
by 5:40 p.m. Moscow time (1340 GMT) Monday, the city fire service
announced Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters examined the TV tower all the way from the 63-
meter mark up to the 357-meter peak and found no sources of
ignition, the Interfax news agency cited Leonid Korotchik, chief
of the state fire-fighting service, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A short circuit is most likely the reason for the TV tower fire,
according to a preliminary investigation by law enforcement
officers at the scene.
</P>
<P>
The short circuit could have been caused by overloaded, worn-
out equipment or neglect for operational procedures.
</P>
<P>
The final answer to what led to the fire will be given by a
special commission on the elimination of the after-effects of the
blaze and by the operative group investigating the Ostankino
disaster, said Korotchik.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports, two people killed by an elevator
drop in the fire have been identified as Col. Vladimir Arsyukov,
deputy chief of the fire service of the city's Northwestern
District, and elevator operator Svetlana Loseva, said the press
service of the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Spending Surges in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Americans' consumer spending
surged 0.6 percent in July, sharply outstripping personal income
and pulling the nation's personal savings rate to a record monthly
low, the Commerce Department reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, increased 0.3 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
In June, Americans' incomes and their spending grew by 0.4
percent each.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income, personal income after taxes, rose in July by
0.3 percent, matching the gain posted the month before.
</P>
<P>
All that spending drove down the personal savings rate, savings
as a percentage of after-tax income, to a negative 0.2 percent in
July, the lowest monthly rate ever. In June, the rate stood at a
positive 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the last 14 months to slow economic growth and keep inflation
under control.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Fed decided not to raise interest rates for a
seventh time, but held the door open to possible action in the
future, citing concerns that the tight labor market could spark
wage and price inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
Monday's report showed that Americans' spending on durable
goods, such as cars and other costly manufactured goods expected
to last at least three years, increased by 0.8 percent in July.
That followed a 0.1 percent drop in June.
</P>
<P>
Spending on nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, grew by a
solid 0.5 percent last month, down from a 0.7 percent increase in
June.

the departure of Chevenement from the Jospin cabinet as well as
his replacement will be announced on Tuesday by a communique of

<P>
As a rule, Chevenemenbt should formally present his resignation

The decision for Chevenement's departure was made during his

As the head of the Citizens' Movement Party who joined the

<HEADLINE> Nestle Joins Swiss Holocaust Settlement with Jewish Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Nestle will contribute to the
settlement negotiated between the Swiss banks and the Jewish
organizations over Holocaust-era claims dating from World War II,
the Swiss food company announced Monday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Nestle said it would make available 25 million Swiss francs (
about 14.6 million U.S. dollars) toward the total settlement
amount of 1.25 billion dollars approved by US Judge Edward E.
Korman.
</P>
<P>
"It is either certain or it may be assumed that some
corporations of the Nestle Group that were active in countries
controlled by the Nazi regime employed forced laborers," Nestle
said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss food company expected that this contribution would
cover all possible legal claims that might be raised against it
both in Switzerland and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Nestle has not admitted to using forced labor, claiming that
the companies concerned were only acquired after the war, but said
it is taking part in the settlement because it felt morally
obliged to do so.
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes just days after a deadline expired for
Swiss companies to take part in the settlement. Firms that used
slave labor during the Second World War were given until last
Friday to join the agreement in exchange for protection from any
future legal action.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 settlement between Swiss banking giants, UBS and
Credit Suisse, and Jewish groups was formally approved last month
by US district court judge, Edward Korman, paving the way for a
distribution plan to be drawn up by September 11.
</P>
<P>
Payments to claimants are not expected to start until the end
of the year. Former slave laborers, war refugees turned away from
Swiss borders, Gypsies, homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses could
also benefit.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes Hostages In Sierra Leone Be Released Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan said "they (officials) are talking
to the rebels who have taken these soldiers. And there are
expectations that they will be released and progress will be made,
and I hope that will be the case."
</P>
<P>
"I think we cannot ignore or condone this tendency in Sierra
Leone for rebels to take peacekeepers hostage. And as you know, we
are taking steps to strengthen the peacekeepers, to give them the
tools that they need to be able to defend themselves and their
mandate," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"And I think the rebels have to be careful not to go around
believing that it is easy to take peacekeepers as hostage, because
they do have robust rules of engagement and they are going to be
defending themselves. And I hope they (rebels) will be dissuaded
from pursuing this tack," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British soldiers, part of a contingent of about 400 who are
training a new Sierra Leone army, went missing on Friday in the
Masiaka-Forodugu area some 100 kilometers east of Freetown, the
capital of the country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges to Strengthen U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday urged to strengthen the United Nations
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) to 20,500 personnel to help the
government to regain control of the country from rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said he believes
that the priority tasks can largely be achieved under the current
U.N. mandate, provided the U.N. mission receives necessary
resources and support from member states.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief called for strengthening the force to 20,500,
including 260 military observers, and for extending the mission's
mandate, which expires on September 8, for another six months.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the rebels continue to control large parts of the
country and the threat they pose to government forces, U.N.
peacekeepers and the general population should not be
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
"The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) is believed to have
a strength of several thousands fighters. It is relatively well-
equipped and, in spite of divisions between some groups, maintains
a relatively-well established system of command and control," the
U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
The additional troops will enable the United Nations force to
strengthen its presence, first with two infantry battalions
deploying at key locations in eastern and western Sierra Leone,
and then gradually eastward with three additional battalions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the U.N. chief said, the force may be required
to deploy to other key areas not under government control,
including the main diamond producing areas.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the mission's peacekeeping role, Annan said "it
should be made clear to all hostile armed groups that UNAMSIL,
while fully committed to its peacekeeping objectives, has the
means and determination to use force when attacked or challenged."
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to support the
mission and help promote a political solution in the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
RUF rebels reignited Sierra Leone's nine-year civil war in May
by seizing about 500 U.N. peacekeepers which severely embarrassed
the United Nations and prompted a reassessment of the U.N. mission.
UNAMSIL was established in October 1999.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Adjourned Over Sensitive Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Lockerbie
trial was adjourned on Monday after the defense team asked for
more time to study the sensitive documents released by the CIA of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers asked for more time to scrutinize the new
information released by the American secret service to prepare
their cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
The defense had until now only seen edited copies of some CIA
cable communications from CIA agents in Malta, where they
interviewed Abdul Majid Giaka, a Libyan secret service agent who
later became U.S. double agent.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Richard Keen said some issues would have to be
settled before CIA documents could be used as court evidence while
another defense lawyer William Taylor pointed out those which did
not tally with previous information.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution formerly gave the court as evidence the edited
copies of the cable communications, saying that the blanked-out
sections and words contain either sensitive or irrelevant
information.
</P>
<P>
Presiding judge Lord Sutherland adjourned the trial until
Tuesday saying that it was a regrettable situation but the three
judges of the trial had little choice.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Basset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima are accused
of posing as Libyan Arab Airlines employees in Malta where they
loaded a suitcase bomb onto a Frankfurt-bound plane.
</P>
<P>
The suitcase bomb was later transferred onto Pan Am Flight 103.
The mid-air explosion over Lockerbie on December 21, 1988, killed
259 people on board the Boeing jumbo and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The cable communications and the testimony scheduled to be
given by Giaka himself are expected to serve as the telling
evidence against the two accused.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says 311 Killed in U.S., UK Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday told the
United Nations that a total of 311 Iraqis had been killed and
another 927 wounded in the south of Iraq since December 1998 in
the U.S. and British bombings.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General and the president of
the Security Council, the speaker of Iraq's National Assembly,
Saadoun Hamadi, said in that time, there were 18,607 sorties flown
by United States and British warplanes from bases in Saudi Arabia
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On August 12 and 13, U.S. and British planes committed a
further crime by indiscriminately shelling civilians in civilian
residential districts and food storage warehouses in Muthanna
governorate in southern Iraq, the speaker said. This resulted in
the killing of two people and the wounding of 24 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Between the attack in December 1998 and the present, a total of
18,607 sorties have been flown in the south of Iraq by United
Kingdom and United States warplanes taking off from the territory
of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, killing 311 citizens and injuring 927
others, the speaker noted.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the flagrant violations of the Charter and
procedures of the United Nations, the Security Council has been
beset by a general paralysis and has been unable to take any
immediate collective measures.
</P>
<P>
Iraq strongly condemns these repeated acts of aggression, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Earns Another 479 Million U.S. Dollars in U.N. Oil-for-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq earned some 479
million U.S. dollars last week from exporting more than 17.2
million barrels of oil, the U.N. reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Office of the Iraq Program, which
administers the U.N. humanitarian oil-for-food program, said since
the program's current six-month period, known as "phase VIII",
began on June 9, Iraq has exported 155.7 million barrels of oil
worth more than 3.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United Nations Security Council's sanctions
monitoring panel approved one contract for the sale of Iraqi oil
under phase VIII, bringing the total of approved contracts within
the phase to 98 with a total volume of nearly 384 million barrels,
the Office said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, humanitarian supplies and equipment for the oil
industry continued to arrive normally last week, it added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. The oil-for-food program began to implement in late 1996
which was aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian situation
in the country caused by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions cannon be lifted until Iraq has destroyed all its
weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> People Have Final Say in Iran's Presidential Election: Reformer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian people will have the
final say in the next presidential election to be held in 2001,
said a prominent leader of Iran's reformist movement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The people will have the last say and there will be no need
for "disturbances and ballyhoo," said Mohammad Reza Khatami, the
younger brother of President Mohammad Khatami, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Reza Khatami heads the Islamic Iran Participation Front, the
most influential reformist party in the country. He is also vice
speaker of the reformist-controlled Majlis (parliament).
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the people will vote for President Khatami's
reform programs in the next presidential election, possibly to be
held in May.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election in 1997 and the Majlis election last
February all showed that the people have clear support for reforms,
and the people will express their wishes in the voting next year,
Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned conservatives in the country not to act against
the people's wishes. "With a clear mandate for the reform programs
in last presidential and parliamentary elections, some individuals
should not oppose the people's wishes," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami, who won an overwhelming victory in the 1997
presidential election, has announced that he will seek a second
term next year. He has also vowed to continue his political and
social reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The announcement made the conservatives nervous, as they had
just suffered another humiliating defeat in February's Majlis
election.
</P>
<P>
But with their control over such powerful organs as the
judiciary and other privileges inherited from the 1979 Islamic
revolution, the conservatives will surely exert severe pressures on
the reformers and try to stage a comeback in the 2001 election.
</P>
<P>
Reza Khatami on Monday also defended the performances of his
brother's government in the past three years, especially in the
economic area, which is often criticized by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Some people accuse the government of not doing enough on
economic issues, but the government has actually taken extensive
measures to solve economic problems over the past three years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the third five-year development plan (March 2000-March
2005) as a major achievement of the government in the economic
field.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the government is not solely responsible for
the country's economic development. In an open environment, and
with cooperation between the executive and legislative branches,
problems will be resolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, people support the government, despite its less than
complete success in some of the programs, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Bodies Found in Crashed Lift in Russian TV Tower Basement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The bodies of those who went
missing in Moscow's Ostankino TV tower fire on Sunday were found
in a crashed elevator on Monday evening, reported the Itar-Tass
news agency.
</P>
<P>
The elevator was found on the Seventh underground floor of the
tower. It lay in water, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have already called in relatives to identify the
bodies. They did not say how many corpses were found in the
elevator.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the city's fire service said an elevator believed to
have carried three people fell down to the earth during the fire
that had been raging inside the tower for more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The elevator is lying in the basement seven meters below ground,
and a counterpoise lying on the top of the elevator impeded rescue
operations, said the fire service.
</P>
<P>
The elevator is heavily compacted. Firefighters have pumped out
water that had accumulated inside the basement as the fire was
being extinguished.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Rescuers and firefighters have completed the
inspection of two elevator shafts 348 and 370 metres above the
ground in the tower crippled by fire.
</P>
<P>
They have also checked the machine room and the technical floor.
No lifts or people were found there.
</P>
<P>
Elevators did not run higher than 370 metres in the 540-meter-
high tower.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Meets on Peacekeeping Operations in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday met behind closed doors to discuss how to improve the
peacekeeping operations in the world, in Africa in particular.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda at the Monday session is "ensuring an effective
role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international
peace and security, particularly in Africa."
</P>
<P>
What is being discussed today is also the topic to be
consulted at the Security Council Summit, scheduled for September
7 at the outset of the September 6-8 Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came as the Sierra Leonean Government and U.N.
officials Monday kept up negotiations with renegade soldiers for
the release of 11 British troops held hostage since Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. observers were in daily contact with the West Side Boys --
soldiers from the former Sierra Leone army who claim allegiance to
the military junta that ruled the West African country from a 1997
coup until its ouster in early 1988.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys have demanded food, medicine and the
release of one of their leaders from prison in return for freeing
the Britons and one Sierra Leonean soldier who were captured with
them.
</P>
<P>
The detained soldiers are among some 400 British troops in
Sierra Leone to train a new army in the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Russian Architect Warns Against TV Tower Disbalance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- An outstanding Russian TV tower
designer warned late Monday that the upper part of the tower
Ostankino in Moscow may lose its balance after suffering a night-
and-day heavy fire and fall down to the earth.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubts about the current stability of the tower
itself, but I fear that its upper part -- the metal spire above
the 385 meter mark may lose its balance and drop to the ground,"
the Interfax news agency quoted Vladimir Milashevsk, chief
architect of the Moscow TV tower project, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The components of the tower were designed with a stability
ratio 2, which means that the carrying structures can stand loads
twice the weight of the tower itself, he said, supported by head
of the tower construction project, Vladimir Travush.
</P>
<P>
Milashevsky said that the tower had been designed with an eye
on possible damage to the steel cables keeping it intact from top
to bottom.
</P>
<P>
"It was designed so that even if all of the cables were cut off,
it would not mean that the building would collapse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he expressed doubts that the stability of the
metal spire attached to the concrete part of the tower at the 385-
meter level may be broken by the fire.
</P>
<P>
"The high temperatures brought about by cables burning could
have a very bad effect on the condition of the metal spire," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Interfax also cited a Russian Emergencies Ministry
official taking part in extinguishing the fire as saying that the
tower will not collapse because the central steel ropes inside it
remain intact.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Ekho Moskvy (Echo of Moscow) radio said that half
of the steel ropes supporting the TV tower have been burnt broken,
which would have destroyed the balance state of the tower as a
whole despite the fact that no dangerous deformation is visible.

</P>
<P>

<P>
Jiang urged people in Heilongjiang and Jilin to implement all
tasks set by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), work hard, make innovative progress, promote economic
growth, accelerate reforms of traditional industrial bases and

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
reiterated during a recent tour of northeast China that China will
unswervingly take economic development as its central task.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental task of socialism is to develop the productive

China (CPC) serves as a guarantee for China's modernization drive,
said Jiang, who is also the general secretary of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We are confronted with a complicated and changeable situation.
It requires all leading officials, especially senior officials, to
make a scientific judgment of the situation, properly handle all
kinds of problems and contradictions and implement the Party line,
principles and policies," Jiang said at a meeting attended by
officials in Jilin, Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said young people are the future of the nation and urged a

Economic development in the new century will be characterized
by readjusting economic structures and maintaining a sustained,
rapid and healthy development of the national economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
The next five to 10 years will be a key period for China's
economic restructuring. The country will maintain fast growth

reduce the government's intervention in economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
China will be active in building an innovative system to make
enterprises the backbone for technical innovation and scientific

<HEADLINE> Clean Fresh Water Supply to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province today started to upgrade the Dongjiang-Shenzhen water
supply project so as to ensure pollution-free water supply to Hong
Kong and its neighboring city Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The project, located in nearby Dongguan city, was built in 1964.
It has so far supplied Hong Kong with more than 11 billion cubic
meters of water, accounting for 80 percent of the fresh water to
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Long-term agricultural development along the water supply route
of the project has maintained nice ecological conditions. However,
fast economic growth in Guangdong, rapid urbanization and the
increase of migrants to the province in recent years has polluted
the water.
</P>
<P>
To deal with pollution, the province issued seven regulations
on water quality protection in the 1990s, and built 70 pollution
treatment projects between 1993 and 1997 with a total investment
of 720 million yuan (about 86.4 million U.S. dollars), keeping the
water quality up to the national standard.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said the current upgrading work will cost 4.7
billion yuan, which is expected to be finished in 2003. By laying
tunnels, all the pollutants will be prevented from entering into
the water flow, thus ensuring the cleanliness of the water going
to Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Rifang, in charge of the province's water conservation,
said that when completed, the project will be able to provide 1.1
billion cubic meters of water annually to Hong Kong, 873 million
cubic meters of water to Shenzhen, and 400 million cubic meters of
water to Dongguan's neighboring towns.
</P>
<P>
Dongjiang River is a part of the Pearl River, the main source
of the clean and fresh water for Shenzhen and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Policeman Killed in Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A policeman was killed Sunday
night in violent clashes in Iran's western city of Khoramabad, the
capital of Lorestan province, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The city has been the scene of a political violence over the
past few days between supporters and opponents of the country's
most influential pro-reform student group -- the Office to Foster
Unity (OFU), which is currently holding its seventh annual
conference.
</P>
<P>
Some people rallied in support of the conference, but opponents
to the country's reformist movement tried to disturb the rallies
and the conference itself, which led to violent clashes.
</P>
<P>
The rioters killed a policeman and wounded some others and
inflicted damages to some banks and shops, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Reza Abdollahi, a security official in the province, blamed "
opportunists" for the unrest and stressed that no political group
was involved. He said some of the rioters have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ali Tajernia, a member of the National Security and
Foreign Policy Commission in the Majlis (parliament), said Monday
that he will ask the Majlis to launch an investigation into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The situation went worse due to some interventions and
mishandling of the issue, the lawmaker said, adding that the Majlis
should probe into its root cause.
</P>
<P>
Political rifts between Iran's two major political camps, namely
the conservative establishment and the nascent reformers, have
escalated since the latter won an overwhelming victory in
February's parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who are still in control of most of the
country's state organs, have stepped up their efforts to undermine
the reformist campaign initiated by President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 20 pro-reform papers and journals have been
banned from publishing and a number of reformist figures have been
imprisoned on charges of violating Islamic principles and
advocating American-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
Rallies and demonstrations are also frequent in Iran, as
different political groups try to mobilize support from the people,
especially young students.

</P>
<P>
It said that these companies would engage only in business to

</P>
<P>
The government said that the foreign investors would be
required to divest their equity only to the extent it exceeds 74
percent to the Indian public.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Direct Investment up to 100 percent in e-commerce
activities shall remain under the automatic route and prior
approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, he added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Expects Tougher Battle after Gaining Candidates Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- New Beijing is making the first
step toward the Great Olympics after the city was chosen as one of
the five finalists to bid for the 2008 Olympic Games on Monday in
Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Those who are also shortlisted are Toronto, Osaka, Paris and
Istanbul while Bangkok, Havana, Seville, Kuala Lumpur and Cairo
were rejected by the International Olympics Committee from the
race.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, whose slogan for the bid is "New Beijing, Great
Olympics", has been widely considered the front-runner in the race.
</P>
<P>
"Among the finalists, Beijing is the only candidate from a
developing country. This shows that China has earned the
recognition from the international community," said He Zhenliang,
member of the IOC executive board at Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
"Although the bid acceptance was measured technically, that
Beijing which was named as one of five finalists suggested that
the city is fully in a position to host a wonderful Olympic Games.
"
</P>
<P>
Keeping in memory the bitter lesson of losing to Sydney in a
two-vote margin for the 2000 Games, Beijing bid committee, however,
showed cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
Expressing greetings to the other finalists, the committee said
that a tougher battle for the quadrennial games has just begun.
</P>
<P>
"It is just the beginning of a harder campaign. The competition
will get more and more intense," said Wang Wei, Secretary General
of the Beijing 2008 Olympics Games Bid Committee. "We must step up
our effort and try to gain the initiative in the next stage."
</P>
<P>
"It is not surprise for other finalists to get through the bid
acceptance, considering their rich experience in hosting major
events and advanced infrastructure," added Wang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Wang said that Beijing will carry on their bid in
terms of the guidance of the IOC in the next stage.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Aling in U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Open begins on
Monday with defending champions Andre Agassi and Serena Williams,
though ailing, among the favorites.
</P>
<P>
Struggling with a sore back, top-ranked Agassi ended his
preparation for the season's final Grand Slam event by losing to
Alex Corretja last week in the Legg Mason final. At the same
event, Agassi and partner Sargis Sargsian were beaten by Jared
Palmer and Alex O'Brien in the doubles final.
</P>
<P>
"It was a good week for me in many ways," Agassi said, "I got
to play some matches, and I got to ask my back to hold up in
singles and doubles. I've got to say it was good."
</P>
<P>
Agassi opens with wild card Alex Kim tonight in Arthur Ashe
Stadium in New York. "Any arena that you win in leaves you with
excitement and momentum no matter where things are when you return
a year later."
</P>
<P>
Former champion John McEnroe expects Agassi to meet No. 4 seed
Pete Sampras in the semifinals. No. 2 Gustavo Kuerten and No. 3
Magnus Norman are bracketed to meet in the other semifinal. No. 6
seed Marat Safin and No. 12 Juan Carlos Ferrero and unseeded Pat
Rafter, a two-time champion, are among the other contenders.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, Serena Williams' challengers include her
streaking big sister Venus, the No. 3 seed and two former
champions of No. 1 Martina Hingis in 1997 and No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport in 1998. No. 5 Serena beat Davenport in Los Angeles
early this month, but her nine-match winning streak ended last
week when she was forced to retire against Hingis in the du
Maurier final, trailing 0-6, 6-3, and 3-0.
</P>
<P>
The Williams sister hope to make the season's final Grand Slam
event a family affair by meeting in the final. "That would be a
dream come true," said Venus who missed playing her sister in last
year's final, losing to Hingis in the semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Wimblendon champion Venus is the favorite as she has a 19-match
winning streak. She won her fourth consecutive title on Saturday,
defeating No. 6 Monica Seles 6-2, 6-4 in the Pilot Pen in New
Haven.

<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the Olympic Dream Pathway at the
Olympic Park in Sydney, Hollway said the Games would leave
Australia a rich legacy, not just in terms of bricks and mortar.
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged Australians to become more involved in the
Olympics, which belonged to the public and the community, not the
International Olympic Committee and the athletic federations.
</P>
<P>
"It's true that before we get to the legacy we have to get to
the delivery of the Games themselves," he said. "Once the Games is
behind us, and hopefully a magnificent Games, the question does
arise what legacy is left.
</P>
<P>
"I do believe there will be a substantial legacy in changing
how this country does business," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be a marked boost to Australia's self-
esteem and self-confidence in bringing this off," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Dream Pathway, featuring more than 20,000 bricks
bearing the names of people who supported the project, marks the
completion of another stage of the Homebush venue.

HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The total assets of the
Exchange Fund of Hong Kong amounted to 982.8 billion HK dollars (
128 billion U.S. dollars) as at July 31, 2000, announced the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure is included in the Exchange Fund Abridged Balance
Sheet, which is released on a monthly basis together with the
Currency Board Account.
</P>
<P>
At the end of July 2000, the total assets of the Exchange Fund,
at 982.8 billion HK dollars, were 26.6 billion HK dollars (3.4
billion U.S. dollars) higher than at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Both foreign currency assets and Hong Kong dollar assets
increased by 16.4 billion HK dollars (2.1 billion U.S. dollars)
and 10.2 billion HK dollars (1.3 billion U.S. dollars)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign currency assets was primarily due to an
increase in the amount of repurchase agreements outstanding at the
end of the month, according to HKMA.
</P>
<P>
The increase in Hong Kong dollar assets reflected an increase
in the market value of Hong Kong equities that was partly offset
by a decrease in placements by other government funds.

<HEADLINE> HK to Launch Trial Employment Scheme for Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Labor Department
announced Monday that it will launch a new trial placement scheme
on September 1 to encourage employers to offer job vacancies to
disabbled people.
</P>
<P>
Under this scheme, the Selective Placement Division of the
Labor Department will refer suitable job seekers with a disability
to fill the vacancies offered by participating employers for a one-
month trial placement.
</P>
<P>
"During this period, placement officers will actively follow up
on the performance of the employees and assist them to settle in
the jobs as soon as possible," Siu Lap-kei, a senior labor officer,
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Participating employers will receive a financial incentive
amounting to 50 percent of the wages paid to the employee during
the trial period. The maximum subsidy will be 3,000 HK dollars (
385 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Certificate of Appreciation will be awarded to employers who
continue to employ the disabled employees for at least another
month after the trial period. Employees who have successfully
completed the trial placement will also be presented with a
Certificate of Commendation.
</P>
<P>
The trial scheme is the extension of an earlier pilot scheme
for job-seekers who are mentally handicapped. The pilot scheme,
launched in April 1998, proved to be very successful as about half
of the 199 participants were offered permanent employment after
the trial placement period.

billion U.S. dollars and the external current account deficit was
below one percent of the Gross Domestic Product, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the new impulses of the growth have
emerged from the private sector with private capital formation
moving up, financed primarily by private savings.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that there were many concerns over the
country's economy. The fiscal position has not been strong enough
to share the burden of macro-economic adjustment. The variability
in both output growth and the inflation rate continued to exist.

<HEADLINE> IOC Selects Five Finalist in Bidding for 2008 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Five cities,
including Beijing, Toronto, Osaka, Paris and Istanbul were chosen
as finalists to host the 2008 Olympic Games after the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) trimmed the preliminary
field of 10 cities on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IOC's executive board rejected Bangkok, Havana, Seville,
Kuala Lumpur and Cairo from the race to bid in the next stage.
</P>
<P>
The IOC reduced the number of cities as part of its reforms to
the bidding process brought about by the corruption and bribery
scandals surrounding Salt Lake City's successful bid to stage the
2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
The winning bid is scheduled to be announced next July at the
IOC congress in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said Beijing, Osaka, Paris and Toronto "reached an
overall grade above the established benchmark" for Olympic bid
cities.
</P>
<P>
The board also accepted a recommendation of a working group to
include Istanbul, making a third consecutive bid, as a fifth
candidate city.
</P>
<P>
On another issue, the IOC board gave final approval to
introducing tests for the banned performance-enhancing drug
erythropoietin, or EPO, at the upcoming Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The tests were endorsed Sunday by the IOC juridical commission,
which found no legal impediments to using the controls and
recommended their final approval Monday by the executive board.
</P>
<P>
A combined urine and blood test for EPO was backed earlier
this month by the IOC medical commission and outside scientific
experts. But final authorization was required by the legal
commission and executive board.
</P>
<P>
The field for the 2008 Games will include cities from Asia,
Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, which lost by two vote to Sydney in the 1993 ballot
for the 2000 Games, is widely considered the city to beat.
</P>
<P>
The five finalists are now classified as official candidate
cities. The IOC will appoint an evaluation commission to visit the
sites and prepare a report assessing their capabilities.
</P>
<P>
EPO, the drug at the heart of the Tour de France doping
scandal in 1998, is believed to be widely used by athletes in
endurance events such as long-distance running, swimming and
cycling.
</P>
<P>
Injected in synthetic form, EPO enhances stamina by increasing
the number of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles.
Experts say it can improve performance by up to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
French researchers developed a urine test which can provide
direct proof of EPO use, while Australian scientists devised a
blood test which offers indirect evidence.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, an athlete will be considered guilty of EPO use
only if both tests are positive.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has said it plans to test at least 300 athletes for
EPO in Sydney, and possibly as many as 700. Testing would begin on
September2, the day the athletes' village opens, and continue
until the closing of the games October 1.

LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The executive
board of the Internatinal Olympic Committee (IOC) approved to
introduce tests for the banned performance-enhancing drug
erythropoietin, or EPO, at the upcoming Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on recommendation from the IOC Juridical
Commission, according to the IOC press release. Thus, during the
Sydney games, test consists of two elements, analysis of blood and
urine samples.
</P>
<P>
When both such elements are positive, the IOC said, the test
shall constitute a positive case of doping. Only one blood sample
of about 10 mls shall be required for purposes of the test, not
the usual "A" and "B" samples as are used for urine samples.

visiting Vice-Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra of Thailand
here today and exchanged views on drug trafficking and related
issues.

Luo briefly introduced China's stance and efforts on
eliminating drugs, stressing China and Thailand, as close
neighbors have been working hard to stamp out the problem and they
should work closely together in dealing with drug trafficking.

Sukhumbhand said both Thailand and China are near the Golden
Triangle Area. For this reason, it is necessary that both
countries work closely together.
</P>

who arrived earlier today for a four-day official visit, Tang
expounded on China's stance on the scientific investigation by
Chinese ships in the disputed waters that involve China and Japan.

have not yet reached a common understanding on the demarcation of
boundary lines in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers believe it is important for the two countries
to safeguard friendship and increase mutual trust, therefore they
agreed in principle that either side might inform the other in the
future about its scientific investigation activities in the
disputed waters.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that mutual information is an independent act of
either side, which would not affect China's position on the
demarcation of boundary lines in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers agreed that discussions would be held through
diplomatic channels about the specific principle and content for
mutual information.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government on
Monday sets programs in a bid to accelerate the on-going economic
recovery process.
</P>
<P>
The programs include creating financial stability, increasing
the people's social welfare to strengthen political and social
stability, developing small and medium industries, increasing
farmers' welfare and productivity.
</P>
<P>
The programs made by an economic meeting will prioritize the
equity-based recovery instead of loan-based recovery, increase
exports, launch the value-creation privatization program, carry
out the economic decentralization and safeguard fiscal balancing,
optimize the using of natural resources as well as accelerate
corporate and banking restructuring programs.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs
Rizal Ramli said that the government will finalize the draft of
the programs by next Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The office of coordinating ministry for economic affairs has
instructed economic ministers to make the program successful by
setting the supporting programs, arranging action agenda and make
target of achievement," Ramli told a press conference on Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the country's currency of rupiah has regained
strength as it traded at the level of 8,200 per U.S. dollar on
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that negative perceptions (made by market) on the new
cabinet is baseless. I am optimistic that the rupiah will keep
strengthening as the above programs are launched," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramli also said that his side has asked economic
ministers to prepare themselves to conduct exchange of ideas with
the economic multilateral organizations such as the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
"The office of coordinating ministry for economic affairs is
optimistic that the cooperation between the government and the
economic multilateral institutions will bring benefit to all of us.
Both for the Indonesian government and the multilateral
organizations, the most important thing is (for) the benefit for
the Indonesian people," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sticks to "One China" Policy: Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Monday that the Philippine government will
continue to follow the "One China" Policy.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made the remark at the presidential palace Monday
afternoon when he received credentials from Wang Chunqui, newly-
appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the
People's Republic of China to the Republic of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries in June 1975, the two have steadily
grown closer to each other.
</P>
<P>
"This is manifested in the exchange of high level visits," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji visited
the Philippines in 1996 and 1999 respectively. Estrada and
Philippine Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo paid visits to
China earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Estrada spoke highly of a Joint Statement on the Framework of
Bilateral Cooperation in the 21st Century signed between the two
countries last May, calling it "a milestone in our relations'
history."
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the two sides may have had differences, he
said, "but we have always agreed that these differences are best
resolved through peaceful dialogue and consultations."
</P>
<P>
"We have also resolved that our differences should not hinder
the development of our relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang, on his part, said that over the past 25 years, the Sino-
Philippine relations, based on the five principles of peaceful
coexistence, have witnessed steady development, which he said has
not only benefited the two peoples feasibly but also contributed
to the peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that through joint efforts by the two
governments and peoples, the cooperative relations of good
neighborliness and mutual trust between the two countries will
enjoy a stride in the new century.

<HEADLINE> Maize Prices to Remain Low in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times of Zambia Monday quoted ACE general manager Hans Brammer
as saying here at the weekend that there are no sales taking place
on the commodity exchange, due to lack of money on the market to
boost the sale of the commodity.
</P>
<P>
The other factor to keep maize prices low is the fall in demand
for maize, staple food for the Zambians, he said.
</P>
<P>
The market is saturated with maize hence some farmers have
resorted to selling it at cheaper prices, according to the local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Brammer said other factors that have made maize buying
unattractive are the current high transportation costs, unstable
foreign exchange rate and rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
Brammer is however optimistic that after the just ended Zambia
National Farmers Union congress, modalities could be worked out to
boost the maize prices.

<HEADLINE> EU to Check Uganda's Conditions for Fish Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Ministry of
Fisheries confirmed that the European Union (EU) will send an
inspection mission from October 2 to 6 to Uganda to check
conditions for its fish export to EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU mission will assess how far Uganda has fulfilled the
conditions that were set when the ban for fish export was
provisionally lifted on August 4, according to a press release
from the ministry Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the requirement for the EU market has been met and the
EU inspection mission in October will find evidence on the ground,
" said the release.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fisheries Resources has provided a list of
official landing sites that handle fish for export, said the
release.
</P>
<P>
It said that there is a program for improvement of the fish
landing sites in both short-term and long-term, adding that the
landing sites need a bit of improvement but are generally
compliant.
</P>
<P>
The fish ban was imposed on Uganda's exports March last year,
citing poor hygiene, sanitation and the presence of pesticides in
the fishing waters. The ban cost the country close to 100 million
U.S. dollars of direct exports, revenues to the government,
incomes to fishermen and other related activities.

<HEADLINE> Security to Be Intensified at Sydney's Olympic Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Security at Sydney's Olympic
site will be raised a notch from Tuesday following an intensive
police and army sweep of the massive Main Press Center (MPC),
organising officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Journalists and photographers covering the Games will be
subject to detailed searches after the 40,000-square-meter site
receives a final security clearance.
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of the expected 5,500 working media are
currently using the venue, and Tuesday's nine-hour sweep is part
of a process encompassing the whole Olympic park, which will
culminate on Friday.
</P>
<P>
MPC venue commander Superintendent Frank Hansen compared the
security measures in the press centre to those of an airport, with
journalists and photographers subject to magnetic scanning via an
x-ray machine from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't anticipate finding anything but it's a precautionary
thing," Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
"(From) a layman's point of view, it's very similar to the
protection that's run in airports."
</P>
<P>
The media center, made up of six pavilions and two temporary
structures, is the size of six football fields and cost 25 million
Australian dollars (14.75 million U.S. dollars)to build.
</P>
<P>
The world's media will descend on the center leading into the
start of the Games on September 15.

<HEADLINE> China's Biggest SEZ Offers Experience for "Developing West" Drive ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A local lawmaker said the
development of Hainan, China's youngest and also biggest special
economic zone (SEZ), could offer precious lessons for the country'
s campaign to open up its western regions.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua today, Mao Zhijun, vice chairman of
Hainan Provincial People's Congress, said that Hainan's experience
shows the development of a region could not be successful by
solely relying on preferential policies given by the state.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative to develop local industries and local
economies in a well-organized and step-by-step manner at a time
when a large amount of outside investment flows in," said Mao.
</P>
<P>
China now has five special economic zones -- Shenzhen, Xiamen,
Zhuhai, Shantou and Hainan, all in the southern coast. The first
four were set up in August 26, 1980 and celebrated their 20th
anniversary last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hainan became a special economic zone in April 1988. The
Chinese government also approved special preferential policies in
the early 1990s for the development of the Pudong New District in

<P>
Hainan, a former prefecture under Guangdong Province, used to
be one of the China's poorest and most backward regions. In 1987,
its revenue was only 270 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since it became a province and also a SEZ in 1988, Hainan has
witnessed a great economic boom but also sustained setbacks in
economic development.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 years, some 13.33 billion U.S. dollars of
investment flew into the island, 6.7 billion U.S. dollars of it
overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
In 1988 alone, Hainan registered more than 10,000 new companies.
And in the four years that followed, the island witnessed a growth
of 30 to 40 percent in its gross domestic product annually. It
even had the highest economic growth in the country in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the 3,400-square-kilometer province has become one of
the most popular tourist destinations in China. It has two
international airports, one in Haikou, the provincial capital, the
other in Sanya on the southern tip of the island. It also boasts a
highly developed expressway network.
</P>
<P>
High-rise buildings have mushroomed in major cities and people
from other parts of the country flocked to Hainan to seek their
fortune by starting up new businesses.
</P>
<P>
However, most investors pumped huge investments into real
estate developments to reap short term profits, turning Hainan
into one of the worst "bubble economy" in China.

<HEADLINE> China's Biggest SEZ Offers Experience for "Developing West" Drive ( 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chi Fulin, head of the Hainan Reform and Development Institute,
said through adjusting efforts in the past few years, the island
province has got rid of bubble economy and moved into a period of
economic recovery and growth since 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Hainan's GDP growth rate rose from 7.8
percent from 1998 to 8.2 percent in 1999, slightly higher than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
"In the next step, Hainan must turn its unique natural resources
into economic benefits so it can realize a double-digit GDP
growth."
</P>
<P>
Though Hainan has not met its pre-set development goal as a
special economic zone -- attaining or even surpassing the level of
economically developed regions in the country by the turn of the
century, it has shown potential in developing tourism.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, more than nine million people visited Hainan. Tourism
earnings accounted for 15 percent of Hainan's GDP and it is
estimated the proportion will rise to 20 percent in five years.
</P>
<P>
"As new industries in Hainan are adapting themselves to the
international market, inflow of overseas funds and advanced
management expertise will help raise the province's economic
development," said Mao Zhijun, who also served as vice governor of
Hainan.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Hainan's tourism sector have been expanding
markets in Europe and America. And cooperation with Taiwan experts
in developing subtropical agriculture is getting along quite well.
</P>
<P>
China is considering exploring oil and gas resources in the
South China Sea with multinationals, and Hainan will become an
important base for processing the offshore oil and gas, Mao said.

Addressing a national working meeting on the old-aged today, Li,

</P>
<P>
The Party and government must safeguard the legitimate rights
of the elderly, he stressed.

Li said it is essential to resolve some urgent issues that have
far-reaching significance. Priority should be given to the
establishment of a social security system for the benefit of the
old people and improve it.

<P>
Cities and townships should do their best to set up the old-
aged security system that provides basic old-aged insurance and
basic medical insurance, among others.
</P>
<P>
In the rural areas, looking after the elderly should continue
to be promoted, and the social relief work for the poor, disabled
and those who have lost their spouses and children be further

MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The fire that broke out on Sunday

</P>
<P>
The fire is unlikely to spread lower than the 63-meters mark,
where firemen mounted nonflammable barriers last night, Interfax
cited head of the Moscow fire department Leonid Korotchik as
saying.

Nonetheless, firemen are pouring liquid into the cable shafts,

<HEADLINE> Fire in Russian Central TV Tower Controlled EDS-Add more details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The fire that broke out in the
Ostankino television tower in Moscow on Sunday was successfully
localized at 12:32 p.m. (0832 GMT) Monday, according to local
media.
</P>
<P>
The fire is unlikely to spread lower than the 63-meter mark,
where firemen mounted nonflammable barriers last night, the
Interfax news agency cited head of the Moscow fire department
Leonid Korotchik as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, firemen are pouring liquid into the cable shafts,
and a foam attack can be made anytime if needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The blaze in the Moscow Ostankino TV tower is generally
controlled," Itar-Tass quoted Vyacheslav Mulishin, deputy chief of
the national fire-fighting service, as saying at the midday.
</P>
<P>
The situation at the Ostankino television tower had been
stabilized by 12:17 Moscow time (0817 GMT) and there is less smoke
now, he said, confirming that the blaze will be extinguished in a
few hours.
</P>
<P>
"The main efforts are now being concentrated at an altitude of
69 meters," he said. "A water mixture is being applied from base
level to 69 meters. In addition, foam is being poured at the same
altitude to prevent sparks falling from the coiling of cables in
the upper sections from lighting new fires," Mulishin said.
</P>
<P>
He said 32 firefighters were working inside the tower. A total
of 220 firefighters from 27 teams are involved in the operation.
</P>
<P>
On the people missing in the fire, Mulishin said "we don't have
any new information about" a colonel from the fire-fighting
service and two civilian tower employees missing in the fire-
fighting, one of them a woman elevator operator.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Moscow fire-fighting department chief Leonid Korotchik
told the press that firefighters on the TV tower had failed to put
out the fire at an altitude above 71 meters.
</P>
<P>
The fire was allegedly caused by a short circuit at the
transmitter of a paging company on Sunday afternoon, but the
authorities have not officially ruled out the possibility of
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the fire, Moscow police received an
anonymous call that said a bomb had planted in the TV tower and
that it would explode shortly, Interfax reported, quoting a source
with law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Ostankino TV and BC center, inaugurated in November 1967,
is the second tallest freestanding building in the world, just
after the TV tower in Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Weighing more than 55,000 tons, the structure is 540 meters
tall. Visitors can reach the observation deck at 337 meters in 58
seconds by the elevator.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Tombs Discovered in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered an unusual group of 72 tombs in Beijing's eastern
suburbs, with the earliest dating back to 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The graveyard is the biggest of its kind found in the Chinese
capital, the archaeologists said, adding that they might lead to
the discovery of a big ruined city in Yanqing, Beijing's satellite
city.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tombs belonged to the Han Dynasty (206 BC- 220 AD)
and Tang Dynasty (618-906), from which the archaeologists have
unearthed some pottery and iron and bronze vessels.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the types of the unearthed items and the
shaping of tombs are different from that in central China, hinting
that there was a mixture of agricultural and nomadic cultures in
ancient Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing first became the Chinese capital in the 12th century
when a northern nomadic tribe defeated the Song Dynasty, a
Confucianism based kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Further investigations are underway to obtain more findings,
the archaeologists said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Turnover of China's interbank
money market has surpassed one trillion yuan (about 120.4 billion
U. S. dollars) this year, according to the latest figures released
by the Shanghai-based China Interbank Trade System.
</P>
<P>
The total interbank trading volume included 366.9 billion yuan
(about 44.2 billion U.S. dollars) in credit, 591.6 billion yuan (
about 71.2 billion U.S. dollars) in bond repurchase agreements,
and 43.3 billion yuan (about 5.2 billion U.S. dollars) in spot
bonds, up 227 percent, 208 percent and 2751 percent respectively
from the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A source with the China Interbank Trade System said the upward
trend represents an increasing demand for capital as the country's
economic situation is turning for the better.
</P>
<P>
The source also attributed the money trade growth to improving
services, citing the establishment of an information system and
the launch of on-line price offering.
</P>
<P>
There are now 394 members in China's interbank money market,
more than double the 1998 figure, because more financial
institutions like stock companies, fund administration companies
and rural credit cooperatives, were approved by the People's Bank
of China to enter the interbank trading market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen Composite Index
closed up 3.55 points or 0.56 percent to its intraday high of 639.
84 points on Monday, while the sub-index finished at 4,957.57
points, up 6.82 points or 0.14 percent from the last close.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 12.65 billion yuan (1.52 billion US dollars),
which was 8.12 percent more than Friday's.
</P>
<P>
A news report relating to some positive comments on China's
stock market made by Zhou Xiaochuan, chairman of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), proved to be a boost to
the market. Zhou urged to speed up the preparation for the
establishment of the second board market, to cultivate
institutional investors with greater efforts, and to push forward
online securities trading.
</P>
<P>
After opening higher on a dynamic note, and hovering in a tight
trading range for most of the day, the Shenzhen stock market
managed to pace its upward move in the late day, boosted by
increased optimism on China's stock market, according to Homeway,
China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Huafa Electronics Co., Ltd., the top gainer, rose 10.
01 percent to its price ceiling at 18.69 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa Brewery Co., Ltd., the biggest loser, was hit by profit-
taking, losing 10.01 percent to touch its price floor at 17.25
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that much of bullish momentum is evident and will
lift the market to new highs as it has fast grip on the positive
ground for the current being.

<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share index shed
2.55 points, or 2.02 percent, to end at 123.95 points on Monday,
posting its fifth declines in a row.
</P>
<P>
Turnover continued to shrink, reaching 99.50 million HK dollars
(104.99 million yuan), which was 41.83 percent less than Friday's
total.
</P>
<P>
Opening lower on a weak note, the market failed to revive from
its recent tumble for an extreme lack of bullish momentum in
morning activity. Follow through moves on the selling side
developed with lackluster volume, making any rally attempts in the
afternoon session futile in the end, according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Decling shares outpaced advancing issues by 41 to 12, with
three unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Huafa Elect rose 6.46 percent to 2.80 HK dollars, while ST
Tellus added 2.45 percent to 2.09 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Huaxin lost 4.41 percnet to 2.60 HK dollars, while Sez Real
Estate fell 4.17 percent to 2.30 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The thought that the index has become a bit overextended
technically and that it is poised to pull back spells no upward
movement is expected to take place very soon, market analysts said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- On Monday, China's securities
investment fund market moved steadily, showing a similar
performance compared with last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 22 discounted funds continued to follow the price level
after last Thursday's rally. Five rising funds, which were all
discounted funds, were Fund Tianyuan, Fund Yuyuan, Fund Kaiyuan,
Fund Taihe that had released its interim report, and Fund Yuyang
that began its strong movement from last Friday, according to
Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory
company.
</P>
<P>
Three funds that dropped more than one percent were Fund
Tongzhi, Fund Handing, and Fund Jinding down 1.23 percent, 1.19
percent and 1.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
There was no interim report release today, which was sort of
out of market expectation. This may be a reason for the market to
move steadily today.
</P>
<P>
Last week, as the composite indexes on the two stock markets
declined within a certain range, down 0.17 percent and 0.41
percent on a weekly basis. Among the 30 funds, only eight funds
realized premiums for their net assets values, up from 0.56
percent to 0.007 percent. In particular, Fund Kaiyuan and Fund
Tongzhi dropped more than 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> NPC to Check Implementation of Law of Neighborhood Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, is
scheduled to dispatch four teams in early September to check the
implementation of the Organic Law of the Urban Neighborhood
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The two-week inspection will cover such cities as Harbin,
Shanghai, Lanzhou and Kunming.
</P>
<P>
China now has 115,000 urban neighborhood committees, with a
total staff of 502,000. These committees deal with some 400
million urban Chinese, as well as some 70 million of China's "
floating population," most of whom come to cities from rural areas
to make a fortune.
</P>
<P>
The inspection teams held a plenary session at the Great Hall
of the People this morning.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
made a speech at the meeting, saying that the inspection is aimed
at finding out how well the Law has been implemented and
summarizing successful experiences.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the inspection, which complies with
China's basic strategy of "governing the country in accordance
with law," will serve to promote the building of socialist
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee has decided to carry out inspections
on the implementation of laws on township enterprises, land
management, urban neighborhood committee, and criminal procedures
within this year. Inspection of the previous two laws has been
done.

<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
According to the daily air quality report issued by the China
Environmental Monitoring Center, level two, or fairly good air

Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Nanchang, Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai,
Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Zhanjiang, Nanning, Chengdu, Guiyang,

and Guiyang, where sulfur dioxide was the major air pollutant.
</P>
<P>
Ten cities -- Nantong, Hefei, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Zhuhai,
Shantou, Haikou, Kunming and Lhasa -- reported excellent air.

<HEADLINE> 40 Pollutant Power Plants Exposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Authorities have
made public a list of the 40 polluting coal-burning power plants
in efforts to press local industries to pay greater attention to
environmental issues, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The 40 coal-powered units exposed by the State Environmental
Protection Administration each discharges more than 5,000 tons of
dioxide annually.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of this June, local environmental authorities
shut down a total of 4,732 high-sulfur coal mines, 778 small
cement and glass production lines, 404 small iron and steel mills,
and 1,422 big polluters in other industries.
</P>
<P>
This has helped reduce sulfur discharge by 600,000 tons in
areas where authorities have been working to curb acid rain and
sulfur dioxide.
</P>
<P>
However, the air pollution still remains a serious problem in
these areas where 23 cities report extra sulfur content in the
atmosphere, while 12 cities are suffering from severe acid rain.

<HEADLINE> Factories in Three Gorges Urged to Curb Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) has urged factories in the Three
Gorges area to bring pollution under control as required.
</P>
<P>
So far, about half of the factories, either in operation or
under construction in this area, are not up to the state pollution
control standards, posing a threat to the quality of water in the
middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River covered by the huge
reservoir at the Three Gorges, the SEPA said.
</P>
<P>
According to the SEPA, a project in the Three Gorges area must
curb pollution right from stage of designing, construction to
operation.
</P>
<P>
A SEPA official attributed the situation in the Three Gorges to
the failure of local authorities who have not paid enough
attention to environmental protection and the implementation of
the environmental protection law.
</P>
<P>
All these factories which have failed to reached pollution
control standards will be ordered to suspend operation until their
anti-pollution equipment passes examinations, the official
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) officers believe the three
soldiers from the elite Duvdevan unit killed late Saturday night in
an attempt to capture a senior Hamas member Mahmoud Abu Hanoud were
most likely shot by other soldiers, in what Chief of Staff Shaul
Mofaz called a "serious operational mishap."
</P>
<P>
A fourth soldier was moderately wounded in the raid.
</P>
<P>
Wounded in the shoulder, Abu Hanoud managed to reach the nearby
West Bank City of Nablus, where he turned himself in to the
Palestinian National Authority and was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is considering whether to ask
for Abu Hanoud's extradition.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli Foreign Ministry is predicting that Islamic
Summit's Jerusalem Committee, convening Monday in Morocco, will not
adopt resolutions that will make it difficult for Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to be flexible in his
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry analysts believe that Arafat called for the
meeting in order to gain support for a more militant stand on
Jerusalem, but Israel and the U.S. have in the last few days been
using all diplomatic channels at their disposal to block any
radical decision by the committee.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli new school year, set for Friday, could be delayed
by a teachers strike that maybe continues after separate talks
between Finance Minister Avraham Shochat and heads of the two
teachers unions on teachers' salary demands failed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who also holds the education
portfolio, renewed his promise to make education, especially in the
peripheral areas, his top priority, but said it would have to wait
for another year, promising a hefty budget increase in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Barak is paying a day-long visit to Ankara to
brief the Turkish leadership on the recent developments in the
peace process with the Palestinians and to further the strategic
and defense cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Barak's visit coincides with the failure of Israeli defense
industries to win two important arms deals with Turkey. Barak's
absence during a crucial phase of the bid, which occurred during
the July 11-25 Camp David summit, was criticized as having a
detrimental effect on the outcome of the bid.

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Urged to Stay Calm Ahead of Soeharto Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Newly-appointed Coordinating
Minister for Political, Social and Security Affairs Susilo Bambang
Yudhoyono asked here Monday all Indonesians to stay calm,
particularly ahead of former President Soeharto's trial.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the people to exercise restraint and "not to
provoke any activities which will likely trigger violent action."
</P>
<P>
"The process of law, please go ahead. But we don't expect any
negative excess," Yudhoyono said, adding that there are views both
for and against the process of the trial of Soeharto on charges of
corruption during his 32 years of rule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has reconfirmed
that Soeharto will be tried on Thursday, August 31, adding that if
Soeharto was to be absent from the trial, that would be due to
medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
He said the trial has been arranged and agreed upon by the
Attorney General's Office, the accused himself and his legal
counsel and the medical team.
</P>
<P>
Darusman also said the medical team observing the health of the
79-year-old man will examine the former strong man to make sure
that he is okay to show up before the court.
</P>
<P>
"And then, the attorney general will submit the result of the
examination to the chief of South Jakarta District Court to decide
(whether or not Soeharto is medically fit for the trial)," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said a trial in absentia is not applicable to
Soeharto as this could only be arranged by a ruling from the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Putin Orders to Secure Blazing TV Tower, Resume Broadcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
ordered his ministers Monday to do every effort to extinguish the
fire raging in the country's central TV tower Ostankino and
quickly restore TV broadcasts and communication services.
</P>
<P>
"The latest emergency, the fire in the Ostankino TV tower, has
revealed the dire situation in vital installations and in the
country as a whole," Putin said at a meeting with cabinet members
in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
He discussed immediate steps to ensure security around the
Ostankino tower and resume TV broadcasts to Moscow and the Moscow
region, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
"We should not forget the large-scale problems or current
economic issues here. Tenacious work along every line in the
economy will make such emergencies impossible," Putin stressed.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Ostankino fire shows Russia in general is in a
plight and believes the situation can be changed only through
economic development.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov vowed
to intensify work and find a way to resume TV broadcasts to Moscow
and its region, which stopped because of the tower fire.
</P>
<P>
Technical directors of Russian TV companies gathered in the
Russian Press Ministry at 11:00 hours Moscow time (0700 GMT) to
find a way out of the TV blackout.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, experts said broadcasts to Moscow and the
region can be resumed via cable TV networks. TV signal should be
transmitted via satellite to the existing networks in the capital
and most suitable are the NTV Plus and Kosmos TV.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, firemen are planning to flood the feeder cables with
foam at the height of 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
A headquarters spokesman said feeders' coating went on fire at
the height of 400 meters at 15:08 hours Moscow time (1108 GMT) on
Sunday. There was no automatic fire extinguishing system in that
place and the blaze began to spread down along the feeders.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Due in Turkey for One-Day Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is scheduled to make a one-day official visit to Turkey on Monday
to seek support in the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak will be greeted by Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer
and will hold talks with Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit. Barak, who
is also Israeli Defense Minister, is also scheduled to meet with
Turkish Defense Minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu.
</P>
<P>
Barak is expected to brief his hosts on the latest developments
in the Middle East peacemaking after the failed Camp David summit
between him, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
To the disappointment of all parties concerned, the two sides
fell into a deadlock primarily over the status of Jerusalem during
the 15-day U.S.-brokered meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims Jerusalem, housing holy sites to Jews, Muslims and
Christians, as its "undivided and eternal capital," while the
Palestinians want the Arab East Jerusalem seized by Israel in the
1967 Mideast war as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Barak's talks will also dwell on military cooperation with
Turkey and the Manavgat Water Project, through which Turkey wants
to sell water to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a Middle East predominantly Muslim but secular country,
has served as a stage for intense diplomatic activities in the wake
of the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Ankara received Arafat, Israeli acting Foreign Minister Sholomo
Ben-Ami and United States Assistant Secretary of State Edward
Walker earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
However, Ankara has repeatedly denied that it has been playing
the role as mediator, saying it has been acting as "facilitator."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have all along asked Turkey to play a more
active and assertive role in the peace process, particularly on the
issue of Jerusalem. But the Israelis have declared that the United
States is the sole mediator on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Freed S. African Hostage Met by Philippine Govt Negotiator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- South African Carel Strydom, who
was freed by the Abu Sayyaf in its Sulu jungle lair earlier Monday
afternoon, has arrived in the nearby city of Zamboanga, where he
was turned over to the Philippines' chief government negotiator
Robert Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
In an interview at an air base in Zamboanga which was televised
through the ABS-CBN TV network, Strydom said emotionally that
although he is freed, yet it is "unfair to see other guys left
behind (in Abu Sayyaf's jungle hideout in Sulu)."
</P>
<P>
Following a short turnover ceremony in Zamboanga, Strydom,
accompanied by Aventajado and other local Philippine officials,
boarded the plane waiting to take him to another southern
Philippine city of Cebu to reunite with his wife, Monique, and
four other foreign hostages freed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A chartered Libyan plane is reportedly waiting to take Strydom
and the other released hostages to Tripoli, capital of Libya.
Strydom was supposed to be included in the first batch of hostages
released Sunday but his freedom was stalled for still unknown
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Strydom is in apparent good health, wearing a colored T-shirt
and blue shorts. He was received in Tagbak, Sulu, which is 150
kilometers away from Zamboanga city, by Retired Gen. Guillermo
Ruiz, a senior aide of Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
With his release, only five more males from the original group
of 21 hostages taken by the Abu Sayyaf in Malaysia's diving resort
of Sipadan on April 23 remain in captivity. They include two Finns,
one French, one German and one Filipino.
</P>
<P>
Besides, two other French male journalists taken on July 9
while covering the hostage drama are also in the hands of the Abu
Sayyaf.

<HEADLINE> Turkana Tribesmen Move to Uganda for Pasture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of heavily armed Kenya
's Turkana tribesmen have crossed the border and settled with
their cattle in Uganda in recent weeks, raising fears of violent
conflict in a region already devastated by drought.
</P>
<P>
The herdsmen have abandoned their arid grazing grounds to keep
their large herds alive while they wait for rain, the major
newspaper Daily Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There are about 5,000 men, women and children," said Ocero
Ogola, an aid worker delivering emergency food to Ugandan Dodoth
and Ik tribes in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Turkana tribesmen made a steep, difficult climb from the
floor of the Great Rift Valley to Kamion, which overlooks shady
woodland and long grass on the Ugandan side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Kamion, inhabited mainly by the small Ik tribe, normally acts
as a buffer zone between the Turkana and Uganda Dodoth herders,
who frequently raid each other's livestock.
</P>
<P>
The Ik, Dodoth and Turkana are at peace at the moment. But in
the sparsely-populated corner of Uganda, 420 km northeast of
Kampala, cattle raiding is endemic and every herder carries a gun.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, i don't think there is going to be trouble,
" an Ik leader said. "But if Turkana try to take cattle from the
Dodoth there will be trouble."
</P>
<P>
The failure of three consecutive rainy seasons have caused
severe drought in the Horn of Africa and east Africa. About 10
million people, including 3.3 million Kenyans are threatened with
famine while livestock are dying in large numbers due to lack of
pasture.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni is scheduled to open a three-day Fourth Africa Governance
Forum in Uganda on Friday, which is sponsored by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
According to a statement available Monday, the annual Forum
will be attended by 100 delegates from over 10 African countries,
representatives of donor countries, civil society and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Governance is recognized as a bedrock of development," UNDP
Administrator Mark Malloch Brown said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Without transparent and accountable institutions, and the
capacity to develop policies and laws to enable a country to
manage its markets and its political life, development is not
sustainable," said Brown.
</P>
<P>
He said it was clear that success in development was closely
related to the quality of governance, adding that open democratic
institutions allow full participation in politics.
</P>
<P>
The third Forum was held last year in Mali and deliberated on
conflict management and governance. Ghana hosted the second on "
accountability and transparency in Africa" while the inaugural one
was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, dealing with issues of
leadership building, strengthening parliamentary, judicial and
administrative systems and peace and stability, as well as free
and responsible press.

that broke out at the local Ostankino TV tower Sunday afternoon
amid reports that several people remain missing in the world's
second tallest freestanding structure.
</P>

Spread of the fire, allegedly caused by a short circuit, has
somewhat slowed down after the use of "special grenades" that spew
inert gas in the cable shaft of the 540-meter tower. All cables
through which the fire moved downward have been cut at the height
of 118 to 120 meters, an asbestos partition has been made and an
aerosol curtain created so as to contain the fire, the Interfax

<HEADLINE> Two Russian Army Deserters Found Dead in Central Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Russian sergeants who escaped
from their unit in the Moscow region were found dead on Sunday
evening near the city of Ivanovo, 260 kilometers east of Moscow,
Russian media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Their bodies with gunshot wounds were discovered in a garage
near Ivanovo at 8:30 p.m. (1630 GMT). Investigators believe that
they committed suicide, said the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The two sergeants, Alexander Svyatkin and Maxim Uzhintsev, left
an Interior Ministry unit in Lynyovo, Solnechnogorsk district, at
about 5 a.m. (0100 GMT) Sunday morning with two assault rifles and
10 magazines of ammunition, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted an
Interior Ministry officer as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigation indicated that the two servicemen
committed suicide. Field investigation groups are ascertaining all
the circumstances of the incident, said the officer.
</P>
<P>
According to information from law enforcement agencies,
Svyatkin opened the firearms room and took the Kalashnikov rifles
and ammunition when on duty in his company. Together with his
buddy, Uzhentsev, the fugitives deserted the unit upon donning
police uniform, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed that Svyatkin was a native of Ivanovo.
Therefore, operatives did not rule it out that the fugitives were
heading for that city.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Commercialize Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Stock Exchanges in The Southern
African Development Community (SADC) will soon start operating as
business houses rather than current membership houses, Zambia
Daily Mail newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press following a two day workshop of the region's
committee of stock exchanges held in Lusaka, chairman of the
committee Jeoff Mhlanga said that stock exchanges within the
region had previously been run like associations, and that when
commercialized, they would run like conventional business
companies in a transparent manner.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the chairman as saying the move was aimed at
integrating the SADC capital market.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that there is transparency and accountability in the
operations of stock exchanges. We have resolved that each member
state consider opening up its exchange as a way forward in a way
that conforms to the rest of the world," Mhlanga said.
</P>

Meanwhile, Lusaka Stock Exchange General Manager Charles Mate
said as the region was integrating into a Free Trade Area there
was need for stock exchanges to operate as businesses than where
members decided everything.
</P>
<P>
He said unlike in the past where trading was done by members
only, time has come to open up the trading to the general public.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee wants to give investors to trade on any
stock exchange in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the SADC Stock Exchanges have
harmonized their listing procedures and would like to improve in
the trading, clearing and settlement systems to allow free flow of
capital in the SADC region.
</P>
<P>
The workshop resolved to de-mutualize the operations of the
exchanges, adopt specific arrangements based on the Johannesburg,
South Africa, stock exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will send 10
military personnel to Ethiopia as observers of the peacekeeping
force there.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been asked by the United Nations to help out in
the disaster-stricken country and it was decided that the 10
officers were enough for the mission, Defense Minister Najib Tun
Razak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the 10 officers would serve in Ethiopia for one year
but their departure had not been fixed as the UN had yet to notify
the Malaysian authorities on the date they were scheduled to
depart.
</P>
<P>
However, the 10 officers are on standby now, he told reporters
after meeting visiting Pakistani Defense Secretary Lt. Gen. Nasim
Rana here.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia would not send a bigger group in the form of a
battalion.
</P>
<P>
On the meeting with Nasim, Najib said Malaysia and Pakistan
were in the midst of discussion on ways to enhance defense
cooperation especially in the area of submarine maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has the ability and technology in the area of
submarine maintenance and Malaysia wants to learn from them, Najib
said, adding Pakistan is currently constructing a submarine with
assistance from France.
</P>

Nasim arrived here Saturday for the Malaysia-Pakistan Defense
Cooperation Joint Commission meeting and is expected to leave
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Firemen Continue Fighting Blaze at Moscow TV Tower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Frantic efforts continued Monday
to contain a fire that broke out at the local Ostankino TV tower
Sunday afternoon amid reports that several people remain missing
in the world's second tallest freestanding structure.
</P>
<P>
Spread of the fire, allegedly caused by a short circuit, has
somewhat slowed down after the use of "special grenades" that spew
inert gas in the cable shaft of the 540-meter tower.
</P>
<P>
All cables through which the fire moved downward have been cut
at the height of 118 to 120 meters, an asbestos partition has been
made and an aerosol curtain created so as to contain the fire, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All major TV channels and many radio broadcast were knocked off
the air in Moscow and the greater Moscow region. Some paging
services and mobile communications have also stopped functioning.
</P>
<P>
TV signals are still available through satellite transmission
in the provinces, Russian media said.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said two policemen and several
employees of the Federal Agency for Government Communications and
Information have failed to contact their units since the outbreak
of fire at 15:20 local time (1120 GMT) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
One officer and two soldiers of the fire reconnaissance section
also remain unaccounted for since their last communication with
the command at 18:00 local time (1400 GMT) Sunday, Tass said,
quoting an officer at the fire-fighting headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out at a height of 475 meters, have
engulfed the upper sections of the tower and moved lower.
Firefighters are working at the height of 162 meters and the
intensive burning has been liquidated, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
To fill the information void created by the fire, the Itar-Tass
news agency started to provide what it described as open access to
all its information from its web site.
</P>
<P>
President Vladimir Putin summoned Minister of Communications
Leonid Reiman to the Kremlin Sunday and discussed the possibility
of using reserve channels to restore the TV broadcasting and
secure uninterrupted work of communication facilities, ambulance
service, the Interior Ministry and other services, the Kremlin
press service said.
</P>
<P>
The fire was allegedly caused by a short circuit at the
transmitter of a paging company, but the authorities have not
ruled out the possibility of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the fire, Moscow police received an
anonymous call that said a bomb had planted in the TV tower and
that it would explode shortly, Interfax reported, quoting a source
with law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Ostankino TV and BC center, inaugurated in November 1967,
is the second tallest freestanding building in the world, just
after the TV tower in Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Weighing more than 55,000 tons, the structure is 540 meters
tall. Visitors can reach the observation deck at 337 meters in 58
seconds by the elevator.
</P>
<P>
There are three dining rooms below the observation deck.
</P>
<P>
Konstantin Ernst, general director of the state ORT television
channel, said full restoration of the TV broadcasting to Moscow
and the Moscow region could take up to three months.

MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Frantic efforts continued Monday
to contain a fire that broke out at the local Ostankino TV tower
Sunday afternoon amid reports that several people remain missing
in the world's second tallest freestanding structure.
</P>
<P>
The fire, allegedly caused by a short circuit, has moved to
lower sections of the 540-meter tower. Intense heat and smoke have

Meanwhile, more than 50 steel ropes that keep the TV tower in a
vertical position have collapsed, but there is no official
confirmation that the structure is tilted, strengthening fears
that the tower itself might collapse.

of 500 meters from the 33-year-old structure, one of Moscow's

<HEADLINE> Prepaid Mobile Phone Service Popular in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Low-end mobile-phone services
with no monthly fees are gaining popularity in Thailand,
especially among young people, the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Advanced Info Service (AIS) and Total Access Communication (TAC)
, the two local market leaders, are contemplating how to attract
more customers to their prepaid services.
</P>
<P>
The two companies now claim 10% of the country's cellular phone
market of three million users. TAC claims 100,000 customers and
AIS 212,400 for the year-old services.
</P>
<P>
Prepaid cellular services in Malaysia, the Philippines and
Italy accounted for more than half of the total cellular market
share, AIS marketing director Thitipong Keawpaisarn was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Even though prepaid service in Thailand is in the early stages,
the sales volume has been more than for the GSM system during the
last few months, which makes the company optimistic about the
business, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prepaid services offered many advantages over conventional
cellular service, including affordable prices, two-way
communications, and controllable fees, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Many Thai parents now give their children prepaid services
instead of buying them a cellular handset with fixed monthly fees,
because prepaying helps control expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Although prepaid services do not have a 500-baht (12.5 U.S.
dollars) monthly fee as regular mobile phone service charges,
operators make up for the difference with higher calling charges
than for conventional cellular services.
</P>
<P>
Handset prices for users of prepaid services are also lower, as
low-volume callers do not need a top quality model.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Pledges to Shift to Knowledge-based Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Monday stressed the importance of a
strategic shift towards a knowledge-based economy in order for
Malaysia to achieve its economic objectives of becoming a
developed country by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
"The critical success factor in becoming competitive in the new
global economy rests with our ability to harness knowledge into
all areas of economic activities," he said at the opening of the
two-day Malaysian Business and Economic Summit here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's push towards this endeavor is an undertaking that
hopes to enhance all its industries and sectors by treating
knowledge as a key ingredient for success, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the transition to a k-economy must also be placed in
the context of Malaysia's long standing socio-economic obligations.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian government has remained committed to a
growth with equity strategy as it believes that it is imperative
to maintain social justice in its strategic shift towards a k-
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a k-economy is not merely restricted to
putting the knowledge component into all sectors, but it also
entails the maximum utilization of all productive resources,
especially our human resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
The guiding principles that chart the Malaysian economy in the
next decade must be characterized by the elements such as
competitiveness, innovation, transparency and social equity, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who is also the home minister, also stressed that
even as Malaysia plans for the future, concepts such as peace,
stability and independence will remain crucial, believing "changes
can be made to its economy and society without jeopardizing
stability and peace."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Business and Economic Summit organized by the
Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute was themed "Malaysia 2000
and Beyond" and is being attended by senior government officials,
corporate captains and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
The participants will deliberate on critical issues, challenges
and opportunities on the way towards a knowledge economy,
globalization and regionalization, managing Malaysia's monetary
policy and Malaysia's economic outlook and prospects in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
They are also scheduled to hold several roundtables with
cabinet ministers, such as on agrifood with the agriculture
minister, on transport and logistic with the transport minister
and on tourism with the culture, arts and tourism minister.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Hold International Conference on Preventing Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Ophthalmologists have
organized an international workshop from September 14 to 16 on
preventing blindness in South Asia, the Daily News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to eye surgeons from six regional countries, eye
doctors from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia,
Canada and Switzerland are also due to participate.
</P>
<P>
One of the organizers of the workshop Dr. Upali Mendis said
that the aim of the workshop was to encourage the fighting of
blindness in the region where 15 to 20 million people can get back
their vision with proper eye care and minor surgery.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, ignorance and lack of proper medical care had
prevented blind people from getting their vision back. The
dramatic increase in the age-related eye disease threatens to
overwhelm the region's health care resources and diminish the
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that by the year 2030 the number of blind people
would have doubled with macular degradation continuing to be the
leading cause of blindness. It is expected that there would also
be a doubling of the total cases of glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, the eye doctors will exchange notes and ideas
as to how to check blindness in the region and encourage young
doctors to be present.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The pending modification of the
country's automobile exhaust regulations is expected to be a
strong incentive to private sedan market.
</P>
<P>
The new rule will result in more dynamic market, especially in
the second-hand car sales, according to the vehicle supervision
division under the Municipal Public Security Bureau quoted by
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The modification, which is expected to be introduced by the end
of this year, may allow automobiles nationwide to keep running
past the age of ten.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, effective since 1994, automobiles
have to be taken out of service after ten years of usage, despite
their condition.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it is not reasonable to discard the autos in spite
that they are still in good conditions, especially as more sedans
are becoming private possessions," said Chen Weiqiang, vehicle
administration official under the division.
</P>
<P>
The move will provoke consumers' long-suppressed eagerness to
buy private sedans, analysts said. Usually private car owners are
unwilling to get rid of a high-priced car after certain years of
service without considering its condition.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Grassland protection and special
agricultural projects will be main themes in a massive campaign to
develop China's western regions.
</P>
<P>
Such schemes are important in the regions because it accounts
for half the country's land area and two-fifth of its grassland.
</P>
<P>
The arrangements will also address the worsening environmental
situation in the west and close the economic gap with affluent
eastern area, said Xue Liang, a senior agricultural official,
quoted by today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
"Within five years, the western regions will improve 13.3
million hectares of grassland and develop 1.3 million hectares of
new meadows, while establishing a sound plant and seed breeding
system," said Xue, director-general of the Development Planning
Department under the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Facilities to monitor and foresee rat and other pest problems
will also be enhanced, he said.
</P>
<P>
The director expected that immediate steps to halt the
deterioration of grassland be completed by 2005. Part of this plan
includes more grassland nature reserves to be added to the current
13.
</P>
<P>
Xue said ten million hectares of reclaimed land should be
returned to grassland, and environmentally friendly animal
husbandry should be developed, with overgrazing prohibited, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As to agricultural production, the official said western
regions are key production areas for high-quality cotton, tobacco,
fruit and flowers, but in the past they were plagued by water
shortages.
</P>
<P>
"China plans to develop its western areas as speciality farm
produce centers to supply produce to Central and East China, and
for export," Xue said.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Leader Cancels Resignation Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- In a dramatic turnaround, East
Timor's independence leader Jose Alexandre Xanana Gusmao and Nobel
peace laureate Jose Ramos-Horta vowed to stay on at the head of
the territory's main political grouping.
</P>
<P>
The vow was made by the two leaders only hours after their
announcement of resignation from the posts as president and co-
vice president of the National Council of Timorese Resistance (
CNRT), an umbrella organization of competing pro-independence
groups.
</P>
<P>
"I will remain, as it is apparently what the people want, and
Xanana, he will stay as well," the Indonesian Observer daily
Monday quoted Ramos-Horta as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the earlier surprise resignation of the two
leaders was due to growing factionalism within the organization.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the two have abandoned plans to stand
for office when East Timor holds its first national elections next
year as part of a UN-supervised transition to full independence.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Xanana quit as head of East Timor 's guerrilla force,
Falintil, which he had led for more than 19 years, on Sunday,
three days before East Timor celebrates its first anniversary of
the August 30 vote in which local people overwhelmingly opted for
independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Xanana, 54, who for close to two decades was East Timor's top
freedom fighter, is believed by many people to become the first
president of East Timor in the forthcoming elections.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Firm Breaks Hair-Washing Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A shampoo producer broke a world
record for the number of heads washed in a day after its
shampooers and stylists washed 4,887 heads on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The record was broken at the National Monument park in Central
Jakarta. The event started from the morning hours and lasted until
about 2:00 p.m., the Jakarta Post daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The organizer, PT Procter and Gamble Indonesia, a manufacturer
of consumer goods, reportedly decided to halt the free shampooing
event as the number of volunteers wanting their hair washed was
increasing.
</P>
<P>
The company earlier expected to surpass 5,000 heads by 5:00 p.m.
</P>
<P>
But the total exceeded Vietnam's record of 4,100, Malaysia's 1,
068 and Singapore's 948.
</P>
<P>
All the heads washed in the event were closely monitored by
representatives from the Indonesian Museum of Record (MURI). Some
200 shampooers and 504 stylists took part in the event.
</P>
<P>
The event raised funds totaling 17.1 million rupiah (2,060 U.S.
dollars) to be donated in the form of mini libraries and books to
four schools for the needy.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Shuttler Wins Motivation With Birth of His Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Olympic badminton
player Marlev Mario Mainaky has gained confidence and motivation
after the birth of a son on August 14.
</P>
<P>
He said the birth of Alweyn Jantja Putra Mainaky had released
his mind.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any wariness in my mind anymore. I can focus my
attention on the Olympics. I don't have any burdens although it's
my firth Olympics. I consider it a regular Grand Prix series. I'm
still recovering after falling sick before the Indonesian Open. I'
m still exercising to get fit and get my concentration in the
games," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Marlev, number eight in the International Badminton Federation
list, admitted that the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI)
was putting its hope on world number one Taufik Hidayat and number
three Hendrawan to win golds.
</P>
<P>
"I have to admit that Taufik and Hendrawan have a much bigger
chance than me to win the gold. But I don't want to easily give up.
I want to prove that PBSI can also count on me. Moreover, I haven'
t won any titles since the 1993 U.S. Open," he said.
</P>
<P>
Marlev's best achievement was in the 1997 Indonesian Open when
he reached the final but lost to Ardy Wiranata.
</P>
<P>
In the Thomas Cup championships in Kuala Lumpur in May, he was
a national hero after beating Danish Kenneth Joanassen in the
semifinal when the position was 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Besides his team mates, the 28-year-old shuttler named Danish
Poul-Erik Hoyer Larsen and Peter Gade Christensen, Chinese Xia
Xuanze and Malaysian Wong Choon Hann as tough contenders.
</P>
<P>
"From those shuttlers, I fear most Poul-Erik, I have never
beaten him in our three meets since 1993. He's really good in
setting a games rhythm and getting me to play fast. I usually lose
to him because I get impatient," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also tipped Xia as the very good Chinese both in offense and
defense.
</P>
<P>
"I must be very patient if I play Xia as he can play well in a
slow and fast rhythm," he said.
</P>
<P>
Coach Mulyo Handoyo believes Marlev could be the dark horse of
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"He's a stylish player and he is good in both attack and
defense. I believe the birth of his son will motivate him. At the
very least, he will be going to Sydney to give a special present
to his son," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hukou Waterfall on Yellow River to Disappear: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hukou Waterfall, which is in a
narrow, precipitous gorge and is known for the rapid speed of the
water and its thunderous sound, will become less than 10 meters
wide in 50 years if no effective measures are taken, Chinese
experts warned.
</P>
<P>
The waterfall on China's second largest river, the Yellow River,
about 46 kilometers west of Jixian county seat, north China's
Shanxi Province, is shrinking at a rate of 20 centimeters a year
and will disappear as a result of reduced water flow, they said.
</P>
<P>
The experts called for effective steps to reclaim the
ecological environment on the upper and middle reaches of the
river to control soil erosion in an attempt to save the waterfall,
which is now only 10 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Yellow River Water Resources Committee showed
that the water flow of the Wubao Hydropower Station on the upper
reaches of the waterfall is less than 100 cubic meters per second
this year, and even dropped to 48 cubic meters per second not long
ago compared with the station's record water flow of 32,000 cubic
meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Shanxi Province also attributed the shrinking of
the waterfall to geological factors. Historical records shows that
the width of the waterfall shrank one-seventh over the past 2,700
years due to erosion of rocks at the two sides of the river bed.
</P>
<P>
The waterfall attracts millions of tourists every year as well
as daredevils who attempt to ride their motorcycle across the
waterfall.

<HEADLINE> Excavation Proves Yangling Mausoleum Built by Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Archeological excavations at the
Yangling Mausoleum in northwest China's Shaanxi Province showed
that this underground palace was built by some 10,000 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by a farmer in Xianyang, and 27 tombs
dating back to the Han (206 B.C.-220) and Tang (618-907) dynasties
were found. The farmer found a great amount of bones scattered
underground on a piece of land near the Yangling Mausoleum when he
dug a reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Further excavation showed that the place had been a graveyard
for more than 10,000 mausoleum builders, whose heads and bodies
were buried in different places.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have unearthed 29 prisoners' tombs on the 80,000
square meter graveyard. No coffins were found inside the tombs.
Many bore marks of hacking on their waist or neck and shackles can
be seen everywhere in the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Nanfeng, head of the archeological team, said the
discovery proves that Emperor Jingdi of the Han Dynasty was as
cruel as other feudal rulers though he brought about a period of
great prosperity during his rein by increasing production and
reducing the burden of the common people.
</P>
<P>
Four years after Jingdi came to the throne, he forced prisoners
from all parts of the country to build his tomb. During the 28-
year toil, many were killed either for resisting or for trying to
escape.
</P>
<P>
The mausoleum was unearthed in September 1999. Many pits
associated with the emperor's tomb contain large quantities of
colored pottery animals as well as terra-cotta warriors and horses.
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest collection of pottery animals ever
unearthed since the founding of the People's Republic of China,"
said Zhao Dequan, vice-governor of Shaanxi.

<HEADLINE> Province Eliminates Iodine Deficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province has basically eliminated the iodine deficiency disease,
which is one of the most common diseases in the world.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries that has a widespread iodine
deficiency disease. The occurrence of the disease in eight
provinces such as Hebei, Shandong and Jiangsu are among the
highest, affecting some 30 million local residents.
</P>
<P>
A survey in the early 1950s showed that some 2 million people
in Hebei suffered from goiter, and 100,000 had cretinism.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, the local public health department
encouraged the daily use of iodine-added salt, and intensified
routine supervision.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Chengde, which is in the most serious condition
in the province, has on the whole got rid of miscarriages,
premature deliveries and stillbirths due to lack of iodine.
</P>
<P>
Iodine is a necessary element in the human body. A low
proportion of iodine will cause low IQ and deformities at birth.
</P>
<P>
China's public health departments set an goal in 1993 to get
rid of iodine deficiency disease nationwide by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Border City Cracks Down Smuggling by Container Trucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers at the
Gongbei Checkpoint in Zhuhai City, south China's Guangdong
Province, checked 29 cases of smuggling using container trucks
shuttling between cities in Guangdong and Macao in the first six
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling cases involves an aggregate value of 11 million
yuan. Both statistics went up by 42 percent and 83 percent from
the same period last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Macao returned to China on December 20, 1999. Zhuhai is the
nearest city to Macao on the Chinese mainland and Gongbei is the
only land customs checkpoint to enter Macao from the Chinese
mainland. Gongbei has become the country's second biggest land
port of entry and exit in terms of the number of vehicles passing
through. More than 4,000 container trucks go through the
checkpoint daily.
</P>
<P>
The rise in smuggling cases by using container trucks is
attributed to the lack of a thorough examination of empty
container trucks or cars.
</P>
<P>
But customs officers with Gongbei Checkpoint have now tightened
their inspections of loaded or empty container trucks shuttling
from Guangdong to Macao.
</P>
<P>
In another development, customs officers with Nanning City,
capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
uncovered 421 cases of smuggling from January to June, with the
value totaling 236.7 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi borders Viet Nam and sits on the northern bank of the
Beibu Gulf. It has convenient transport conditions both on land
and on the sea and has long been used by smugglers as an ideal
place to smuggle cargo in and out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Car Firms Fuel New Price War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The price war in the Chinese car
market has escalated further with the announcement of new price
cuts by major domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Xiali Automobile Co. Ltd. slashed the price of two of
its Xiali models by about 8,000 yuan (965 US dollars) on Saturday.
The two models both come with electric fuel injection engines.
</P>
<P>
The FAW (First Automotive Works) Volkswagen Automobile Co. Ltd.
also cut the price of its Jetta model by 12,000 yuan (1,445 US
dollars) last week in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The price cuts were aimed at cutting the number of stored cars
and to expand market share, Jia Xinguang, a senior analyst with
the China National Automobile Industry Development and Consulting
Corp., was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Price cuts are inevitable as domestic car makers are under
pressure over the country's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO)," Jia said.
</P>
<P>
The price cuts are good news for Chinese consumers eager for
mobility, though most of them expect prices to fall still further
after China enters the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China will cut its tariffs on automobile imports from the
current 80 to 100 percent level to 25 percent by mid-2006. The
biggest cuts are expected in the first two years after WTO
accession, which is anticipated to take place at the end of this
year or the beginning of the next.
</P>
<P>
To date, the domestic car market has seen about 15 price cuts
among all brands this year, but the industry still remains in the
doldrums.

<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese children with congenital
heart defects may be taken to Israel for treatment free of charge,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The plan was being discussed by the Children's Hospital of
Hebei Province and the Israeli side, said Ren Huaizhi, director of
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
A 12-person surgical team representing an Israeli humanitarian

colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Nine children aged between 10 months and 11 years suffering
from heart disease have been successfully operated on by the team
in the children's hospital since last week.
</P>
<P>
The team plans to conduct another five or six pediatric heart
operations this week, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The project of "Saving a Child's Heart", initiated by Amram
Cohen in 1995, was the largest undertaking in the world to provide
urgently needed heart surgery and follow-up care for children from
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It provides services such as surgical operations and medicines
to children with heart defects free of charge regardless of race,
color, religion or financial situation, according to Cohen.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong province has
yet to get a break in its battle against summer locusts and now
autumn locusts are swarming in.
</P>
<P>
So far, 213,000 hectares of land has been infested with a
density of two locusts per square meter.
</P>
<P>
Experts explained that the infestation of summer locusts has
helped a large number of dormant autumn locusts become active.
</P>
<P>
The area of land plagued by autumn locusts could reach 330,000
hectares, they warned.

<HEADLINE> Freshwater Lake Survived Chronic Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Drought-stricken
Baiyangdian, the largest freshwater lake in north China, has
recovered and regained its lush scenery.
</P>
<P>
The lake almost dried up due to years of drought that had
affected most parts of north China. Local government released
water from reservoirs recently to rescue thirsty residents as well
as animals and plants on the banks of the lake.
</P>
<P>
Unexpected rainfall in the mountain areas also contributed to a
raise in the waterline to 6.88 meters, a reasonable level for the
aquatic creatures that inhabit the lake.
</P>
<P>
"The water is very pure now," Zhang Junping, a 62-year-old
fisherman said.
</P>
<P>
China has invested nearly 600 million yuan (about 72.3 million
U.S. dollars) on building up three wastewater treatment plants on
the upper reaches of the lake and closed down over 2,000
enterprises which emit pollutants into the environment.
</P>
<P>
The 500,000-hectare forest and the 20,000 kilometers of
afforestation belt along the banks of the lake also cost 100
million yuan (over 12.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Covering a space of over 360 square kilometers, Baiyangdian,
known as "the bright pearl in north China," provides water to
hundreds of thousands of people in Beijing and Tianjin as well as
helps balance the regional ecology.

Statistics from the local customs indicate that in the first
seven months, the import of fresh and dry fruits and nuts hit 720
tons, up 289 times over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the import of edible oil-bearing seeds

improved service by Chinese quarantine departments on U.S.
agricultural products.

<P>
LUANDA, August 27 (Xinhua)- - Angolan President Jos Eduardo dos
Santos said over the weekend that the lesson taken from the
Angolan peace process is that "we ought to offer peace to whom
wants peace, and war to whom wants war."
</P>
<P>
"No one can become stronger than the will of the people," he
said when opening the third military games of the Angolan Armed
Forces in Cabinda, capital of Cabinda Province, the official news
agency Angop reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Santos, it is a united, free people that should
determine their destiny and choose their government.
</P>
<P>
As long as the people cannot elect another government because
of the current circumstances, "our mission is to unite all the
people under the government of unity and national reconciliation,
forgetting about the time of divisions, and creating a moment of
union of all Angolans for national reconciliation and
reconstruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
That is the only way the government, in its turn, can create
the conditions for the building of an increasingly just, more
prosperous and more fraternal society, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Santos expressed satisfaction at the great victories that the
army and police forces have scored at battlefield.
</P>
<P>
As for the military games, the president said, they are a
testimony of the attention the army leaders do dedicate to a
multilateral development of their personnel and the creation of an
environment of healthy interaction and solidarity.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Vows to Kill Budget Deficit by 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi government said
Monday it would seek, through the 2000-2004 economic and social
development plan, to achieve an annual growth rate of 3.16 percent
and slash the state budget deficit.
</P>

gross domestic product (GDP), according to the Saudi Press Agency
monitored here.
</P>
<P>
The state budget deficit will be reduced to zero by 2004,
through non-oil revenues and rationalizing of government spending,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Budget deficit for fiscal 2000 was projected at 28 billion Saudi
riyals (7.466 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The statement said the new development plan intends to turn the
current account in payment balance from a deficit of 3 percent in
1999 to a surplus of 6.9 percent by the end of 2004.
</P>
<P>
The plan also sought to expand Saudization of manpower in the
oil-rich Gulf kingdom by providing 817,300 jobs.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the need to develop financial and
administrative structures, and rationalize consumption of economic
resources and energy.

Turkish troops stationed in the Turkish Cypriot area in early

Cyprus, changing the military status quo in the area, to retaliate
the U.N. Security Council's renewal of the mandate of UNCIFYP
without asking for their prior approval.

The UNFICYP so far failed to persuade the Turkish Cypriot side
to remove the checkpoint and to restore the status quo in the

Papapetrou also said the Cyprus government considers the visit
by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to the village of Strovilia
as an additional provocation. Denktash visited Strovilia on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou noted that within the day letters will be sent to U.
N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Security Council president,
to protest against the provocative visit.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cyprus government will bring up once again the
demand "for the restoration of the status quo ante in the Strovilia
area.
</P>
<P>
"The government is pushing for the issue to be brought before
the Security Council, to directly take it's responsibilities," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Role of Civic Groups Hailed at U.N. Nongovernmental Organization Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- In its efforts to tackle
global problems, the United Nations depends on civic groups, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd annual conference of the nongovernmental
organizations, Annan pledged to provide nongovernmental
organizations with greater access to the world body.
</P>
<P>
"You are our best defense against complacency, our bravest
campaigners for honesty and our boldest crusaders for change," the
U.N. chief told more than 1,800 representatives who gathered for
the annual conference organized by the U.N. Department of Public
Information.
</P>
<P>
"While ultimately, decisions about the level of nongovernmental
organizations in U.N. work would be taken by the Member States, I
believe that in time, they will agree that our doors must be open,
" Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general spoke directly to misgivings among some
nongovernmental organizations regarding globalization.
</P>
<P>
"It has been said that arguing against globalization is like
arguing against the law of gravity. But that does not mean we
should accept a law which allows only heavy weights to survive,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on those present to make globalization an engine
that lifts people out of hardship and misery, not a force that
holds them down.
</P>
<P>
Annan said networks bringing together governments, civil
society and the private sector are the most promising partnerships
of our globalizing age, and the task ahead is to move from largely
unplanned interaction towards a more systematic approach to
working together.

<HEADLINE> First Colombian Woman to Be Extradited to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Colombia will extradite a woman
for the first time to the United States under charges of drug
trafficking, said the National Police.
</P>
<P>
Ivone Maria Scaff de Saldarriaga, who was captured along with
Gustavo Gomez Maya, is allegedly responsible for sending 65 tons
of cocaine to the United States.
</P>
<P>
General Luis Ernesto Guillibert, Director of the National
Police, said the operation was carried out in Venezuela, the
Caribbean islands and Colombia, with the participation of the
authorities of these countries and the collaboration of the United
States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
</P>
<P>
The official said the seizure is the result of the intelligence
work of Colombian police officers supported by the DEA. But he did
not say anything on the details of the extradition.
</P>
<P>
He said that through satellite tracking, it was possible to
discover the net that operated from Colombia, with connections to
Europe and the United States.

WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A new blaze near Yellowstone
National Park has forced the evacuation of 150 homes in Montana
State of the United States, fire officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials are concerned that Red Lodge, a town near the
Yellowstone National Park with a population of 1,875, was also
threatened by the fire. The blaze had covered 3,000 acres by
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We're constantly reevaluating whether there will be a need to
evacuate the town," a Forest Service official said.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 firefighters are combating 23 wildfires that
have burned some 670,000 acres in the state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a firestorm in Idaho State destroyed most of the
buildings at a guest ranch, and another guest ranch was ordered
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Gusty wind in central Idaho Sunday turned one of the blazes
into a firestorm that raced about six miles and burned 21 of the
29 buildings at the Pistol Creek Ranch.
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported as the area had been evacuated long
before. Fires have blackened about 117,000 acres in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
Fire officials reported a total of more than 1.6 million acres
ablaze in 13 western states in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Some UK Train Companies Treble Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) - Hidden increases in train fares in
Britain are deterring passengers and undermining government
attempts to cut car use, according to a research paper.
</P>
<P>
The researchers analyzed 2,300 ticket prices and found that the
average rise in fares over the four-year period was 15 percent,
compared with an inflation rate of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rail travel is 40 percent more costly in real terms than 30
years ago, a study for the Rail Passengers' Council shows.
</P>
<P>
The research paper, entitled "Are Passengers Getting Value for
Money?", says someone traveling between London and Liverpool in
1996 paid 35 pounds for a SuperSaver. Now a passenger would pay
140 pounds for the walk-on-Standard Open Return, a 300 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
Stewart Francis, the council chairman, said there was now less
need for operators to raise the cost of instant travel after the
Government said 60 billion pounds would be invested in rail in the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Higher fares on many parts of the network are in
danger of undermining the government's attempts to fight
congestion and tackle the social exclusion that occurs when
transport becomes unaffordable for low income groups."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The two-day Notting Hill Carnival,
Europe's largest street festival, ended peacefully Monday in west
London with over 1 million people turning out to watch.
</P>
<P>
Despite a downpour at midday Monday, just as the colorful
parade of floats, flamboyantly dressed dancers and Caribbean steel
bands was about to start, the streets of west London were packed
with spectators ready to party.
</P>
<P>
Police said there had been little trouble given the scale of
the event, with only 18 arrests being made Monday for public order
and drugs offenses and that they were investigating a stabbing
incident.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the first day of the extravaganza, 57 arrests were
made. More than 7,500 police officers were on duty at the carnival
in an effort to prevent any violence that has marred some previous
festivals.
</P>
<P>
The main celebrations ended at 7:00 p.m. (1800 GMT). All sound
systems were shut down and the floats dispersed although many
private parties continued into the night.
</P>
<P>
The 36th annual Notting Hill Carnival featured more than 75
costume bands and two live stages. During the two-day carnival, at
least 2 million people packed Notting Hill's streets, squares and
bars to sample West Indian food, watch dance troupes and marvel at
a whirl of sights and sounds.
</P>
<P>
The event has its roots in a 1964 street procession aimed at
bringing together an Afro-Caribbean community blighted by racism
and prejudice. It was born among west London's black community in
the 1960s, tracing its roots to the island of Trinidad where the
carnival tradition began as a celebration of the end of slavery.
</P>
<P>
The area won worldwide fame in the blockbuster hit film set in
its streets and starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts but has long
been a favorite haunt for Londoners for its street markets and
cafes.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic Party
presidential candidate Al Gore promised prescription drugs for all
seniors Monday as he began a week-long focus on health care.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Gore, who campaigned in Florida Monday, told
older voters that his prescription drug plan would help them while
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush offers only
political ads.
</P>
<P>
"I think the American people deserve to have a full discussion
of all these issues," said Gore, who talked to about 150 senior
citizens invited to share their stories in a round-table at
Florida State University.
</P>
<P>
Gore renewed his criticism of big drug companies for their
lobbying power in Congress and attacked their advertising spending
and their price setting, which makes drugs more expensive.
</P>
<P>
"We need more competition for the big drug companies," Gore
said, hoping to get the support of 39 million seniors covered by
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
Under Gore's proposal, Medicare would pick up all the costs of
prescription drugs for low-income seniors. For the rest, Medicare
would pay half the cost of prescription drugs up to 5,000 dollars
a year.
</P>
<P>
Gore's drug plan would cost 253 billion dollars over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Prescription drugs have become an important election issue as
Americans are living longer. Polls have suggested that voters view
Gore as the candidate most likely to boost the nation's health
care system.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Inaugurates Free Port Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour Tuesday inaugurated the Spice Isles' free port project,
which he said will stimulate business activities and restore the
Isles lost glory as a business center in east and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the free port zone with 36,
000 square meters, the president said he is optimistic that the
project will give a fresh impetus to Zanzibar's economic revival
plans in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the free port is a step in the right
direction of carrying out Zanzibar's economic diversification
programs and promoting the transfer of technology so as to ease
the islands' unemployment crisis and improve infrastructure, said
Salmin.
</P>
<P>
"The free port project is part of our struggles in the hope of
giving better life to the people and revamp our economy following
the decline of cloves prices in the world market," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Zanzibar could become "the second Dubai" when
the project is in full swing, saying many sub-Saharan countries
will import goods from Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
This measure, Salmin said, will generate a minimum of 84
million U.S. dollars in the initial year.
</P>
<P>
The volume of cargo to be routed through the Zanzibar port will
rise to about 30,380 cargo containers per year, up from less than
7,300 at present, he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, director general of the Isles Free Port Authority
Ahmed Sheikh announced they plan to spend about 2.3 billion
Tanzanian shillings (about 2.9 million U.S. dollars) to provide
facilities for the port.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that a total of 13 sheds with 800 square meters
each will be built in the zone plus an administration block which
will house offices to provide several services for the free port.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. But it has its own government and
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Cloves are the main export of Zanzibar, providing about 80
percent of the islands' foreign-exchange earnings.

He told reporters after meeting Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe that the peace agreement has failed to speed up the peace
process in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"The Lusaka peace agreement is still on track, but is not on a
very fast train," he said. "We want it to go faster than it is now,
but it cannot because it has been overtaken by events."
</P>
<P>
He said the peace agreement should be amended to recognize
Uganda and Rwanda as aggressors in the DRC and not as parties to
the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"If we follow the Lusaka peace agreement, it will be used by
our oppressors to prolong their stay in our country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no way for the DRC to accept former Botswana
President Ketumile Masire as a mediator to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Masire was appointed the peace facilitator in the DRC by the
Organization of African Unity, but the DRC government rejected him,
accusing him of being biased.
</P>
<P>
In response, Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs Minister Stan Mudenge
said the Lusaka peace agreement could be amended according to the
demands of the DRC government.
</P>
<P>
"The peace agreement can be amended because we have already
done that at some time," Mudenge said, adding "it is not written
on stone that it cannot be amended."
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace agreement was signed by all belligerents in
the DRC in July and August last year to pave way for the
deployment of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia had been fighting on the side of
DRC President Laurent Kabila to push out rebels supported by
Rwanda and Uganda in the two-year old civil war erupted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At least three countries have reportedly offered to send troops
to the DRC under the U.N. peacekeeping mission. These include
Pakistan, Senegal and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Ukraine and Nigeria have agreed to provide
logistical support to the peace mission.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Lower Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba urged here Tuesday the oil producing countries in the
world to provide relief and support to developing countries, which
will be seriously affected by the oil price increases.
</P>
<P>
"The capacity of developing countries to absorb these prices is
severely compromised by equally serious economic difficulties they
are facing amongst which is the debt burden that is strangling our
development efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a handover ceremony of houses and a police post,
Chiluba said a global economic recession precipitated by the oil
price increases will worsen what is already a bad situation for

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police Warned Against Violating Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean police were warned
Tuesday against violating human rights while conducting business,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Human rights violations have tarnished the image of the
organization and antagonized the police force with the community
they are mandated to serve, Zimbabwean police chief staff officer
responsible for human resources at the Harare headquarters Senior
Assistant Commissioner Shepherd Gwasira was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He told a human rights workshop for 30 superintendents and
chief superintendents from all stations in the country that "if
police officers violate human rights, then they turn out to be the
law breakers."
</P>
<P>
The five-day workshop, organized by the Zimbabwe Republic
Police in conjunction with the Human Rights Research and
Documentation Trust of Southern Africa, is aimed at helping police
officers to observe human rights when doing their work.
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to ensure that all police commanders
receive training in human rights, gender and law to guard against
any form of violating the law," Gwasira said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the police to portray a good image of the country
internationally by adhering to ethical and legal conduct expected
of law enforcement officials.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Not Ready to Implement SADC Trade Protocol: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will not be able to meet
the Friday deadline for the implementation of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Free Trade Protocol, the country's
Industry and International Trade Minister Nkosana Moyo said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moyo made the remarks during the opening of the two-day
Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries conference on the SADC Trade
Protocol, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the
World Trade Organization, and African, Caribbean and Pacific/
European Union Relations.
</P>
<P>
"We won't be able to meet the September 1, 2000 deadline," Moyo
said, explaining that "the protocol allows for entry at different
times and Zimbabwe will follow on the heels of the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU)."
</P>
<P>
SACU members -- Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and
Swaziland -- which have been trading on terms similar to the SADC
Free Trade Protocol for years, are more prepared to transform
their trade into a regional scale but the other nine SADC members,
Zimbabwe included, still have to organize themselves.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the SADC heads have agreed to split their countries
into the developed, developing and least developed categories for
tariff reduction purposes.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries are SACU members while the developing are
Mauritius and Zimbabwe and the last group comprises Malawi,
Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. The other three member countries,
namely Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Seychelles,
have not been included in these categories.
</P>
<P>
Countries in SACU will reduce the bulk of tariffs in the early
part of the eight-year free trade trial period while those in the
second category will reduce in the middle and the last group in
the last part of the period.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said Zimbabwe still needs to organize its administrative
capacity before depositing its instruments but he could not give
dates.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 16 sub-
Saharan African countries will discuss issues vital to the
continent's future at the fourth Africa Governance Forum in Uganda
's capital Kampala from September 1 to 3.
</P>
<P>
The forum, organized by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and the Office of Prime Minister of Uganda, will focus on
the contribution of the parliamentary process in strengthening
governance in Africa, according to a UNDP press release on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the importance of the forum, UNDP Administrator
Mark Malloch Brown said "ineffective governance often short-
circuits the connection between anti-poverty efforts and poverty
reduction, that is why good governance built around strong,
transparent and democratic institutions is so important."
</P>
<P>
The Africa Governance Forum provides a platform for Africans,
international organizations and Africa's external development
partners to engage in dialogue on the state of governance in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The third forum was held last year in Mali and deliberated on
conflict management and governance.
</P>
<P>
Ghana hosted the second on "accountability and transparency in
Africa" while the inaugural one was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
to address issues of leadership building, strengthening
parliamentary, judicial and administrative systems and peace and
stability as well as free and responsible press.

<HEADLINE> At Least 26 Killed in Somali Clan Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 26 people were killed
and more than 20 others wounded in three separate armed
confrontations in the past two days in Jowhar town, 90 kilometers
north of Mogadishu, Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The first confrontation started when rival militiamen from the
Hawadleh and Galje'el clans exchanged heavy gunfire near the main
market of the town. Eyewitnesses said the Galje'el clansmen lost
12 of their fighters while their Hawadleh opponents lost eight
during a fighting right inside the market place.
</P>
<P>
Four innocent civilians were killed in a nearby house after a
stray round of assault grenade landed inside it. Six others were
wounded in the ablaze.
</P>
<P>
The shooting subsided a little after the Galje'el clan
militiamen withdrew from the town leaving their houses and
properties under the mercy of their friendly and strong Warsangeli
subclan of Abgal to protect.
</P>
<P>
As the Hawadleh clan militiamen went around the area in search
of something to loot, they met a man with a gun guarding an oil-
milling machine. In blunder they killed the man who happened to be
a Warsangeli fighter.
</P>
<P>
The Warsangeli militiamen, annoyed by the killing, attacked the
Hawadleh militiamen in their turn. The ensuing exchange of heavy
fire forced the Hawadleh clan militiamen to withdraw from the town
to Buraneh village, about 23 kilometers north of the town on
Monday, thus giving chance for the return of the ousted Galje'el
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another armed confrontation has begun between the
Warsangeli and Agon-Yar subclans of Abgal dominating the entire
region. At least two men were killed, one from each side, and four
others wounded as the two sides exchanged gunfire at the entrance
of the town.
</P>
<P>
The wounded include a well-known businessman, Ahmed Hassan, who
sustained gunshot wounds as he tried to curb down the hostility.
</P>
<P>
Jowhar town is calm Tuesday, with talks now continuing between
the two Abgal subclans of Warsangeli and Agon-Yar. But no talks
has been initiated between Hawadleh and Galje'el nor Hawadleh and
Warsangeli.
</P>
<P>
In another development, faction leaders of Mogadishu who
boycott the Djibouti-sponsored Somali peace conference have
started making political journeys by rushing outside the country
one after the other.
</P>
<P>
Osman Ali Atto left for Nairobi Monday over what is called
consultations aimed at searching political solution to Somalia's
problems, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
His move was followed by Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Hussein
Hajji Bod, who left for Sanaa of Yemen on Tuesday. According to
their close deputies, the two faction leaders have received
official invitation from President Ali Abdalle Salah of Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Salah, who witnessed the recent inauguration ceremony of Somali
President Abdiqasim Salad Hassan, has been among the front runners
of the regional presidents supporting the Djibouti peace
conference.
</P>
<P>
Atto and Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, another faction leader, are
reportedly departing from Nairobi for Sanaa to join their fellow
faction leaders already there on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected departure of the faction leaders from Mogadishu
is seen as another new tentative in which President Salah is
trying to persuade them to join the government to be established
in Djibouti soon.

LUANDA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos has reiterated that his government welcomes all those
who drop guns, accept democracy and want to contribute to the
reconstruction of the country, the official news agency Angop
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president made this statement after a reception to
celebrate his 58th birthday on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Angola has space for all, the country belongs to all Angolans
and not only to a few, so it is useless to make war," said the
Angolan head of state.
</P>
<P>
The president added that what is necessary is that the people
give up arms, accept democracy and the free debate of ideas,
respect the difference of opinions and contribute to the national
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
President dos Santos also reminded that during the campaign for
the general elections in 1992, he offered reconciliation with
Jonas Savimbi, leader of the UNITA rebel movement. But Savimbi
refused to accept the result of the elections and restarted the
civil war.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sets Up Fishery Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
established an authority to oversee the operations of the fishing
industry, media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is the government's latest initiative to fulfill the
European Union (EU) requirements set in 1998 when the EU banned
the fish export from Kenya due to hygienic reasons.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Rural Development Maalim Mohammed said here
Monday that the authority headed by Agriculture Permanent
Secretary Shem Migot Adhola would oversee implementation of
regulations governing fish-processing, handling and transportation
to both local and export markets.
</P>
<P>
The functions of the authority include monitoring fishing
grounds, controlling fish landing, approving establishment of fish
processing factories as well as issuing health compliance
certificates, Mohammed said.
</P>
<P>
The ban by the EU has been a severe setback to Kenya's fishing
industry which nets more than 6.5 billion shillings (about 84.4
million U.S. dollars) and employs over 40,000 fishermen annually.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed expressed optimism that the ban would be lifted by the
EU since the Kenyan government and other stake holders had met all
the conditions set by the EU.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Launches Anti-Poaching Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Wildlife Authority (
ZAWA) has successfully launched an anti-poaching campaign
arresting more than 700 poachers and confiscating about 239
firearms throughout the country in the first seven months of this
year, Times of Zambia newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Henry Mwima, ZAWA director of operations and research,
as saying in Lusaka on Monday that also seized were 63 ivory and
430 rounds of assorted ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The transformation of the department of national parks and
wildlife services(NPWS) into ZAWA late last year, had created a
big vacuum with a lot of field officers being pulled out from the
national parks, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Mwima said the wildlife officers who have had their contracts
renewed have been instructed to move into the field as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He said the poachers had taken advantage of the operational
changes that ZAWA had instituted and were roaming the parks at
will.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have deployed our men into the field, the poaching
rate in the national parks will reduce tremendously," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said last week more than 10 poachers were arrested and 14
pieces of ivory confiscated by wildlife police officers from the
Kafue National Park.
</P>
<P>
Mwima said the wildlife officers deployed in the field have
been provided with all the necessary resources to enable them
fight poachers.
</P>
<P>
He said ZAWA was committed to providing logistical support,
uniforms and equipment in order to strengthen field operations of
their officers.

LUSAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has made
contact with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) rebels on
the release of the 26 Zambian fishermen in custody, Home Affairs
Minister Peter Machungwa has said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the press in Lusaka on Monday, the minister said the

Zambians.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted the minister as
saying the rebels however did not give the amount they wanted.
</P>
<P>
He said further investigation was being made to establish what
happened exactly.
</P>
<P>
"It could be that the rebels are asking for a fee, like
immigration, or probably for fishing on foreign waters because
these people were blown to the DRC side by the winds," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the men were fishing between Nsumbu bay and Lake
Tanganyika last Saturday when they were blown by the wind.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Introduce Open Prison System for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Prison Services will
in the near future introduce the open prison system for women,
following the success of the one for men, The Herald reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Prison Officer Charity Gezi told the newspaper on Monday
that the open prison system, which is still on trial in the
country, will be a success.
</P>
<P>
Currently there is only one open prison - Connemara in Kwekwe,
with about 110 inmates.
</P>
<P>
She said, "The open prison would be an ideal place for the
women with children as they will no longer be confined like in the
other prisons."
</P>
<P>
She added that the idea behind the open prison system was to
reintegrate the prisoners into society and it also reduced the
transmission of airborne diseases in closed prisons.
</P>
<P>
Inmates in open prisons enjoy outdoor recreational facilities,
have regular communication with outsiders and can also go back
home when the need arises.
</P>
<P>
"So far no prisoner has never returned from weekend visits and
if this trend continues then we can see more open prisons in the
country," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also said that inmates admitted into the open prison are
those with lighter crimes and sentenced to less than three years
in jail.

Powertel will be taken over for the time being by VoiceStream,
the mobile phone server the Deutsch Telekom bought one month ago.
If the U.S. authorities approve the purchases, the two will be
merged into one daughter company of DT.
</P>
<P>
VoiceStream and Powertel have 3 million customers and with
business licenses in almost all U.S. states, will be able to
establish a mobile phone net covering 245 potential users.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two companies currently use GSM-standard,
compatible to the technology of Deutsch Telekom, which will pay
both purchases by share-swapping.
</P>
<P>
About one third of the U.S. senators have expressed their
opposition to DT's purchase of VoiceStream on the ground that the
German government has a majority share in the telecommunication
company. The German media dismissed the charge as U.S.
protectionist backlash.

<HEADLINE> Canada, Brazil to Negotiate Solution on Aircraft Subsidy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Canadian and Brazilian
negotiators are scheduled to meet for the fourth time in Sao Paulo
this week on Brazil's Proex aircraft subsidy program, the Canadian
government announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's priority remains reaching a mutually satisfactory
negotiated resolution with Brazil on this issue," said Canadian
International Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew in the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the World Trade Organization (WTO)
arbitration panel ruled in Geneva that Canada can apply 344
million U.S. dollars per year in countermeasures against Brazil
for the subsidy issue.
</P>
<P>
Pettigrew described the latest WTO arbitration as the "fifth
consecutive ruling against Brazil," saying that "the WTO agrees
with Canada that the Proex subsidy should be withdrawn as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
Four previous WTO panels have also ruled that Brazil's Proex
export subsidy for regional aircraft violates that country's WTO
obligations and must be withdrawn, according to Canadian
government sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Canadian Industry Minister John Manley expressed
support for negotiation with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"Resolving this dispute will promote increased trade between
Canada and Brazil to the benefit of both countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Canada has yet to require for authority to impose
countermeasures from the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO if it
really decides to take retaliation under the WTO ruling.

<P>
"Denktash does everything he can to affect the Cyprus talks in
a negative way," said Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
at a press briefing Monday.
</P>
<P>
Complaining that the U.N. did not undertake any initiatives
with regard to Denktash's actions, Reppas said that the
international organization must take action with regard to the
continuous provocations of Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
eastern Mediterranean island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Denktash and Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides have held
several rounds of indirect talks in New York and Geneva, but these
talks have failed to make some breakthroughs in seeking a fair and
just solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Greek-Cypriot side hopes that the next round of talks will
be a direct one and can become substantive.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides is to arrive in
Athens Tuesday to have talks with his Greek counterpart, George
Papandreou, in order to coordinate their actions for substantive
talks between the two communities in Cyprus.

<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Office Minister
Peter Hain is scheduled to visit Israel and the Palestinian
Authority Tuesday to offer encouragement for the Middle East peace
process, it was announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of my visit is to use Britain's influence and
friendships in the region to encourage progress, not to broker a
deal or seek a breakthrough," Hain said in a statement issued by
the Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
"The window of opportunity for agreement is small. Now is the
time for friends of the peace process to do what they can to
encourage all the parties to work as constructively as possible
while there is still time," said Hain.
</P>
<P>
Hain's Mideast tour coincides with a trip to London by Israel's
acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, who is due to meet British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, currently visiting several European countries to seek
support for Israel's stand in the peace process, has said an
accord with the Palestinians is within reach and both sides must
grasp it.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the verge of being able to reach a final agreement (
with Palestinians)," Ben-Ami reportedly said in an interview to
the French daily Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
The key issues of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian
refugees were believed to be behind the failure of last month's
peace summit at Camp David in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise on Market Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose broadly
Monday as investors showed confidence in the market direction in
an improved interest rate environment.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 60.21 at 11,252.84
points, extending a rally which began a week ago. The blue chip
index rose as much as 120 points earlier in the trading.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 27.91 at 4,070.59 points and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 7.64 at 1,514.09 points.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose as investors have built confidence in the future
direction of the market since the Federal Reserve decided last
Tuesday to leave interest rates unchanged but held the door open
to possible action if a threat to inflation rises. A majority of
analysts believed that the central bank would not raise rates
further before the presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last
summer in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy and prevent
inflation from rising. A series of reports showed recently that
the economy is slowing and inflation remains tame.
</P>
<P>
Financial stocks rose across the board today, leading the Dow's
advance. Among them were J.P. Morgan and Citigroup. IBM also rose,
helping to push the blue chip index higher.
</P>
<P>
In the tech sector, Intel, Cisco Systems and Dell computer were
up, driving the Nasdaq index higher. Internet stocks have moved
back into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 2.73 at 675.26 and the American Stock
Exchange index was up 0.16 at 934.97. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 1.37 at 526.48.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,470 down, 1,373 up and 526
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 722.92 million shares from 670.68
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Britain Considers Report of Sierra Leone Captors' Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- British officials trying to win
the release of the 11 British soldiers captured in Sierra Leone
said Sunday that they were investigating a report from the West
African country that rebel captors were demanding freedom for one
of their jailed leaders in exchange for the soldiers' release.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said it was looking into an unconfirmed
report that a group called the West Side Boys said it would
release the Britons in exchange for a fighter known as General
Papa, who was arrested in June after a fight with United Nations
peacekeepers over the ownership of a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The captors reportedly also want their supplies replenished
before the British soldiers are released.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Defense Ministry said a team of "varying makeup"
had been sent to help secure the release of the men and they would
consider any possible resolution.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident we can secure their release through
discussion with their captors, and the team was sent in order to
aid that process," local reports here quoted a spokesman in the
Ministry of Defense as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, British officials said the leader of the 11-man
British team, which was captured Friday while patrolling near
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, had been in contact and said
all were "being fed and well-treated."
</P>
<P>
"We have made contact with those who appear to be holding," a
Defense Ministry spokesman said Sunday, adding that "discussions
are at a very early stage."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Britain was "working closely with the
government of Sierra Leone to try to bring this to a conclusion."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Freetown said a British force spokesman had said
he could not confirm or deny the reported demands of the abductors.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say for certain is efforts are continuing to secure
their speedy release," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the 11 soldiers lost contact with their base, where
British instructors are training Sierra Leonean army recruits.
They were accompanied by a government soldier, who was acting as
their guide and was also believed to have been captured.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone had been a colony of Britain. A civil war broke
out there in 1991 and the United States had to send in a peace-
keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Britain sent 1,000 soldiers to Freetown when the rebels re-
started the conflict in May. The rebels seized 500 U.N.
peacekeepers and advanced toward the capital. When the British
forces withdrew in mid-June, they left behind 400 soldiers to
train Sierra Leone army recruits. Britain has also donated arms
and equipment and sent military advisers.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Implementation of Cease-fire Agreement in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United Nations Under-
Secretary Ibrahim Gambari has called for a quick implementation of
Lusaka ceasefire agreement signed last year to solve conflict in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Gambari, also special advisor to the U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, said the U.N. Security Council is waiting for the
implementation of the agreement in the DRC so as to work on
sending 5,500 U.N. peacekeepers to the country.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing here on Tuesday, Gambari said: "We hope the
Congolese government and the rebels will come to the agreement
soon for the U.N. to decide on the deployment of the troops as
long as the conditions have been improved in that country."
</P>
<P>
Shortly before his departure for Namibia, Gambari said the
purpose of his visit to Zambia was to see the situation on the
Angola and Namibia border areas.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the situation in refugee camps in Western
Province in terms of medical equipment was good while some
infrastructures needed to be improved.
</P>
<P>
Zambia was faced with the challenge of accommodating a growing
number of refugees from Angola and the DRC, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are at present over 230,000 refugees in Zambia, 160,000
of which are from Angola.
</P>
<P>
Gambari said his mission has been accomplished by visiting some
refugee camps and having discussions with Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba and government officials.
