HINGIS FEARS NOT THE WILLIAMS SISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the past year, the shots uncoiled by the
sculptured Venus and Serena Williams have come at Martina Hingis
with the force of uppercuts.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of reacting to the sisters' power by putting up a
scaffold around her fit but slight physique, Hingis will remain as
is. She is not reaching for creatine to turn her body into bulk
mail or searching out supplements for a potent answer. To combat
the Williams sisters, Hingis, the No. 1 player in the world, will
continue to improve on what she does best.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after the first day of the U.S. Open was christened with
a cloudburst at noon, Hingis revealed an appetizer of the skills
she believes are sharper than ever. By leaning on her almost
clairvoyant anticipation, deceptive speed and crafty shot
selection, she dissected Alina Jidkova in 57 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But once she exited Arthur Ashe Stadium, there were the Williams
sisters again. Not in person, but in the form of questions. But
oddly enough, perhaps as a defense mechanism, Hingis' most telling
response to the sisters was delivered when the subject of her
difficult 1999 season was raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody expects me to do as I did in '97, which, in a way, I
feel is unfair,'' said the 19-year-old Hingis, who won three majors
in 1997 but has won just two since then. ``I have five Grand Slams.
Venus and Serena each have one. Lindsay Davenport maybe now has
three because she played better. But she's 24. The Williamses, you
know, they're my age. I think, so far, I've been better than them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been as injured as them. It's just the consistency,
that's what counts to be No. 1, not who wins the most tournaments
or who hits the ball the fastest or who hits the fastest serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost feisty in her demeanor, this was a more defiant Hingis
than the one who slumped away from Wimbledon with shattered spirits
after Venus Williams crushed her confidence in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   But like most of the other seeded players Monday, Hingis used
the first round of the U.S. Open as a new beginning. Venus
Williams, on the other hand, continued the momentum she began to
gain in July. Pounding the hardcourts with almost vicious ground
strokes Monday night, the third-seeded Williams won her 20th
straight match, leaving Anne-Gaelle Sidot behind, 6-3, 6-4.
Williams was ahead by 5-0 in the second set, but, as is her trend,
she temporarily lost her focus and allowed Sidot to close in, if
only for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   There were some minor tremors in their midst, but no upsets as
15th-seeded Jennifer Ca-H priati, sixth-seeded Monica Seles,
top-seeded Andre Agassi and fifth- seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov ad-L
vanced to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-seeded Pete Sampras also came through with a 7-6 (3),
7-5, 6-4 victory over Martin Damm. Tossing in 22 aces like
lightning bolts, Sampras looked under control in a good tuneup for
the rest of the tournament. In one first-round match, he progressed
further in the draw than he did a year ago. Last year, he was
forced to withdraw before the tournament with a back injury, which
gave him a first real brush with his tennis mortality.
</P>
<P>
   It also started discussions about the life span of his career.
Although the 29-year-old Sampras showed he was still dangerous and
dominant on grass when he won his record 13th Grand Slam at
Wimbledon, the ATP is concerned about the future popularity of the
game. In an effort to promote the young players, the tour has begun
a marketing campaign with the catch phrase: ``New Balls Please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting slogan,'' Sampras said with a smile. ``I
think it's a sign of what the ATP is trying to do, how they're
trying to push the young guys. A lot of people in the public don't
know the young Europeans. We'll see how the marketing strategy
unfolds. I admire the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre and I aren't going to play five or 10 years. But for the
next couple of years, I think we'll contend for the majors. It's a
sign of the tour marketing for the young guys. It's no insult to me
or like they're pushing me out.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour still needs Sampras. He is still popular, still a
dominant figure in demand. But in some ways, the women's tour is in
far better shape. With rivalries and charismatic personalities, the
women are in the spotlight. Early in the day, the women provided
one of the first round's most intriguing matches. After the rain,
the flower beds were mussed by gusty winds and the puddles turned
into reflecting pools for Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a 90-minute rain delay, she had time to contemplate
the approach that undid her in the first set, which she dropped,
7-5, to Joannette Kruger, ranked 63rd on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think the rain delay helped me to realize a lot
of what I was doing wrong,'' said Sanchez-Vicario, who won, 5-7,
6-4, 7-6 (2), even though Kruger had a chance to serve for the
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back hitting well again. I was able to win. I probably
let her play too much. But I think at the end, I pulled it out
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis had an easier time. She had never played Jidkova before
but quickly deciphered the best approach to beating her and went
about her quick work.
</P>
<P>
   But she knows what is looming. She knows there is a potential
meeting against Venus Williams in the semifinals. Even though she
has been rattled by Williams' power in the past, she is mentally
steeled if the occasion to play her should arise once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people don't understand why I'm up there,'' Hingis
said, referring to her No. 1 ranking. ``The fans, when they watch
me, I don't hit the ball as hard as Venus. But you know, I've got a
pretty good all-around game. It's just no weaknesses, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to deal with things, like being No. 1, the pressure.
I think now I've survived quite a bit, and I think I can improve my
game again.''
</P>
<P>
   No redesign necessary. No additives required.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life is too nice,'' said Hingis, who bristled when asked if
she would ever think of taking supplements to help her build
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I start taking something else to bulk myself up to get
bigger, it's not worth it for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my speed and quickness is my game anyway. If I get
bigger, I just get slower, and that's not my game.''

   The company CEO on TV stares into your eyes and pours out his
heart. It doesn't quite fill a shot glass.
</P>
<P>
   By God, he's so sorry, he's almost in tears, and he won't sleep
until the problem has been rectified and you, the cherished
customer, have been taken care of _ up to and including your

   United Airlines' CEO, golly does he feel bad about 10 trillion
United fliers currently camped out in airport boarding areas. Some
have been camped so long that they get mail delivered there.

<P>
   You know this man is United's CEO because he is talking to you
from inside an airplane, and who but a United CEO could actually
board a United airplane?

   The Ford guy is my favorite. Heavy Australian accent, so you
know he's a good bloke who likes to drink beer and laugh when he's
not worried sick about your car rolling over and spilling the

</P>
<P>
   The company is working around the clock to fix the problem with
the Explorer's faulty tires and lousy suspension, he says, or words
to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   He also says that there are two things that Ford will  &UR; never &LR; 
take for granted: profits, and the ``personal safety of my precious
arse.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually he says the two things are ``owner safety'' and
``trust,'' but what's the diff?
</P>
<P>
   As Marshall McLuhan or Marshall Dillon or somebody said, ``The
message is the massage.''
</P>
<P>
   INCIDENTALLY, I hear reports that Ford will paste a large
warning sticker on the dashboard of each Explorer to discourage
driving maneuvers that might exceed the suspension limitations of
the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The sticker will say: DO NOT EXPLORE!

   MOOCH THE ROMANTIC: 49ers' Forty-Niners' coach Steve (Mooch)
Mariucci got a big laugh at the 49ers' kickoff luncheon Friday,
introducing wife Gayle: ``I haven't seen her in six weeks so I
asked her if she wanted to have lunch in the city. ... So here it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cute. And that evening, Mr. &AMP; Mrs. Mooch dropped into P.J.
Mulhern's in North Beach. They sat at the bar, ate calamari and
lamb sirloin, talked 49er football with the patrons and watched the
Rams-Cowboys game on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Then they went home, turned off the lights ... and broke down
Atlanta Falcons' game films.
</P>
<P>
   I'm just guessing at that part. Could have been Packers' films.

   Now we know auto tires shred and explode if they're
underinflated or overinflated. When was the last time you checked
yours?

   And where? At a gas station? Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   If you're old enough to remember when the station attendant
would cheerfully check your tire pressure, it doesn't matter what
kind of shape your tires are in now because you're at death's door
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If your station does have an air compressor with a PSI (pounds
per square inch) gauge, chances are the gauge is broken or faulty.
Those gauges, I'm guessing, are made by the same people who make
BART escalators.

RIDER WILL BE FINE, IF HE`S ON TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO _ Isaiah Rider's introductory press conference Monday
began a few minutes late. It wasn't Isaiah's fault. He arrived
promptly. So we're assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a problem with the electrical system, so there was a
delay,'' explained Michael Uhlenkamp, one of the Lakers publicists,
gesturing toward the microphones and cameras set up on the team's
practice court. ``He was definitely on time. Early!''
</P>
<P>
   This means one of two things: Rider has mended his ways and will
never be late for a team event again. Or we should expect a number
of ``problems with the electrical system'' at the Staples Center
next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Rider, who is in his late 20s, comes to the Lakers with a
bit of a reputation for disruptive behavior. He has livened up the
basketball scenes in Minnesota, Portland and Atlanta by earning
repeated suspensions and fines for assorted incidents of marijuana
possession, locker-room altercations, ballistic spitting, and
tardiness.
</P>
<P>
   But among these misdemeanors, the one that seems to concern the
Lakers front office is the tardiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it's the same old questions,'' general manager Mitch
Kupchak said, referring to his examination of Rider's record in the
days before he signed the sharp-shooting guard as a free agent last
Friday. ``He's been late. He doesn't come to practice. But once you
get past that, he's one of the most talented players ever to play
in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing I could come up with is that he's late. I
don't see the big risk here.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do I.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are paying the late, great Rider $736,000 on a
one-year contract, the low end of the scale for seven-year pros.
That's $2.3 million less than Travis Knight will receive next
season and a couple hundred thousand less than Tyronn Lue.
</P>
<P>
   As much as everybody would prefer to fill a roster with Eagle
Scouts boasting 30-point averages, the Lakers are practically
forced by economics to take risks like this. Up against the NBA
salary cap, they must hunt for bargains, players whose prices are
held down by factory defects.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes a matter of what sort of some sort of blemish you'd
rather have, the occasional ``Hey, anybody seen Isaiah?'' or a guy
who can't shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak suggests the problem could be solved if Riders finds a
home near the arena, or if he hires ``somebody to drive him
around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A.'s not the easiest place to move around in, getting to a
game,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   Rider said he has searched his soul and figured out what has
gone wrong with his career, the future of which was up in the air
after the Atlanta Hawks released him March 17. He said he summoned
his better angels and assembled a plan to correct things. He didn't
say if he bought a freeway map.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you (the plan), but I can't tell you,'' he
said, mysteriously. He indicated he'd try to live somewhere between
the downtown Staples Center and the team's El Segundo training
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere that I can get there on the streets. I'm from Cali
(California, specifically Oakland), I know what it's like at 2
o'clock in the afternoon,'' Rider said.
</P>
<P>
   What I like about the Rider signing is that he might be just the
man to keep things interesting while the Lakers waltz to
championship after championship in the years before Shaquille
O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Phil Jackson go their separate ways.
Otherwise it could get monotonous.
</P>
<P>
   The chances are slim that his behavior will actually disrupt a
veteran team blessed with the confidence and steady self-image of a
defending champion and the most secure head coach in all of sports.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part for Rider might be living up to our low
expectations. Compared to some of the troublemakers who have come
through this town Alex Johnson, Steve Howe, Dennis Rodman, the
Raiders _ a nicely groomed and well-spoken young man with a few
tardies on his report card is kind of a piker.
</P>
<P>
   Better to worry about a player because he might not show up than
because he might.

EDITORIAL: A CIA COVER-UP ON CHILE
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 29:
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton first promised that the administration
would declassify secret documents on political violence in Chile,
the Central Intelligence Agency pledged to cooperate. Now it is
breaking that promise with regard to the most important information
_ documents about covert operations to destabilize the socialist
government of Salvador Allende and support Augusto Pinochet's
repressive security forces after his 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Although the State Department has cooperated, the CIA argued
that the president's directive did not cover most files on its own
operations. After howls from Congress, human rights advocates and
State Department officials, the CIA last year agreed to review and
release those files. Its declassification experts marked hundreds
of documents for release on Sept. 14 and deleted their references
to confidential sources and methods.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA. is still planning to release files on its covert
operations to keep Allende from taking power after winning the 1970
election. But George Tenet, director of central intelligence, has
blocked release of hundreds of other documents on covert actions
both before and after Pinochet came to power on grounds that the
documents illustrate a ``pattern of activity'' that reveals
``intelligence methods that have been employed worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental group
that fought for declassification, points out, the methods these
documents describe were publicly revealed a quarter-century ago by
a Senate select committee on intelligence. There is no good reason
to withhold documents that would help Chileans and Americans
understand their past.
</P>
<P>
   After a public outcry earlier this month, the administration set
up an interagency panel to look at the documents and recommend to
Tenet which of them should be declassified. Clinton should simply
instruct him to declassify the documents. Tenet insists he is not
simply trying to cover up actions that were an embarrassment to the
United States. But it sure looks that way, and his defiance of the
presidential order for openness adds a new embarrassment to the
list.

OAKLAND MAYOR INSPIRES A NEW AGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JANINE DeFAO 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Does this look like the urging of some New Age
yogi or Hindu sage?
</P>
<P>
   Try instead an open invitation in a newspaper ad from a big-city
mayor to come make a mind-body connection _ at his home.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly not typical, but not altogether surprising _ not
if that mayor is Oakland's Jerry Brown, nicknamed ``Governor
Moonbeam'' two decades ago for his proposal to have California
launch its own satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brown is more often derided these days for his
unabashed courting of developers and dot-coms, the three-time
presidential candidate, who attended Jesuit seminary and studied
Zen meditation in Japan, has not completely lost touch with his
inner guru.
</P>
<P>
   He offers yoga and tai chi for the public weekly at his home.
And now, Brown is ready to try on a new mantle, that of philosopher
king.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Saturday, his quasi-communal live-work warehouse near
Jack London Square will host two dozen academics led by philosopher
and social historian Ivan Illich, who has been Brown's friend and
teacher for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, called the Oakland Table, will last five weeks
and will take place twice a year for the next three to five years.
Lectures, discussion groups and seminars are scheduled almost
daily, and all are free and open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Exploring Society
</P>
<P>
   The theme is the ``city as a place,'' and it will explore the
isolation and homogenization of modern society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as an opportunity to gain insight on what the
modern world is doing to people, doing to our consciousness, our
sense of who we are and what it means to be human,'' said Brown,
who plans to attend many of the sessions. ``And what it means to be
human in the year 2000 is very different than what it meant to be
human 500 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Nightly seminars will range from ``Medieval Philosophical
Latin'' _ of interest to Brown, who majored in classical languages
in college _ to ``Politics from the Ground Up,'' which Brown
himself will host. Required reading for the seminars will be
available at Oakland public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting scholars, who will live at the mayor's house during
the Oakland Table, include architects, linguists and
mathematicians. Many are part of Illich's scholarly circle.
</P>
<P>
   Illich will give the first of six Saturday lectures at the We
the People auditorium in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aristotle says the unexamined life is not worth living,''
Brown said. ``So we're examining. That's exactly what this is. ...
What we're looking at is a recovery of what it means to be a human
being, creating your life instead of having it created for you.''
</P>
<P>
   These are definitely not the questions being explored at City
Hall, where Brown is more concerned about the nuts and bolts of
crime statistics and school test scores. But he does see a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as very valuable to study history, to study
traditional thinking to gain distance and perspective on what we're
doing now,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Disappearance of Commons
</P>
<P>
   One of the topics to be examined is the loss of ``civic
relatedness,'' the disappearance of commons where diverse citizens
can come together outside the confines of their private homes _ and
how such spaces can be re-created.
</P>
<P>
   Brown hopes the Oakland Table can provide such a forum as ``a
group of people sitting around a table, reading books, talking
about ideas, in friendship pursuing truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has been a goal of his five-year experiment in communal
living at We the People, the name of his nonprofit educational
association, the warehouse he built near the Oakland waterfront
five years ago and the radio show he hosted from there.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment continues, although some of its loftier goals
have fallen by the wayside. Its environmental School of
Sustainability fizzled after a year. The rooftop garden still
exists, but it isn't being farmed as a cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   And Brown's housemates have shrunk to a relatively small circle:
his longtime friend and adviser Jacques Barzhagi, Barzhagi's wife
and toddler, press secretary Erica Harrold and Marcus Clark, a
sometimes driver for Brown and Barzhagi who also works in the
construction and cleaning industries.
</P>
<P>
   But tai chi classes have been part of the scene since the
beginning, and a twice-weekly yoga class, open to the public for a
small fee, was resurrected this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who practiced yoga regularly before he moved to Oakland,
doesn't attend the morning classes in the We the People auditorium,
but he can sometimes be heard in the kitchen next door. Or a
passer-by may wander in, insisting he knows the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's holistic,'' Brown, who is featured this month on the
cover of a Buddhism and meditation magazine, Shambhala Sun, said of
yoga. ``We should definitely be putting more into body-mind
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   It is ``definitely on my `to do' list,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoga teacher Catherine Cowsill said she doesn't push Brown too
much to come to class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yoga isn't just a physical practice. He's working on his
dharma,'' Cowsill said, referring to the Hindu term for a person's
core mission. ``He's doing something to keep him physical and
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is sure that she ``would not be there if Jerry didn't
want a yoga class there. ... It would never happen at President
Clinton's house. It wouldn't happen anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The class is small, a mostly word-of-mouth gathering of people
who have some connection to Brown or his housemates. There is a
choreographer, a dancer, a baker, a neighbor and a gallery owner
who sits on the city's cultural arts commission. Press secretary
Harrold is a regular.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the location, it is much like any other yoga class.
People breathe and stretch, balance in poses named warrior and
cobra and boat.
</P>
<P>
   But Cowsill, who lives in West Oakland, believes that her class
can provide a greater good not just for the individual, but for the
city itself.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Sense of Sharing
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the way (Brown) lives and the projection of how he
is seeps into the fabric of what the city is becoming,'' she said.
To her, Oakland is a place of ``creative people, deep vision and a
sense of real sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown hopes to share with the public his intellectual
meanderings through the Illich project, although he realizes the
subject matter probably will not appeal to a mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been following the work of Illich, 73, since the late
1960s, when he came across the book, ``Deschooling Society,'' which
criticized formal education as ``a standardizing and dependency-
and privilege-creating institution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met in the mid-1970s, and Brown has been several
times to Cuernavaca, Mexico, where Illich first brought together a
group of intellectuals and activists who questioned the concepts of
progress and development. Illich now splits his time between
Cuernavaca and Bremen, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a historian, he's a theologian, he's a philosopher. He
has tremendous understanding that is outside the normal
conventional channels that you run into, and that's why I find it
bracing, challenging to spend time with him,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The project is expected to cost $120,000 a year, which We the
People is raising through contributions. The academics involved
hope to publish a book and a series of shorter booklets based on
their work in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a side of Oakland that hasn't ever been explored or
brought out,'' said yoga participant Bridget Berrigan, a former
Brown campaign volunteer. ``A spiritual side, a coming to terms
with what it means to be a citizen of the city these days, what it
means to be a community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brown) has been doing this for years,'' she said. ``It's not
new and radical in his life, but it may be for Oaklanders.''

 UNITED SERVICE IMPROVES AFTER TENTATIVE LABOR PACT  &HT;     By DAVID R. BAKER and ALAN GATHRIGHT 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For business traveler Peter Molloy, Monday's
United Airlines flight into San Francisco International Airport
proved nothing short of remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   It landed on time.
</P>
<P>
   No mysterious delays on the ground in Tucson, Ariz. or Los
Angeles. No last-minute cancellations, followed by a mad scramble
for another flight. Coming just two days after United pilots
reached a tentative agreement in their summer long labor dispute
with the airline, the entire trip went off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the shuttle to arrive on time in San Francisco is a big
achievement,'' said a relieved Molloy, 46.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco and across the country, problem-plagued United
returned to something like normalcy Monday. The airline's network
of flights _ tangled all summer by delays blamed on bad weather and
fed-up pilots _ ran largely on time.
</P>
<P>
   More than 71 percent of United's 2,400 worldwide flights arrived
on schedule Monday, compared to 40 percent overall for the entire
month to date. And the airline, which in May canceled 75 San
Francisco flights in one day, canceled just 61 Monday throughout
its global network.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big sense of relief,'' said Mike McCarron, SFO's
assistant deputy airport director. ``Especially as we're getting
ready for the Labor Day weekend crunch, the last thing we need is
some labor dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Both United, the world's biggest airline, and the Air Line
Pilots Association declined to release details of the agreement,
preferring to wait until after the union's governing board receives
the proposal next week. Several pilots at SFO said they didn't know
the specifics. But they were happy to put the dispute behind them,
saying a quick resolution would benefit both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely good news,'' said First Officer Bill Harris,
37, waiting for his flight to Washington, D.C.'s Dulles
International Airport. ``A lot of times, the pilots get blamed for
a lot of it. People don't understand the full story.''
</P>
<P>
   United's 10,500 pilots have worked without a new contract since
their last one expired in April. Although union representatives
insist the association never organized or encouraged any effort to
delay flights this summer, many frustrated pilots refused to work
overtime, leading to scheduling problems throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ken Bradley, spokesman for the union's United pilots,
said Monday the association did nothing within the last two days to
get pilots back into the planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has told the pilots to do extra shifts, or do anything
differently, just as nobody ever told them to do anything else,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet travelers used to SFO's crowds of angry, delayed fliers
found a surprisingly quiet airport Monday. Departure boards for
United, the airport's main airline, showed just two afternoon
cancellations _ both of them shuttles to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Many United travelers, anxious about their plans, had already
heard about the tentative agreement. For Garry Wood and his family
_ on vacation from Hertford, England _ the settlement arrived none
too soon. Wood, his wife and three children were relieved to find
their flight to Honolulu boarding on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling with a family is difficult already,'' said Wood, 44.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, he said, if the contract dispute had dragged on through
his family's 17-hour return trip to England.
</P>
<P>
   ``You add another six hours to that because the pilots are on
strike, and it's a lot worse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Problems at the airline have been so widespread that few
business travelers flying through SFO managed to avoid them. As
chief executive officer of a Madison, Wisc. biotech firm, Molloy
flies United often, usually through its Chicago hub. The delays can
be maddening, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been caught up in it a couple of times, and it's
incredibly frustrating,'' he said, waiting for his bags to tumble
into view. ``As a business traveler, you expect things to work. And
this doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The pact probably won't be ratified for at least another month.
The pilots association's governing board will vote on it during a
special meeting Sept. 6-8. Assuming it passes, the union will then
hold information sessions for the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will not end the company's potential labor woes.
Talks with the machinists union are ongoing. Machinists
representatives could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, however, said he hopes the weekend's tentative
agreement will help repair the damage done to the airline's
reputation by this summer's delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is the hope of all concerned that this agreement
will lay the groundwork for United management to get back on track
to rebuild this company and restore public confidence,'' he said.

 MATH SCORES ADD UP TO SAT SUCCESS  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verbal scores on nationwide college entrance exams held steady
this year, but math scores hit a 30-year high, jumping three points
after dipping slightly last year.
</P>
<P>
   While the national average on the SAT rose from 511 to 514,
California students did even better. For the second year, they
outperformed their counterparts nationwide in math with average
scores rising from 514 to 518, according to information released
Tuesday by the College Board.
</P>
<P>
   The board administers the SAT, an exam that measures the
mathematics and verbal skills of high school students bound for
college. The test, which has a possible score of 800 in each
subject and is used by 83 percent of four-year colleges as a factor
in admission, was taken this year by more than one-and-a-quarter
million seniors nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   This year's scores also show minority groups regaining some of
the ground they lost from 1998 to 1999, when education advocates
worried that the gap between racial and ethnic groups was growing.
Although whites continued to be the top scorers, their math scores
increased at a lower rate than did those of African Americans and
some Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   African Americans scored an average of 426 in math, up from 422
last year, and Mexican Americans scored 460 in math, up from 456.
Whites scored 530 in math, up from 528.
</P>
<P>
   However, verbal scores remained the same for the two minority
groups, while whites gained a point.
</P>
<P>
   Women are making progress in closing the gap with men. Since
1990, the average verbal score for women has risen 8 points to 504,
while men have improved by only 2 points to 507. Since the 1980s,
the gap in math scores has dropped 5 points, although it still
remains large, men scoring an average of 533 and women 498.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the national average for math scores has risen 13
points since 1990, for the first time bringing it above the 1970
score of 512. (The 1970 numbers have been adjusted to reflect a
recentering of SAT scores in 1995.) The increase may reflect a
boost in math and science preparation in high school, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-nine percent of both men and women report taking four or
more years of mathematics, up from 68 percent of men and 62 percent
of women 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many districts are strengthening graduation requirements to
include more math, and the state has worked during the past decade
to reform its math program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It contradicts those who claim that all American schools are
falling apart,'' said Bob Schaeffer, public education director of
the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, an organization that
opposes test requirements.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the annual fluctuations mean little. This was a
sentiment reiterated by San Francisco State University math
professor Dan Sendel, who does not expect to see significant gains
until every classroom has a credentialed teacher trained in the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge set of students, and to make a 13 point jump in
that large a population takes work,'' Sendel said. ``It may be
going in the right direction, but we still have a long, long way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Average national SAT verbal scores remained steady at 505 for
the fifth consecutive year. For the 12th year in a row, California
students lagged behind the rest of the nation in verbal skills,
posting a score of 497, unchanged from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does suggest that it is harder to budge reading scores,
especially in states like California with a high percentage of
students who speak English as a second language,'' said Bruce
Fuller, a professor of education and public policy at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   This year's test takers are the most diverse group ever, 34
percent being nonwhite and a third having parents who did not
attend college.
</P>
<P>
   The number of foreign-born and first generation American test
takers has increased by 47 percent, nearly three times the growth
rate of the overall SAT test takers, since the College Board began
tracking the data in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In California, 19 percent of test takers reported that English
was not their first language, compared with only 9 percent
nationwide. In California, they gained ground on the test, with
scores rising from an average of 444 to 446 on the verbal section
and from 500 to 507 on the math.
</P>
<P>
   In California, 11 percent of test takers had parents who had not
earned a high school diploma, compared with 4 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as there is a more diverse population taking the test and
going to college, we are still seeing gains. That is a big success
story for California,'' Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound in minority scores is surprising considering that on
Friday, National Assessment of Educational Progress report revealed
what appeared to be contrary data. It showed that the average black
17-year-old reads about as well as the average white 13-year-old
and that the gap between white and minority students is again
widening. Fuller said that since the SAT is taken by students
interested in attending college, while the NAEP is taken by a
sampling of 9-, 13- and 17-year-olds, the apparent conflict may
indicate another disparity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent school reform may be helping college-bound students
and not other students,'' he said.

 &HT;    (Eds, this   story was mistakenly sent under slugL.A. COUNTY SUPERVISOR WANTS AN AUDIT OF SECRET COURT FUND &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Outraged that Los Angeles County Superior Court
officials kept secret an account containing $81.6 million, County
Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich called for a sweeping audit to
find who is owed $18 million in interest.
</P>
<P>
   Antonovich said Monday he will introduce a motion at today's
Board of Supervisors' meeting to order an audit and determine
whether the county withdrew money illegally for its general fund.
</P>
<P>
   A Daily News story on Sunday outlined how the account was kept
secret until a bribery case involving an Encino attorney exposed
its existence. Cities and individuals pay into the account during
disputes over eminent domain cases, but the courts failed to notify
them that they are due interest.
</P>
<P>
   Antonovich said he is outraged by court officials' decision to
keep the account confidential for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current system is irresponsible and an example of
insensitive bureaucrats,'' he said. ``This is an example of why big
government is unable to meet the needs of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big bureaucracies tend to lose track of whom they are serving
and the courts need to recognize that individuals' rights need to
be protected and their properties held need to be returned to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the bribery case -- &UR;  &LR; the largest in county
history -- that court officials began notifying people about the
trust account, which contains $18 &UR;  &LR; million in interest owed to
local governments and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association, said he believes the court's decision not to tell
people about the money was a serious act of neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a shocking development involving a large amount of
money,'' Coupal said. ``Our hope is that public officials work
quickly and earnestly to make sure that the owners of the funds
receive what rightfully belongs to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Presiding Judge Victor E. Chavez said the court
has acted appropriately, and he is upset by the accusation of
intentional negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask for my reaction, it's righteous indignation,'' he
said. ``We have not hidden anything from anybody. We have not done
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these funds accrue to the benefit of the court. We've
got an obligation in case after case to maintain the privacy of the
people involved. It's not our obligation or appropriate for us to
get other folks involved in other people's cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said people can check the status of their cases in an
index at the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you expect me or judges to go into ongoing cases and
provide people with information, you are expecting too much of us
and expecting something we shouldn't do. The indexes have always
been open. There is no secret and no wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his motion, however, Antonovich disagreed, saying the courts
and individuals should have been notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those entities owed funds should have received regular, timely
notice of funds available. Instead, no notice was sent to any
entity regarding the trust account. Currently, notice is sent
annually to municipalities owed funds, but not to individuals or
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The motion calls for the auditor-controller to audit the
account, including separate audits of the principle and interest
accounts, determine the amount held in each account and determine
whether funds transferred out of the account into the general fund
in 1985 and 1994 went through the proper procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Antonovich also is calling on the Superior Court Finance Office
to send notices every six months to the cities, businesses and
individuals that have funds owed to them.
</P>
<P>
   The court has been sending notices out to cities since last year
after the investigation into the bribery case started.
</P>
<P>
   In the scheme, Gregory Pentoney, 32, of Downey gave secret
county account data to Encino attorney Robert Fenton, 51, who
collected bounty fees for tracking down forgotten funds owed to
cities, mostly in interest, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   They split about $1.5 million in fees by telling cities and
other government agencies how they could collect about $5 million.
Both pleaded no contest to bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, Fenton began a 16-month state prison term. Pentoney
is expected to begin serving a two-year prison term Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Encino attorney James Blatt, who is representing Fenton, said
he's very pleased with Antonovich's motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's long overdue,'' he said. ``I think if anything good comes
from this unfortunate event with Mr. Fenton, it's now come to the
public's attention about this unjust situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Wina, spokeswoman for Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke,
said the supervisor said people should know that accounts like this
exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supervisor is certainly willing to support a motion that
would search for similar kinds of accounts so they could be made
public,'' Wina said.

SHEFFIELD MIGHT BE BACK FOR PHILLY SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Gary Sheffield couldn't even walk around the block
without a rest. So getting on a plane, flying halfway across the
country and playing baseball in any of the next three days is out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson is hoping Sheffield can be
back in time for Friday's home stand opener against Philadelphia.
Sheffield remained at his Los Angeles home trying to recover from a
viral infection, and Friday is the new target date.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't even handle walking around the block,'' Johnson
said. ``I just hope he can get better by Friday. He doesn't sound
too good, but he wants to be here. I said Sheff, `Don't even try to
feel guilty about not being here. Try to rest and relax and get
well.'`'
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers couldn't stand the thought of losing Sheffield for
five games because of suspension, and now they're 7-1 in his
absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we have guys that can play,'' Dodgers
second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said, ``but I don't know how long
we can keep going without Sheff.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Sheffield returns, it's going to take him time to
regain his strength. Grudzielanek missed six games, bridged by the
all-star break, with a viral infection. Grudzielanek also lost 13
pounds. Johnson said Sheffield has lost 10.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's hitting .331 and even though he's missed the last
week, he still leads the Dodgers in homers (40), RBI (96), runs
scored (93) and walks (87).
</P>
<P>
   But Grudzielanek said it took him nearly three weeks to start
feeling like his normal self, and by then his timing was out of
kilter. Since the all-star break, Grudzielanek's batting .236 with
six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take that much time off and lose weight, it was much
more difficult for me to come back than I thought it would be,''
Grudzielanek said. ``I came back too quick. I had no business being
in there at all in late July. I lost a lot when I got back. You
start doing things that I didn't know I was doing.... My hands were
different, my feet were different.''
</P>
<P>
   SEPTEMBER CALL-UPS: The Dodgers' return home Friday coincides
with rosters expanding from 25 to 40, but because the Triple-A
Albuquerque Dukes are heading to the playoffs, the initial call-ups
will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Paul LoDuca, who's been recalled twice this season and
has expanded his resume by playing outfield and other infield
positions, and left-hander Onan Masaoka are expected to join the
club for the weekend series against Philadelphia. Infielder Chris
Donnels, who's been on the disabled list with a sore right shoulder
for the last month, is expected to be activated.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also would like to add a right-handed long-relief
man, but they don't want to deprive right-handers Mike Judd or Eric
Gagne of the playoff experience in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dodgers might take a look at right-hander Luke
Prokopec, who's having a strong season at Double-A San Antonio.
Prokopec is 7-3 with a 2.45 ERA in 22 starts. In 128 2/3 innings,
Prokopec has 124 strikeouts and walked 23.
</P>
<P>
   After Albuquerque's playoff run is over, the Dodgers will look
at recalling Judd, Gagne and catching prospect Angel Pena. However,
a Dodgers official said recalling Gagne and Judd could depend on
the number of innings they will have thrown this season. Lefty Jeff
Williams is also a possible September call-up.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Left fielder Bruce Aven, who homered twice, was
scratched from the starting lineup because of a strained oblique
muscle. He's day-to-day.... Center fielder Devon White jogged in
the outfield and his strained left quadricep felt better. However,
Johnson said White remains a few days away from returning.

VETERAN CORNERBACK SPARKS SIGNS WITH COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Roughly two hours after giving a ``we got an
experienced player'' speech to a pack of cameras and notepads
regarding Monday's signing of veteran cornerback Phillippi Sparks,
Dallas Cowboys coach Dave Campo was discussing music in the hallway
of the team's Valley Ranch headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder he didn't break out in song.
</P>
<P>
   Caught with his guard down, a gleeful Campo said he was
``extremely happy'' about the moves the Cowboys have made the past
two days and said he ``can't wait'' for Sunday's season opener
against the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Sparks, which improves the team's depleted and
inexperienced cornerback corps, follows the trade for tight end
O.J. Santiago on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, an eight-year veteran who retired after last season,
started for the New York Giants the past seven seasons. Santiago
was a starter for the Atlanta Falcons the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, not only are the Cowboys better than they were before the
moves, but they are better than they were before training camp when
the team planned to play a hobbling Kevin Smith (now retired) and
second-year man Mike Lucky (injured) at starting cornerback and
third tight end, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there is no question that Phillippi can come in here
and give us experience and skill that really benefits this team,''
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ``If you add this to the fact that
we got O.J., we've made an impact on our roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, 31, will play and might even supplant rookie Kareem
Larrimore as the starter opposite Ryan McNeil against the Eagles,
depending on Sparks' conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys released middle linebacker Chris Bordano to make
room for Sparks after unsuccessfully trying to trade the former SMU
standout.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks signed a five-year, $18 million deal that includes a
$1.55 million signing bonus. He will get $450,000 in base salary
this season and $1 million in 2001 before his salary jumps to $5
million in each of the final three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who said he has healed from the groin injury that
sidelined him for the final five games last season, came out of
retirement to sign with the Cowboys. For now, he's taking it one
year at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's one more year?'' Sparks said. ``I'm going to take it
for what it is. I've got one year to get it done. Whatever happens,
Dallas has my rights. You never know, there might be some positive
years ahead. I want to make this one special. I'm not here to be
the savior but I want to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks' presence has already done wonders for members of the
Cowboys' brass, who were admittedly concerned about starting a
rookie at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said they weren't down on Larrimore, a fourth-round pick.
But starting a rookie was something they didn't plan on, despite
their selection of three cornerbacks in the 2000 draft.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Smith's departure, the Cowboys are without
veteran cornerback Charlie Williams, who missed training camp and
will be out for the first three games of the regular season because
of a staph infection.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' plans suffered another hit when rookie cornerbacks
Mario Edwards (sixth round) and Dwayne Goodrich (second round)
missed the final three weeks of training camp with hamstring
strains. Those events left Larrimore, the most promising of the
rookies, in the starting lineup by default.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't line this thing up by design to go with a rookie,''
Jones said. ``When Kevin retired and Charlie was injured, we were
sitting out here going for it with rookies. Then we didn't get the
competition we really wanted with our rookies. We were way behind
schedule. This was the prudent thing to do. We feel fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who have pursued the 5-foot-11, 195-pound Sparks
for the past three weeks, convinced him to sign after increasing
their original contract offer. Still, defensive coordinator Mike
Zimmer, who compares Sparks to McNeil, said the Cowboys are
fortunate that he was available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lucky,'' Zimmer said. ``He had a deal done with the
Rams. Other teams were interested. Obviously, we don't have Deion
(Sanders), but we have two Ryan McNeils. This gives us a chance (to
be good). I feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   And Campo feels like singing. nn

SANTIAGO QUICKLY ENROLLS IN COWBOYS OFFENSE 101 (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jerry Jones couldn't sleep. Dave Campo couldn't
wipe the smile off his face. The Dallas Cowboys can hardly wait to
see newcomer O.J. Santiago in the season opener against
Philadelphia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Cowboys faxed several pages of the Jack
Reilly/Ernie Zampese playbook to the newly acquired tight end
(traded by the Atlanta Falcons for a fourth-round pick in 2001 and
a seventh-round pick in 2002), just so he had something to read on
his two-hour flight from Atlanta to Fort Worth/Dallas on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL today, it's all about packaging.
</P>
<P>
   In this offense, Santiago has his name on a few packages already
for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys want to see him in the same lineup as Joey Galloway
and Rocket Ismail or paired with either Jackie Harris or David
LaFleur in the double-tight-end set. They consider the 6-foot-7,
264-pound Santiago's addition to the team as more than just a
backup, or a No. 3 tight end, but another weapon to drive opposing
defensive coordinators crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning on the run,'' said Santiago, working mostly in
LaFleur's spot Monday as the Cowboys continue their conservative
approach with LaFleur, who played for the first time Thursday night
after being sidelined with a groin strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too bad. I had somebody whispering in my ear what to
do each time I ran up to the line of scrimmage,'' said Santiago,
who had tight ends coach Les Miles on his shoulder throughout the
90-minute practice at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago, a fourth-year player who started on the Falcons' Super
Bowl team two years ago, is as eager as the Cowboys, but also
extremely honest. The playbook that he was handed might as well
have been written in Sanskrit.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plays looked familiar. Some of the motion influences
were the same as Atlanta. But the terminology may as well have
dropped in out of the sky from Pluto.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, Miles marveled at Santiago's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be real honest with you, there's no chance that I
could do what he did today,'' Miles said. ``He showed up here
today, and the only thing he recognized was that he put his helmet
on the same way he has his whole life. Everything else was new to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago plans to ``memorize the game plan'' _ well, certain
packages _ which he finds to be less cumbersome than trying to
learn the entire playbook as he would have done in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be ready for Sunday,'' he said. ``I was ready to play
against the 49ers ... now it's just the Eagles instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago comes to the Cowboys with a one-year contract after
being tendered the restricted free-agent minimum ($472,000) by the
Falcons, who didn't have Santiago in their future after sending
their 2000 first-round draft pick to Baltimore for a chance to take
tight end Reggie Kelly in the second round in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When 1998 NFC rushing champion Jamal Anderson tore knee
ligaments against the Cowboys in Week 2 of the '99 season at Texas
Stadium, the Falcons scrapped their plans to use two tight ends in
a featured running attack ... and Santiago became the odd-man out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way game is going these days. You've got to be
ready to leave for anywhere in 15 minutes,'' Santiago said. ``When
I heard that I was going to be traded, I packed my bag and I was
out of there ... happy to be with America's Team.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo's biggest concern over preparation for the Eagles in five
days is with Santiago, not newly signed cornerback Phillippi
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing will be with O.J. getting the terminology
down,'' Campo said. ``That's why it was so big that he practiced
today. I'd rather that it be him than Phillippi because, obviously,
there are more things to learn offensively than defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Santiago expects to have a busy week in a brand-new town.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly reading, probably. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys were able to call back and re-sign quarterback
Clint Stoerner, running back Troy Hambrick and wide receiver Damon
Hodge to play on the practice squad. Each cleared 24-hour waivers.
The Cowboys will go with the practice-squad maximum of five players
and are expected to add defensive end Aaron Fields and tight end
Chris Fontenot.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys will hold their annual Kickoff Luncheon on Tuesday
at the Intercontinental Hotel, beginning at 11:30 a.m. nn

LAPD OFFICIALS DISCUSS SURGE IN VIOLENT INNER-CITY CRIME &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Top LAPD commanders pledged to mobilize officers
and the community to stop a sudden surge in violent crime in the
city, occurring mainly on weekends among young, inner-city
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department officials said they would detail
their plan next week to fight the sharp rise in homicides in the
South and Central bureaus, even as the San Fernando Valley Bureau
has reported the city's only decline in crime.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour meeting of 20 top LAPD commanders during a
summit Monday on violent crime, officials said they are committed
to making sure the streets in the inner city are not surrendered to
hoodlums. But while attacking inner-city crime, staffing levels
will remain at least at current levels in Valley and elsewhere,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some clear patterns we identified as it relates to
crime, and we are going to develop some strategies to reduce it
between now and the end of the year and to carry on to next year,''
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have something by next week that we can talk about on
strategies to help us reduce violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit was prompted by a 23.5 percent rise in homicides
citywide, as reported in the Los Angeles Daily News on Monday.
Homicides in the Valley dropped by 8.5 percent, from 47 to 43
slayings, while the South and Central bureaus reported that
increases jumped from 264 to 326.
</P>
<P>
   To be effective against crime, police said more than the LAPD
must be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires the entire community to work together to address
these issues. Various parts of the government must also be
involved,'' said the department's top spokesman, Cmdr. Dave Kalish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we all work together -- the Police Department, the
community, elected officials -- we can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the LAPD will examine the Valley, where community
programs with volunteers assisting police have been effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley is really known for citizen participation,'' Kalish
said. ``I imagine other areas will be looking at what's worked in
the Valley and, if appropriate, replicating what's worked there.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the session was devoted mostly to an examination of
statistics and to begin looking at possible solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we found are a lot of similarities between the victims
and the suspects,'' the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   They are young -- between the ages of 13 and 23.
</P>
<P>
   They are minority -- 50 percent are Latino, 45 percent are
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   They are out at night and on weekends -- most of the slayings
occurred between 6 p.m. and 3 a.m. and between Thursday nights and
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Klein, a professor at the USC Social Science Research
Institute, said there are no easy answers, and he pointed out the
increase in homicides is only over the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are looking at is homicide, because crime generally is
going down across the nation. When you look at why homicides are up
in these areas of Los Angeles, the answers are unknown and the
police will tell you they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have to do with an increase in gang-related crime. But
why is that going up? There is no answer. Gang crime has been going
down for six years in a row and at some point it has to bottom
out,'' he said. ``Gang violence is cyclical and maybe what we are
seeing is a statistical phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein also said the nature of the inner-city neighborhoods is
changing as more Latino youths move into traditionally
African-American areas, resulting in increased tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Schumsky, chief probation officer for the county, said
he also is unclear about why there is an increase in the homicide
rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could represent an anomaly, and you hear different
theories, such as prison inmates being released and trying to
reestablish themselves. But it's probably too quick to make a
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumsky said he was pleased with the quick LAPD effort to deal
with the problem and said his office also will have some tools
under new state legislation to do some prevention work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can expect to see some more resources sent to the `hot'
areas and then in a few months we can form a conclusion,'' Schumsky
said. ``It's hard to say at this point if this is more than a
one-time thing or a serious new trend.''
</P>
<P>
   After the LAPD summit, Kalish said the department's first step
will be to gather as much information as possible on the slayings
and the second step will be to look at programs needed while
determining whether adequate resources are available.
</P>
<P>
   But Parks said, ``One thing we want to make clear is that we
will not be taking resources from the Valley or any other portion
of the city to address this. We will not be taking from one area to
help another. We think there are adequate resources within the
department.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Joel Wachs, a mayoral candidate who has been
increasingly critical of the LAPD, warned that any reduction in
police protection in the Valley is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we can't do is take resources from the Valley,''
said Wachs, a member of the city's Public Safety Committee who
serves a district stretching from Studio City to Sunland-Tujunga.
``Just because the Valley is lower now in murders doesn't mean it
will stay that way. We have to do what the department is doing and
address this problem immediately, before it spreads to other parts
of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has said before, Wachs stated he believes the department
was distracted while planning for the Democratic National
Convention, which occurred in mid-August, and has failed to fully
staff its anti-gang efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we don't have that distraction, we can get back to
the basics and staff the anti-gang program and return to
community-based policing,'' Wachs said.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs has been a leader in calling on the LAPD to restore its
senior lead officer program to work with the community on
quality-of-life issues. Police Chief Parks has resisted that,
saying he needs the officers on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Parks disagreed that the department has been distracted and said
fluctuations in crime rates can be expected. ``We've had a long
period of decline in crime and this is just a spike,'' he said.
``Even though crime is down 40 (percent) or 50 percent, I don't
think we've bottomed out, and (we) can still have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mayor Richard Riordan said the mayor has been
talking with Parks about the matter and remains as concerned today
about public safety as he did when elected in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``While crime has dropped drastically since the mayor took
office, he is concerned that we deal with this sudden spike in
murders as quickly as possible,'' Riordan spokesman Peter Hidalgo
said. ``It remains his top priority, not only for the safety of
people but to make sure Los Angeles is the safest big city in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Los Angeles is to continue to be successful, it has to be
safe.''

BELCHER BETTER, BUT STATUS UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Tim Belcher said Monday he felt fine one day after
pitching five innings in a rehab assignment for Lake Elisnore at
Rancho Cucamonga and anticipates coming off the disabled list
Friday, when clubs expand rosters.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the 38-year-old right-hander will get back on the
mound again is another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim came out of (the rehab start) great, he got a little
tired, but it was a great performance,'' manager Mike Scioscia said
of Belcher, who threw 86 pitches and gave up five runs on five hits
in his latest comeback attempt from surgery in December to repair a
torn flexor tendon in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's too soon to tell when he'll pitch,'' Scioscia added.
``We're confident in the arms we have going out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff was great ... for three or four innings. The
challenge is to take what he has over six innings, or more. That's
the only question right now, not only because of the surgery but
where he is in his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Belcher, who's made only four starts all season, is
anxious to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a `clubbie' (clubhouse attendant),'' he said.
``I'm here every day, but I don't play.''
</P>
<P>
   SALMON SALUTED AGAIN: Right fielder Tim Salmon was selected the
A.L. Player of the Week for the second time this month after going
11 for 22 with two home runs including his 30th Sunday night that
enabled the Angels to become the first A.L. team with four 30-homer
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the fifth time in his career Salmon has earned Player
of the Week honors no other Angel has won it five times and the
fifth time this season an Angel has been selected. Mo Vaughn was
selected May 10-16 and Darin Erstad May 22-28 and July 3-9.
</P>
<P>
   COACH TO COACH: Angels third base coach Ron Roenicke defended
what appeared to be a questionable decision by Cleveland third base
coach Jim Riggleman in the seventh inning Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman waved Manny Ramirez home from second on a single to
center even though Ramirez got a terrible jump off second and was
running with a gimpy hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two outs, you have to send him,'' Roenicke said.
``He did the right thing. No matter what, you still have to make
the play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels did Garret Anderson threw a strike from center field
to catcher Bengie Molina well ahead of Ramirez' slide
</P>
<P>
   and won the game 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   NO REST IN DETROIT: It was Aug.4 when the Angels launched what
figured to be a make-or-break portion of their season, a 27-game
stretch against six clubs at .500 or better.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night was game No.22, and while the Angels haven't
exactly taken command in the A.L. West, they haven't broken either.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, that demanding stretch of games might end up being a
little longer than 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers, who the Angels play Sept.4 after two more
games this week at home against Toronto and then three this weekend
in Chicago, are just one game under .500 entering a four-game
series at Baltimore starting tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Garret Anderson started the night needing just
two hits to reach the 1,000-hit plateau for his career. Only four
players have collected 1,000 hits in an Angels uniform: Brian
Downing, Jim Fregosi, Bobby Grich and Tim Salmon. ... Darin Erstad
threw before Monday night's game and might be able to return to
left field tonight. He was the Angels' designated hitter Monday
night for the fourth consecutive game because of a strained muscle
in his left rib cage. ... The Blue Jays and Texas Rangers might
open the 2001 season in Puerto Rico. Details are still being worked
out, but the plan is for the two clubs to play an exhibition game
there March 31 to end spring training, then play a regular-season
game April 1.

AGREEMENT REACHED TO CLOSE PUMICE MINE ON SACRED INDIAN PEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS spelling of ``Navajo'' in 10th graf)  
 By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ It's a long way from the catwalks of Paris to
the craggy forests of the San Francisco Peaks, but the two have
been linked for more than a decade by the demand for stonewashed
denim: new jeans made to look old by laundering them with pieces of
volcanic pumice.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the pumice came from a strip mine on Sugarloaf Mountain,
one of the Peaks, twelve miles northeast of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were rated as the No. 1 supplier to the industry back in
the mid-1990s,'' said Ed Morgan, vice president of Arizona
Tufflite, the Phoenix company that owns the mine. Morgan estimated
sales by his company at $25 million to $30 million over the last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pumice washed jeans went all over the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For just as many years, the Sierra Club and 13 American Indian
tribes have been trying to limit the company's mining, saying that
it damages the environment of the Peaks, which the Indians believe
are sacred ground.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, they succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   On a rocky outcrop overlooking Tufflite's 100-foot deep White
Vulcan Pumice mine, federal officials and the company signed an
agreement to close the 90-acre site within six months.
</P>
<P>
   That was welcome news for the Hopi tribe, which believes that
the Peaks are the home of kachina spirits who live part of the year
as clouds in the mountains, and bring rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have believed these things for thousands of
years,'' said Wayne Taylor, chairman of the Hopi tribe.
</P>
<P>
   For the Navajo, the mountains are one of four borders to their
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Just as galling as the desecration of the land, Indian
representatives said, was the purpose for the mining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further destruction of the countryside in this Sacred area
just so the fashion conscious can wear jeans which make them seem
to have spent time outside, is to us, ludicrous,'' wrote one tribal
leader to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have to work to get that look,'' complained Andrew
Bessler, an organizer for the Sierra Club who runs the group's
`Save The Peaks' effort linking the Indian tribes with
environmentalists. ``Besides, stonewashing takes two years out of
the life of the jeans, and that's why the industry likes it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Tufflite applied for a permit to expand their operations in
1998, the Indian' and Sierra Club's public relations campaign
against the mine went into overdrive with concerts, demonstrations
at the mine site, and relentless pressuring of state, local, and
federal public officials.
</P>
<P>
   All thirteen tribes passed resolutions opposing the mine, as did
the city of Flagstaff and Coconino County, where it is located. Of
6,000 public comments received by the Forest Service on the
expansion project, only four favored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that this mine is being shut down and this long
controversy is ending. It's time to restore the Peaks to their
natural splendor,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in a
statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the government will pay Tufflite $1 million
and drop a lawsuit that demanded $300,000 in unpaid royalties for
previous sales of the pumice. In return, the company will shut down
the mine, which has just four employees, but will be able to sell
extracted pumice for the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great victory,' says Bessler. ``It will protect a
key cultural and archeological site from the continued desecration
of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   To Morgan, the mine closure is just a relief.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years of fighting, we decided that the
government was going to make it harder and harder to do business,''
he said. ``We were paying our lawyers, plus paying our taxes which
paid the government's lawyers, and in the end it just didn't make
sense to keep going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes the best years of using pumice to stonewash
denim are behind Tufflite anyway. ``They've got new techniques now
that use enzymes that are biodegradable and cheaper. Our market was
declining,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Indian tribes, at least one tribal chairman saw some
significance in an unusual event that occurred in these
drought-stricken mountains just minutes after the closure agreement
was signed:
</P>
<P>
   It rained.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the spirits way of thanking us,'' said Taylor.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRM PLANS THEME PARK IN CHINA  &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a champagne toast marking the historic
occasion, the Landmark Entertainment Group signed a contract to
design a world-class theme park in China.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Christopher, Landmark's president and chief executive
officer, said Monday that the Yangtze Theme Park on more than 100
acres will be the ``most expensive theme park ever built in
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   A joint project with the Wuhan Yangtze Entertainment Development
Co. LTD, the entertainment complex will be built in Wuhan, in the
Hubie province of central China. Construction will begin in January
of next year and is scheduled to be completed in May 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy to sign this design contract with
Landmark,'' Mao Dong Sheng, chairman of Wuhan Yangtze
Entertainment, said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the Yangtze Theme Park will set a new standard for
theme parks around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher said it took two years of negotiations to reach this
point. Landmark has also invested an undisclosed amount in the
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think China is an incredible market in terms of future
growth,'' he said. ``We think we can build something that the
Chinese people can be proud of and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Landmark has designed and produced other attractions in China,
as well as in South Korea and the Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landmark Asia, which is based in Seoul, South Korea, oversees
our projects in Asia,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Goddard, chairman of Landmark, said, ``This is the first
theme park in China that will combine the best of the East and West
to create a very unique attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   He said attractions at Yangtze Theme Park will include a roller
coaster, a high-tech simulator ride and a twin dragon Ferris wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Goddard said half of the park will feature Chinese-theme rides
and attractions, while the other half of the theme park will
feature attractions from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This theme park will be to China what Disneyland meant to
Southern California when Disneyland opened in 1955,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1980, the company based in North Hollywood, Calif.,
has designed and built entertainment venues around the world,
including Terminator 2/3D for Universal Studios Florida, the
Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas and Star Trek: The Experience for
Paramount Parks.

INTERSTATE BAKERIES LOOKS TO AN IMPROVED FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two years ago,
Interstate Bakeries Corp. was riding high. Earnings were on track,
its stock was strong, and its reputation was solid. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 11 straight quarters of earnings increases, all was
looking rosy for the country's largest wholesale baker. Then, on
Oct. 7, 1998, the company warned Wall Street that it was probably
going to come up a little short of fourth-quarter earnings
expectations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street pummeled the company so badly that by the time the
market closed that day, Interstate's stock had lost more than 30
percent of its value. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And with each subsequent quarter since then, as one analyst who
follows the company says, ``It's always something with
Interstate.'' Now, its stock is trading at about half of what it
was before that day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those ``somethings'' include labor troubles, the flooding of a
plant in North Carolina, start-up problems at a new plant in the
Northeast, a big employee discrimination verdict and an inability
to find reasonably priced acquisitions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been absolutely disastrous the last six to eight
quarters,'' said Mitchell Pinheiro of Janney Montgomery Scott.
``Whatever could go wrong has gone wrong.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles Sullivan, chairman of the Kansas City-based Fortune 500
company, acknowledges the analysts' criticism but looks forward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street gets pretty disappointed pretty quick,'' Sullivan
said. ``But we're doing what we think is right.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does he think those days of ``it's always something'' are behind
Interstate? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, but I would hope so,'' Sullivan said. ``But you
know, we've spent a lot of money in the last three years, about
$200 million. Our major projects, and I think our major problems,
are behind us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is confident that once the company gets a few good
quarters under its belt, Wall Street will once again warm to the
company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got their necks out there with `buy' recommendations,
and they want to see good things happen,'' Sullivan said. ``I
understand that.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Stops and starts &QL; 
One of Interstate's biggest problems in the last couple of years
has been start-up complications, particularly at the $100 million,
240,000-square-foot bakery it built in Biddeford, Maine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That one plant replaced four older ones. The new plant uses a
lot of computerized equipment, some of which is three and four
stories high. It's the state-of-the-art bakery in the United
States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it also was a lot to master all at once, and problem after
problem popped up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, this spring the company was hit with an eight-day work
stoppage over disagreements with the Teamsters union. That stoppage
caused a dearth of Twinkies, Ho-Hos and Wonder bread products in a
wide swath of the Northeast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence of the start-up problems and labor strife, the
company lost customers and market share. Some have come back, but
not all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the analysts got tired of hearing, `Oh, the Biddeford
excuse again,' &UR; '' Sullivan said. ``But you know that plant is
different from any other one out there. And even though we had our
best people there, it was a pretty steep learning curve.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company is finishing up a new plant in the
Pacific Northwest that will replace three older bakeries. Sullivan
said the company has learned a lot from its Biddeford experience
and expects that start-up to be a lot smoother. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company also is in the midst of retooling the old
Wolferman's plant in Kansas City and starting up a new plant in
Knoxville, Tenn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another of the ``somethings'' that hurt Interstate much more
than Sullivan believes the investment community understands was the
flooding of two plants last year in the wake of Hurricane Hugo in
North Carolina. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plants _ a new one and an older one joined together _ were
protected by a 500-year flood retaining wall, as required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. Water still rose a
foot-and-a-half over the wall, and 62 inches of water filled both
bakeries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company cleaned up the new plant but decided to go ahead and
retool the older one. Six million dollars later, that plant is
ready to roll, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We took an immediate hit with loss of product and an ongoing
hit because we didn't have a lot of the product that the old plant
produced,'' Sullivan said. ``But we're on our feet now _ everything
is OK.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Labor woes &QL; 
Another problem at Interstate is its relations with some of the
unionized workers among its 34,000 employees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has surprised some analysts is the whipping that
Sullivan's reputation has taken from labor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you historically, (Sullivan) has done very well
with the unions,'' said Bear Stearns &AMP; Co. analyst Terry Bivens.
``But this company definitely has more of a labor problem than it
did a year ago.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One place to get a flavor of some of that disenchantment is on
the Yahoo! message board for Interstate. On that board people post
under names such as Muffin_2000, Backthatthingup, Right_Turn_Baby,
Loser_Company and Famman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only Famman claims to be in management. The rest say they're
union members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is familiar with each of those posters and others. Some
he gives credence to, others he dismisses. But he reads them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That paid off in Cincinnati, where there were several complaints
about bread quality at the company's bakery. Management checked out
the complaints and found that they were true. Interstate's
president, Michael Kafoure, has spent time there in recent weeks
getting the problem fixed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the posters say that management is trying to find out
who they are and pressure them into not posting their complaints. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan says that's not true, at least not at corporate
headquarters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just as soon have people bring these problems to our
attention instead of just closing our ears,'' he said. ``If they
have a legitimate issue to put on the table, we'll check it out.'' &QL;

JUDGE, JURY CONSIDER SEX DISCRIMINATION ALLEGATIONS AT A MISSOURI
BAPTIST COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Advocates of
equal treatment for women in college sports are following a trial
in which a former coach accuses Southwest Baptist University of sex
discrimination. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anne Julian, who coached at the Bolivar, Mo., school for three
years, alleges that she was paid less than male coaches with the
same or fewer responsibilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She also claims that her volleyball and softball teams received
less support in publicity, equipment, supplies and recruiting money
than men's teams did. She says she was fired because she complained
of unequal treatment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The university says that Julian got the same pay as other
volleyball and softball coaches before her and that her team
received as much or more money per athlete as other similar
sports. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Baptist contends Julian did not take the initiative to
raise money or gain publicity for her team. She was fired for not
feeding her players when they lost, the school says, and for not
taking criticism well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Janet Justus, a Kansas City sports law lawyer who used to
specialize in gender equity issues at the National Collegiate
Athletic Association, was in the audience Monday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Justus said Julian's case was uncommon because U.S. District
Judge Fernando Gaitan allowed Julian to sue under Title IX, a
federal regulation that prohibits educational institutions from
discriminating on the basis of sex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the country, judges have not allowed coaches who
allege sexual discrimination to sue under Title IX, she said.
Instead, they have allowed those cases to go forward under Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Title IX has prompted changes on college campuses in the last
two decades, with women's teams increasing in number, offering more
scholarships, and getting better fields and courts to play on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Justus said it was important for coaches, not just athletes, to
be able to use Title IX to focus attention on inequalities between
men's and women's teams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination lawsuits ``are bigger than the individual,'' she
said. ``You're looking at the principles identified. They're about
fairness and equality.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In her opening statement Monday, Julian's attorney, Denise
Henning, urged the jury to focus on fair play. She said women's
sports were considered second-class at the 3,539-student
university, which affected how Julian was treated as a coach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The university competes in NCAA Division II, fielding seven
women's teams and eight men's teams, including football. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julian graduated from Southwest Baptist in 1990 and went back to
coach volleyball and softball in 1996. She quit coaching softball
in 1998. She brought a discrimination complaint to the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission in 1998 and coached volleyball
until 1999, when the university did not renew her contract. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The university's attorney, Jerry Kirksey, urged the jury to
focus on Julian as an individual, saying the case was about alleged
employment discrimination, not gender equity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Southwest Baptist has done absolutely nothing wrong,'' Kirksey
said before the trial began. ``And they've done the right thing to
fight it. Just because you file a lawsuit doesn't mean it has any
merit. And just because you're going to trial doesn't mean it has
merit. That just means a judge decided to let the jury hear all the
evidence.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Monday, Matt Henenberg, Julian's graduate assistant
in the 1996-97 softball season, and a personal friend of 17 years,
said she was a good, caring coach who turned a losing softball team
into a winner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Keck, who coached women's basketball at the university
in the late 1980s, said she was not given adequate money for
recruiting and unlike men's teams, hers and other women's teams did
not have assistant coaches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said she left the university after just two years because
the university reallocated two scholarships it had promised her
team to the men's basketball team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Keck said she was no longer affiliated
with the university and had no knowledge of current athletic
program budgets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last into next week. &QL;

PARK WILL SHOWCASE KANSAS CITY'S PIONEER TRAIL HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICA WOOD  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Schumacher Park
stands just minutes from signs of modern living, yet its native
grasses and wildflowers are meant to serve as a tribute to a bygone
era. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, National Park Service officials and local
leaders will gather to officially open the park, though it has been
in development since the late 1980s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony will include speeches from park service
representatives, City Council members and south Kansas City
community leaders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The park is meant to educate people about the Santa Fe, the
Oregon and the California trails, which crossed through Kansas
City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It benefits tourism in Kansas City,'' said Lou Austin, who
owns a south Kansas City law firm. ``If the trails had not been
here, Kansas City wouldn't exist.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Austin's parents, Lou and Topper Schumacher, donated two and a
half acres to the city for the park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A crushed-rock trail winds through the front of the park,
allowing visitors to touch the native vegetation and see the
historical exhibits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seven exhibits use pictures and text to emphasize the roles
of various racial and ethnic groups, to explain the trails' origins
and to give a glimpse into problems that pioneers faced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farther along the trail, visitors can watch trains pass below
while reading about the nation's conversion from trails to
railroads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Austin said he hoped the path would be paved and eventually
stretch to the nearby Bannister Mall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Conoboy, of the park service's long-distance trails group
office in New Mexico, said that turning Schumacher Park into a
historical site was a great idea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent opportunity for an urban area to interpret
the trail system in a coordinated way,'' Conoboy said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The project was funded through the National Park Service and
Kansas City tourism funds. &QL;

BRIDGESTONE/FIRESTONE ASKING VENEZUELAN DEALERS TO RETURN TIRES
MADE THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS ``Ford Ranger'' to ``F-series'' in 2nd graf)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced Monday evening
that it had asked its dealers in Venezuela to return unsold 15- and
16-inch light truck tires made there, but the company rebuffed the
Ford Motor Co.'s call for a recall of identical tires already in
use in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Ford recalled its Ford Explorer and F-series pickup
trucks equipped with the tires in all three countries, and the
company said Monday that it had urged Bridgestone to recall suspect
tires used on other manufacturers' sport utility vehicles. Ford
also scheduled a news conference on Tuesday in Caracas, Venezuela,
to explain why they thought that tire-related crashes of Ford
Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela had solely been the
result of defective tires and not because of any excessive tendency
of Explorers to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said that Ford had cut open
Firestone tires returned during the recall in Venezuela and found
that many lacked a protective layer of nylon, or were unable to
withstand high-speed driving.
</P>
<P>
   None of the tires made in Venezuela were shipped to the United
States, Ford and Bridgestone said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bridgestone said that problems with its tires were limited
to a mislabeling of their sidewalls and insisted that the tires met
Ford specifications, including the use of nylon layers. The tire
maker said that a broader recall was unnecessary and that it was a
coincidence that the mislabeled 15-inch tires in Venezuela were the
same size as the tires being recalled in the United States because
the treads occasionally come off during high-speed driving.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, which used some of the tires on Toyota Land Cruisers
sold in Venezuela, said that it had not received any reports of
problems and did not think a broader recall was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Dominguez, a senior investigator at the Institute for
Consumer Protection and Education in Venezuela, said that the
agency was convinced that Ford was partly responsible for a problem
that had caused more than 60 deaths in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have documentary evidence,'' he said. ``The responsibility
is shared.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the agency's evidence, he said, were communications
between the two companies, as well as stickers that Ford put on its
vehicles showing a lower recommended tire pressure than Firestone
favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the tire manufacturer said the tire should be inflated to
32 pounds pressure, they put on their stickers that it should be 26
to 28 pounds,'' Dominguez said. ``We even have photos of the
crashed vehicles showing these stickers in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Firestone have only recently differed in public in the
United States over the recommended tire pressure. Ford has long
favored 26 pounds per square inch. Firestone, after 10 years of
acquiescing to this number, abruptly announced at the beginning of
its recall in the United States on Aug. 9 that the pressure should
be 30 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   Tires inflated to low pressure can overheat and come apart at
high speeds. Virtually all of the deaths in the United States have
occurred when sport utility vehicles, mostly Explorers, have rolled
over when their tires came apart.
</P>
<P>
   Tire makers tend to prefer higher air pressures because it
reduces the risk of failure for the tires, which are covered by the
tire makers' warranties. But higher-pressure tires increase the
risk that sport utility vehicles will roll over during some driving
situations without tire failure.
</P>
<P>
   A Ford memorandum distributed by consumers' lawyers in the
United States showed that Ford rejected higher-pressure tires on a
prototype of the Explorer because they tended to cause rollovers.
Ford ended up choosing a different, lower-pressure tire and a
different suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Ford contends that rollovers are the main cause of crash deaths
for occupants of all brands of midsized sport utility vehicles.
Explorer occupants actually have a lower death rate in rollovers _
and in crashes overall _ than occupants of other midsized sport
utility models, according to Ford safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   In television commercials scheduled to begin Monday night,
Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive and president, said that
Ford had one of the best safety records, according to government
data for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   George Pipas, a Ford market analyst, said Monday that Ford's
sales in the United States in August would be roughly equal to last
year's levels and only slightly below the company's early
projections, a shortfall that he said might reflect response to the
tire recall but also a somewhat slower economy and a highly
competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Harmon said the company had not found protective nylon
layers in 71 percent of the 15-inch tires from Venezuela that it
cut open, nor in 55 percent of the 16-inch tires. Auto companies
commonly specify that tire makers include nylon for vehicles to be
sold in South America because of the poor roads and because drivers
frequently go extremely fast in the absence of enforced speed
limits, Harmon said. The tires also came apart before reaching 112
miles per hour on a dynanometer, a speed they were supposed to be
able to withstand, particularly because the Explorer's engine has a
computer control to keep drivers from going more than 99 miles an
hour, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been criticized by consumers' lawyers for not having
Firestone include the nylon layers on Explorer tires for the United
States market. Because of the good roads in the United States,
manufacturers rarely use the layers except for very high-speed
models like the Chevrolet Corvette sports car and the Ford F-150
Lightning pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone hinted in a letter Monday to the Venezuelan consumer
agency that Ford might not have asked for nylon layers until
recently. The letter said that Ford had specified in 1999 that the
nylon be included and that nylon had been included since then. The
tires in question have been produced since 1996, and the
Bridgestone letter did not say whether the earlier tires had the
nylon, nor were officials willing to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Harmon said the company had always asked for the nylon.
``Firestone specified a nylon ply to meet Ford's performance
specifications from the beginning of Ford's Explorer sales in
Venezuela,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Firestone tires in Venezuela, as in the United States, bear
no external signs that the tread may come apart from an inner layer
of rubber. Yet Ford engineers who cut apart the tires from
Venezuela found that they were 100 to 1,000 times as likely to show
early signs of tread separation as even the recalled Firestone
tires in the United States, said a person who had seen the results.
</P>
<P>
   Four investigators for the House Commerce Committee visited
Bridgestone's U.S. headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., Monday seeking
evidence on what the company knew about its American tires and
when.

EARLY RUNS ENOUGH FOR AILING DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ There are those Dodgers that are ill. Others are
injured. And between the vomiting and physical therapy, they're
managing to find enough guys to field a team.
</P>
<P>
   Though questions about how long the Dodgers will be able to do
that have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Two outfielders are injured, another sick and their starting
pitcher was so weak from illness that he said he felt wobbly at
times. Even so, the Dodgers were able to make five first-innings
runs stand up Monday and defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-3 at
County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, stuck in his Chicago hotel room for two days over
the weekend because of flu-like symptoms, battled through seven
innings as the Dodgers (69-62) won for the seventh time in eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd see what I could get out of myself and try to
save the bullpen,'' Brown said. ``I don't know how fresh (reliever)
Terry Adams was. I think (the illness) was different than what some
of these guys had. But for about 24 hours, I was worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown (12-5) allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings.
He struck out seven and walked three, but the only inning he
experienced trouble was the sixth, when Geoff Jenkins led off with
a triple and Richie Sexson doubled. Sexson eventually scored on a
groundout to make it 5-3, but Adams pitched the eighth and Jeff
Shaw the ninth for his 22nd save.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Brown) was out there throwing that ball in the first
inning I didn't know if he was going to make it five innings,''
said Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros, who had a run-scoring
single in the first inning. ``He didn't look like Brownie in the
first inning. It didn't look like he was going to make it through
the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for Milwaukee starter Jeff D'Amico, but
for a different reason. D'Amico (10-5) allowed a season-high five
earned runs, all of which came in the first inning. Shawn Green and
Karros had RBI singles, Hundley had a sacrifice fly and Adrian
Beltre continued his torrid hitting with a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, named the National League player of the week after
batting .536, increased his season-high hitting streak to 10 games
with his 14th homer. He also added a double and is batting .295.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The ball) is like a grapefruit,'' Beltre said. ``I feel good
at the plate, and I have confidence. We saw the pitches pretty good
in the first few innings, but then he did something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, Chan Ho Park, Mark Grudzielanek, Mike Fetters and Gary
Sheffield were hit the hardest by this flu-like bug that surfaced
the first week of July and hasn't gone away. In fact, Sheffield
missed his eighth straight game and remains in Los Angeles trying
to overcome the his sickness. He won't join the Dodgers on the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dodgers are also short in the outfield. Devon White
already has a strained left quadricep and outfielder Bruce Aven
strained a left oblique muscle during batting practice and was
scratched from the starting lineup. Aven will be re-evaluated
today, but Johnson said it could be as much as two weeks before
he's ready to return.
</P>
<P>
   Aven's injury leaves the Dodgers with two healthy natural
outfielders in Tom Goodwin and Shawn Green. Jim Leyritz started in
left field, and the Dodgers are considering recalling outfielder
Tony Mota from Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are also 7-1 without Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good defensively, stringing hits together and
everyone is contributing,'' Karros said. ``That's how you win
games.'' &QL;

CALIFORNIA MOTORISTS TRY SHORTCUTTING TIRE RECALL  &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Replacing defective Firestone tires can be a
costly, time-consuming and frustrating experience, say tire makers,
dealers and crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists who don't like being on a waiting list for new
Firestones can spend $400-plus to buy competitors' tires and then
wait to be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   But California consumers have found that's not necessarily a
quicker solution -- because Firestone's rival tire manufacturers
also are scrambling to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co., for example, said it plans to
increase production of compatible models by 500 percent, but a
spokesman said that will take until the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's not fast enough,'' said Goodyear spokesman
Chuck Sinclair. ``Even with all tire manufacturers making them,
when you've got 6.5 million to get off as quick as possible, it's
not fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's subsidiaries, Kelly-Springfield and Dunlop, also
are stepping up production, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But availability of Firestone tires and their replacements made
by other companies is uneven, with Los Angeles dealers in the San
Fernando Valley reporting a heavy volume of inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of tires that aren't available right now because
there's a such a big run on,'' said Terry Freed of Tires Buy Mark.
Freed estimates his small store gets between five and 10 calls a
day from people looking for replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone is advising owners of tires subject to recall to be
patient while enduring waits for replacements reportedly as much as
eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It varies from place to place,'' said Bridgestone/Firestone
spokesman Walt Sharp. ``We hope to shorten the time frame all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nashvillle, Tenn.-based company said Monday it has replaced
more than 1 million of the tires subject to recall since Aug. 9.
Federal investigators are examining 62 deaths and more than 100
injuries purportedly caused by the treads of the tires peeling off.
</P>
<P>
   Reseda, Calif., resident Matoux DeLaCroix said he became one of
the most recent victims of the peeling tread Friday night, as he
and his 9-year-old daughter drove through Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   DeLaCroix said he and daughter, Erica, sustained minor injuries
after the tread on his Firestone ATX tire peeled away and his 1996
Ford Explorer spun out and flipped. California Highway Patrol
officers called the peeling tire a factor in the crash, though they
added DeLaCroix swerved incorrectly in response.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he had tried to get replacement tires from a
Firestone dealership in the San Fernando Valley, in Northridge, and
was told the wait was between three and eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just find the whole thing outrageous,'' said DeLaCroix, who
is contemplating legal action. ``It's unbelievable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the tires can get replacements from any tire company
that makes compatible sizes. They will be reimbursed up to $100 per
tire. Firestone dealers also offer free inspections on request.
</P>
<P>
   The company is recommending affected tire owners keep their tire
pressure at 30 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything we can to make tires as quickly as
possible,'' said Bridgestone/Firestone spokesman Doug McGraw.

&HT;    NEW HANDGUN-CONTROL BILL PASSESCALIFORNIA SENATE
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;    (Eds, this story was mistakenly slugged ``BILLS-SFVALLEY'' in
the budget)(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The California Senate recently passed tough
handgun control legislation that requires safety classes and
licensing of owners, but the measure faces an uncertain future in
the Assembly and a likely veto by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Jack Scott, D-Pasadena, authored the bill as a means
of reducing gun crimes and accidents. It passed 22-15 with strong
support from Democrats and opposition from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns are simply a dangerous product,'' said Scott, an
outspoken proponent of gun control and chairman of the Assembly Gun
Violence Committee, said Monday. ``The more we can train people on
safety and keep others with criminal pasts from buying guns, the
more we'll reduce the number of gun-related deaths and injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   But gun lobbyists voiced strong opposition to the new rules,
arguing they will not have an effect on criminals, who they say
mostly acquire guns illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're targeting the wrong people with this feel-good
legislation,'' said John Snyder of the national Citizens Committee
for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. ``All this does is require
law-abiding citizens to abide to more laws, instead of addressing
the real criminal element.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who lost his 27-year-old son, Adam, in a gun accident in
1993, argued the primary impact of the bill would be to reduce
accidents by raising safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't allow car buyers to simply drive off the lot,'' Scott
said, ``you have to have a license.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires all gun buyers except law enforcement
officials to attend a safety course and pass tests on proper gun
handling, target shooting, and a written test on handgun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers also would have to undergo a background check before
being issued a 5-year renewable license -- with a maximum price tag
of $25 -- from the state Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The bill could be vetoed by Gov. Gray Davis, who, when passing a
landmark set of gun control laws last year, said he wants time to
measure their effectiveness before signing any new gun legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor doesn't want to see any more gun legislation
until the new laws passed last year are given a chance to work,''
said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. ``However, he has not stated
his position on AB 273, and he'll be taking a close look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bills signed by Davis last year made California one of the
toughest states on gun control, enacting trigger-lock requirements,
expanding bans on assault weapons and banning low-priced Saturday
night specials.
</P>
<P>
   Before reaching Davis, the bill must pass a second Assembly vote
with the amendments added by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has until Sept. 30 to make a decision on all legislation
acted on by the Legislature this week in the session's closing
days. The governor usually has 12 days to make a decision on bills,
but end-of-session rules extend the time because of the large
number of laws being acted on as the Legislature wraps up.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, the law would take effect in July 2002 and be
applicable only to new gun purchases. Current gun owners would not
have to apply for licenses for guns bought before then.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates, including Mary Leigh Blek, president of
the Million Mom March, also are lobbying state lawmakers to
eventually pass legislation requiring all gun owners to register
with the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Licensing alone can be a very powerful preventive measure,''
she said. ``But we hope that the Assembly will reconsider annual
gun registration during its next legislative session.''

SERGIO TURNS OUT TIGER`S LIGHTS

<P>
   PALM DESERT _ So that's how you beat Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   You make him win a tournament in almost total darkness the
previous day, have him come back early the next morning to put on a
clinic and force him to fly cross-country for another round of golf
later that afternoon. Throw in the lingering effects of a cold, and
there is a pretty good chance the unquestioned No.1 player in the
world might not be at his best.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what happened Monday at Bighorn Country Club,
where Spanish sensation Sergio Garcia, ranked 15th in the world,
upset an admittedly weary Woods 1 up in a prime-time television
golf event, the much-hyped ``Battle of Bighorn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I was this tired? I don't know, maybe finals
week,'' Woods joked after Garcia clinched the victory with a
10-foot putt for birdie on the par-4, 355-yard 18th hole. ``I've
had three pretty good weeks, and it just builds up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body broke down two days early. If it had happened
tomorrow, I couldn't have cared less.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said he was tired, too, after flying in from last
weekend's Reno-Tahoe Open. He tied for 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good until 17,'' he said. ``Then I was a little
tired. After the putt on 18, I was a lot tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's competition, which included portable lights
illuminating the final four holes, turned out to be an entertaining
match between two of the world's best, young players. Woods, in
particular, has been brilliant lately. His amazing run has
included, for example, a thrilling playoff victory over former La
Habra resident Bob May in the PGA Championship two weeks ago. Then
he breezed to an 11-shot victory in this past weekend's NEC
Championship in Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Woods returned to Firestone Country Club early Monday morning to
put on a clinic, then flew to Southern California for Monday's $1.5
million match. It was the second time he had been involved in such
a showcase he defeated David Duval in last year's ``Showdown at
Sherwood'' at Sherwood Country Club but his luck finally ran out
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who won $1.1 million to Woods' $400,00, started with a
bogey on the first hole to immediately fall one down, and wasted a
chance to even the match by three-putting for bogey on the par-4,
367-yard fourth hole. But he played impressively from that point,
and birdied four of his final holes for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with a six-under-par 66 to Woods' 67.
</P>
<P>
   The shot of the day might have come on the par-4, 351-yard 14th
hole. Woods had hit a sand wedge to within two feet for a conceded
birdie, and Garcia was 25 feet short. But he made the putt to keep
the match even.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very important putt,'' said Garcia, who admitted he
had trouble seeing the cup because of increasing darkness. ``When
it was four feet short of the hole, I was trying to see where the
hole was. Then when it got closer, I said,`Hey, that's looking
good.'''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia saved par from 10 feet after a bad chip to halve the next
hole, and he curled in a 40-footer on the par-3, 180-yard 16th to
take his first lead of the day. Woods missed left and never
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' loss continued a surprising lack of success in match
play. Not counting his three consecutive U.S. Amateur
championships, he is 3-6-1 in the Ryder and Presidents cups. He
also lost last year's match-play championship to Darren Clarke in a
36-hole final at La Costa.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he wasn't overly upset with Monday's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had better days,'' he said, ``and I've had shorter
days.''

CLEMENS IS AT HIS OVERPOWERING BEST
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ No words were necessary for the Seattle Mariners to
confirm to the baseball world Monday night that Roger Clemens, even
at his advanced age, is a dominant pitcher, one of the best. The
swings they produced said everything about the quality of Clemens'
overpowering stuff.
</P>
<P>
   There were weak swings and half swings and check swings, little
ground balls and pop-ups. There were no good swings, no hard rips
until Alex Rodriguez's single leading off the eighth. Rodriguez and
Al Martin were the only Seattle batters to pull the ball with
authority against Clemens, who pitched seven scoreless innings,
allowing five hits and striking out seven, as the New York Yankees
wiped out Seattle, 9-1, and increased their lead over Boston in the
American League East to five games. The Mariners have lost 13 of
15, and their advantage over Oakland in the West has shrunk to a
game and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' earned run average of 3.65 is the second best in the
American League, behind Boston's Pedro Martinez, and his 11-6
record could be significantly better; the bullpen has blown five
leads for him.
</P>
<P>
   While Clemens was on the disabled list in June, his right groin
muscle healed, and as a result, he was able to make a necessary
adjustment to his mechanics, through the guidance of the pitching
coach Billy Connors. Clemens, a right-hander, had fallen into the
habit of swinging his left leg in a long arc as he worked from the
windup, perhaps to compensate for the problem in his groin.
</P>
<P>
   Connors suggested that Clemens draw his leg almost straight up,
with little swinging in his foot; this way, he can keep his body
and weight mostly centered over the pitching rubber before driving
forward toward the plate. The principle is the same in many
athletic functions, whether shooting free throws or throwing a
baseball: eliminate the unnecessary movement.
</P>
<P>
   With his legs healthy, Clemens has been able to throw in this
way and his fastball has been explosive and consistent. There may
have been only two or three games in his time with the Yankees that
Clemens has had a fastball as good or better than he did against
the Mariners Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens seemed to want the Seattle hitters to know exactly how
hard he was throwing _ 94 to 95 mph consistently, reaching 96 mph
once _ because he fired his second pitch of the game over the head
of the catcher and umpire and thumped it loudly against the
backstop. Later in the inning, he pushed Edgar Martinez away from
the plate with inside fastballs, prompting Seattle manager Lou
Piniella to push himself away from the Mariners bench and remark on
the brushback pitches to his own players.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella's voice had already been heard in the Yankees' first
at-bat. Derek Jeter dived back into first base after rounding the
bag and was called safe on a tag play _ wrongly, as a replay
showed, and then Piniella argued. Then, with two outs, the Yankees
leading by 1-0 with a runner at first base, Paul Abbott zipped a
fastball near the inside corner against Jose Canseco. Strike three
to end the inning, Abbott thought; ball two, according to the
rookie home plate umpire Scott Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco smashed Abbott's next pitch about 430 feet, his 13th
home run increasing the Yankees' lead to 3-0, and Piniella yelled
and screamed at Packard from the dugout before the Mariners batted.
Clemens did his fair share of staring and glaring at Packard during
the evening, shaking his head and barking words as he came off the
mound after disagreements in the fifth and seventh innings. It was
as if Clemens and Piniella, with about 50 years of major league
experience between them, were engaged in a tug-of-war over
Packard's strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens may have walked away believing Packard stingy, but it is
scary to imagine what Clemens might have accomplished with a wider
strike zone. He struck out three in the first inning, getting ahead
in the count with the fastball and finishing off the Seattle
hitters with his split-fingered fastball. Fastball, splitter, just
those two; he did not throw his slider until the 55th pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners collected five hits, but all the swings were
defensive, their rallies somewhat pathetic. The
right-handed-hitting Mike Cameron reached to poke a 95-mph fastball
with two outs in the second and dumped a single over first base.
Dan Wilson hit a soft liner through the middle, and Clemens walked
Mark McLemore to load the bases, before Rickey Henderson lofted a
fly to short center. Bernie Williams raced in and made a sliding
catch Clemens whiffed two more in the fourth and struck out
McLemore on three pitches leading off the fifth. With two walks and
another soft single, the Mariners loaded the bases again in the
fifth. But both Martinez and John Olerud, accomplished hitters,
popped up harmlessly. They were overmatched. Clemens' strikeout of
Cameron in the sixth was his 150th of the season; at 38 years 24
days old, he became the oldest Yankee to strike out 150 in a
season.
</P>
<P>
   He has 3,458 for his career, only 50 short of reaching Walter
Johnson's 3,508 strikeouts, which are No. 7 on the career list. He
has 258 victories. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A newborn boy was found abandoned on a subway
platform at 14th Street in Manhattan Monday night, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   A subway passenger found the baby on the southbound platform of
the A, C and E trains, which run along Eighth Avenue, around 8:30
p.m., the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I glanced down and saw what I thought was just a baby doll,''
the passenger, Danny Stewart, told Channel 11 News. ``His upper
body and his head were wrapped in a dark sweatshirt. But as I
started to go up the stairs, he started to move, so I knew he was
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart called 911 from a pay phone, then ran back to the
platform to baby-sit until the police came and took the boy to St.
Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is in good health, said John Re, an administrator at the
hospital. Doctors believe he was probably born Monday, Re said.
</P>
<P>
   The police are searching for the baby's mother.

BLUE JAYS DOUBLE UP ON ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ It figured there'd be a flock of home runs when the
American League's heaviest hitters, the Toronto Blue Jays and the
Angels, got together Monday night, and given the added jolt of
swinging away in a ballpark named for a power company.
</P>
<P>
   What didn't figure was the fact the Angels hit into more
rally-killing double plays than they hit home runs, never a good
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto belted three homers for a major league-leading 217 and,
more importantly, a 4-2 victory over the Angels before 17,483 fans
at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels hit just one home run, their 200th, second only to
the Blue Jays in the A.L. But the Angels also grounded into three
double plays, a little surprising in as much as they've grounded
into fewer DPs than all but one A.L. club.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon hit the Angels' lone home run, his 31st, coming just
one day after hitting his 30th, which made the Angels the
first-ever A.L. team with four 30-or-more-homer men.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays will get there soon enough _ they've got two with
more than 30 now, two others close _ and, the way they're going,
could wind up with six 30-plus homer hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado (No.39), Jose Cruz Jr. (28) and vagabond Dave
Martinez (five), who's playing for his eighth club
</P>
<P>
   fourth this year hit the Blue Jays' homers, all with the bases
empty.
</P>
<P>
   And all of them off of Ramon Ortiz, the third time this season
he's given up three home runs in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the presence of the hot-hitting Delgado, who's making
a strong pitch to win the A.L. Triple Crown _ no one's done that in
33 years _ and Darin Erstad on the same field livened the debate
over who's the league's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado won round one. His homer gave him the A.L. lead, he's
hitting .361, second in the loop to Boston's Nomar Garciaparra
(.371), and he's third in runs batted in with 118.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad had one hit, a lead-off single, but also grounded into
one of the Angels' three double plays. He's hitting .360.
</P>
<P>
   The question was put to Angels manager Mike Scioscia before the
game: How do you pitch to a guy like Deldago?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a fluke. There aren't a lot of holes. It'll be a
challenge for us to make the pitches to get him out. He's a
legitimate MVP candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who would Scioscia vote for _ if he had a vote?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still like Erstad,'' he said. ``Carlos is a dangerous
hitter, and he's got great numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, when it comes to what a guy means to a ballclub ...
taking in everything, his production, his defense ... I like what
Ersty's done for this club.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the double play Erstad hit into produced a run.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from enough against Toronto's Esteban Loaiza
(8-9), who scattered seven hits over seven innings, enabling the
Blue Jays to win for only the sixth time in their last 18 road
games.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Angels three games back of Cleveland in the
A.L. wild-card race. Toronto's right there, too, just a game
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado homered in the second inning, his 87th extra-base hit to
tie the Blue Jays' club record set last season by Shawn Green, now
with the Dodgers; Cruz homered in the third and Martinez, who's hit
safely in 18 games in a row, in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have now been hammered 197 home runs, second only to
the 200 that Kansas City pitchers have allowed.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got an unearned run in the third to get to within a
run, 2-1, when Bengie Molina scored from third as Erstad grounded
into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   But Mo Vaughn hit into a double play in the sixth, just before
Salmon hit his home run. And the Angels missed their biggest
opportunity in the eighth, when they had two on and only one out.
But reliever John Frascatore struck out Salmon, the third time he
fanned, and got Garret Anderson, who had two hits to reach 1,000
for his career, to ground into a force out.

<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Q: There is a very popular employee in my department. She is
well-liked by her fellow employees and by many of my peers in
management. The problem is her work, it is often sloppy and late,
and she does not seem concerned about it. I have talked to her
about this, but she seems to think she is so well-liked that
nothing can happen to her. I am ready to terminate her but am
concerned about the backlash against me. Any suggestions? T.R. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: As a manager, sometimes you have to take an unpopular stance
when dealing with a popular person. Be sure you have documented her
performance, discussed it with her, and given her the opportunity
and support to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   If you have done so, only to find she continues to believe
popularity is more important than productivity, it is time to make
a managerial decision. And this decision should not be based on her
popularity, or on the impact the decision will have on your
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking this action, however, consider one unique aspect
of this situation: Employees who do not carry their weight
typically are regarded with disdain rather than adoration. This
worker's popularity indicates she must have some rather compelling
people skills -- which raises the question of whether she is simply
in the wrong position.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies today are trying to fit jobs to people, rather
than fitting people into jobs. If there is a more people-oriented
position in your firm, perhaps she would fare better in it. At the
same time, if there is no appropriate internal option for her, then
it is time for the external option. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whenever I talk with my manager, he inevitably brings up my
co-workers and tells me things about them that are not my business.
He likes to talk about who is struggling and whom he just
counseled. This puts me in a bad position, but I don't want to tell
my manager how to manage. What do you suggest? L.A. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: You are in a bad position, and your manager is in the wrong
position. This single act clearly indicates he has a long way to go
before he is ready for prime time. It sounds like your company is
either overly eager to fill managerial slots on the organization
chart or it lacks adequate communication, education and follow-up
with the managerial staff.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, you do not want to tell your manager how to manage, yet
you can still discuss his babbling. One approach that may protect
his ego and protect you is to mention you are concerned about his
openness. By using the word ``openness,'' already you are placing
your comments in a positive context.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to mention it is not really fair to your fellow
employees for you to have this kind of information about them. And
further, it may not even be fair to your manager himself, since
other employees might be upset if they learn about this.
</P>
<P>
   If he does not get this obvious message from you, there will be
plenty of other messages he is bound to miss as well. When this
occurs, it should only be a matter of time before senior management
send him the clearest message of all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last week my manager told me that I am too focused on family
matters and I need to pay more attention to work. I have no idea
where this comment came from. I asked for some examples, but he
couldn't think of any specifics. That's how the discussion ended,
but I'm concerned about what's happening. Should I do anything
else? H.M. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Whether dealing with employees, children or pets, most people
know that the time to provide feedback is as close to the behavior
in question as possible. If your family dog has chewed up a family
heirloom, it's not going to do much good to confront Fido three
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   When managers stockpile their concerns about an employee and
then unload at a later date, the employee's reaction is a
combination of defensiveness, denial and distress. If an employee
is engaging in a behavior inappropriate for the job, the manager
should discuss the situation with him or her at the time. That's
the best way to have any kind of acceptance, credibility and
impact.
</P>
<P>
   You should revisit this situation with your manager. Tell him
you have thought very carefully about it and you still do not see
any family interference in your work. In addition, suggest that if
he ever sees such interference, you would like to discuss it with
him at that time. It is hoped he will not need any more feedback
about his feedback. &QL;

would be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe next time, that is, if the current losing stretch doesn't
kill him. Monday night, Roger Clemens and the Yankees presented
their former player, manager and general manager with yet another
clubhouse-quieting loss, wrapping up the Mariners 9-1 and sending
another sellout crowd home wondering when _ or if _ their team will
turn itself around.
</P>
<P>
   It was another loss of missed opportunities and stranded
baserunners, and this one left the crowd occasionally jeering late
in the game before derisively cheering when the Mariners finally
scored a run in the ninth inning on a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating obviously,'' said starter Paul Abbott, who
allowed eight runs in seven-plus innings. ``But we're going to wake
up tomorrow and be 1(DD) games up in first place and that's
reality. And there's a lot of season left to play, and that's
reality. But there isn't a guy in this clubhouse who isn't
frustrated. This is too long for a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19-inning victory over the Red Sox, the road trip to New
York and Chicago ... it all seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, I'm concerned about everything,'' Piniella said,
telling reporters there will be lineup changes for tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just might shake the whole lineup up, put some different
people out there and let them play and see what happens. Playing
the same people right now hasn't been the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have lost 13 of their past 15 games, watching a
once healthy seven-game lead wither to 1(DD) games over Oakland.
Even with their great road trip to New York and Chicago at the
start of the month, the Mariners are playing sub.-500 baseball
since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Mondayh's game was the ninth in which Seattle has allowed at
least nine runs during the slide, the third time in four games the
Mariners have scored one run or fewer and the second time this
homestand they haven't managed an extra-base hit. They've been
outscored 122-66 in their past 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start winning,'' Piniella said. ``We can talk about
all the positives you want but the most important thing you can do
is win.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, about the last opponent a struggling team wants to
see is Clemens and the Yankees. Clemens has more wins (21) against
the Mariners than any other pitcher and has been beating them since
he set the major league record in 1986 by striking out 20 batters
in one game. Pitching like the Rocket of old, he's 7-0 in 12 starts
since July 2, with an overall record of 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, meanwhile, has been Seattle's most effective starter
since the start of June and he pitched fairly well for six innings
Monday. Unfortunately for him, those six innings came between a
three-run first inning and a four-run eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The first inning could have gone very differently, though. After
Abbott walked Luis Polonia to open the game, Derek Jeter followed
with a single to left-center. Polonia went to third on the play and
when Jeter took a wide turn at first, shortstop Alex Rodriguez
threw to first base for a close play. Jeter was ruled safe, though
replays showed he probably was out by a couple inches.
</P>
<P>
   More frustrating to Abbott was a 2-2 pitch he threw to Jose
Canseco with two outs and the score 1-0. Abbott, catcher Dan Wilson
and Piniella all thought it was strike three but home plate umpire
Scott Packard called it a ball. Canseco hit the next pitch, a pitch
that was out of the strike zone, over the fence to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably let that affect me a little bit,'' Abbott said of
the 2-2 pitch. ``But he's still Canseco and extremely strong. And
he was able to hit a pitch out that most people couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I created a hole for myself early and when you do that it
makes it hard for good things to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to leave Piniella squawking from the dugout
between innings, presumeably at the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how when we don't get a call or make a mistake,
the other team capitalizes on it right away,'' Piniella said.
``That's what happened in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chances early in the ballgame if we could have
gotten some hits with men on base and just couldn't do it. They
did. They got the hits when they needed it and beat us handily.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-inning runs were more than enough for Clemens, who
threw hard and just wildly enough to keep batters jumpy (he fired
two pitches to the backstop). Clemens held the Mariners to five
singles and walked four in seven-plus innings, struck out seven and
worked out of two bases-loaded jams.

BASEBALL BRINGS SOUTH AFRICA NEW SENSE OF HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A softball player, cyclist, wrestler and tennis player
filed lawsuits when they were left off their respective U.S.
Olympic team rosters this year. Salt Lake officials face a possible
criminal trial for their role in the Olympics bribery scandal.
Athletes at the U.S. track and field trials last month were
identified in the results not by their hometown but by the shoe
company sponsoring them.
</P>
<P>
   But just when you question whether the Olympics have outlived
their original purpose, just when you wonder whether the Games are
nothing more than a venue for displaying the latest shoes and
hyping the new prime-time schedule, along comes a team that makes
you reconsider everything. Along comes the South African baseball
team.
</P>
<P>
   The manager is Raymond Tew, a white South African. The batting
coach is Jim Murphy, a graduate of Kentridge High School. The
pitching coach is Jose Alleman, a Cuban who doesn't speak English.
Half the players are white and half are mixed race (or what South
Africans refer to as colored; blacks are a separate group), ranging
in age from 19 to 44. They are teachers and electricians and
plumbers.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, the South African government would have
forbidden these players from competing on the same field. But there
they are, taking grounders and batting practice with what equipment
they have, training to play on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   Whites and non-whites playing together for post-apartheid South
Africa, with American and Cuban coaches. Interesting, isn't it, how
a 90-foot by 90-foot baseball diamond can hold so much?
</P>
<P>
   ``They say sports brings people together, that it brings
societies together,'' Murphy says. ``That's what we're doing with
the South African Olympic team. ... I feel really fortunate to be a
part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans brought baseball to South Africa during that country's
gold rush during the 1890s, and though the sport did not catch on
to a significant extent, some South Africans have played it at the
club level for decades. Cricket, rugby and soccer are by far South
Africa's most popular team sports, but baseball's popularity is
growing, helped in part by Major League Baseball's international
program.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to truly put the world into a sport with a World Series
(as well as increase revenue sources and the talent pool), MLB
International sends equipment and coaches such as Murphy to 37
countries around the world, ranging from South Africa to Slovenia.
Program specialist Mike McClellan says 170,000 kids have
participated in the South African program the past three years. The
sport is particularly growing among black children, though adult
blacks are all but absent from the high amateur level and not on
the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Some South Africans are just beginning to feed the U.S. minor
leagues. South African pitcher Tim Harrell is pitching for the
Class A Dodgers team in Vero Beach. Fla. Shortstop Paul Bell is
playing for the Brewers farm team in Helena, Mont. Wes Botha
pitched in the Braves system prior to returning to South Africa
with an injury. The Royals recently hired a part-time scout for the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, baseball in South Africa is not the same as baseball in
South Carolina. For one thing, there is the issue of equipment. Or
rather, the lack of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the aluminum bats would crack, and people would keep
using them because they couldn't afford to replace them,'' Harrell
says. ``We have five dozen balls for every game here in Vero Beach.
In South Africa, if we hit a foul ball, we had to chase it no
matter where it was. If it went in the woods or the river, you had
to chase it down. We had maybe two dozen balls for the entire
season. All brown as the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrell is the son of American Baptist missionaries who raised
their family in South Africa while serving there. He attended
Liberty College in Virginia and was drafted by the Dodgers after
his final season there. His brothers, Richard and Brian, are on the
Olympic team as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game really developed when I got to college,'' he says. ``I
don't know if I could ever have had this opportunity (with the
Dodgers) if I hadn't come over here to go to college. Who knows how
many guys over there could make a career of it with better
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Tew, who coaches the South Africa team after installing carpet
all day, took up baseball as age 6 because cricket was too slow for
him. The 50-year-old coach grew up following major league baseball
by watching films of old games sent from the U.S., watching
year-old World Series and All-Star games with friends.
</P>
<P>
   He coached the South Africa team into the Olympics last winter,
leading the plumbers and teachers past Guam in the qualifiying
tournament to secure the final berth in the eight-team field for
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Of these teens and 40-something parents, among the best players
are Harrell and Bell, the Brewers farmhand. Bell is of mixed race
and the son of Michael Bell, who played for years on a colored club
team in Capetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I'm playing, he's playing with me,'' Bell recently
told the New York Times. ``It makes me feel I'm giving him a part
of his life he never had.''
</P>
<P>
   FROM SEATTLE TO SOUTH AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   A 1985 graduate of Kentridge, Murphy played a couple seasons in
the Chicago Cubs organization before a rare vision problem, dynamic
visual acuity, affected his hitting and forced his retirement in
1991. In addition to hitting poorly, he says, ``I kept getting hit
by pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked for Federal Express in Seattle, parking his truck and
sprinting up hills with packages to meet delivery deadlines. His
love of baseball did not decline, however, and soon he was back
playing in the independent Western League, hitting better than .300
again and rooming with Joe Strong, the 37-year-old who earlier this
season became the oldest rookie to make his major league debut in
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Strong reached the majors, Murphy did not, eventually
finding himself at the University of British Columbia, where he
started the school's baseball program from such humble beginnings
that, he says, ``We would get kicked off the field by ultimate
frisbee.''
</P>
<P>
   While at UBC, he met up with an old friend who arranged a
part-time scouting job with the Texas Rangers. He also parlayed a
research paper on the strategies of championship teams into a job
as the hitting coach last year with the Savannah Sand Gnats, the
Rangers' Class A affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, an official with MLB International asked Murphy
whether he could help coach the South Africa team while it trained
for the Olympic qualifying tournament. A month later, he was in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   With his background in the low minors, the independent Western
League and UBC, Murphy was as prepared as any American coach could
be for South Africa baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, it still was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   For the first couple weeks, there were no bases or batting
helmets. There was no pine tar, either, which wasn't that big a
deal because the team was fortunate to even have bats. Major league
baseball gave Murphy 60 wood bats to take back and the team broke
them so quickly he taped them together as best he could and
rationed them.
</P>
<P>
   The field was a converted cricket field with no infield dirt and
no cutouts for the bases. Players slid on the grass, risking knee
and ankle injuries. There was no locker room; the players would
come to practice straight from work and change clothes in what
passed as a dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of play is like a junior college league in the
states. It's not real high,'' Murphy says. ``Our national team
would easily beat a junior college team, but if we played a
best-of-seven series, it would be tough. Our No. 1 pitcher is Tim
Harrell, but after him it drops off quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim's done a good job,'' Tew says. ``He's improved the hitting
by 30 to 40 percent, and his knowledge on defense and offense has
helped, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the players are from all around the country and have
families and jobs they can't leave, the team practices in small
groups in different cities, getting together occasionally on
weekends. They will play only a few pickup games before the
Olympics because there is so little competition.
</P>
<P>
   The South Africa team doesn't have the facilities to videotape
and study performances _ there is only one lighted field _ but one
of the team sponsors proposed another idea last winter. Instead of
watching videotape, he suggested, just watch the pitcher's shadow
to determine whether his arm mechanics were proper.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds ridiculous, but at least they're trying. And, as
Murphy says, ``They don't have to fit into me. I have to fit into
South African culture.''
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH AFRICA'S PAST AND FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee banned South Africa from
competition from 1964 until 1992 due to its apartheid policies, but
the country won three gold medals in Atlanta and also bid for the
2004 Games. While it is re-emerging in international sports, it
still has so very far to go in so many areas.
</P>
<P>
   When Sports Illustrated's Rick Reilly toured Soweto in 1996, his
tour guide pointed out a shantytown of corrugated tin shacks,
saying, ``Right there was the field where we used to play softball.
... We came to practice one day, and a family was living on third
base. It was their home. Within a week there were 50 houses on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst conditions were in the squatter camps where there
was no running water, no sewers,'' Harrell says. ``They would make
homes out of rusted, corrugated metal. Just absolute, destitute
poverty. Their whole day was to wake up and walk to find firewood
to cook with. There wasn't much of it, so each day, the walk to
find some got longer. ``You would see kids with open sores on their
faces, babies with no clothes. You would wish you could help them,
but you weren't sure how.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the poverty, doctors estimate 10 percent of the
population is infected with HIV, and the country's crime rate is
legendary _ Guam was supposed to play South Africa there last year
but refused due to safety concerns. Two Olympic baseball players
had their car stolen this summer, and the team's center fielder
brought a handgun to practice for protection.
</P>
<P>
   Two car bombs exploded when Murphy was in Cape Town, and he says
several passengers and drivers have been shot there in a transit
war between buses and taxi companies. Murphy says a player told him
that no one wears a seat belt in South Africa because they take too
much time to unlatch during a car-jacking.
</P>
<P>
   His residence last winter was protected by a 6-foot wall, an
iron gate and enough barbed wire to pen in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so much barbed wire in my life,'' Murphy says.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy says he wondered how the different races would mix, but
says there are no more problems than there would be for a team in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems sort of odd to me, but good of course,'' he says.
``I guess I thought the blacks or coloreds would be bitter, but on
our team and in society I really haven't seen any blatent racism.''
</P>
<P>
   With a half-mixed roster, the South African team is
significantly more diverse than the U.S. baseball squad in Atlanta
four years ago, when Jacque Jones was the team's only
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any window dressing,'' Tew says. ``We really are
one of the only South African teams that have pushed the question
of color. That is a big part of why we got to go. Yes, we
qualified; however, the South African ruling body said we would go
only if we were medal contenders. But because we represent the
demographics of the new South Africa so well, they wanted us to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is the noteable absence of blacks from the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy says he initially assumed four or five of the team's
players were black because of their dark skin, but he was informed
they are considered colored by South African standards. There are
no blacks on the South Africa team because, Tew says, the black
community was effectively shut out from baseball until apartheid's
end and adults don't play it (soccer was played in the black
community during apartheid and most of the Olympic soccer team is
black).
</P>
<P>
   With the way the sport is catching on with young people in the
country's overwhelming black majority, however, Tew estimates that
within 10 years the South African national team will be wholly
black.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Murphy says the batboy for the South African team is a
black child named Gift, who plays for a 12-under national team that
recently toured Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the day the South African team has a black
majority, hopefully with Gift as a player,'' Murphy wrote in a
diary for the MLB International Web site.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa opens the Olympics with games against Cuba and the
U.S., games it is almost certain to lose. Tew thinks South Africa
can beat Italy and the Netherlands but said it would be a ``huge
shock'' to make the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in this case, winning in Sydney isn't really the point.
After so many years of apartheid, the victory is just playing
together on an Olympic diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could see the team, and the spirit we have and who
mixes together, there aren't any little groups,'' Tew says. ``They
go out and party together, and when they fight, they fight
together. Sports has really brought the country together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident that things will really become good in
South Africa. It's a beautiful country; we just need to get more
money and jobs coming into the country. It's getting better, and in
a small way, baseball is playing a part.''

   POLYGAMIST (Colorado City, Ariz.) - School opens in Colorado
City. Nearly 700 students don't show up, as the fundamentalist
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints begins its ambitious
home-schooling and private schooling project. Church leaders warn
about the evils of the outside world. Parents kept their students
out of school, the latest in a series of events of the church
saying they want to withdraw from society and to keep alien ideas
out of the town. Meanwhile, as 350 students did go school, dozens
of students from the fundalmentalist families were riding
motorcycles and tractors around town. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will

<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush announces that Jesus is his favorite political
philosopher. Al Gore seeks moral guidance by invoking the pop
refrain ``WWJD? - What would Jesus do?''
</P>
<P>
   But as religious references infuse this year's presidential
campaign, another question arises: ``What would Jefferson do?''
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans in 2000, the answer would be surprising.
</P>
<P>
   In his time, the author of the Declaration of Independence was
branded an atheist in some traditional religious circles. Like many
of the founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson embraced a basic belief
in God - deism - but was also a man of science, intrigued by the
philosophies of the Age of Enlightenment, a European intellectual
movement that contended all of life, including religion, could be
understood through the process of reason.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men who forged the new American nation embraced God
but distrusted organized religion, disdainful of abuses by the
powerful clergy who ruled the Church of England and held sway over
the English government itself. In one of his letters, Jefferson
charged that yoking church and state turned human beings into
``dupes and drudges.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined to avoid such mischief, the framers of the U.S.
Constitution codified their concerns in the First Amendment:
``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson would interpret this as a mandate for the separation
of church and government. The article also would be construed not
only as freedom of religion but also freedom from religion.
</P>
<P>
   Americans today who hope to paint a picture of the founding
fathers as a pious bunch risk rewriting history.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is really overstated,'' says John Corrigan,
professor of American studies and religious studies at Arizona
State University. ``They (the founding fathers) were not
particularly religious.''
</P>
<P>
   Brook Simpson, ASU professor of history and humanity, calls them
men of reason and enlightenment who saw God's will as expressed in
the laws of nature and whose mixed bag of ideas cannot be
appropriated to fit a particular agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes on today is that they treat the founders as a sort
of cafeteria, where they get to pick and choose,'' Simpson says.
</P>
<P>
   The beliefs held by these 18th-century men were often at odds
with prevailing thought in a time when church and faith held
central roles in society.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, Jefferson was a conventional Christian, an
Anglican - the Church of England in the New World. He served as a
vestryman in his parish. He believed that religion holds society
together and goes hand in hand with morality. In the Declaration of
Independence, he refers variously to the creator, nature's God and
divine providence.
</P>
<P>
   But while Jefferson embraced the teachings of Jesus as a good
moral foundation, he doubted Jesus' divinity. He even rewrote the
New Testament, cutting and pasting passages to remove references to
miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson ``preferred a world of science and rationality,''
Simpson says.
</P>
<P>
   So passionate was Jefferson about religious freedom that his
tombstone lists as his three greatest accomplishments the writing
of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, authoring the
Declaration of Independence and founding the University of
Virginia, a purposely secular institution in contrast with his own
Anglican-run alma mater, the College of William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   The epitaph he requested omits his role as president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's friend and philosophical confederate, James Madison,
also professed a general belief in God and wrote in Memorial and
Remonstrance that an individual's duty to his ``universal
sovereign'' came before his civic responsibilities. But he shared
Jefferson's wariness of what was then termed ``priestcraft,'' or
clerical hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, an Anglican, had been educated at the College of New
Jersey, now Princeton University. Though the school had been
founded by the Presbyterian Church, he chose it for its aversion to
ministerial rule.
</P>
<P>
   As principal author of the U.S. Constitution, Madison was as
adamant as Jefferson about the Establishment clause. Like
Jefferson, he advocated ``a perfect separation between
ecclesiastical and civil matters.''
</P>
<P>
   During his presidency, Madison rejected requests to make
official religious proclamations or to declare religious holidays.
Citizens of the new United States, he insisted, would have to
accept the absence of a state religion - disestablishment.
</P>
<P>
   When creating the American government, its framers not only
believed fervently in disestablishment but also neatly avoided
choosing one religion from among the many faiths espoused in the
colonies, including Episcopalian (Anglican), Congregational (church
of the Pilgrims), Dutch Reformed, Presbyterian, Quaker, Methodist
and Calvinism.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland had been founded as a Roman Catholic colony but fell to
pressures from England to establish Anglican parishes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the American Revolution, Corrigan says there were
between 2,300 and 2,500 Jews living in America - with little
anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most complex figures in colonial religious life was
the venerable Benjamin Franklin. As a young man, Franklin had
undergone a conversion to Presbyterianism, but ``it didn't take,''
Corrigan says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for such a champion of democracy, Franklin was
something of an elitist when it came to religion, says Richard
Wenz, ASU professor emeritus of American religious studies. In a
letter to his daughter, Franklin encouraged her to attend church
services and to heed the message of the sermon. But for himself, he
believed he had evolved beyond the need for catechism.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jefferson, Franklin was more intrigued by science than
spirituality. Religion was an intellectual pursuit, useful for
moral grounding. A wise man graduated from the need for further
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he professed a belief in God and, just a month before his
death, answered a friend's request to state his Christian
principles, saying, ``I believe in one God, creator of the
universe. That he governs the world by his providence. That he
ought to be worshiped. That the most acceptable service we can
render to him, is doing good to his other children. That the soul
of man is immortal.''
</P>
<P>
   Immortality was a basic tenet of deism, along with a belief in
God and a love of freedom. America's second president, John Adams,
was solidly deist. For more than 60 years, he embraced the liberal
Unitarian church.
</P>
<P>
   Like his colleagues, Adams denounced the priestcraft and
believed the principles of Jesus had deteriorated into superstition
and hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington wore his faith as humbly as he did his
political leadership, unfettered by doctrine. Though an Anglican
vestryman like Jefferson, he insisted that ``my tenets are few and
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   To Washington, God was the ``grand architect'' of the universe,
``great ruler of events,'' ``higher cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The faith he expressed in conversation was generic.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, one of the richest and most provocative treatises
on early American religious thought was penned by master wordsmith
Thomas Paine, whose 1776 pamphlet Common Sense helped to incite
passions favorable to the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1794, Paine published Age of Reason. Son of a Quaker, Paine
said, ``I believe in one God and no more, and I hope for happiness
beyond this life.{hellip}I believe that religious duties consist in
doing justice, loving mercy and endeavoring to make our fellow
creatures happy.''John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence in
Congress, displayed in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol, pictures
the founding fathers, who were intrigued with science and reason
and were not particularly religious.not needed

<P>
   ``DROWNING RUTH''
</P>
<P>
   By Cristina Schwarz
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   This first novel is soap opera at its best, a story with such
melodrama waiting around every bend that it would seem silly if
Schwarz were not so adept at leading us on through the mire. It is
1919, and Amanda Starkey, a Milwaukee nurse who cares for men sent
home from the Great War, is teetering on the edge of a nervous
breakdown. When the hospital asks her to leave, she goes home to
live on her family's farm overlooking Nagawaukee Lake with her
younger sister, Mattie, and Mattie's 3-year-old daughter, Ruth. A
year later, Mattie is found mysteriously drowned (yes, Mattie,
despite the book's title), her body frozen in the lake ice. What
happened? Schwarz moves masterfully back and forth in time,
switching from third-person narration to the voices of Ruth and
Amanda and introducing characters who are startlingly blind to
their roles in events that cost Mattie her life and threaten
Amanda's sanity. It's a darkly entertaining story of guilt and
grief, told with suspense and meticulous control.
</P>
<P>
   ``TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by James M. McPherson
</P>
<P>
   (DK, $29.95)
</P>
<P>
   John Adams, historian James M. Banner Jr. writes, was
``insecure, volatile, impulsive, irritable, suspicious,
self-pitying, self-righteous and filled with often combustible
rage.'' John F. Kennedy once said to a group of Nobel Prize winners
that they were ``the most extraordinary collection of human talent
ever gathered at the White House, with the possible exception of
when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.'' And was it a critic or an
admirer who asked about Andrew Jackson, ``If (he) wants to go to
heaven, who's to stop him?'' Most of us don't need to know
everything about the 42 men who have been presidents of the United
States, but it's nice to grasp the basics. This handsome book
offers an informative essay about each president, written by a
member of the Society of American Historians (editor McPherson
deals with Abraham Lincoln). Also, here are voting statistics for
each election and the texts of each president's inaugural address.
It's a primer well worth its price.

   ``ISN'T THAT A GUN IN YOUR POCKET?''
</P>
<P>
   By Rachel Abramowitz
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $26.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started directing, people said to me the first day,
`Where shall we put the camera?''' Elaine May remembers. ``And I
didn't know what the camera looked like. I thought it was one of
the lights.'' Luckily, she figured it out. This book, which began
as a story about women in the movie business for
(beginitalic)Premiere (enditalic)magazine, is really a rambling
collection of miniprofiles of powerful women in Hollywood,
including Barbra Streisand, Jodie Foster, writer-director Nora
Ephron, director Penny Marshall, studio executive Sherry Lansing
and agent Sue Mengers. Abramowitz actually spends less time on the
subject of women and power than she does telling stories about the
making of such films as (beginitalic)The Accused(enditalic),
(beginitalic)Yentl(enditalic), (beginitalic)Thelma
&AMP;(enditalic)(beginitalic)Louise(enditalic), (beginitalic)Fatal
Attraction (enditalic)and (beginitalic)When Harry Met
Sally(enditalic). In the end, it's more fun that way. After all,
she says, the true measure of success in Hollywood is the ease with
which it's taken for granted.

   ``THE CIVIL WAR: A NEW VIEW IN CLOSE-UP 3-D''
</P>
<P>
   By Marc E. Frey
</P>
<P>
   (Running Press, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   This ``book'' is terrific if you are 8 years old, but Civil War
enthusiasts with more years under their belts will probably find it
wanting. On the first page, a simple tent pops up, much like the
one Lincoln and McClellan met in at Antietam (there are men in this
one, too, but they aren't Lincoln or McClellan and you need a
flashlight to see them). On the next page is something that bears
considerable resemblance to a pit toilet but is really a
stubby-barreled, muzzle-loading cannon (that's the problem with
pop-up books - everything looks like something else, and you don't
get to choose what it is). The third page offers a simple pop-up of
the ironclad warship Monitor; on the fourth are the trenches of the
Petersburg campaign; on the fifth is the city of Columbia, S.C.,
with little flames coming out of it; and finally, a lumpy
topographical map of Gettysburg. That's what you get for the price
of admission - scoff or enjoy, as you will.

 &HT;    PACKARD GOES ON THE BLOCK VIA INTERNET(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - The Packard Motor Car Co., a Phoenix-based effort to
resurrect one of the greatest names in motoring, is being auctioned
on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling company, which has produced a widely acclaimed
running prototype of a modern V-12 Packard, is being sold on the
Internet lock, stock and barrel, according to Roy Gullickson, the
Phoenix engineer and businessman who unveiled his prototype about
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gullickson is selling the Packard name, its classic logo, the
prototype car, a full-size styling model, factory equipment and
other pieces of his company to the highest bidder. The sale is
necessary, he said, because he hasn't attracted enough investors to
start a factory to build his dream car, the ``ultraluxury'' Packard
12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' Gullickson said, still hoping he can
make a go at manufacturing. ``Maybe it will shake some investment
people out of the bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur said 85 orders already have been placed for the
Packard 12, an extravagant automobile that would compete with such
foreign luxury brands as Rolls-Royce and Mercedes-Benz and sell at
prices well over $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Kruse, president of Kruse International, which is handling
the sale for eBay, said the trademarked Packard logo alone is worth
considerable money. That piece of script lettering goes back to
1902 and recalls a powerful automobile of huge proportions and
beautiful styling. Packards built before World War II are highly
prized by collectors, many of whom yearn to see Gullickson revive
the power and prestige of the brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the Packard people want to see a revival of the car,''
said Ken McCartney, vice president the Packards International Club
in Arizona. ``To my mind, he (Gullickson) has done an amazing job.
He's carried it off very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruse said his 30-year-old auction company, which was bought by
eBay a year ago, has sold some prototypes and abortive
manufacturing endeavors in the past ``but not with a trademark like
Packard, which is one of the greatest names in automobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullickson would not reveal his reserve, which represents the
lowest price he'll accept for the Packard company. And Kruse would
not speculate as to its value, saying only that Gullickson has a
lot of money invested, ``like 7 or 10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction goes up on eBay on Thursday and concludes on Sept.
4. Kruse said that when the Packard Motor Car Co. shows up on eBay,
it will appear like any other auction item, though with a longer
description and more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to sell a Beanie Baby or something on eBay, it's
just a couple of lines,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kruse International, which was founded in Scottsdale in 1970 by
Dean Kruse's father, Russell, conducts an auction every January in
Scottsdale, one week before the local Barrett-Jackson Classic Car
Auction.
</P>
<P>
   The two auctions were founded together, with Russell Kruse
teaming up with Thomas Barrett and Russell Jackson to put on the
first auction events. Nowadays, Kruse International conducts more
than 60 classic-car auctions around the globe, Dean Kruse said.
</P>
<P>
   The Packard sale will coincide with Kruse's biggest classic-car
auction of the year in its home base of Auburn, Ind. Kruse said the
sale the company will be accompanied with equivalent show-biz
hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of the huge Auburn event, the Packard Motor Car
Co. will come up on the block, possibly with the lavish prototype
car driven up on stage, Kruse said. At that point, the eBay bidding
and the live bidding will merge, with the crowd in Auburn vying
against the Online offers.
</P>
<P>
   Gullickson said if the company fails to reach its potential at
auction, he'll go on with his manufacturing plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty low reserve, we feel, and if that isn't
reached, we'll carry on with our search for investors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kruse said he's confident the bidding will surpass the
reserve and the company will sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for investors - we're looking for a buyer,''
he said. ``We've had a lot interest in this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like anybody's baby. He just hates to give it up.''

<P>
   (Colorado City, ARIZ.) - He'd had a month to prepare since
polygamous religious leaders declared public schools the bane of
this insular, isolated town of hotel-sized houses, frontier dresses
and ponytails.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado City Superintendent Alvin Barlow said there's only
so much you can do to offset the shock on the first day of school
when two-thirds of your previous student body, more than 600
students, don't show up.
</P>
<P>
   Like the surreal, deserted corridors.
</P>
<P>
   And no one fighting over the computer terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Or, like in Deloy Bateman's ninth-grade general science class,
where he used to cram in more than 30 students by using bar stools
and where now 11 students can stretch their legs in the front two
rows.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints had heeded the call of their leaders,
who had implored them during church services in late July to turn
their back on secular society, to cut off ties with apostates, to
teach their children at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the admonition prevented dozens of children from riding
around town during normal school hours on three-wheelers, tractors
and bicycles and helping their fathers build additions to their
homes and hoeing gardens.
</P>
<P>
   This is harvest season, noted several teenagers remodeling this
area's only recognized private school in nearby Centennial Park,
where classes will begin in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the dominant ``first ward'' of the church, which
broke away from the mainstream Mormon church in the late 1800s
after the taking of plural wives was banned, was greeted warmly by
members of the ``second ward'' of the church. That ward, which also
went it own way 10 years ago, created its own polygamous community
in Centennial Park, across Arizona 389.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers said that clashes between children of the two
polygamous sects had created discipline problems, especially during
past school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot better that they are gone, if you ask me,'' said
Melissa Hammon of Centennial Park after dropping off her 5-year-old
son at the Colorado City school. ``Eighty percent of the teachers
last year were indoctrinating the kids with all the first ward
teachings. Now, I think they'll get a better education.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Isis Israel, a potter in the nearby community of Cane
Beds, who said goodbye to her eighth-grader, Yesod, and
first-grader, Asher, as a school bus rumbled into her driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They illegally broke the classes up for first-ward kids,
second-ward kids and then our kids who believe in neither one,''
Israel said. ``I figure this way that it will be more attention for
my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barlow noted that following the exodus of teachers from the
school after the demand by Warren Jeffs, head of the fundamentalist
sect, the school district had to hire an additional six teachers to
keep the ratio at one teacher for each 19 students, which had been
the ratio last year. Early counts indicated the school had about
350 students enrolled the first day.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 30 of those students, however, are in high school and
more than 200 were enrolled last year. Last month, school officials
also announced that elementary school and middle school classes
would be merged because of the lack of students in the seventh and
eighth grades.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow, however, a member of the first ward, said he would make
do with what he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like when Fredonia lost its sawmill, when the
strikes shut down the mines in Morenci,'' Barlow said. ``You just
adjust and go on. We lost 300 students one year in the 1980s when
Phelps School opened across the (Utah state) line in Hildale.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the mass withdrawal from school might be a blessing in
disguise, Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the highest tax rate in the state on schools,'' Barlow
said. ``There's undoubtedly going to be a significant reduction in
that since we will only have about one-third the number of
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the students' education at home and in private schools
which Barlow says soon will be forming will be just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked in this district for 38 years and have seen the
support for education in this community,'' Barlow said, noting the
success Colorado City students have had in spelling bees and
mathematics and arts competitions over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing people have to worry about are students here
getting a good education.''

CHENEY SLIPS ON OIL CRITICIZING NATIONAL MONUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (In 10thgraf, corrects number and acreage of abolished
monuments.)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has written about public lands issues
for over a decade and is respected for his insight into these
issues. His e-mail address is levendos(at)trib.com.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney
threw down the gauntlet, challenging the national monuments created
by President Clinton. It was a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney knows as much about national monuments as his
presidential running mate, George W. Bush, knows about foreign
policy. Cheney has spent too many years in board rooms in the
company of oil executives in Texas to speak knowledgeably about
this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made the assertion that if Bush and he were elected, Bush
might make the decision to rescind the national monument status of
the monuments Clinton has created.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Bush were president, he could not rescind a national
monument status. No president can. Only Congress has that
authority.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of the Interior's top legal counsel,
Solicitor John Leshy, ``The attorney general of the United States
issued an opinion in 1938 that said the president could not undo a
national monument, could not undo it in the sense of completely
repealing it. And no president has ever done that. Presidents have
made boundary adjustments, both enlarging and diminishing the size.
That's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the reasoning was pretty simple; it just said the
Antiquities Act authorizes the president to proclaim monuments but
not to unproclaim them. Only Congress, according to that view, can
`unproclaim' or outright repeal a national monument altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   And Congress doesn't unproclaim national monuments very often.
Practically, it's politically impossible to do so. The American
people want wilderness preserved and protected.
</P>
<P>
   In general, national monument status prohibits any new mineral
exploration, drilling for gas and oil, or mining. Under the new
policy of landscape monuments, the areas are left pristine and
protected from development, as the people want them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the furor among some members of the Utah congressional
delegation and other Western congressmen when Clinton created the
Escalante-Staircase National Monument in 1996, there has not been a
successful move in Congress to abolish that monument.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the record: Approximately 64 million acres have been set
aside as 110 national monuments since the Antiquities Act was
passed in 1906. Congress has only abolished 10 national monuments _
comprising about 13,000 acres in total. One of the abolished
monuments was later redesignated as a monument under a different
name.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was mistaken in another criticism of the process of
creating national monuments during the Clinton administration. He
asserted that these proclamations are announced ``willy-nilly all
over the West'' without considering the desires of the people who
will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Cheney bashed the administration's monument
designations, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, in an Aug.
23 interview, repeated what he had said many times before, ``We
have a `no-surprise' policy when it comes to recommending national
monuments.''
</P>
<P>
   A no-surprise policy makes good political sense. Babbitt has
traveled from Western state to Western state repeatedly in order to
gauge residents' interest in having a particular locale set aside
as a national monument.
</P>
<P>
   The records show that Babbitt has met with congressional
delegations, with governors and state legislators, with mayors and
local stakeholders and any others who might have some say in the
matter. There have been public hearings in each state where a new
monument was nominated and then created. Discussions about possible
national monument status has been front-page news in the states
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has even suggested to congressional delegations that
they take the lead in creating greater protection for unique public
landscapes in their states.
</P>
<P>
   Claims that national monument status has been forced down a
state's throat have no factual basis. It would be political suicide
to take such a tactic.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, 80 percent of the population supports the
designation of Aqua Fria National Monument outside of Phoenix. In
other Western states, polls indicate the support for their new
monuments hovers at 75 percent. Nationally, the American people
have shown unwavering support for the new monuments.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, Babbitt sent the president a recommendation that
proposes the creation of the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in
northern Arizona. The Vermilion Cliffs proposal covers 293,000
acres of federal land and includes the Paria Plateau. It would
continue to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Babbitt recommended that Clinton expand the current
Craters of the Moon National Monument in central Idaho. The
original 54,440-acre monument was created by President Calvin
Coolidge in 1924. Babbitt proposes that it be expanded by 661,000
acres in order to include craters, cones, lava flows, caves and
fissures along a rift that is 65 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the end of it. Babbitt will make other
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   About other monument proposals, Babbitt said, ``We have a list
of areas that have been publicly discussed, where I have been out
on the ground and engaged all of the stakeholders: Steens Mountain
(Oregon), the Carrizo Plain in California, the Santa Rosa Mountains
in California, the Missouri Breaks (Montana), the Black Ridge area
in Colorado, the San Rafael in Utah. These areas are in the
congressional phase right now. At this point, these are all areas
of possible future recommendations, but they are areas where we
have emphasized our desire to see legislation coming out of the
Congress. With each of these places, we have stuff going in varying
degrees in the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no ``willy-nilly'' monuments, despite Cheney's
assertions. But, by his statements, Cheney has certainly broadcast
where he stands on environmental issues _ on the side of oil.

FOR GARAGE.COM'S KAWASAKI, NOTHING IS SACRED

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. _ Guy Kawasaki is being wicked.
</P>
<P>
   As moderator to a panel of start-up chief executives, he asks a
question he knows will make them squirm.
</P>
<P>
   ``So are venture capitalists good for anything?'' Kawasaki lobs
with deliberate amiability, arching an eyebrow for effect.
</P>
<P>
   A few CEOs nervously chuckle as they ransack their brains for a
diplomatic answer. Kawasaki glows, knowing entrepreneurs privately
loathe venture capitalists _ call them ``vulture capitalists''
behind their backs _ but dare not say so in public for fear of
losing their funding.
</P>
<P>
   Being a troublemaker is all in a day's work for Kawasaki, best
known in Silicon Valley as Apple Computer Corp.'s one-time chief
evangelist (yes, that was the title), the man who turned down the
chance to interview for the CEO position at Yahoo, and now the CEO
of Garage.com, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He is also known here as a ceaseless self-promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Guy does best is promoting Guy,'' said Andy Hertzfeld,
one of the original engineers at Apple and now head of Eazel, a
Linux software company.
</P>
<P>
   This is something Kawasaki happily and bluntly acknowledges in
his one-page biography: ``Guy wasn't the first or the last
Macintosh evangelist, but he took the most credit.''
</P>
<P>
   It's in this realm of in-your-face ``Aikido marketing'' that
Kawasaki has excelled. What makes him bearable in polite company is
his biting humor, which he directs at himself just as often as he
aims it at others.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking to the guy who turned down the opportunity to
interview for the CEO position of Yahoo,'' said Kawasaki in a
recent interview. ``There were 10 search engines at the time,
including one from (Digital Equipment Corp.) called AltaVista. I
couldn't see how Yahoo would make it. So you see how easy it is to
be a bozo.''
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki also turned down the job because he had a second son on
the way, and the commute to work would have been too taxing on his
young family.
</P>
<P>
   Family is something he refers to often. He points out that his
grandfather, an immigrant from Japan, was a taxi driver in Hawaii,
where Kawasaki was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly weren't wealthy industrialists,'' he said. ``And we
didn't make motorcycles, either.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kawasakis did well. His father, Duke Kawasaki, was a
Democratic state senator for Honolulu. Guy attended college at
Stanford University and majored in psychology. After a week in law
school, he quit because he ``couldn't take it.'' His calling became
clearer while he was attending business school at the University of
California at Los Angeles. He joined a jewelry company as a diamond
counter and left as vice president of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   His next job was at a software company, which was sold to a
larger company in Atlanta. Not wanting to relocate, Kawasaki cast
about for another job in California. He landed at Apple. It was
1983, and Apple was an irreverent upstart battling a formidable
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki left Apple in 1987, hacked around on various projects,
and eventually returned to Apple in 1995 as chief evangelist. He
left again in 1998 to become CEO of Garage.com, a company that
funds start-ups, matches investors with entrepreneurs, and stages
``boot camps'' throughout the country for would-be entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   At 46, Kawasaki still has an edge. He rises at 4:45 a.m. three
mornings a week to play basketball. His sarcasm continues to be
unsparing. And he is an unrelenting smart aleck. It's almost as if
he can't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, ``Rules for Revolutionaries: The Capitalist
Manifesto,'' he writes about naysayers, ``The higher you go in a
company, the less oxygen there is, so supporting intelligent life
becomes difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the book, he encourages start-ups to slum it.
``A lousy building and lousy furniture are necessary because
suffering is good for revolutionaries,'' he writes. ``It builds
cohesiveness; it creates a sense of urgency; and it focuses the
team on what's most important: shipping'' new products.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his thoughts on Apple, Kawasaki responds that as a
consumer he would like to see Apple make an ultra-lightweight
laptop to compete with Sony Corp.'s VAIO line of computers. ``I'd
like a laptop I can carry to five meetings a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a strategist, Kawasaki said, ``The bigger challenge for Apple
is that they have to make a computer that kills the Macintosh.
Right now, they're milking the Macintosh. But what they need to do
is jump to the next curve.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kawasaki is a man on today's curve, and he knows it. That's
why he relishes his current position as sifter of ideas for the
next generation of computing.
</P>
<P>
   As CEO of Garage.com, he sees hundreds of business plans float
across his desk each week. Today, the buzz is around companies
built on solid science, as opposed to marketing, he said. Companies
that focus on building the Internet's infrastructure or wireless
technology are hot. Internet retailers are not.
</P>
<P>
   The weirdest proposal he's seen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone actually submitted a business plan for buying a small,
Middle Eastern country and turning it into an amusement park,''
Kawasaki said. ``We turned him down.''

MINDBRANCH UPS THE ANTE IN RESEARCH DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Changing the name was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   Juiced up with an $18 million injection of capital funding, the
sedate-sounding Publications Resource Group in North Adams, Mass.
is now officially known as MindBranch _ aggregator of
technology-oriented market research.
</P>
<P>
   It's a space that's still surprisingly wide open, but the
company is moving quickly to enhance its Web infrastructure to make
gathering corporate intelligence an easy experience. At the top of
the list: fine-tuning the latest technology to establish a feedback
loop for clients, to help narrow and customize future searches.
</P>
<P>
   MindBranch (www.mindbranch.com) claims to have more than 230
partners signed up for its one-stop-shopping site, including
Forrester Research, the Gartner Group, Giga Information Group, and
dozens of small and medium-size outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Companies doing research on competitors, contemplating an
acquisition, or breaking into a new business will enter their
desired subject _ ``optical scanning,'' for example, or ``undersea
cable'' _ and get back the best and latest work from those
publishers: market research reports, newsletters, directories, and
databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the lessons everyone has learned is, you've got to be
vertical. Claiming the high ground is all about focus, and ours is
technology-oriented information,'' said Alton L. Adams, the
43-year-old former president of Standard &AMP; Poors DRI who is
relocating from Boston to the Berkshires to become chief executive
of MindBranch.
</P>
<P>
   Other players in the space, including marketresearch.com,
Dialogue, and Silver Platter, do a fine job of managing information
via the Internet, Adams said, but tend to be more general. The
individual market research companies have their own Web sites, but
they cry out for being gathered together in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to get the best research now, you'd have to go to
30 different places, a significant investment of time and money.
And you're never sure you have the entire universe covered,'' he
said. ``With us, you can get everyone who's done work on a topic,
and compare. In a market that's changing, and with so much
information available, it's important to be able to go to one
place.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the site as cutting-edge as possible, MindBranch is on a
strict schedule to implement technological enhancements, such as
conference Webcasts, real-time market research, online-catalog
searching capability (by concept or intended use of the
information), and, perhaps most ambitiously, a custom-consulting
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Industries covered include business and finance, communications,
computers and information technology, consumer products, health
care, industrial markets, the Internet, and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   In concept, at least, outsiders agree there's an important
market niche to tap in aggregating research data.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a need for a site like this, which
aggregates all kinds of information,'' said Steve Miyao, senior
vice president at Kasina Strategic E-Business Solutions in New
York. ``People usually have subscriptions with one company, like
Forrester or Gartner, but there's always going to be additional
information they need, or information from a smaller company that's
done a white paper on a given topic. Certainly for publishers, it's
a great way to disseminate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to get the best thinking and insight from all of
the best providers can be a tremendous value, especially in an age
when information is only a commodity to those who get it second or
can't interpret it,'' said Robert Powell, editor of
mutualfunds.com, which plans to offer a similar service but
specifically focused on market research for the mutual fund
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do it well, to distinguish themselves, they'll have to
offer customers the most comprehensive, best-in-class, and timely
information available. And the site has got to be easy to use and
well-organized,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   MindBranch got its funding from Internet entrepreneur Bo
Peabody's Village Ventures Inc., which provides capital primarily
for start-ups outside of major metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   MindBranch, which will have 90 employees by the end of the year,
is moving into a long-shuttered department store space on North
Adam's Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Peabody, who is joining the board of MindBranch, said he hopes
the company's success will further establish the Williamstown-North
Adams area as a fledgling ``Silicon Village'' in northern Berkshire
County, just south of the Vermont border.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who is leaving the cosmopolitan setting of the South End
for a house in Bennington, Vt., said when he first drove to North
Adams it was raining ``and as I checked into the Holiday Inn I
thought, `There's no way I'm moving out here.' But then I met the
young people (at MindBranch) who had so much enthusiasm, and it was
so different from the conservatism of McGraw-Hill (owners of
Standard &AMP; Poors DRI), I completely turned around on it.''

FREEDOM-LOVING GEEKS DEVOTED TO GUNS, LINUX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what has become a ritual during Linux conventions throughout
the nation, dozens of computer programmers have been gathering to
catch up with old friends, trade tips on the latest hacking
techniques, and fire off a few rounds at the local shooting range.
</P>
<P>
   Their most recent meeting took place in Silicon Valley two weeks
ago. The occasion was LinuxWorld in San Jose, a confab of 20,000
devotees of the Linux computer operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Call them Linux Libertarians. This subculture of hackerdom is
less about guns than it is about an elaborate philosophy of a
faction of freedom-loving geeks with an acute distrust for
authority. To understand them is to understand the popularity of
Linux, an operating system that spawned out of the insurgent ``free
software'' movement.
</P>
<P>
   Members of this movement believe the source code _ or recipe _
for all software programs should be freely available to the public.
It's a notion anathema to companies that sell software, especially
Microsoft Corp., whose Windows operating system is seen as the
uber-rival of Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Raymond, founder of the Geeks With Guns group, summed it up
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux is about getting freedom,'' Raymond said. ``Personal
firearms are about keeping it.''
</P>
<P>
   If attendance at Geeks With Guns events is any mea-sure, this
philosophy is gaining ground. A record number of geeks showed up to
the latest shooting event at Target Masters, a local shooting
range, according to Raymond, who has organized a dozen of these
gatherings over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Word had gotten out, and the 40-geek group got more than its
usual share of novices that evening. They received a tutorial from
Jordan K. Hubbard, a veteran shooter and vice president of Berkeley
Software Design Inc. Hubbard issued precise instructions as though
he was compiling code.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, who has been shooting guns since he was 7 years old,
also acted as arms dealer that evening, bringing seven of his own
guns for others to shoot. A crowd favorite was the Sig-Sauer 1P220
45 caliber semiautomatic handgun; another was the sleek silver
Walther PPK, also known as the ``James Bond'' gun.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Maynard, a software engineer with Compaq Computer Corp.
in Houston, was among those who came to socialize. Maynard greeted
Raymond as if the two were old friends. In fact, they had only met
in person the day before. But the two had corresponded via e-mail
for over a decade. This, Raymond said, is a common occurrence among
geeks.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting a few bull's-eyes, Maynard and Raymond talk about
gun control. The discussion becomes animated as more geeks join in.
Needless to say, the conversation is heavily biased against gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK to stand on your principles,'' said Heather Stern, a
senior engineer at Tuxtops Inc. in Sunnyvale, Calif., and one of a
handful of ``Linux chix'' at the event. ``It's not OK for you to
step on mine.''
</P>
<P>
   John Charles Randolph, a Macintosh programmer from San Jose,
Calif., adds with impeccable logic, ``If you illegalize guns, then
only criminals will have guns.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it with geeks and guns?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think engineers don't particularly like being told what to
do,'' said Randolph. ``And gun control is about the government
telling us what we can and can't do. They're treating us like
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, in an earlier interview, tried to explain. ``Hackers
tend to have a broadly libertarian view of the world,'' he said.
``Whatever hackers label themselves, they tend to be more
individualistic and more skeptical of concentrations of power. From
that attitude, there follows a sympathy with the Second Amendment
(of the US Constitution, which bestows the right of individuals to
bear arms).''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a revenge-of-the-nerds factor, Raymond admitted.
``This is a population that shies away from conventional sports,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all geeks like guns. And not all geeks with guns
are libertarian. Some geeks like to shoot guns for the sheer fun of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Luger, director of developer relations at OpenSales Inc.
in San Mateo, Calif., considers herself a ``liberal'' but also a
gun enthusiast. Luger, a descendant of the inventor of the
automatic pistol used during both World Wars, likes to schedule her
first dates at the shooting range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys get intimidated, but I'm a pretty full-on person, so
this is a good way for guys to get to know me,'' said Luger.
</P>
<P>
   But for Michael Pelletier, guns are a key part of his political
expression. Pelletier, a senior engineer with Taos, a technical
consulting firm in Santa Clara, Calif., is a walking encyclopedia
on gun control. A single question can trigger a formidable lecture
from Pelletier, complete with legal citations and verbatim
quotations from Supreme Court justices, Thomas Jefferson, and
George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun control laws simply take away the right of ordinary
citizens to protect themselves,'' said Pelletier. He said he plans
to print bumper stickers that read ``Linux and Guns _ Tools of
Freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelletier, a member of the Libertarian Party, sees a clear
connection between the right to carry firearms and the Linux ``free
software'' movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The myriad architects of Linux and other free software
projects have a very clear understanding of what freedom actually
means and how it applies to our everyday lives, and how the
government can act to take it away,'' said Pelletier.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether society would be better off if there were simply
no guns, Pelletier remarks with the incredulous look of an engineer
being asked to do the impossible, ``You can't uninvent
technology.''

PORTALS: A TEST POSTPONED

<P>
   A lawsuit against Yahoo Inc. that had been seen as a key test of
online anonymity was withdrawn before any formal arguments could be
made in court.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was brought in May by an Ohio man who said he was fired
after being identified as the author who posted on a Yahoo message
board criticism of his superiors at AnswerThink Consulting Group in
Miami. The man's lawyer argued Yahoo should have done more to
protect his identity, or at least notify him that AnswerThink was
seeking the information. The American Civil Liberties Union had
supported the suit, contending Internet companies give users the
false impression their online musings will be protected.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments will have to wait for another case, however,
following the withdrawal of the suit by the plaintiff, according to
his attorney, Megan Gray of the Baker &AMP; Hostetler law firm in Los
Angeles. Gray declined to discuss the reasons for the action. A
Yahoo attorney said there was no settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the suit, Yahoo's policy had been that it would
disclose information about its users in response to civil
subpoenas. After the suit was filed, Yahoo said it had changed its
rules. Now, it will notify users when their identities are sought
by a third party, and give them 15 days to take legal action.
</P>
<P>
   One of the suit's original supporters, David Sobel, an attorney
with the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington,
called Yahoo's new rules an improvement but said he hopes federal
laws will eventually clarify just how much anonymity users should
expect when using pseudonyms online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that bothers me the most is that it's entirely
voluntary, and still probably subject to their discretion, and
there's nothing that obligates them to do more'' to protect a
user's identity, Sobel said. &QL; 
 &QL;

</P>
<P>
   AltaVista Co. has introduced what it calls the world's largest
index of Web pages customized for use by mobile phones and palmtop
devices, a listing of 2.7 million pages in all. AltaVista, a
majority-owned unit of CMGI Inc. of Andover, is best known as a
portal site for PC users. But full Web pages usually contain too
much data, up to 1,000 words, to be useful for most wireless
devices that link to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware makers hope to overcome the limitation with a standard
known as WAP, or Wireless Application Protocol, which creates Web
pages with fewer characters _ perhaps just 80 words _ that are
easier to download and display on wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   By listing sites that are WAP-enabled, AltaVista hope its index,
found at wap.raging.com, will become a standard of its own.
Currently a majority of the sites it lists are in Europe, where
mobile-phone usage is more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Google Inc., an AltaVista competitor, uses a technology that
translates sites written in traditional Web codes into another
mobile-friendly language. Earlier this month, Google announced a
deal with wireless-services provider Nextel Communications Inc. &QL;

Hyperlinks unbound &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A New York company's software turns any typed text into a
hyperlink to other information on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The company is Zapper Technologies Inc. and its program, Zapper,
works with most PC applications. The software develops links to
financial, sports, reference, and shopping sites, and pastes to
them any word or phrase a user highlights with a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   If a user receives an e-mail mentioning the book ``In a
Sunburned Country'' by Bill Bryson, for instance, he could
highlight the title and be linked to Amazon.com, where the book is
for sale, or to a review at CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Zapper says it is in talks with several Internet portals,
including AltaVista, Excite, and AskJeeves. Zapper says it won't
limit searches to sites with which it has business agreements,
however.

MANY IPOS WAIT ON THE SIDELINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   August has been a huge month for IPOs. But not all companies got
out as they'd hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Several local deals have been shelved _ most temporarily _ and
they share one thing in common: They all filed to go public before
or shortly after the April Nasdaq dive.
</P>
<P>
   Take Connected Corp. The Natick-based provider of remote
computer repair and database backup filed April 5 to go public, in
hopes of raising $57.5 million. The company has raised $36 million
in venture capital from a Who's Who of the financial world.
</P>
<P>
   Here's who's on the hook, unable to make a quick buck on
Connected for the moment: Fidelity Ventures (an arm of the mutual
fund giant) holds a 10.6 percent stake. Intel Corp. has 9.8
percent. Baker Communications Fund of New York has 19.7 percent.
And, Softbank, the big Japanese venture group, holds 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Connected's chief executive, Robert Brennan, says the company
has plenty of cash and simply doesn't need to go public in a market
he views as rewarding only telecom-related companies lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the markets get a little less volatile, I'm not
comfortable entering the fray,'' he says. Brennan left Cisco
Systems to run Connected, right around the time of the IPO filing.
But he says he's willing to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got cash that will take us well into 2002,'' he says.
``There's really not a need to go public from a financial
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there have been 26 IPOs withdrawn or postponed this
month, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data, a research
firm in Newark. Five of those are Massachusetts-based companies,
including Connected.
</P>
<P>
   The other Bay State companies are:
</P>
<P>
   --Account4.Com Inc., a Newton maker of Internet-based software
for professional services companies.
</P>
<P>
   --Intrinsix Corp., a Westborough semiconductor maker.
</P>
<P>
   --Modus Media Inc. a Westwood-based customer service and order
fulfillment company.
</P>
<P>
   --A fifth company, NEN Life Sciences Inc., pulled its IPO after
it agreed to be acquired by PerkinElmer Inc. Boston-based NEN makes
tools for genomic drug research.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the IPOs that have been yanked, this has been the
biggest money-raising August on record, observes Richard Peterson,
chief market strategist at Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have raised more than $8 billion on IPOs this month.
And there have been 58 deals completed, in striking distance of the
record 75 deals done in August of 1983. The last week of August is
often slow, however, because of the Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Investment returns on IPOs this month have been more modest than
in July, Peterson says. The average first-day pop on new stocks has
been 28 percent, about half the average jump they got in July.
Average gains beyond the first day were 35 percent through last
week, for companies that went public in August, compared to a 46
percent gain for companies that sold shares in July.
</P>
<P>
   But the big gains haven't been there for many companies in the
Internet and software realms, as Brennan points out.
</P>
<P>
   Modus Media Inc., a Westwood-based company that handles order
fulfillment for companies selling products over the Web, is no
start-up. The company, which has delayed its IPO plan filed in
December, has 4,800 employees in 13 countries and 1999 revenues of
$697 million.
</P>
<P>
   Big investors include Boston's Bain Capital, which owns nearly
39 percent of the company. An affiliate of Chase Capital Partners
is an investor, as well as BankAmerica Investment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not discussed the state of its IPO plans
publicly. But in June, it announced it would cut 200 jobs in its
Fremont, Calif., plant, as part of a consolidation of its North
American operations.
</P>
<P>
   After a break this last week of August, many analysts believe
IPO activity will come back strongly for the fall. Optimists
abound, in venture circles and among entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Zefer Corp., the Boston-based consulting firm, is trying to go
out shortly after Labor Day, having canceled its IPO after the
April crash. But it has lowered its expectations somewhat; Zefer's
trying to raise $45 million, down from $69 million in the first
go-round.
</P>
<P>
   Zefer chief executive William Seibel Jr. had said of the IPO
market back in April, ``We'll just wait for it to be back.''

 &HT;    Collect not, want not
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDWICH, Mass. _ Cool, drizzly days here on Cape Cod drive
visitors off the beaches and into the tiny villages situated up and
down the coast line of this intriguing arm of land so boldly
flexing its muscle out into the Atlantic. Like locusts, they swarm
into shopping malls, picking them clean of must-have items like
genuine resin replicas of island lighthouses (made in Taiwan), or
sea shells (shipped in from Florida).
</P>
<P>
   My friend Gail, in her native New England-ese, says rainy days
were different when she was a kid. ``If it rained, we went inside
to play board games or put together jigsaw puzzles.'' She remembers
the family actually talked to one another, even if it was only to
argue over what it cost to land on Boardwalk with a hotel, or to
whine because they'd gotten stuck with all the sky pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Gail and I suspect our lack of enthusiasm for getting
into a pile and shopping our backsides off might be a generation
thing. However, we prefer to think of it as a sign that we've
caught on to a basic fact of life _ stores can put it on the
shelves faster than we can carry it away. Also, there's an
algebraic truth at work here _ it's impossible to jam 50 pounds of
stuff into a 25-pound house.
</P>
<P>
   Our refusal to buy into the American dream of spending a
two-week vacation frantically driving from one outlet mall to the
next in search of shoppers' Nirvana, definitely sets us apart from
friends who plan trips to anywhere around a stop in Hershey, Penn.,
not to visit Willie Wonka and his chocolate factory, but to smoke
their credit cards on stuff they wouldn't have given a second
glance had it showed up in their local K-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The art of acquisition, always a competitive sport for the
wealthy, seems to have trickled its way down to the rest of the
population, but with one big difference _ rich stuff lasts longer.
Forty-room country houses and Picassos don't overload landfills as
does the buy it, break it, and dump it junk that most folks haul
home in such overwhelming quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Gail tells about her father, a collector of anything touted as
limited edition _ paintings, books, plates, whatever _ and how as
the years passed shelves began to sag under the weight of his
accumulation. Methodically, he'd point out each new acquisition to
his daughter and explain how valuable it would be one day. Sadly,
after he was gone, the inherent truth in the old saying ``one man's
treasure...'' struck home as she wrote the check paying someone to
haul most of it away.
</P>
<P>
   My mother was the collector in our house. She loved miniatures.
If it came in one-quarter scale it found a home with us. Shelves,
table and dresser tops, window sills, and even the tile ledge
around the shower, were loaded with Lilliputian tea sets or
families of diminutive polar bears and striped tigers. It drove my
father nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much stuff,'' he'd mutter as he threaded his way through
the fragile minefield our home had become. Once, in one of many
futile attempts to stem the incoming tide, I heard him decree: ``I
don't care what you bring in the front door, as long as something
of equal size goes out the back.'' Of course, that didn't work
either. Mother collected. Daddy complained. And the house bulged.
</P>
<P>
   This morning it's another rainy day on the Cape. The jigsaw
puzzle on the dining table is finished, and Monopoly has lost its
enchantment. We opt for a movie _ drizzle drama we call it. That's
how we came to spend a couple of hours with the ``Space Cowboys'' _
a must-see space spoof. Trust me _ nothing perks up a drab
afternoon quicker than a shot of these aging ``cowboys'' _ Clint
Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, James Garner, and Tommy Lee Jones,
standing bare-bottom nekkid, backs to the camera!
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's an age thing, we decide, but these guys were looking
mighty good in their September `morn suits. I got dibs on Tommy Lee
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   And it sure beats shopping.

 &HT;    I-35 maniacs driving 85 mph remind us of tune at 45 rpm
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With apologies to Jan and Dean:
</P>
<P>
   I-35 was packed that late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   We were speeding and following way too tight.
</P>
<P>
   Maypearl was in our dust, Hillsboro in our sights.
</P>
<P>
   All that SUV could see was my six tail lights.
</P>
<P>
   He tried me at construction; guy had nerve.
</P>
<P>
   So I punched it and there we were at Dead Man's Swerve.
</P>
<P>
   You've been there, no matter where you drive. If you've been on
the interstate you've been there, at Dead Man's Swerve. Concrete
barriers divide a section of interstate in which one side of the
four-lane highway is under construction. You still have two lanes
going both ways, but no shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the tunnel of the roller coaster when you suddenly
find yourself wrapped in black. All you can do is scream.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, you could do something else. You could decelerate.
Nobody does that, of course, even as a vehicle threads a muffin
slicer at 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like you don't get warned. The signs are explicit.
``Slow down.'' ``No shoulder.'' ``Fines double.''
</P>
<P>
   But you haven't heeded a warning sign for 250 miles.
``Stuckeys.'' That would get your attention.
</P>
<P>
   Speed limit says 50. Speedometer says 80.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Dead Man's Swerve is south of Hillsboro on I-35. The
swerve is where the lanes feed back to normal from cramped confines
between barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the wall
</P>
<P>
   An 18-wheeler hit the retaining wall not long ago. Every day,
rattled motorists ride the rapids with breaths bated. Someone
commented how many blown-out treads appear along the confined
stretch. The problem is that the treads, like the cars, have
nowhere to go when they blow.
</P>
<P>
   Being on one of the planet's most heavily traveled stretches and
not far from a swarming outlet mall, this stretch has been a major
conversation piece locally. The irony is that the construction
there isn't adding lanes as many would assume. It simply is
reconstructing with an eye to expansion one of these days. In
October, the reconstruction will switch to the northbound side and
traffic will be routed onto the other side, flip-flopping the
swerve.
</P>
<P>
   When construction is done, crews will take their retaining walls
elsewhere down the highway and the adventure will begin again.
</P>
<P>
   What speed limits?
</P>
<P>
   As the state makes plans to add lanes on I-35 from Hillsboro to
Williamson County, motorists should be settling in for hazards like
this and respecting warning signs with sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune-Herald editorialized to this effect recently and
almost lost a subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the last time I pay attention to one of your editorial
recommendations,'' said my wife, not really meaning it, I think.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to the Hillsboro outlet mall with our son she said she
slowed down as advised at the construction site. She found herself
in the middle of ``Ben Hur'' without a breast plate.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is always warring with Washington about its share of
federal highway funds. It seems that if state troopers would fine
every speeder through Dead Man's Swerve, with fines appropriately
doubled, we could tell Washington to kiss our ruby red patooties.
We could build the NAFTA highway ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Unless or until that happens, remember the refrain:
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man's Swerve is no place to play
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man's Swerve, you'd best keep away.
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man's Swerve, I can hear them say:
</P>
<P>
   Won't come back from Dead Man's Swerve.

taste and smell _ well, identical. No brainer. Then along comes

flout the laws of physics. What next? The sun rising in the west?

 &HT;    SEC scores one for the small investor
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Remember those times you noticed a stock leaping in
value and wished you had invested in it?
</P>
<P>
   Then you found out, two days later, that a privileged few
already knew a secret?
</P>
<P>
   This month the Securities and Exchange Commission acted to
curtail such infuriating surprises.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's new fair-disclosure rule requires that publicly held
companies spread the news to little-guy investors at the same time
they tell market professionals or major stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   The rule says that when a company discloses ``material nonpublic
information'' to market professionals or selected shareholders who
might trade on it, the company must also spread the information to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   A company can comply by filing a form with the SEC or by issuing
a news release. A conference call, presumably open to the public,
is another alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule follows a two-year campaign by SEC Chairman Arthur
Levitt. When he first raised the subject, Levitt said trading on
privileged information ``has utterly no place in any fair-minded,
law-abiding economy. ... The American people see it, bluntly, as a
form of cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   The public agreed. When the federal agency asked for comments,
it got 6,000 of them, most from individuals and many of them angry
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokers, market makers and the big-money boys have been
ripping off the little guy for so long they think that they are
entitled to do so,'' investor Philip J. Kaus wrote in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Regulation FD is an important victory, according to Barbara
Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation
of America. ``Information is money on the stock market,'' she said.
``The market sets stock prices based on the best available
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant information won't be important to all investors, said
Jan Holman, a market strategist for American Express. ``For most of
us, what's important is having a plan, investing on a regular basis
and remaining invested,'' she said. ``It's easy to get mired in all
the details of whether a new product is, in fact, selling, or
whether a company is going to hit its earnings forecast.''
</P>
<P>
   For regular traders, however, quick disclosures can be
moneymakers.
</P>
<P>
   Timeliness is not the only thing. When a company holds its
quarterly conference call with stock market analysts, it often
provides valuable information about the company's prospects. ``A
conference call provides insight into the the true driving forces
behind a company's performance,'' said Mark Coker. His Web site,
www.BestCalls.com, allows individuals to listen in on the calls of
many companies.
</P>
<P>
   To benefit from the new flow of information, you must find out
how companies you care about will provide their news. You can check
the company's Web site for guidance. Often the information will be
in the investor relations area. Some companies use other labels,
such as About Us or News and Info.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies have already welcomed little-guy
investors. At www.airtran.com, for example, you can listen to tapes
of the airline's most recent conference call with analysts. You can
also sign up for e-mail notifications when the next call is
available.
</P>
<P>
   You can also get e-mails telling you when AirTran files
documents with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   At www.lucent.com, Internet home of one of the most widely held
stocks, you can sign up for e-mail notifications of press releases
and download filings with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't find the services you want, it never hurts to send
an e-mail requesting them.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to listen to conference calls in real time, a number
of Web sites may help. Among them are Coker's www.BestCalls.com and
www.fool.com.
</P>
<P>
   (At the Motley Fool site, click on Conference Calls. It's on the
left side, about two screen loads down, under Stock Research.)
</P>
<P>
   Not all companies are available, of course. But last Thursday,
as the quarterly rush of earnings reports was slowing down,
BestCalls carried nine companies' conference calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Motley Fool arranges its offerings in a calendar, making it
easier to anticipate future announcements or go back to listen to
past ones. Monday, for example, you can listen in on Certicom
Corp., Piedmont Natural Gas and T/R Systems.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see up-to-the-minute SEC filings, go to
www.freeedgar. com and sign up for e-mail notifications of filings
by the companies you are following.
</P>
<P>
   Holman uses a more old-fashioned technique: She watches for
changes or trends in a company's stock price. ``Then I look at what
the news is,'' she said. ``If something looks interesting, I'll dig
it out.''

 &HT;    Parents can help teachers by backing them
 &HT;    By Hap Lecrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In last week's column I began a discussion of how stress affects
one of the most important group of professionals in our society _
schoolteachers. Last week's column noted some of the reasons for
stress including work overload, low pay, lack of control over
results and lack of positive feedback. In today's column I would
like to discuss things that can be done to help these educators.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  We should all begin by examining our attitude about the
importance of educating our children. Without a good education the
child is often doomed to a life of poverty, crime, poor health and
even shortened life span. Teachers have spent their time and money
obtaining specialty training in order to help children obtain the
tools necessary to exist in today's complex society. Minimizing the
importance of their impact on our children's lives and future is a
disastrous oversight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parents need to encourage their children to put the highest
priority on the child's education by following the rules set by the
teachers and school and by also taking advantage of the
opportunities that the school offers in both classroom studies and
extracurricular activities.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parents need to show support for teachers by becoming involved
in parent volunteer activities such as PTA, home room volunteers
and field trip chaperones. Many employers are quite willing to
extend leave time to employees who explain the need to be involved
in their child's education. Employers can also examine their own
attitude about giving their employees leave time to assist in
school-related volunteer work.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parents can increase their efforts at home by teaching such
virtues as self-discipline, delaying gratification, striving for
personal responsibility and willingness to be compassionate and
empathetic with those less fortunate then themselves. Additionally,
respect for authority, respect for other people's property and
nonviolent means of conflict resolution should be emphasized by
parents at home.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Every student needs the proper environment for home study by
having a place that is free from distraction, with proper light,
space and comfort necessary to complete after-school assignments.
Also, by assisting the child, when appropriate, with homework and
special assignments, the parent can place the child's education in
a healthy perspective.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Last but certainly not least, our society needs to
dramatically increase the recognition given teachers. Higher
salaries and increased benefits, public support for schools and
teachers, opportunities for continuing education, personal
development, family involvement and career advancement all should
be increased.
</P>
<P>
   Our society must not waste this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to invest in our children's future. Education, now perhaps more
than at any other time in history, is essential for the welfare and
happiness of our children.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The inability of Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush to animate the electorate with his plans
for whopping tax cuts suggests we're not all that angry about how
much we're paying in taxes, despite years of hysterical tutoring by
talk-radio alarmists, anarchy-lite libertarians, supply-siders and,

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ SANDWICH, Mass. _ Cool, drizzly days here on
Cape Cod drive visitors off the beaches and into the tiny villages
situated up and down the coast line of this intriguing arm of land
so boldly flexing its muscle out into the Atlantic. Like locusts,
they swarm into shopping malls, picking them clean of must-have

   I had just finished cleaning the gutters and was putting the
ladder away when I spotted, off in a corner of the garage, my high
school yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't seen the thing in years, and I figured I'd lost it
several moves ago. How it reappeared is a mystery. I can only guess
that one of the critters running my adopted state of Florida _ fire
ant, palmetto bug, termite, tree rat, wind-insurance salesman _ had
found the book amid the clutter and cracked it open in hopes of
learning more about his prey.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hot, muggy Saturday afternoon, and since I was already
elbow-deep unclogging stuff, I decided to flip through the pages of
the yearbook and test my memory.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered most everyone, although a few folks were, at best,
only familiar faces. Sometime during the last 20 years, their names
must have saddled up a brain cell and ridden off into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished with the photos, I began reading the parting
words my fellow students had scrawled in the margins. It was
predictable stuff, mostly. Lots of goofiness, sighs of relief, good
lucks and best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   One note stood out, though, and caused my sweaty brow to furrow.
``Really, Daryl,'' a classmate had written, ``you should try to
look more alive in the future. It makes people wonder, y'know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahem. There it was _ my condition, my native disposition, my
supine predilection _ but now, after all these years, I suppose it
finally has a name: The Al Gore Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden. Laconic. Drowsy. Slow to rile. Ready to tuck in.
</P>
<P>
   I was, and am, all of those things. Always have been, with the
possible exception of the Terrible Twos and certain keggers in my
Terrible Twenties.
</P>
<P>
   I've tried looking more peppy, really I have, but it feels
unnatural, phony, forced. Like Al, I'm pretty much doomed to be a
stick figure in a nauseatingly animated world.
</P>
<P>
   I've accepted my fate, but it's not always as effortless as it
might look. With my first name, I have to put up with a lot of
``Daryl and his other brother, Daryl'' jokes. (I like Bob Newhart,
but really now, isn't it time to put that show to pasture?) I also
encounter people who assume that I'm not the, uh, brightest bulb in
the marquee. (Oh, hell, let's face it: There is no marquee. The
lights are off, the parking lot's empty, and everyone went home
hours ago.)
</P>
<P>
   So, as you can imagine, I feel a certain affinity for Al Gore.
Regardless of his politics, he's my kind of guy. When he shuffled
into the national spotlight as Bill Clinton's running mate, I
listened to all the chatter about what a stiff he is, how
uncomfortable he looks, how dull and listless he seems. ``Yeah,'' I
eventually said, in a slow, drawling mumble. ``So what's yer
point?''
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of time, these so-called negatives look more
and more like pluses to me. I don't know about you, but after eight
fun-filled years of Clinton's redneck debonair, I'm ready for
boring.
</P>
<P>
   Go wonkish on us. Bury us in mind-numbing policy discussions.
Read us a long, snoozy speech. That's fine by me. If I want
animation, I'll watch the Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   As incredible as it sounds, we may be in for several months of
candidates trying to out-dull each other. It seems that Al is now
facing, uh, stiff competition from George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   I nearly jumped out of my seat last week when I read in The New
York Times that, post-Democratic convention, Dubya is making a
point of looking a little less energetic, a little less motivated.
He spent a recent Monday at home and boasted to reporters afterward
that he'd taken a nap. ``Went to bed relatively early,'' he added.
He's taking a couple of days off this week, too, and plans a long
Labor Day break.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the story, there was this paragraph: ``Mr. Bush
himself makes frequent comments about resting and sleeping and a
sensible pace, concerns that do not exactly portray him as a ball
of fire. His advisers sought to frame this as an advantage, saying
it casts him as a sensible man not utterly consumed by politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Dubya is my kind of guy, too. The choice this fall is
looking less automatic.
</P>
<P>
   If they want my vote, I think they're going to have to make one
of those scripted, phony, uninspiring, media-hyped campaign stops
at my house. They could, I dunno, take a look at the gutter that's
causing me so much trouble. I'll hold the ladder.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I'm beating a monkey's face to a pulp. But don't run off to
alert PETA _ it's really not the way it sounds.
 &HT;    The abused ape isn't real. His face is a digital simulacrum,
floating on a high-resolution screen, created to help me test a
weird computer peripheral called the PHANTOM. It resembles a desk
lamp, minus the bulb and shade, and interacts with the
computer-generated image.
 &HT;    Wherever I move the business end of this gadget, the cursor on
the screen moves in sync, denting the virtual simian's cheek,
flattening an eyebrow or crumpling an ear.
 &HT;    In short, the PHANTOM is a computer mouse that has entered into
another dimension.
 &HT;    A conventional mouse moves a cursor across the screen in many
directions _ up, down, diagonal, around _ but on only one plane.
This new tool goes not only to the x and y axis but also opens the
in-and-out, z axis. With it, I can smash in the monkey's nose,
which is pointed right at me, by pushing my hand forward; the
ball-shaped cursor convincingly shrinks as it glides away.
 &HT;    Even more amazing, whenever the ball smacks the monkey's face, I
feel the resistance in my hand as a stiff, claylike friction. In
less than a minute, I've become so proficient that I can repair the
fellow.
 &HT;    The manufacturer contends a 5-year-old can master this
peripheral. I believe it.
 &HT;    The PHANTOM was designed and built by SensAble Technologies, a
seven-year-old company with 50 employees housed in a nondescript
brick building in Woburn, Mass. Coupled with a software program
called FreeForm, it may herald an important change in the way human
beings and computers interact.
 &HT;    ``The last time the computer-human interface had a substantial
improvement was the mouse, which came out of Xerox about 25 years
ago,'' says SensAble marketing director Andrew Hally. ``This is the
next move up.'
 &HT;    Which sounds like the kind of overheated claims marketing
directors get paid to make. Do computer users really long to
``feel'' the objects on their screens?
 &HT;    After spending a few hours with the PHANTOM, I started to get a
feeling of deja vu. In the early days of personal computing, some
users huffily insisted that arrow keys were more than enough, so
who needed that goofy mouse?
 &HT;    The mouse evolved from toy to essential tool because it inspired
designers to dream up applications for it. An interface based on
haptics _ the more technically correct term for interactions
involving both feeling and position _ will likely follow the same
path.
 &HT;    ``There are a lot of problems that you can solve better if you
can use your sense of touch in 3-D space,'' Hally says.
 &HT;    The first widespread commercial application of haptic tools
arrived as part of computer-aided design, or CAD, of complex forms.
My monkey face originated as a concept model to show toy designers
how the PHANTOM could help them with their CAD work.
 &HT;    Most of the 600 PHANTOMs sold to date are used by sculptors and
engineers for companies such as Adidas, Disney, Hasbro, LEGO and
Honda, and users are ebullient. A mouse-driven CAD program works
adequately for designing squarish buildings, but try modeling a
titanium hip replacement or a snazzy new sneaker using only lines,
grids and circles.
 &HT;    ``To a sculptor, it really is a revolutionary development,''
says David R. Fish, who crafts clay footwear models for Nike and is
in the process of switching to PHANTOM-based prototyping.
 &HT;    Not only does the system emulate physical sculpting, it allows
techniques that are impossible in real clay, such as pushing out
from the inside. If an artist wants to sculpt a nose, she can click
the cursor ``off,'' push it inside the digital clay, click it
``on,'' and then pull material toward her.
 &HT;    Coupled with 3-D printers, which can manufacture plastic items
from a computer-specified form, objects sculpted in cyberspace can
become real at the touch of a button.
 &HT;    The $15,000 PHANTOM/FreeForm package is among the first haptic
applications on the market, but more ambitious systems are already
under development.
 &HT;    At the Medical College of Georgia and Georgia Technical
Institute, doctors and engineers have created an eye-surgery
simulator for training students. The digital scalpel feeds back
springy resistance as it touches the white of the digital eye; then
resistance lessens as the cyber-blade slices through.
 &HT;    Physical-skill training of all kinds is ``a huge application,''
says leading haptics researcher J. Kenneth Salisbury, who, while a
professor in MIT's mechanical engineering department, helped to
develop the PHANTOM with SensAble CEO Thomas Massie.
 &HT;    The haptics revolution is bolstering telerobotics, in which a
remote user, watching via video cameras, directs robotic arms
engaged in a task too dangerous, precise or inaccessible for naked
flesh. Telerobotics works a lot better with tactile feedback
indicating what the arms are doing.
 &HT;    Applications for such interactive devices include fighting
fires, exploring undersea or on other planets and handling
hazardous materials, but the most promising home may be surgery.
 &HT;    Already used for heart operations in the United States and
Germany, million-dollar machines allow a surgeon to operate through
half-inch-wide incisions by manipulating thin robotic arms. The
minimally invasive procedure speeds patients' recovery and someday
may extend surgeons' careers by digitally canceling age-related
hand tremors.
 &HT;    ``Eventually such techniques will be applicable in neurosurgery
or fetal surgery,'' says Salisbury, now a professor in both the
departments of computer science and surgery at Stanford University.
 &HT;    In the long run, virtually every action that involves real-world
touch could be simulated or enhanced via haptic interfaces _ and
some human activities that have never been touchy-feely could
become so.
 &HT;    Someday, we may view haptic interfaces as just one more step we
took toward the computer-immersed human. The evolution began with
the first computers, as punch cards and then screens engaged the
sense of sight. Later, computers gained sound, then touch.
 &HT;    Today companies such as Digiscents, TriSenx and Aromajet are
laboring to bring smell and even taste to the digital realm.
 &HT;    The omega point is the day when the virtual world becomes as
real to humans as the outside, three-dimensional world, with one
important distinction. For good or ill, the virtual world's only
limitations will be the ones we choose.

 By MICHAEL D. LEMONICK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    You don't hang out for long with Joseph Nagyvary before you're
faced with an uncomfortable thought: Is he a genius or a crank?
 &HT;    He certainly bears some of the telltale marks of crankdom. For
one thing, he's a monomaniac. Give him the slightest opening, and
he'll talk for hours about his research. Then, too, he's certain
that jealous enemies are conspiring to keep his discovery from
gaining the respect it deserves.
 &HT;    And as with most scientific cranks who claim to have solved a
big problem, Nagyvary is convinced he has solved an age-old riddle:
Why are violins made by Antonio Stradivari, the legendary
18th-century Cremonese instrument maker, so dramatically better
than anything built since?
 &HT;    Yet for all of Nagyvary's pretensions to crankdom, one fact
counteracts all appearances: He does make extraordinary violins,
violas and cellos.
 &HT;    Indeed, the instruments this biochemistry professor builds have
been purchased for as much as $15,000 apiece and reviewed favorably
by members of the Cleveland Quartet, Chicago Symphony and New York
Philharmonic. Yehudi Menuhin played one, on loan from Nagyvary, for
15 years.
 &HT;    Still, no one has ever found a satisfactory explanation for the
transcendently beautiful sounds that come from the violins made by
Stradivari and his Cremonese contemporaries Nicolo Amati and
Giuseppe Guarneri.
 &HT;    Instrument makers have patiently disassembled their violins and
replicated the measurements perfectly in new instruments, yet
failed to duplicate the magic.
 &HT;    Physicists have used lab equipment to analyze the vibrational
patterns of Stradivari front and back plates, which generate most
of a violin's sound, and had craftsmen carve new plates that
faithfully reproduce the patterns, all to no avail.
 &HT;    Chemists have cooked up elaborate recipes for the varnish that
coats and colors a violin's raw maple and spruce. Again, no luck.
 &HT;    Yet Nagyvary's theories suggest the chemists were closest to the
truth. It is the varnish, he says, along with the specially treated
spruce that makes Cremonese violins great. And neither had much to
do with Stradivari himself. The local lumberman just happened to
supply him with the ideal wood, and the local apothecary with the
perfect varnish.
 &HT;    ``Stradivari was a marvelous craftsman,'' Nagyvary observes,
``but the magnificent sound of his instruments is a lucky
accident.''
 &HT;    He and his colleagues at Texas A&AMP;M University have compiled an
extensive database from which they can tell a great violin from a
mediocre one. The test: the pattern of frequencies they see on
their computer screen.
 &HT;    ``It turns out that the violins acknowledged to be great by
expert listeners all look similar on the sound analyzer,'' Nagyvary
says. ``And the pattern almost exactly reproduces that of the human
voice.''
 &HT;    The 66-year-old biochemist also did extensive historical
research, which yielded a crucial clue. According to an account
written by the aristocratic patron of Joannes Baptista Guadagnini,
one of the last of the famed Cremonese violin makers, it was
important to use wood that had been dry-aged, with no extra
treatment. Nagyvary didn't buy it.
 &HT;    ``I think this may have been a deliberate deception,'' he says,
``in order to keep anyone from copying the great masters and
lowering the value of existing instruments.''
 &HT;    He learned that wood supplies were tightly controlled at the
time by government authorities in Venice: ``If you just went out
and cut wood from the forests, you could be thrown in jail.''
Instead, authorized woodcutters felled trees in the highlands and
dumped logs into rivers, where they were carried downstream to the
capital.
 &HT;    ``The Venetian navy got the best wood for building its ships,''
Nagyvary says. ``Only after bureaucrats had taken inventory and
assessed taxes could wood merchants buy their supplies _ and at
this point, the wood had been sitting in water for weeks or even
months at a time.''
 &HT;    Sure enough, Nagyvary says, when he took electron micrographs of
a handful of wood shavings from Cremonese instruments, residues of
bacteria and fungi showed up, just as you'd expect in wood that's
been sitting in water.
 &HT;    Using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Nagyvary also found the
slivers to contain unusually large amounts of minerals, including
potassium, sodium, aluminum, copper, iron and especially calcium
and magnesium.
 &HT;    Some of the minerals might have been drawn from the brackish
water in Venetian lagoons, but the rest, Nagyvary decided, were
most likely the result of deliberately treating the wood with
mineral solutions.
 &HT;    This was hardly a preposterous notion: Alchemy books _ the
chemistry texts of the day _ had plenty of recipes for mineral-rich
wood preservatives used by furniture makers to protect chairs and
tables against damage from insects and general rot.
 &HT;    So Nagyvary began soaking chunks of spruce and maple in various
brews of preservative chemicals. He knew, for example, that some
Swiss woodworkers soaked their lumber in solutions containing
bovine dung and urine. So he put up a sign above a tub in a men's
room in the biochemistry lab: ``Please contribute generously to
violin research.''
 &HT;    He kept experimenting with brines and in 1975 went to Cremona,
where he talked a violin maker there into building some instruments
with his treated wood. This raised the question of how to varnish
the finished instruments. As little as possible, say physicists who
study the vibrational qualities of wood: Varnish adds weight to a
violin, keeping it from vibrating to its full potential.
 &HT;    Nonsense, say many violin makers: Varnish is essential to the
beauty of a violin, and the secrets of varnish are jealously
guarded by professionals.
 &HT;    ``As a biochemist, though,'' Nagyvary says, ``you should have to
think about it for only a little while to realize they're both
right and both wrong. I'm annoyed that it took me a couple of years
to realize how important varnish can be.''
 &HT;    Many violin makers swear by oil-based varnishes _ and for those
craftsmen, he asserts, the instruments would be better off bare.
``First the oil penetrates deep into the wood. Then it dries and
becomes gummy. That dampens down the vibrations.''
 &HT;    On the most pristine surviving Stradivari instruments, by
contrast, the finish has a brittle, almost glassy look.
 &HT;    ``It's like a candy apple,'' says Nagyvary _ and, he believes,
with good reason. The apple's surface is hard and shiny because the
molecules that make up its sugar coating link up to form long,
interlocked chains. If Stradivari's varnish contained sugar or a
polysaccharide, the molecules would have attached to one another
and to the wood, stiffening it so it could vibrate more efficiently
_ precisely the opposite of what happens with oil.
 &HT;    Nagyvary found support for his belief in 16th-century documents
that noted that wood finishes frequently contained powdered glass,
porcelain or amber to add stiffness to the wood and make the finish
glitter like a gem, and that fruit-tree extracts were widely used
in wood varnishes.
 &HT;    ``This makes perfect sense,'' he says. ``The pectin creates
beautiful polymers. It's what makes jellies jell. Look at this.''
 &HT;    He heads into a lab at the far end of the bungalow and picks up
a beaker filled with a solution of gum from the guar plant. He adds
a bit of borax, ``commonly used as an insecticide,'' he says, ``but
in this mixture it acts as a cross-linker, weaving the chains of
sugar molecules into a sort of web.''
 &HT;    Suddenly, the liquid solidifies into a gelatinous mass. Nagyvary
takes it into his hands and begins pulling it like taffy.
 &HT;    ``We need an emulsifier, of course, to make it fluid enough to
work into the wood. I like to use ox bile myself.''
 &HT;    He also adds plenty of other ingredients, including quartz,
amber, gypsum, coral, zinc and powdered ruby and sapphire. By the
time he's ready to apply the mixture to the instruments he makes,
it has the consistency of mayonnaise.
 &HT;    The test, of course, is in the playing, and Nagyvary claims that
his lab tests show the sound patterns of his instruments match
those of the best Stradivariuses. Musicians who have tried
Nagyvary's creations agree that they have a lovely sound. Still, he
hasn't been able to get a concert star to make a public
endorsement.
 &HT;    Without big-name endorsements, Nagyvary has had to rely on
grants from the Texas government as well as his own earnings to
fund additional research.
 &HT;    His latest idea is the most controversial of all _ lifted from
the movie ``The Red Violin.''
 &HT;    ``I'm thinking of coloring my varnish with blood,'' he says with
a Count Dracula accent. ``But I won't use human blood. It doesn't
have enough DNA to polymerize properly. I think chicken blood will
be much better. I'll have to work on it.''

 &HT;    Most of the 600 PHANTOMs sold to date are used by sculptors and
engineers for companies such as Adidas, Disney, Hasbro, LEGO and
Honda, and users are ebullient. A mouse-driven CAD program works
adequately for designing squarish buildings, but try modeling a
titanium hip replacement or a snazzy new sneaker using only lines,
grids and circles.
 &HT;    ``To a sculptor, it really is a revolutionary development,''
says David R. Fish, who crafts clay footwear models for Nike and is
in the process of switching to PHANTOM-based prototyping.
 &HT;    Not only does the system emulate physical sculpting, it allows
techniques that are impossible in real clay, such as pushing out
from the inside. If an artist wants to sculpt a nose, she can click
the cursor ``off,'' push it inside the digital clay, click it
``on,'' and then pull material toward her.
 &HT;    Coupled with 3-D printers, which can manufacture plastic items
from a computer-specified form, objects sculpted in cyberspace can
become real at the touch of a button.
 &HT;    The $15,000 PHANTOM/FreeForm package is among the first haptic
applications on the market, but more ambitious systems are already
under development.
 &HT;    At the Medical College of Georgia and Georgia Technical
Institute, doctors and engineers have created an eye-surgery
simulator for training students. The digital scalpel feeds back
springy resistance as it touches the white of the digital eye; then
resistance lessens as the cyber-blade slices through.
 &HT;    Physical-skill training of all kinds is ``a huge application,''
says leading haptics researcher J. Kenneth Salisbury, who, while a
professor in MIT's mechanical engineering department, helped to
develop the PHANTOM with SensAble CEO Thomas Massie.
 &HT;    The haptics revolution is bolstering telerobotics, in which a
remote user, watching via video cameras, directs robotic arms
engaged in a task too dangerous, precise or inaccessible for naked
flesh. Telerobotics works a lot better with tactile feedback
indicating what the arms are doing.
 &HT;    Applications for such interactive devices include fighting
fires, exploring undersea or on other planets and handling
hazardous materials, but the most promising home may be surgery.
 &HT;    Already used for heart operations in the United States and
Germany, illion-dollar machines allow a surgeon to operate through
half-inch-wide incisions by manipulating thin robotic arms. The
minimally invasive procedure speeds patients' recovery and someday
may extend surgeons' careers by digitally canceling age-related
hand tremors.
 &HT;    ``Eventually such techniques will be applicable in neurosurgery
or fetal surgery,'' says Salisbury, now a professor in both the
departments of computer science and surgery at Stanford University.
 &HT;    In the long run, virtually every action that involves real-world
touch could be simulated or enhanced via haptic interfaces _ and
some human activities that have never been touchy-feely could
become so.
 &HT;    Someday, we may view haptic interfaces as just one more step we
took toward the computer-immersed human. The evolution began with
the first computers, as punch cards and then screens engaged the
sense of sight. Later, computers gained sound, then touch.
 &HT;    Today companies such as Digiscents, TriSenx and Aromajet are
laboring to bring smell and even taste to the digital realm.
 &HT;    The omega point is the day when the virtual world becomes as
real to humans as the outside, three-dimensional world, with one
important distinction. For good or ill, the virtual world's only
limitations will be the ones we choose.

 By MICHAEL D. LEMONICK 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    You don't hang out for long with Joseph Nagyvary before you're
faced with an uncomfortable thought: Is he a genius or a crank?
 &HT;    He certainly bears some of the telltale marks of crankdom. For
one thing, he's a monomaniac. Give him the slightest opening, and
he'll talk for hours about his research. Then, too, he's certain
that jealous enemies are conspiring to keep his discovery from
gaining the respect it deserves.
 &HT;    And as with most scientific cranks who claim to have solved a
big problem, Nagyvary is convinced he has solved an age-old riddle:
Why are violins made by Antonio Stradivari, the legendary
18th-century Cremonese instrument maker, so dramatically better
than anything built since?
 &HT;    Yet for all of Nagyvary's pretensions to crankdom, one fact
counteracts all appearances: He does make extraordinary violins,
violas and cellos.
 &HT;    Indeed, the instruments this biochemistry professor builds have
been purchased for as much as $15,000 apiece and reviewed favorably
by members of the Cleveland Quartet, Chicago Symphony and New York
Philharmonic. Yehudi Menuhin played one, on loan from Nagyvary, for
15 years.
 &HT;    Still, no one has ever found a satisfactory explanation for the
transcendently beautiful sounds that come from the violins made by
Stradivari and his Cremonese contemporaries Nicolo Amati and
Giuseppe Guarneri.
 &HT;    Instrument makers have patiently disassembled their violins and
replicated the measurements perfectly in new instruments, yet
failed to duplicate the magic.
 &HT;    Physicists have used lab equipment to analyze the vibrational
patterns of Stradivari front and back plates, which generate most
of a violin's sound, and had craftsmen carve new plates that
faithfully reproduce the patterns, all to no avail.
 &HT;    Chemists have cooked up elaborate recipes for the varnish that
coats and colors a violin's raw maple and spruce. Again, no luck.
 &HT;    Yet Nagyvary's theories suggest the chemists were closest to the
truth. It is the varnish, he says, along with the specially treated
spruce that makes Cremonese violins great. And neither had much to
do with Stradivari himself. The local lumberman just happened to
supply him with the ideal wood, and the local apothecary with the
perfect varnish.
 &HT;    ``Stradivari was a marvelous craftsman,'' Nagyvary observes,
``but the magnificent sound of his instruments is a lucky
accident.''
 &HT;    He and his colleagues at Texas A&AMP;M University have compiled an
extensive database from which they can tell a great violin from a
mediocre one. The test: the pattern of frequencies they see on
their computer screen.
 &HT;    ``It turns out that the violins acknowledged to be great by
expert listeners all look similar on the sound analyzer,'' Nagyvary
says. ``And the pattern almost exactly reproduces that of the human
voice.''
 &HT;    The 66-year-old biochemist also did extensive historical
research, which yielded a crucial clue. According to an account
written by the aristocratic patron of Joannes Baptista Guadagnini,
one of the last of the famed Cremonese violin makers, it was
important to use wood that had been dry-aged, with no extra
treatment. Nagyvary didn't buy it.
 &HT;    ``I think this may have been a deliberate deception,'' he says,
``in order to keep anyone from copying the great masters and
lowering the value of existing instruments.''
 &HT;    He learned that wood supplies were tightly controlled at the
time by government authorities in Venice: ``If you just went out
and cut wood from the forests, you could be thrown in jail.''
Instead, authorized woodcutters felled trees in the highlands and
dumped logs into rivers, where they were carried downstream to the
capital.
 &HT;    ``The Venetian navy got the best wood for building its ships,''
Nagyvary says. ``Only after bureaucrats had taken inventory and
assessed taxes could wood merchants buy their supplies _ and at
this point, the wood had been sitting in water for weeks or even
months at a time.''
 &HT;    Sure enough, Nagyvary says, when he took electron micrographs of
a handful of wood shavings from Cremonese instruments, residues of
bacteria and fungi showed up, just as you'd expect in wood that's
been sitting in water.
 &HT;    Using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Nagyvary also found the
slivers to contain unusually large amounts of minerals, including
potassium, sodium, aluminum, copper, iron and especially calcium
and magnesium.
 &HT;    Some of the minerals might have been drawn from the brackish
water in Venetian lagoons, but the rest, Nagyvary decided, were
most likely the result of deliberately treating the wood with
mineral solutions.
 &HT;    This was hardly a preposterous notion: Alchemy books _ the
chemistry texts of the day _ had plenty of recipes for mineral-rich
wood preservatives used by furniture makers to protect chairs and
tables against damage from insects and general rot.
 &HT;    So Nagyvary began soaking chunks of spruce and maple in various
brews of preservative chemicals. He knew, for example, that some
Swiss woodworkers soaked their lumber in solutions containing
bovine dung and urine. So he put up a sign above a tub in a men's
room in the biochemistry lab: ``Please contribute generously to
violin research.''
 &HT;    He kept experimenting with brines and in 1975 went to Cremona,
where he talked a violin maker there into building some instruments
with his treated wood. This raised the question of how to varnish
the finished instruments. As little as possible, say physicists who
study the vibrational qualities of wood: Varnish adds weight to a
violin, keeping it from vibrating to its full potential.
 &HT;    Nonsense, say many violin makers: Varnish is essential to the
beauty of a violin, and the secrets of varnish are jealously
guarded by professionals.
 &HT;    ``As a biochemist, though,'' Nagyvary says, ``you should have to
think about it for only a little while to realize they're both
right and both wrong. I'm annoyed that it took me a couple of years
to realize how important varnish can be.''
 &HT;    Many violin makers swear by oil-based varnishes _ and for those
craftsmen, he asserts, the instruments would be better off bare.
``First the oil penetrates deep into the wood. Then it dries and
becomes gummy. That dampens down the vibrations.''
 &HT;    On the most pristine surviving Stradivari instruments, by
contrast, the finish has a brittle, almost glassy look.
 &HT;    ``It's like a candy apple,'' says Nagyvary _ and, he believes,
with good reason. The apple's surface is hard and shiny because the
molecules that make up its sugar coating link up to form long,
interlocked chains. If Stradivari's varnish contained sugar or a
polysaccharide, the molecules would have attached to one another
and to the wood, stiffening it so it could vibrate more efficiently
_ precisely the opposite of what happens with oil.
 &HT;    Nagyvary found support for his belief in 16th-century documents
that noted that wood finishes frequently contained powdered glass,
porcelain or amber to add stiffness to the wood and make the finish
glitter like a gem, and that fruit-tree extracts were widely used
in wood varnishes.
 &HT;    ``This makes perfect sense,'' he says. ``The pectin creates
beautiful polymers. It's what makes jellies jell. Look at this.''
 &HT;    He heads into a lab at the far end of the bungalow and picks up
a beaker filled with a solution of gum from the guar plant. He adds
a bit of borax, ``commonly used as an insecticide,'' he says, ``but
in this mixture it acts as a cross-linker, weaving the chains of
sugar molecules into a sort of web.''
 &HT;    Suddenly, the liquid solidifies into a gelatinous mass. Nagyvary
takes it into his hands and begins pulling it like taffy.
 &HT;    ``We need an emulsifier, of course, to make it fluid enough to
work into the wood. I like to use ox bile myself.''
 &HT;    He also adds plenty of other ingredients, including quartz,
amber, gypsum, coral, zinc and powdered ruby and sapphire. By the
time he's ready to apply the mixture to the instruments he makes,
it has the consistency of mayonnaise.
 &HT;    The test, of course, is in the playing, and Nagyvary claims that
his lab tests show the sound patterns of his instruments match
those of the best Stradivariuses. Musicians who have tried
Nagyvary's creations agree that they have a lovely sound. Still, he
hasn't been able to get a concert star to make a public
endorsement.
 &HT;    Without big-name endorsements, Nagyvary has had to rely on
grants from the Texas government as well as his own earnings to
fund additional research.
 &HT;    His latest idea is the most controversial of all _ lifted from
the movie ``The Red Violin.''
 &HT;    ``I'm thinking of coloring my varnish with blood,'' he says with
a Count Dracula accent. ``But I won't use human blood. It doesn't
have enough DNA to polymerize properly. I think chicken blood will
be much better. I'll have to work on it.''

   LARS VON TRIER: PRINCE OF DARKNESS. From W magazine. One color
slide. By all accounts, the making of Lars Von Trier's latest
picture, the Palme d'Or-winning musical melodrama ``Dancer in the
Dark,'' was an excruciating experience. The story centers on Selma
(played by pop singer Bjork), a Czech immigrant living in the
Pacific Northwest in the late 1950s who is losing her sight due to
a hereditary disease. She works in a factory, saving up for an
operation that will protect her son from the same fate. But after a
friend betrays her and steals the money, the world caves in on her:
Selma winds up charged with murder. However, the real melodrama
took place off-camera between Von Trier and Bjork, who nearly quit
the film. (At one point, she reportedly climbed a fence to escape
the experience.) An interview with the controversial filmmaker.

   LARS VON TRIER: PRINCE OF DARKNESS. From W magazine. One color
slide. By all accounts, the making of Lars Von Trier's latest
picture, the Palme d'Or-winning musical melodrama ``Dancer in the
Dark,'' was an excruciating experience. The story centers on Selma
(played by pop singer Bjork), a Czech immigrant living in the
Pacific Northwest in the late 1950s who is losing her sight due to
a hereditary disease. She works in a factory, saving up for an
operation that will protect her son from the same fate. But after a
friend betrays her and steals the money, the world caves in on her:
Selma winds up charged with murder. However, the real melodrama
took place off-camera between Von Trier and Bjork, who nearly quit
the film. (At one point, she reportedly climbed a fence to escape
the experience.) An interview with the controversial filmmaker.

 By AARON GELL 
 (One color slide is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    He may be the enfant terrible of the international film circuit,
notorious for his unguarded remarks, his crusade to put
overindulgent filmmakers on a creative austerity program, his
crippling phobias and, most of all, for his films themselves _
brutal, beautiful, shattering tragedies that tend to leave
audiences either sobbing or cursing his name.
 &HT;    But today, sitting in an office at Zentropa, his sprawling
film-production facility housed in a former army base on the
outskirts of Copenhagen, Lars Von Trier is in good spirits.
 &HT;    The primary reason is out in the parking lot: a spiffy,
cherry-red Alfa Romeo Spider convertible.
 &HT;    ``Ah, doesn't it look new!'' Von Trier remarks. Moments later,
we're flying down a nearby expressway.
 &HT;    ``I won't go very fast,'' promises the director as he nudges the
car into fifth and fumbles with the stereo, adding, ``It's just ...
the acceleration is so very nice.''
 &HT;    Overhead, the sun suddenly pushes its way through a thick carpet
of Scandinavian clouds, and the Beach Boys' ``I Get Around'' drowns
out the hum of the engine. Von Trier is beaming.
 &HT;    Given his well-known political leanings (he used to belong to
the Danish Communist party), to say nothing of his long history of
severe panic attacks, the Alfa Romeo is a bit out of character.
It's actually on loan as some sort of promotional gesture by the
automaker, which is apparently harboring a true subversive in its
marketing department.
 &HT;    ``My first wife would never have allowed this car,'' Von Trier
says. ``But my new wife is very nice. She thinks having a sports
car is a basic human right.''
 &HT;    So does Von Trier, who cheerfully tosses the keys to anyone who
asks to take it for a spin.
 &HT;    Besides, the director has earned a little fun. By all accounts,
the making of his latest picture, the Palme d'Or-winning musical
melodrama ``Dancer in the Dark,'' was an excruciating experience.
 &HT;    Like 1996's ``Breaking the Waves,'' ``Dancer'' centers on a
dreamily naive, willfully self-sacrificing young woman. Selma, a
Czech immigrant living in the Pacific Northwest in the late 1950s,
is losing her sight due to a hereditary disease. She works in a
factory, saving up for an operation that will protect her son from
the same fate. But after a friend betrays her and steals the money,
the world caves in on her: Selma winds up charged with murder.
Meanwhile, she daydreams of movie musicals.
 &HT;    It's operatic stuff by any standard, but as most everyone knows
by now, the real melodrama took place off-camera between Von Trier
and his lead actress, the Icelandic pop star Bjork, who very nearly
quit the film.
 &HT;    (At one point, she reportedly climbed a fence to escape the
experience and tore at her costume in a frenzy.)
 &HT;    ``We had some difficulties collaborating,'' Von Trier says
slowly. Asked what the trouble was about, he says, ``It was just
that for her it was extremely tough to do it. She felt trapped and
claustrophobic and betrayed and whatever.'' He adds that since
Bjork, who composed the film's music, is accustomed to having total
creative freedom, serving his vision proved difficult.
 &HT;    ``Usually, she's in charge,'' he says. ``But if she's in my
story, I have to stop her all the time. That's direction, that's
where the word comes from, right? I'm pointing the direction, and
this is not very pleasant if you go right and I want to point
left.''
 &HT;    Although it was her first role, Von Trier says, Bjork
immediately took to his improvisational approach.
 &HT;    ``She was so extremely good at it,'' he says. ``I felt like a
lion tamer, and she was my best lion. She could do all kinds of
tricks if she wanted, but otherwise, rraaarrgh!''
 &HT;    It seems that Bjork, who declined to comment for this article,
came to associate Von Trier with a different sort of creature.
After the film wrapped, she gave cast and crew members little
animal figurines as gifts. The director got a rat.
 &HT;    Von Trier sighs. ``I'm sure I've been an asshole,'' he says,
``but I've also been extremely pressed, right? This was a very big
production for us. At a certain point, if she had walked out, we
would have been extremely bankrupt. And my four children would have
had to sleep outdoors. This is something that is not really
artistic to talk about, but it's a fact of life.''
 &HT;    The resulting film, which caused a sensation at Cannes and
earned the elfin singer the Best Actress award, is like nothing
ever seen before, a gorgeous musical fantasy crossed with an almost
medieval tale of exquisite suffering. Von Trier says that as with
``Breaking the Waves,'' his aim was to bring a sense of
authenticity to the unfashionable genre of melodrama.
 &HT;    ``My mother and father were Communists and cultural radicals,''
he explains, ``so they thought a story like this was the worst _
opium for the people. Since this was so forbidden when I was young
and people became so angry, I thought there had to be some good
qualities there.''
 &HT;    People still get angry around Von Trier. Detractors accuse him
of cheap sentimentality, even misogyny for the tortures he inflicts
on his female protagonists. He doesn't seem to mind a bit.
 &HT;    Since he regards it as the artist's role in society to, as he
says, ``take you by the hand and lead you somewhere you didn't want
to go on your own,'' a bit of resistance seems only natural.
 &HT;    ``I have tried to see how far I could go with this,'' he says
when asked about the misfortunes that inevitably befall his
heroines. ``It's a matter of taste if you think it works, but I
haven't yet reached the limit. I still don't know how bad it can
get.''
 &HT;    Let's just say that for Selma, it gets uncommonly bad.
 &HT;    ``When you want to work with melodrama, then you have to find
some tools,'' Von Trier says with a shrug. ``The first tool was the
mother and child. And then a handicap is good, very good.''
 &HT;    The director's devotion to easy sentimentality coincided, oddly
enough, with his holy war on behalf of cinematic truth. Among other
things, signatories to the highly publicized Dogma 95 ``Vow of
Chastity,'' which Von Trier composed with his friend Thomas
Vinterberg, agree to work on location with hand-held cameras and to
shun special lighting and effects.
 &HT;    While ``Dancer'' is not officially a Dogma film, it aims for
that same honesty. The film was shot mostly on hand-held video, and
the musical sequences were performed in full takes, captured by 100
stationary cameras.
 &HT;    While many observers viewed the Dogma manifesto as an
attention-getting prank _ particularly its repudiation of the
auteur theory as ``bourgeois romanticism from the very start and
thereby ... false!'' _ the fact is that Von Trier, a child of
permissive hippie-intellectual parents _ simply wanted a few rules.
Dogma may have 10 points, but for him, it's a 12-step program.
 &HT;    It seems to be working, too. His later work seems almost to have
been made by a different person than the tormented genius behind
the meticulously controlled ``Element of Crime,'' ``Epidemic'' and
``Zentropa.''
 &HT;    ``They were technically brilliant, but there was a coldness,''
says Stellan Skaarsgard, who appeared in ``Breaking the Waves'' and
``The Kingdom II'' as well as ``Dancer.'' ``There was no real life
in them. But then he totally changed his way of working. He's a
control freak, like all directors, but now he knows he can control
even chaos.''
 &HT;    Von Trier says he hasn't seen his early films in years. ``I'm
embarrassed about them, really embarrassed,'' he offers. ``The guy
who made them was just so young, so irritating. Now I feel more
mature.''
 &HT;    ``You know,'' he adds, ``even now when I see drawings I did when
I was 3 or 4, I think, `Oh, I should never have given that to my
mother, because this little flower down here is completely wrong
...''
 &HT;    The need for control has been a constant motif in his life _
``that ghost again,'' he calls it _ and it is at the root of the
director's psychological ailments: compulsive perfectionism, bouts
of agoraphobia and hypochondria and a terror of hospitals and
airplanes. (As a result of the latter, he'll be a no-show at the
New York Film Festival in September, although ``Dancer'' is being
honored with the opening-night slot.)
 &HT;    It is perhaps in light of these disorders that ``The Idiots,''
his controversial and critically misunderstood 1998 film about a
cultlike group of young Danes who pretend to be retarded, is best
viewed.
 &HT;    For Von Trier, mimicking the mentally handicapped is not about
ridicule but envy; it's a fantasy of liberation from his own
tyrannical superego.
 &HT;    ``I've been a nervous wreck all my life,'' he acknowledges. ``At
a certain point, I couldn't even leave my room.''
 &HT;    He had years of therapy, but he credits Prozac with taking the
edge off his neuroses. He also practices a form of meditation,
leading himself on what he calls ``shamanic journeys'' into a sort
of Jungian spirit world.
 &HT;    ``It's really fantastic,'' he says. ``You have this drum sound
on the stereo, and you imagine that you go into this animal world.
You discover a lot.''
 &HT;    On these travels, he takes on the guise of an animal. ``I'm an
otter,'' he says.
 &HT;    Sort of like an auteur?
 &HT;    ``Oh!'' he punches the steering wheel. ``An auteur otter! Great.
Thank you. I never thought of that, but now I can never face my
otter again.''
 &HT;    Thank goodness for Bjork's rat.

 &HT;    HARD CELL
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ When the fantasy thriller ``The Cell'' opened in
theaters recently, audiences will got another fashion statement out
of Jennifer Lopez.
 &HT;    This time, though, the actress traded in her Versaces for a
touch of ``Mad Max'' _ with the help of costume designer Eiko
Ishioka. Combining the outrageousness of the Paris couture with a
bit of quirky sci-fi futurism, Ishioka has turned ``The Cell'' into
a visual feast, with Lopez the inevitable muse.
 &HT;    ``I want to challenge the design vocabulary and weave it into
other aspects of film _ acting, lighting and directing,'' the
Japanese-born Ishioka says. ``Ninety percent of movie costumes are
based on reality or history. These were based on my imagination.''
 &HT;    On top of ``The Cell,'' Ishioka, who won an Oscar for her work
on ``Bram Stoker's Dracula,'' is coming out with a new book in
October. ``Eiko on Stage'' contains sketches and photographs of her
work for film, opera and the theater over the last 15 years.
Francis Ford Coppola, one of many admirers in Hollywood, wrote the
introduction.
 &HT;    ``I've been lucky to work with people who gave me creative
freedom,'' she says. ``Coppola is one of the few directors who
really adores design and its power. He is an ideal director for a
designer.''
 &HT;    Ishioka has equal praise for Tarsem Singh, who directed ``The
Cell,'' and the feeling is clearly mutual.
 &HT;    Upon meeting Ishioka for the first time, Singh, who had read her
first book, ``Eiko by Eiko,'' when he was still in art school, told
her, ``That was our bible and you were our goddess.'' So when ``The
Cell'' came around, he was prepared to give Ishioka complete
freedom to create a group of outlandish costumes for the film's
dream sequences.
 &HT;    ``In the movie's opening scene, I thought Jennifer should look
like a fairy tale,'' says Ishioka, who draped the star in a white
feather-trimmed gown. ``I liked the image of a bird in the middle
of a dry, golden desert. For her cape, I asked the research team
for feathers from all the white birds there were.''
 &HT;    ``Jennifer was very involved with her image in the film,''
Ishioka adds. In one scene, Lopez insisted that a Grecian peplum
dress be made with an open front. But occasionally the actress had
to sacrifice the comfort of standard-issue sex appeal.
 &HT;    ``When she becomes trapped by a serial killer,'' Ishioka
explains, ``she enters a world of torture and abuse _ she
essentially becomes a sex toy, so she had to look erotic and
uncomfortable at the same time. I gave her a sheer dress and a big
black-and-red wig and a bizarre hard collar made of plastic.
Jennifer asked me if I could make it more comfortable, but I said
`No, you're supposed to be tortured.'''
 &HT;    In another pivotal scene, Lopez wears a suit of molded leather
armor that Ishioka first sculpted in clay, then cast. ``Tarsem
didn't want to use typical metal. He wanted me to design something
erotic and special.''
 &HT;    Before working on ``The Cell,'' Ishioka, who moved to New York
in the mid-'80s, spent two years in Amsterdam designing costumes
for Wagner's Ring Cycle for the National Opera.
 &HT;    ``When Tarsem called me in Amsterdam, he said `The Cell'
costumes should be very operatic. I sent him a 60-page fax of
initial sketches.
 &HT;    ``Film costumes should be perfect from every angle,'' Ishioka
continues, ``because the camera shoots 360 degrees. In opera, the
audience watches from a distance so there doesn't need to be as
much detail _ but my Japanese heritage forces me to do it. If a
singer or actor is wearing a perfect costume, her spirit is rich
and beautiful. If not, she has no confidence.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SUITE DREAMS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    If you book yourself into Paris' latest hot hotel _ the newly
restored Meurice _ remember two secret numbers: 524 and 528. These
junior suites, nestled under the hotel's mansard roof, feature
dizzying views of Place Vendome and Montmartre and great bathrooms
with original stained-glass windows.
 &HT;    The oak-paneled dressing rooms are gigantic (there's space for
plenty of Vuitton trunks and Colette shopping bags) and feature
flattering golden lighting.
 &HT;    But if you're feeling as flush as the hotel's owner, the Sultan
of Brunei, reserve La Belle Etoile, the most expensive hotel suite
in all of Paris. The 3,000-square-foot complex includes a Belle
Epoque rooftop pavilion with a huge wraparound terrace. The views
alone may be worth the price of admission _ $8,400 a night.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MONUMENTAL HEADACHE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Giorgio Armani can't stand clutter _ whether it's on the runway
or in the piazza. The designer is lobbying to have a monument to
former Italian president and prime minister Sandro Pertini removed
from its home in the piazza next door to Milan's Grand Hotel,
because he thinks it's an eyesore.
 &HT;    Armani, who happens to be opening his Emporio Armani mega-store
in that same piazza in October, even has offered to foot the bill
for the transfer.
 &HT;    City officials are divided as to what to do; designer Gianfranco
Ferre is furious: ``Whether Giorgio likes it or not, that monument
is part of the city's cultural face,'' Ferre says. ``He only
noticed it now, because of the opening of the store.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BABY TALK
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Supermodel Stella Tennant has been in the family way _ in more
ways than one. The supermodel, who just gave birth to a daughter,
is designing a baby line for Burberry called Tennant &AMP; Son,
handmade in her Scottish hometown by her own friends.
 &HT;    The collection will hit Burberry's 57th Street store in New York
in September.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BATTLE ROYAL
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the old days, British monarchs used to behead errant nobles;
today, Queen Elizabeth just sues them.
 &HT;    The queen has filed suit against the Duke of Westminster,
Britain's wealthiest man, over a mineral-rich quarry in Wales.
 &HT;    The duke is keen to mine the quarry, but the Crown Estate
Commission is seeking a court writ to keep his minions from
trespassing on the land, which it contends belongs to the queen.
 &HT;    Let's hope the spat doesn't upset the delicate balance of royal
social life _ in the past, the duke has been a regular dinner guest
at Buckingham Palace.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Roll back the clock.
 &HT;    After a decade of sleek, silvery minimalism, juniors are looking
with fondness at late '70s-early '80s wear, with a special fondness
for anything ultra-sexy or anything ``Charlie's Angels.''
 &HT;    Color is still big news, but preferred hues are going more
earthy, deepening away from sunny turquoise and fuchsia into burnt
orange, rust, olives, wines and cognacs. And purple: Junior
manufacturers said they're planning a royal push of the color.
 &HT;    Here, a look.

 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Internet may be a great equalizer, but new research shows
that the rich are different from you and me when it comes to the
online world.
 &HT;    A new study by Forrester Research Inc. indicates millionaires
research and buy everything from clothing and jewelry to airline
tickets and groceries online.
 &HT;    For the report, ``The Millionaire Online,'' Forrester surveyed
more than 2,000 affluent households (those with investable assets
of $1 million or more, not including the value of their primary
home).
 &HT;    ``Retailers and manufacturers that target the affluent often
adopt a defensive tone about the Internet,'' said Ekaterina O.
Walsh, an analyst at Forrester. ``But our research uncovered four
oft-cited misconceptions about affluent consumers: That they don't
like technology, don't go online, don't shop online and don't use
the Internet to manage their finances.''
 &HT;    To begin, Walsh reports 56 percent of affluent households are
online vs. 43 percent of the general population.
 &HT;    The report states the affluent actually like technology more
than other consumers. Almost two-thirds of the affluent score as
optimists, according to a technology-optimism scale, vs. slightly
more than half of the non-affluent.
 &HT;    From fax machines to writable CD drives, the affluent own more
technology products than other consumers. Not only do two-thirds of
the affluent have a home PC, but the average affluent household
owns two.
 &HT;    Moreover, the survey also found that the millionaires' primary
reason for using a PC is to go online. Half of them have been going
online for at least three years, while only one-third of
non-affluent wired consumers have that much experience.
 &HT;    The study refutes the idea that millionaires don't shop online.
Millionaires are 16 percent more likely than other Internet users
to regularly research products online.
 &HT;    They are also more likely to follow through on their search.
Across a wide range of categories, the affluent score high on a
``buy to look'' ratio that measures research to purchase
follow-through. Overall, the affluent buy-to-look ratio is 21
percent higher than other Internet users, Walsh noted.
 &HT;    The study found 21 percent of affluent respondents purchased
clothing, compared with 15 percent of non-affluent buyers.
 &HT;    Millionaires are also more likely to buy in every product
category online, except for entertainment items such as music,
videos and games. They also power through the online
retail-adoption cycle faster, graduating from buying convenience
goods to research items and replenishment products earlier than
other consumers.
 &HT;    The report declares: ``Armed with deeper pockets and an affinity
for e-commerce, millionaires spend more on almost every type of
product online. They spent almost $150 more online during the 1999
winter holiday season than other buyers. This year, affluent
Internet buyers expect to spend $100 per month online, which is
double the spending planned by other Internet buyers.''
 &HT;    The affluent may spend more, but they don't overlook value. Like
other consumers, most affluent online shoppers (58 percent) are
value-focused buyers who seek good prices without sacrificing
quality.
 &HT;    The remaining 42 percent are convenience-focused buyers who
would pay extra to get their shopping done quickly and have it be
hassle-free. But even these convenience-focused buyers don't ignore
value.
 &HT;    Nine out of 10 respondents pay attention to shipping fees, and
43 percent are likely to visit price comparison sites such as
MySimon or CompareNet.
 &HT;    Compared with the non-affluent, millionaires are more
brand-conscious, states the report.
 &HT;    ``The wired affluent would prefer to buy a Baume &AMP; Mercier watch
if they could find it online,'' Walsh observes.
 &HT;    She notes that almost half say they seek specific brand names
for everything they buy versus less than a third of the
non-affluent.
 &HT;    Millionaires are a much sought-after market for a whole host of
companies, from luxury retailers and private banks to charities. To
effectively target them, the study says marketers must: &HT;    Master the online channel. Almost 60 percent of young consumers
are online, so the Internet must be at the core of any strategy to
target them. With Internet penetration among the affluent almost as
high, winning their allegiance requires synchronized offline and
online channels.
 &HT;    Avoid ``affluent portals.'' Although many will try, portals
aimed at millionaires will fail. Having investable assets beyond
seven figures is not enough of a common bond to drive site traffic.
Instead, seek the affluent at the myriad sites where they'll go in
pursuit for their other interests.
 &HT;    Use the affluent to test and launch new products. An affinity
for novelty, opinion leadership, brand-consciousness, and
value-focus make the affluent ideal candidates for examining and
fueling market trends.
 &HT;    Target emerging affluent consumers. These younger, high-income
non-affluent consumers share many key characteristics with the
affluent: a dominant career motivation, a passion for technology
and a high tolerance for investment risk. c.2000 Fairchild

 (One color slide is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    He may be the enfant terrible of the international film circuit,
notorious for his unguarded remarks, his crusade to put
overindulgent filmmakers on a creative austerity program, his
crippling phobias and, most of all, for his films themselves _
brutal, beautiful, shattering tragedies that tend to leave
audiences either sobbing or cursing his name.
 &HT;    But today, sitting in an office at Zentropa, his sprawling
film-production facility housed in a former army base on the
outskirts of Copenhagen, Lars Von Trier is in good spirits.
 &HT;    The primary reason is out in the parking lot: a spiffy,
cherry-red Alfa Romeo Spider convertible.
 &HT;    ``Ah, doesn't it look new!'' Von Trier remarks. Moments later,
we're flying down a nearby expressway.
 &HT;    ``I won't go very fast,'' promises the director as he nudges the
car into fifth and fumbles with the stereo, adding, ``It's just ...
the acceleration is so very nice.''
 &HT;    Overhead, the sun suddenly pushes its way through a thick carpet
of Scandinavian clouds, and the Beach Boys' ``I Get Around'' drowns
out the hum of the engine. Von Trier is beaming.
 &HT;    Given his well-known political leanings (he used to belong to
the Danish Communist party), to say nothing of his long history of
severe panic attacks, the Alfa Romeo is a bit out of character.
It's actually on loan as some sort of promotional gesture by the
automaker, which is apparently harboring a true subversive in its
marketing department.
 &HT;    ``My first wife would never have allowed this car,'' Von Trier
says. ``But my new wife is very nice. She thinks having a sports
car is a basic human right.''
 &HT;    So does Von Trier, who cheerfully tosses the keys to anyone who
asks to take it for a spin.
 &HT;    Besides, the director has earned a little fun. By all accounts,
the making of his latest picture, the Palme d'Or-winning musical
melodrama ``Dancer in the Dark,'' was an excruciating experience.
 &HT;    Like 1996's ``Breaking the Waves,'' ``Dancer'' centers on a
dreamily naive, willfully self-sacrificing young woman. Selma, a
Czech immigrant living in the Pacific Northwest in the late 1950s,
is losing her sight due to a hereditary disease. She works in a
factory, saving up for an operation that will protect her son from
the same fate. But after a friend betrays her and steals the money,
the world caves in on her: Selma winds up charged with murder.
Meanwhile, she daydreams of movie musicals.
 &HT;    It's operatic stuff by any standard, but as most everyone knows
by now, the real melodrama took place off-camera between Von Trier
and his lead actress, the Icelandic pop star Bjork, who very nearly
quit the film.
 &HT;    (At one point, she reportedly climbed a fence to escape the
experience and tore at her costume in a frenzy.)
 &HT;    ``We had some difficulties collaborating,'' Von Trier says
slowly. Asked what the trouble was about, he says, ``It was just
that for her it was extremely tough to do it. She felt trapped and
claustrophobic and betrayed and whatever.'' He adds that since
Bjork, who composed the film's music, is accustomed to having total
creative freedom, serving his vision proved difficult.
 &HT;    ``Usually, she's in charge,'' he says. ``But if she's in my
story, I have to stop her all the time. That's direction, that's
where the word comes from, right? I'm pointing the direction, and
this is not very pleasant if you go right and I want to point
left.''
 &HT;    Although it was her first role, Von Trier says, Bjork
immediately took to his improvisational approach.
 &HT;    ``She was so extremely good at it,'' he says. ``I felt like a
lion tamer, and she was my best lion. She could do all kinds of
tricks if she wanted, but otherwise, rraaarrgh!''
 &HT;    It seems that Bjork, who declined to comment for this article,
came to associate Von Trier with a different sort of creature.
After the film wrapped, she gave cast and crew members little
animal figurines as gifts. The director got a rat.
 &HT;    Von Trier sighs. ``I'm sure I've been an asshole,'' he says,
``but I've also been extremely pressed, right? This was a very big
production for us. At a certain point, if she had walked out, we
would have been extremely bankrupt. And my four children would have
had to sleep outdoors. This is something that is not really
artistic to talk about, but it's a fact of life.''
 &HT;    The resulting film, which caused a sensation at Cannes and
earned the elfin singer the Best Actress award, is like nothing
ever seen before, a gorgeous musical fantasy crossed with an almost
medieval tale of exquisite suffering. Von Trier says that as with
``Breaking the Waves,'' his aim was to bring a sense of
authenticity to the unfashionable genre of melodrama.
 &HT;    ``My mother and father were Communists and cultural radicals,''
he explains, ``so they thought a story like this was the worst _
opium for the people. Since this was so forbidden when I was young
and people became so angry, I thought there had to be some good
qualities there.''
 &HT;    People still get angry around Von Trier. Detractors accuse him
of cheap sentimentality, even misogyny for the tortures he inflicts
on his female protagonists. He doesn't seem to mind a bit.
 &HT;    Since he regards it as the artist's role in society to, as he
says, ``take you by the hand and lead you somewhere you didn't want
to go on your own,'' a bit of resistance seems only natural.
 &HT;    ``I have tried to see how far I could go with this,'' he says
when asked about the misfortunes that inevitably befall his
heroines. ``It's a matter of taste if you think it works, but I
haven't yet reached the limit. I still don't know how bad it can
get.''
 &HT;    Let's just say that for Selma, it gets uncommonly bad.
 &HT;    ``When you want to work with melodrama, then you have to find
some tools,'' Von Trier says with a shrug. ``The first tool was the
mother and child. And then a handicap is good, very good.''
 &HT;    The director's devotion to easy sentimentality coincided, oddly
enough, with his holy war on behalf of cinematic truth. Among other
things, signatories to the highly publicized Dogma 95 ``Vow of
Chastity,'' which Von Trier composed with his friend Thomas
Vinterberg, agree to work on location with hand-held cameras and to
shun special lighting and effects.
 &HT;    While ``Dancer'' is not officially a Dogma film, it aims for
that same honesty. The film was shot mostly on hand-held video, and
the musical sequences were performed in full takes, captured by 100
stationary cameras.
 &HT;    While many observers viewed the Dogma manifesto as an
attention-getting prank _ particularly its repudiation of the
auteur theory as ``bourgeois romanticism from the very start and
thereby ... false!'' _ the fact is that Von Trier, a child of
permissive hippie-intellectual parents _ simply wanted a few rules.
Dogma may have 10 points, but for him, it's a 12-step program.
 &HT;    It seems to be working, too. His later work seems almost to have
been made by a different person than the tormented genius behind
the meticulously controlled ``Element of Crime,'' ``Epidemic'' and
``Zentropa.''
 &HT;    ``They were technically brilliant, but there was a coldness,''
says Stellan Skaarsgard, who appeared in ``Breaking the Waves'' and
``The Kingdom II'' as well as ``Dancer.'' ``There was no real life
in them. But then he totally changed his way of working. He's a
control freak, like all directors, but now he knows he can control
even chaos.''
 &HT;    Von Trier says he hasn't seen his early films in years. ``I'm
embarrassed about them, really embarrassed,'' he offers. ``The guy
who made them was just so young, so irritating. Now I feel more
mature.''
 &HT;    ``You know,'' he adds, ``even now when I see drawings I did when
I was 3 or 4, I think, `Oh, I should never have given that to my
mother, because this little flower down here is completely wrong
...''
 &HT;    The need for control has been a constant motif in his life _
``that ghost again,'' he calls it _ and it is at the root of the
director's psychological ailments: compulsive perfectionism, bouts
of agoraphobia and hypochondria and a terror of hospitals and
airplanes. (As a result of the latter, he'll be a no-show at the
New York Film Festival in September, although ``Dancer'' is being
honored with the opening-night slot.)
 &HT;    It is perhaps in light of these disorders that ``The Idiots,''
his controversial and critically misunderstood 1998 film about a
cultlike group of young Danes who pretend to be retarded, is best
viewed.
 &HT;    For Von Trier, mimicking the mentally handicapped is not about
ridicule but envy; it's a fantasy of liberation from his own
tyrannical superego.
 &HT;    ``I've been a nervous wreck all my life,'' he acknowledges. ``At
a certain point, I couldn't even leave my room.''
 &HT;    He had years of therapy, but he credits Prozac with taking the
edge off his neuroses. He also practices a form of meditation,
leading himself on what he calls ``shamanic journeys'' into a sort
of Jungian spirit world.
 &HT;    ``It's really fantastic,'' he says. ``You have this drum sound
on the stereo, and you imagine that you go into this animal world.
You discover a lot.''
 &HT;    On these travels, he takes on the guise of an animal. ``I'm an
otter,'' he says.
 &HT;    Sort of like an auteur?
 &HT;    ``Oh!'' he punches the steering wheel. ``An auteur otter! Great.
Thank you. I never thought of that, but now I can never face my
otter again.''
 &HT;    Thank goodness for Bjork's rat.

 &HT;    HARD CELL
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ When the fantasy thriller ``The Cell'' opened in
theaters recently, audiences will got another fashion statement out
of Jennifer Lopez.
 &HT;    This time, though, the actress traded in her Versaces for a
touch of ``Mad Max'' _ with the help of costume designer Eiko
Ishioka. Combining the outrageousness of the Paris couture with a
bit of quirky sci-fi futurism, Ishioka has turned ``The Cell'' into
a visual feast, with Lopez the inevitable muse.
 &HT;    ``I want to challenge the design vocabulary and weave it into
other aspects of film _ acting, lighting and directing,'' the
Japanese-born Ishioka says. ``Ninety percent of movie costumes are
based on reality or history. These were based on my imagination.''
 &HT;    On top of ``The Cell,'' Ishioka, who won an Oscar for her work
on ``Bram Stoker's Dracula,'' is coming out with a new book in
October. ``Eiko on Stage'' contains sketches and photographs of her
work for film, opera and the theater over the last 15 years.
Francis Ford Coppola, one of many admirers in Hollywood, wrote the
introduction.
 &HT;    ``I've been lucky to work with people who gave me creative
freedom,'' she says. ``Coppola is one of the few directors who
really adores design and its power. He is an ideal director for a
designer.''
 &HT;    Ishioka has equal praise for Tarsem Singh, who directed ``The
Cell,'' and the feeling is clearly mutual.
 &HT;    Upon meeting Ishioka for the first time, Singh, who had read her
first book, ``Eiko by Eiko,'' when he was still in art school, told
her, ``That was our bible and you were our goddess.'' So when ``The
Cell'' came around, he was prepared to give Ishioka complete
freedom to create a group of outlandish costumes for the film's
dream sequences.
 &HT;    ``In the movie's opening scene, I thought Jennifer should look
like a fairy tale,'' says Ishioka, who draped the star in a white
feather-trimmed gown. ``I liked the image of a bird in the middle
of a dry, golden desert. For her cape, I asked the research team
for feathers from all the white birds there were.''
 &HT;    ``Jennifer was very involved with her image in the film,''
Ishioka adds. In one scene, Lopez insisted that a Grecian peplum
dress be made with an open front. But occasionally the actress had
to sacrifice the comfort of standard-issue sex appeal.
 &HT;    ``When she becomes trapped by a serial killer,'' Ishioka
explains, ``she enters a world of torture and abuse _ she
essentially becomes a sex toy, so she had to look erotic and
uncomfortable at the same time. I gave her a sheer dress and a big
black-and-red wig and a bizarre hard collar made of plastic.
Jennifer asked me if I could make it more comfortable, but I said
`No, you're supposed to be tortured.'''
 &HT;    In another pivotal scene, Lopez wears a suit of molded leather
armor that Ishioka first sculpted in clay, then cast. ``Tarsem
didn't want to use typical metal. He wanted me to design something
erotic and special.''
 &HT;    Before working on ``The Cell,'' Ishioka, who moved to New York
in the mid-'80s, spent two years in Amsterdam designing costumes
for Wagner's Ring Cycle for the National Opera.
 &HT;    ``When Tarsem called me in Amsterdam, he said `The Cell'
costumes should be very operatic. I sent him a 60-page fax of
initial sketches.
 &HT;    ``Film costumes should be perfect from every angle,'' Ishioka
continues, ``because the camera shoots 360 degrees. In opera, the
audience watches from a distance so there doesn't need to be as
much detail _ but my Japanese heritage forces me to do it. If a
singer or actor is wearing a perfect costume, her spirit is rich
and beautiful. If not, she has no confidence.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SUITE DREAMS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    If you book yourself into Paris' latest hot hotel _ the newly
restored Meurice _ remember two secret numbers: 524 and 528. These
junior suites, nestled under the hotel's mansard roof, feature
dizzying views of Place Vendome and Montmartre and great bathrooms
with original stained-glass windows.
 &HT;    The oak-paneled dressing rooms are gigantic (there's space for
plenty of Vuitton trunks and Colette shopping bags) and feature
flattering golden lighting.
 &HT;    But if you're feeling as flush as the hotel's owner, the Sultan
of Brunei, reserve La Belle Etoile, the most expensive hotel suite
in all of Paris. The 3,000-square-foot complex includes a Belle
Epoque rooftop pavilion with a huge wraparound terrace. The views
alone may be worth the price of admission _ $8,400 a night.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MONUMENTAL HEADACHE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Giorgio Armani can't stand clutter _ whether it's on the runway
or in the piazza. The designer is lobbying to have a monument to
former Italian president and prime minister Sandro Pertini removed
from its home in the piazza next door to Milan's Grand Hotel,
because he thinks it's an eyesore.
 &HT;    Armani, who happens to be opening his Emporio Armani mega-store
in that same piazza in October, even has offered to foot the bill
for the transfer.
 &HT;    City officials are divided as to what to do; designer Gianfranco
Ferre is furious: ``Whether Giorgio likes it or not, that monument
is part of the city's cultural face,'' Ferre says. ``He only
noticed it now, because of the opening of the store.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BABY TALK
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Supermodel Stella Tennant has been in the family way _ in more
ways than one. The supermodel, who just gave birth to a daughter,
is designing a baby line for Burberry called Tennant &AMP; Son,
handmade in her Scottish hometown by her own friends.
 &HT;    The collection will hit Burberry's 57th Street store in New York
in September.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BATTLE ROYAL
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In the old days, British monarchs used to behead errant nobles;
today, Queen Elizabeth just sues them.
 &HT;    The queen has filed suit against the Duke of Westminster,
Britain's wealthiest man, over a mineral-rich quarry in Wales.
 &HT;    The duke is keen to mine the quarry, but the Crown Estate
Commission is seeking a court writ to keep his minions from
trespassing on the land, which it contends belongs to the queen.
 &HT;    Let's hope the spat doesn't upset the delicate balance of royal
social life _ in the past, the duke has been a regular dinner guest
at Buckingham Palace.

WELCOME BACK, MR. McPRESIDENT 
 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My fear that President Clinton's return to ``private'' life will
not be a pretty thing was confirmed by a recent photo of the Chief
Executive gorging at a Michigan McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it was a regular thing of mine when I was a private
citizen, so maybe I'll do it some more now,'' said Clinton between
(or possibly during) bites of crispy chicken sandwich and French
fries washed down with a cup of Coke the size of a grain silo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, a
self-described ``big health food freak and a vegetarian devotee.''
How many Secret Service agents it took to wrestle Chelsea into this
temple of red meat was not made clear in the brief story carried by
Reuters, but one has to think that the scene in the limo beforehand
was not something out of ``Father Knows Best.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton has as much trouble becoming a ``normal'' private
citizen as he had being a ``normal'' president, we are in for a
rough ride.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Clinton has to realize is that he does not have
to make up for eight years of fast-food avoidance during his first
two weeks out of office. A bloated, 300-pound ex-president waddling
back and forth from McDonald's to Burger King will do little to
rehabilitate his image as a man of huge, uncontrollable appetites.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also needs to have some sympathy for the majority of
Americans who go to McDonald's not because they like the food but
because it is fast. Regular visits by Clinton, a phalanx of Secret
Service agents, handlers and media in tow, can only lead to slower
service and hard feelings. The average American can forgive Clinton
for his affair with Monica Lewinsky, but they have little patience
with someone who stands between them and their Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be-ex-president may also have trouble wrapping his
mind around the fact that he will be expected to pay for his food.
Presidents are not accustomed to paying for things themselves and
seldom carry any money. Clinton may want to refamiliarize himself
with the concept of ``cash,'' particularly the recently redesigned
$5, $10 and $20 bills. (Chelsea may want to buy him a wallet made
of plastic, cloth or some other non-animal substance.)
</P>
<P>
   If and when Clinton gets too fat to fit through the door of a
fast-food restaurant, he will be forced to order at the drive-thru,
something that presents its own set of problems. The cashier will
come on the intercom and ask, totally unbidden, if the ex-president
would like to order a ``value meal.'' It is also possible that the
cashier is asking the ex-president if he would like to order a
``fat blue seal,'' the fidelity of drive-thru intercoms being
somewhat less than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the president's experience with foreign leaders and their
multitude of languages will be put to the test. If Clinton, upon
arriving home, opens his bag and finds a quivering blob of seal
blubber instead of a Quarter-Pounder with cheese, he'll better
understand why his Camp David peace talks never panned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to be a (private) citizen again, I'm going to
have to start getting used to it,'' Clinton said while posing for
pictures behind the Michigan McDonald's counter with wife, Hillary,
and daughter Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   So will we, Mr. President. So will we.

   LOUD. FAST. BIG. More than any other rock band, Metallica
proudly embody these qualities, which describe not only the music
they play, but also their lifestyles. ``Danger around every
curve,'' says singer James Hetfield, his eyes wide with eagerness.
</P>
<P>
   On a late-July day, Metallica is the climactic band at a
festival called Rockfest (even the name is big), held at the
Chicago Motor Speedway. On the infield of the racing oval, where
cars usually speed through dangerous curves at 180 mph, Kid Rock
sings from a BIG 120-foot stage, to a BIG audience of more than
50,000 sun-streaked zealots. Hetfield sits in a backstage trailer _
which is actually vibrating because Kid Rock is playing so LOUD _
and explains his band's ardent opposition to Napster, the Web site
that allows 20 million users to swap entire CDs through their
computers, an act Metallica considers theft.
</P>
<P>
   Why have so many music fans embraced Napster? ``Because they're
lazy bastards and they want everything for free,'' Hetfield
wisecracks.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica have earned their superstardom. Hetfield, guitarist
Kirk Hammett, bassist Jason Newsted, each 37, and drummer Lars
Ulrich, 36, have sold 71 million records, and won five Grammys.
Their high-action video for ``I Disappear,'' from the ``Mission:
Impossible 2'' soundtrack, was nominated for five MTV Music Video
Awards, including Best Rock Video, with the ceremony set for
September 7.
</P>
<P>
   The LOUD and FAST bands that inspired Metallica are pretty
obscure _ unless you're familiar with thrash pioneers like Diamond
Head and Blitzkrieg _ but Metallica spread pure metal to the masses
by adding hints of melodic appeal and experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all the success and adoration, Hetfield is an uneasy
member of the rock establishment. A big-shouldered Californian, he
craves adventure: like a metal-head Huck Finn, he hunts, owns guns,
smokes cigars, rides a custom Harley and jet-skis.
</P>
<P>
   He loved filming the ``I Disappear'' video because he got to
drive a fast car ``without cops chasing me,'' while living out a
macho fantasy: ``I'm Steve McQueen in 'Bullitt,' dude.'' A tattoo
on his left shoulder reads ``Carpe diem baby,'' surrounded by
flames, in recognition of the August, 1992 show when a pyrotechnics
explosion ignited the left side of his body, requiring a year of
physical therapy. ``That tattoo reminds me, you are alive, take
advantage of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   To Hetfield, Metallica's assault on Napster _ they sued the Web
site for copyright infringement and racketeering, and Ulrich
testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 11 _ is
consistent with the band's contrarian energy.
</P>
<P>
   They've defied metal etiquette by writing ballads; they've
trimmed their unkempt hair into stylish male-model cuts; and they
recorded last year's ``S&AMP;M'' CD with a symphony orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been afraid to break the rules of the heavy-metal
school,'' he says. Hetfield offers another high-speed analogy:
``There's no rear-view mirror in the Metallica van.'' He's proud to
be an irritant, an outsider. ``That's the story of Metallica,
really, the story of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   SMART. CONTRARY. UNPREDICTABLE. When Metallica began in Los
Angeles, 19 years ago, ``We were very much the outcasts,'' says
Ulrich, backstage at the Chicago Speedway. ``The first year or so,
it was pretty lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   A proud Danish citizen, Ulrich moved to the U.S. to become a
professional tennis player _ his grandfather, uncle, and father
Torben all played Davis Cup tennis for Denmark. But Ulrich's love
of roaring rock prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   He met Hetfield through a newspaper ad in the spring of 1981,
and they began to play in a fast, heavy style much wilder than
L.A.'s reigning band, Van Halen. Adding to their sense of being
misfits, they felt like the only L.A. band without a sleek,
colorful look. ``The only look we had,'' Hetfield says with a manic
laugh, ``was ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   They moved to San Francisco and named themselves Metallica, so
there would be no doubt what kind of music they played. (Other
names they considered, Ulrich says, included Helldriver and Nixon.)
When they put a ballad, ``Fade To Black,'' on their second album
``Ride The Lightning,'' fans accused them of selling out, Hetfield
recalls. Before releasing ``Load'' in 1996, they cut their hair and
were accused of getting trendy, as though using hair gel was a
hard-rock sin.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Ulrich says, ``I realized that I really hated heavy
metal cliches.'' At times, he adds, when Metallica is ``not
thinking rationally,'' the band has even discussed changing its
name and abandoning the metal association.
</P>
<P>
   Still, through the years, Metallica became known as the smart
metal band. ``I hate it,'' Hetfield says of the reputation. ``I
like to NOT think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just him playing up,'' counters Ulrich. ``He's brighter
than he wants to cop to.'' Where Ulrich is an excitable spirit, so
colorful and animated he's nearly a cartoon, Hetfield swaggers and
broods. ``He's more comfortable the less people know about him, and
the more mysterious and aloof he can be,'' Ulrich says.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans identify intensely with Hetfield's lyrics, which are
mostly about struggle and alienation. Backstage, a fan from Brest,
France, who won a trip to Rockfest by writing an essay about his
brother's death in a car accident 14 years ago, anxiously waits to
meet the band. Metallica's music, he wrote, gives him comfort. He
once drove 35 hours to see them in Berlin. ``It's more than music
now,'' he says in French.
</P>
<P>
   Music was more than entertainment for Hetfield, too. The dark
lyrics, he explains, spring from ongoing anger about his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ulrich's warning, Hetfield cracks jokes and breaks into
accents. Though watchful, he's also surprisingly playful for a guy
whose three big themes are death, destruction and nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   In frank but matter-of-fact terms, he describes his childhood as
one long convulsion: his parents divorced when he was young, his
mother Cynthia died, and because his dad Virgil, a trucker, was
``nowhere to be found,'' Hetfield lived with his half-brother
David, who was 10 years older. Plus, he was raised as a Christian
Scientist, and the faith's opposition to doctors and medicine ``was
very alienating. It was just weird for me to have to leave health
class during school _ all the kids whispering about you and
thinking you're weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in elementary school, being a freak ain't cool.
Later on, maybe it is. So I'd run home and play music. Music became
my friend.'' Years later, Hetfield reconciled with his dad, who
died of cancer five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hetfield and his wife Francesca have two kids, daughter
Cali, 2, and son Castor, born in May. Ulrich, the other parent in
Metallica, has a 2-year-old son Myles with wife Skyler, an
emergency-room doctor (she previously dated actor Matt Damon, who
made her the model for Minnie Driver's character in ``Good Will
Hunting'').
</P>
<P>
   There's a growing sense of domesticity within the band. Ulrich
often takes his family over to Kid Rock's house, ``and he makes
dinner for us.'' Ulrich discloses a shocking secret about Rock, the
self-proclaimed American Bad Ass: ``He cooks a mean spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that's not cozy enough, Ulrich and Hetfield brought their
families together last spring, to have ``an Easter Egg hunt in the
Hetfield back garden.'' The drummer grimaces: the image is more
Martha Stewart than Metallica. ``It's like, people would puke.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Newsted wonders whether fatherhood will lead Hetfield to
write from ``a good, positive spot now, rather than his usual dark
spot,'' when Metallica begin recording new songs after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say, the dark spot has worked very well for me,''
Hetfield says with a chuckle. ``I'm absolutely happier as a person;
the kids are a whole new energy. But there's a dark spot you can't
wash off, either _ childhood is always fuel for writing. I've
learned how to go to the dark spot and come back now. I can visit
it. I used to just live in it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, Napster partisans continue to post frequent
attacks on Metallica; some are full of reason, others made mostly
of fury and childish curses.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the criticism accuses Metallica of being ``greedy
bastards,'' as Hetfield says, and trying to earn as much money as
possible by maximizing CD sales. ``No, I don't (expletive) need
more money,'' Ulrich replies hotly. ``I'm fine, thank you. Is it
possible it could be about something else?''
</P>
<P>
   Music, he argues, is a form of property, and ``property
shouldn't be free. We have a right to control what happens to it,
since we own it and pay for it.'' Yes, Metallica encourages fans to
trade homemade recordings of live concerts: ``Make it a part of
your life,``Hetfield says. ``It's a keepsake.''
</P>
<P>
   But they don't want their master studio recordings to be
available for free, any more than they'd want you taking their
cars, houses, or any other property without asking first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd stop being a Metallica fan because I won't give you
my music for free,'' Ulrich says, ``then (expletive) you, I don't
want you to be a Metallica fan.''
</P>
<P>
   By taking the lead in trying to shut down Napster, Metallica
have again leapt into the fire; heat is their favorite element.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kinda like arguing with people,'' admits Hetfield, who says
conflict ``keeps you on edge, keeps you alive.'' By now, he's used
to debating fans about Napster, sometimes fervently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This poor girl in Atlanta, I made her cry. And I ended up
hugging her. She felt money was evil,'' he says with a sneer.
``Well, why don't you go live in Canada, or some socialist country,
like Russia? We have a right to control what happens to our music,
since we own it. This is not a hobby for us. This is what we've
dedicated our lives to.''
</P>
<P>
   The reward for their drive and dedication comes a few hours
later. ``Chicago, let me hear you!'' Hetfield implores the crowd as
the set begins under a night sky. Okay, so sometimes Metallica
still use a heavy-metal cliche or two.
</P>
<P>
   But when they launch into ``Creeping Death,'' the fans try to
match the band roar for roar, enjoying the shared experience of
being rock 'n' roll freaks, savoring the thrill: LOUD. FAST. BIG.

craves adventure: like a metal-head Huck Finn, he hunts, owns guns,
smokes cigars, rides a custom Harley and jet-skis.
</P>
<P>
   He loved filming the ``I Disappear'' video becuse he got to
drive a fast car ``without cops chasing me,'' while living out a
macho fantasy: ``I'm Steve McQueen in 'Bullitt,' dude.'' A tattoo
on his left shoulder reads ``Carpe diem baby,'' surrounded by
flames, in recognition of the August, 1992 show when a pyrotechnics
explosion ignited the left side of his body, requiring a year of
physical therapy. ``That tattoo reminds me, you are alive, take
advantage of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   To Hetfield, Metallica's assault on Napster _ they sued the Web
site for copyright infringement and racketeering, and Ulrich
testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 11 _ is
consistent with the band's contrarian energy.
</P>
<P>
   They've defied metal etiquette by writing ballads; they've
trimmed their unkempt hair into stylish male-model cuts; and they
recorded last year's ``S&AMP;M'' CD with a symphony orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been afraid to break the rules of the heavy-metal
school,'' he says. Hetfield offers another high-speed analogy:
``There's no rear-view mirror in the Metallica van.'' He's proud to
be an irritant, an outsider. ``That's the story of Metallica,
really, the story of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   SMART. CONTRARY. UNPREDICTABLE. When Metallica began in Los
Angeles, 19 years ago, ``We were very much the outcasts,'' says
Ulrich, backstage at the Chicago Speedway. ``The first year or so,
it was pretty lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   A proud Danish citizen, Ulrich moved to the U.S. to become a
professional tennis player _ his grandfather, uncle, and father
Torben all played Davis Cup tennis for Denmark. But Ulrich's love
of roaring rock prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   He met Hetfield through a newspaper ad in the spring of 1981,
and they began to play in a fast, heavy style much wilder than
L.A.'s reigning band, Van Halen. Adding to their sense of being
misfits, they felt like the only L.A. band without a sleek,
colorful look. ``The only look we had,'' Hetfield says with a manic
laugh, ``was ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   They moved to San Francisco and named themselves Metallica, so
there would be no doubt what kind of music they played. (Other
names they considered, Ulrich says, included Helldriver and Nixon.)
When they put a ballad, ``Fade To Black,'' on their second album
``Ride The Lightning,'' fans accused them of selling out, Hetfield
recalls. Before releasing ``Load'' in 1996, they cut their hair and
were accused of getting trendy, as though using hair gel was a
hard-rock sin.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Ulrich says, ``I realized that I really hated heavy
metal cliches.'' At times, he adds, when Metallica is ``not
thinking rationally,'' the band has even discussed changing its
name and abandoning the metal association.
</P>
<P>
   Still, through the years, Metallica became known as the smart
metal band. ``I hate it,'' Hetfield says of the reputation. ``I
like to NOT think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just him playing up,'' counters Ulrich. ``He's brighter
than he wants to cop to.'' Where Ulrich is an excitable spirit, so
colorful and animated he's nearly a cartoon, Hetfield swaggers and
broods. ``He's more comfortable the less people know about him, and
the more mysterious and aloof he can be,'' Ulrich says.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans identify intensely with Hetfield's lyrics, which are
mostly about struggle and alienation. Backstage, a fan from Brest,
France, who won a trip to Rockfest by writing an essay about his
brother's death in a car accident 14 years ago, anxiously waits to
meet the band. Metallica's music, he wrote, gives him comfort. He
once drove 35 hours to see them in Berlin. ``It's more than music
now,'' he says in French.
</P>
<P>
   Music was more than entertainment for Hetfield, too. The dark
lyrics, he explains, spring from ongoing anger about his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ulrich's warning, Hetfield cracks jokes and breaks into
accents. Though watchful, he's also surprisingly playful for a guy
whose three big themes are death, destruction and nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   In frank but matter-of-fact terms, he describes his childhood as
one long convulsion: his parents divorced when he was young, his
mother Cynthia died, and because his dad Virgil, a trucker, was
``nowhere to be found,'' Hetfield lived with his half-brother
David, who was 10 years older. Plus, he was raised as a Christian
Scientist, and the faith's opposition to doctors and medicine ``was
very alienating. It was just weird for me to have to leave health
class during school _ all the kids whispering about you and
thinking you're weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in elementary school, being a freak ain't cool.
Later on, maybe it is. So I'd run home and play music. Music became
my friend.'' Years later, Hetfield reconciled with his dad, who
died of cancer five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hetfield and his wife Francesca have two kids, daughter
Cali, 2, and son Castor, born in May. Ulrich, the other parent in
Metallica, has a 2-year-old son Myles with wife Skyler, an
emergency-room doctor (she previously dated actor Matt Damon, who
made her the model for Minnie Driver's character in ``Good Will
Hunting'').
</P>
<P>
   There's a growing sense of domesticity within the band. Ulrich
often takes his family over to Kid Rock's house, ``and he makes
dinner for us.'' Ulrich discloses a shocking secret about Rock, the
self-proclaimed American Bad Ass: ``He cooks a mean spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that's not cozy enough, Ulrich and Hetfield brought their
families together last spring, to have ``an Easter Egg hunt in the
Hetfield back garden.'' The drummer grimaces: the image is more
Martha Stewart than Metallica. ``It's like, people would puke.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Newsted wonders whether fatherhood will lead Hetfield to
write from ``a good, positive spot now, rather than his usual dark
spot,'' when Metallica begin recording new songs after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say, the dark spot has worked very well for me,''
Hetfield says with a chuckle. ``I'm absolutely happier as a person;
the kids are a whole new energy. But there's a dark spot you can't
wash off, either _ childhood is always fuel for writing. I've
learned how to go to the dark spot and come back now. I can visit
it. I used to just live in it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, Napster partisans continue to post frequent
attacks on Metallica; some are full of reason, others made mostly
of fury and childish curses.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the criticism accuses Metallica of being ``greedy
bastards,'' as Hetfield says, and trying to earn as much money as
possible by maximizing CD sales. ``No, I don't (expletive) need
more money,'' Ulrich replies hotly. ``I'm fine, thank you. Is it
possible it could be about something else?''
</P>
<P>
   Music, he argues, is a form of property, and ``property
shouldn't be free. We have a right to control what happens to it,
since we own it and pay for it.'' Yes, Metallica encourages fans to
trade homemade recordings of live concerts: ``Make it a part of
your life,``Hetfield says. ``It's a keepsake.''
</P>
<P>
   But they don't want their master studio recordings to be
available for free, any more than they'd want you taking their
cars, houses, or any other property without asking first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd stop being a Metallica fan because I won't give you
my music for free,'' Ulrich says, ``then (expletive) you, I don't
want you to be a Metallica fan.''
</P>
<P>
   By taking the lead in trying to shut down Napster, Metallica
have again leapt into the fire; heat is their favorite element.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kinda like arguing with people,'' admits Hetfield, who says
conflict ``keeps you on edge, keeps you alive.'' By now, he's used
to debating fans about Napster, sometimes fervently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This poor girl in Atlanta, I made her cry. And I ended up
hugging her. She felt money was evil,'' he says with a sneer.
``Well, why don't you go live in Canada, or some socialist country,
like Russia? We have a right to control what happens to our music,
since we own it. This is not a hobby for us. This is what we've
dedicated our lives to.''
</P>
<P>
   The reward for their drive and dedication comes a few hours
later. ``Chicago, let me hear you!'' Hetfield implores the crowd as
the set begins under a night sky. Okay, so sometimes Metallica
still use a heavy-metal cliche or two.
</P>
<P>
   But when they launch into ``Creeping Death,'' the fans try to
match the band roar for roar, enjoying the shared experience of
being rock 'n' roll freaks, savoring the thrill: LOUD. FAST. BIG.

   LOUD. FAST. BIG. More than any other rock band, Metallica
proudly embody these qualities, which describe not only the music
they play, but also their lifestyles. ``Danger around every
curve,'' says singer James Hetfield, his eyes wide with eagerness.
</P>
<P>
   On a late-July day, Metallica is the climactic band at a
festival called Rockfest (even the name is big), held at the
Chicago Motor Speedway. On the infield of the racing oval, where
cars usually speed through dangerous curves at 180 mph, Kid Rock
sings from a BIG 120-foot stage, to a BIG audience of more than
50,000 sun-streaked zealots. Hetfield sits in a backstage trailer _
which is actually vibrating because Kid Rock is playing so LOUD _
and explains his band's ardent opposition to Napster, the Web site
that allows 20 million users to swap entire CDs through their
computers, an act Metallica considers theft.
</P>
<P>
   Why have so many music fans embraced Napster? ``Because they're
lazy bastards and they want everything for free,'' Hetfield
wisecracks.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica have earned their superstardom. Hetfield, guitarist
Kirk Hammett, bassist Jason Newsted, each 37, and drummer Lars
Ulrich, 36, have sold 71 million records, and won five Grammys.
Their high-action video for ``I Disappear,'' from the ``Mission:
Impossible 2'' soundtrack, was nominated for five MTV Music Video
Awards, including Best Rock Video, with the ceremony set for
September 7.
</P>
<P>
   The LOUD and FAST bands that inspired Metallica are pretty
obscure _ unless you're familiar with thrash pioneers like Diamond
Head and Blitzkrieg _ but Metallica spread pure metal to the masses
by adding hints of melodic appeal and experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all the success and adoration, Hetfield is an uneasy
member of the rock establishment. A big-shouldered Californian, he
craves adventure: like a metal-head Huck Finn, he hunts, owns guns,
smokes cigars, rides a custom Harley and jet-skis.
</P>
<P>
   He loved filming the ``I Disappear'' video because he got to
drive a fast car ``without cops chasing me,'' while living out a
macho fantasy: ``I'm Steve McQueen in 'Bullitt,' dude.'' A tattoo
on his left shoulder reads ``Carpe diem baby,'' surrounded by
flames, in recognition of the August, 1992 show when a pyrotechnics
explosion ignited the left side of his body, requiring a year of
physical therapy. ``That tattoo reminds me, you are alive, take
advantage of the day.''
</P>
<P>

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It happened while I was reading a short
interview in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin with Hironobu Sakaguchi, a
video game developer and budding feature film director.
</P>
<P>
   The creative force behind a $70 million, entirely
computer-generated film (``Final Fantasy: The Movie'') Sakaguchi
had just joked about how much easier it is to make a movie with
cyber actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes human actors can be very selfish and not listen to
the director and producer. But our actors are always willing to
work on time and take direction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sakaguchi, 38, was asked, ``What has been the most
difficult aspect technically of making this film?''
</P>
<P>
   He replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural human facial expressions. To have the skin and hair
move naturally like it does in reality. Also the way the clothes
wrinkle when people move. That is very, very hard to simulate
realistically. If you produced wrinkles by hand animation, it would
take probably 10 years. So we created our own software to
accomplish this.''
</P>
<P>
   For one incredible, glimpse-eternity nanosecond, I could ``see''
the collective energy, intellect and achievement of all human
existence. That which has come before us and that which is yet to
be.
</P>
<P>
   And what I saw looked really stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say I think Sakaguchi is stupid. Far from it. He
is one of God knows how many talented and imaginative young men and
women who spend their days and nights creating dazzling alternative
realities via computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sony deeply believes in Sakaguchi's vision; the media giant will
distribute the feature film adaptation of Sakaguchi's phenomenally
successful ``Final Fantasy'' video game series when it is released
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Alec Baldwin, James Woods and Donald Sutherland are among the
human actors who supply voices for the movie's real-looking but
computer-generated characters. Oscar-nominated screenwriter Al
``Apollo 13'' Reinert is on the script team.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, ``Final Fantasy: The Movie'' is a big damned
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But ... it's about those wrinkles in the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   And the facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   And the strands of hair.
</P>
<P>
   We already have millions and millions of actual people who can
easily smile, frown, express rage, surprise, confusion and lust.
Some of them can even do it convincingly in front of a movie
camera.
</P>
<P>
   And we have enough clothes in existence to cover _ what? _ maybe
the Western United States. They wrinkle at the slightest breeze.
</P>
<P>
   But in a Honolulu high-rise, in the labs of Square Co. Ltd., we
have hundreds of artists, craftspeople, technicians and cyber
engineers sweating blood. They are inventing new software, spending
$70 million to make the best computer-generated versions of real
people and wrinkled clothes they possibly can.
</P>
<P>
   What is wrong with this digitally enhanced picture?
</P>
<P>
   As someone who does not play video games and still surfs the
Internet on a big, slow, pre-World War II-board, I do not get it.
The only reason I know about ``Final Fantasy,'' Sakaguchi or the
wrinkles is because I read that they and he have seriously
influenced a Hollywood director named Andrew Nichol (``The Truman
Show'').
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by what he's seen from Square Co., and frustrated by a
fruitless search for a young actress to play the title role in his
new film, ``Simone,'' Nichol reportedly decided to cast a
computer-generated woman instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'' will ``play'' opposite Al Pacino and other human actors.
</P>
<P>
   Some 60 years ago, David O. Selznick experienced a similar
frustration. Despite combing the United States for more than a
year, he could not find the perfect actress to play Scarlett O'Hara
in ``Gone With The Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Despairing but locked into a shooting schedule, he began
production without his leading lady. Then, while filming the
``burning of Atlanta,'' Selznick saw his Scarlett _ behind the
cameras and lights, just another celebrity visitor to the set.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the beautiful (and British) Vivien Leigh would don the
bonnet and dress that a little stunt man wore during the chaotic
scene. Because computer technology had not yet been invented, the
wrinkles in the dress played themselves.

   DATONG, China _ The way Zhang Weilin sees it, as the Chinese
palate becomes more demanding and sophisticated, it's only a matter
of time before the dog meat industry takes off. With his 90 Saint
Bernards, he's counting on being at the forefront of the
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When China opens the dog meat market and dog breeding
industry, it will gradually become like raising cows and sheep,''
said the middle-aged Zhang. ``As people spend more and their
dietary habits change, industrialization of dog breeding will not
take as long as domestication of cows and sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows there's still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to start a new industry,'' he said. ``Breeding
dogs (for meat) has never been done on a large scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang oversees what he says is China's largest Saint Bernard
breeding center and the only one that is state-run. The famed
mountain rescue dog is mated with local dogs to produce mixed-breed
dogs that can then be sold for meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of the local dogs is they have a lot of lean
meat,'' said Zhang. ``The advantage of Saint Bernards is they're
big and grow fast and don't get sick.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Zhang's farm is only breeding dogs, not slaughtering
them. But he has plans to build what he says will be China's first
large-scale dog meat factory.
</P>
<P>
   After launching two years ago, the breeding center has become
one of the most profitable ventures of the state-owned Datong
Mining Bureau, the largest employer in this gritty city of 2
million about 160 miles west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   When the coal industry went into a slump a few years ago and
started running out of money to pay workers, the government ordered
certain sectors to find outside revenue streams. Zhang, and a few
other Datong Mining Bureau officials spent more than six months
exploring possibilities before settling on dog meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through market analysis and research, we discovered there was
a huge demand for dog meat,'' said Cui Liguo, a former coal
industry planner now in charge of managing the Saint Bernard
breeding center. ``There are a lot of consumers of dog meat and not
many breeders of dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to use Saint Bernards was also arrived at after
much scientific research, Cui and Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To develop this industry you need a good breed. The local
breeds are not good enough,'' said Zhang. ``Chinese scientists have
done a lot of comparative research. The Saint Bernard was their
first choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being large - male Saint Bernards can grow to
more than 200 pounds - they are also very fertile, adapt well to
various weather conditions and are easy to care for.
</P>
<P>
   At Zhang's farm, a pair of puppies _ one male, one female _
sells for $1,800 and has to be ordered months in advance. An adult
Saint Bernard, which is cross-bred with other dogs to produce meat
for consumption, goes for $3,600 to $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers include farmers and small businessmen who come from all
over China hoping to make some money on the side by breeding dogs.
They are drawn by ads boasting of a high rate of return: three
times as profitable as poultry and four times as profitable as
raising pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang said the breeding center earned back its initial
investment of $324,000 after just one year.
</P>
<P>
   They stress that Saint Bernards are not for eating. Gao
Yuanping, head of the mining bureau's forestry division, said he
knows dog lovers would howl in protest if it were thought Saint
Bernards were being killed.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights groups in Switzerland have tried to stop the sale
of Saint Bernards to Asian countries. But Cui said Swiss dogs are
too expensive anyway; most of their Saint Bernards come from Russia
and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   For American animal rights groups, however, the breed of the dog
is a secondary issue. ``Like pigs, cows and chickens, all dogs are
intelligent animals that deserve respect and not exploitation at
the hands of money-makers,'' said Cem Akin, a spokesman for the
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).
</P>
<P>
   He said PETA is currently focused on a similar situation in
Korea, site of soccer's World Cup in 2002. The group alleges that
it is a common practice in Korea to consume dog meat after first
beating, torturing and strangling the dog to increase its
adrenaline level. It is believed that this will make a man
consuming the meat more virile, Akin said.
</P>
<P>
   Gao knows Americans don't eat dog meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Americans, it's very strange,'' he said. ``Dog is man's
best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, he said he welcomes investors from the
United States or anywhere else to help them expand their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to like dogs,'' he said enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   Dog meat is thought to be nutritious and good to eat in the
winter because it heats up the body. Gao said every part of a dog
can be eaten except for the lungs. ``Heart of a wolf, lung of a
dog,'' is a Chinese insult meaning cruel and savage. Some
restaurants offer a full banquet of up to 100 different dishes made
from one dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dog skin tastes very good,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas American palates rarely venture beyond the staples,
Asians are far more adventurous diners, enjoying chicken feet, pig
brains and countless other dishes that would make Americans
squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Beijing and many other cities in China, dog meat is
not commonly eaten and is available only at a few restaurants. It
is more popular in the northeast, which has a large ethnic Korean
population, and Guangdong province in the south. More and more
urban Chinese with disposable income are also keeping dogs as pets.
</P>
<P>
   Cui, the general manager of the dog farm and once an avid
consumer of dog meat, said he has stopped eating dogs after working
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel affection for them,'' said Cui, who had never raised
dogs before his current job. ``Dogs have intelligence. They're not
like livestock. This is one of the reasons dog breeding has never
developed over these thousands of years. Dogs are smarter than
other animals and they have feelings. They can understand people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zhang, who has a German shepherd as a pet, sees no conflict
between raising dogs and eating them.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Although the dogs are not often let out to play on the large
grassy yard, Zhang, Cui and Gao all seem to enjoy them. Gao asks
workers to let two out so they can demonstrate to a visiting
reporter how dog breeding occurs.
</P>
<P>
   But after 10 minutes of commanding and nudging and physically
lifting of one dog on top of the other, the dog coupling was not to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just mated yesterday,'' Gao offered as an excuse for the
stud's poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Ends optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   To Zhang, cross-breeding Western and Chinese dogs is simply part
of the trend towards globalization. Just as foreign wheat has been
introduced on Chinese farms and foreign people are living all over
the country, he says, mixing foreign and Chinese dogs is a natural
result of opening up China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is getting smaller,'' he said with great
seriousness. ``Dogs can also get globally connected.''

   Still, in Beijing and many other cities in China, dog meat is
not commonly eaten and is available only at a few restaurants. It
is more popular in the northeast, which has a large ethnic Korean
population, and Guangdong province in the south. More and more
urban Chinese with disposable income are also keeping dogs as pets.
</P>
<P>
   Cui, the general manager of the dog farm and once an avid
consumer of dog meat, said he has stopped eating dogs after working
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel affection for them,'' said Cui, who had never raised
dogs before his current job. ``Dogs have intelligence. They're not
like livestock. This is one of the reasons dog breeding has never
developed over these thousands of years. Dogs are smarter than
other animals and they have feelings. They can understand people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zhangening up China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is getting smaller,'' he said with great
seriousness. ``Dogs can also get globally connected.''

UNSHADED UNPROVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Saturday's Travers Stakes at Saratoga shedding little light
on the 3-year-old situation, never has the old saying ``champions
are made in the fall'' seemed truer.
</P>
<P>
   Unshaded, a moody gelding, was the deserving winner of the
Midsummer Derby, authoring a determined charge to prevail by a
head. However, Unshaded's chances of future success are shaky. He's
a bad actor, and that's going to be a problem for him as he assumes
a bigger role in the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an ordinary horse,'' said his rider, Shane Sellers.
``He's a difficult horse to ride and he has a bad attitude. You
just have to keep nudging him along, and when he says `no,' you
have to go with him. Sometimes, you have to tell yourself to wait
just a couple of strides longer. He's not much of a fighter when he
gets head-and-head. He has a tendency to wait, and I have to live
by the decisions I make on him. I'm very fit, but he took all of
the energy out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Carl Nafzger, whose ultimate goal is to get Unshaded to
the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs Nov. 4, knows that his
charge has a long way to go before he can be considered a contender
for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice division of horses,'' said Nafzger. ``Unshaded has
got to step up to win an Eclispe. He has to go on, and keep
winning. If he does that, he'll be 3-year-old champion. But we
won't know until we get to our ultimate destination. The bottom
line is, assuming he runs, we have to beat Fusaichi Pegasus.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus won the Kentucky Derby and ran second in the
Preakness, but has not raced sinced. Syndicated to stud for $70
million, he had his first workout in three months last Thursday,
going 3 furlongs in :39 2/5 at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just cruising,'' said his trainer, Neil Drysdale.
``He's carrying a bit more weight, and is stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, who is aiming Fusaichi Pegasus at the Classic, has
still not said when the colt will start next. However, he is
planning a New York campaign. Assuming that Belmont Park officials
can't write an allowance race for him (for lack of competition),
Fusaichi Pegasus could appear in the $150,000 Jerome Handicap, at 1
mile for 3-year-olds only, on Sept. 23. That would set him up for
the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup, at 1 1/4 miles, weight-for-age
against older horses, Oct. 14.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Drysdale wants to throw Fusaichi Pegasus right in
with the bears, he could try the $500,000 Woodward, at 1 1/8 miles,
weight-for-age, Sept. 16. Waiting for him there would be Lemon Drop
Kid, winner of three stright stakes and the leader of the handicap
division. It may be that the last thing the Fusaichi Pegasus camp
wants is to see the $70 million colt get trounced in a comeback
bid, so the Woodward seems questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens with Fusaichi Pegasus, Unshaded has given
himself a chance to go to the head of the class. Sellers, who can
be openly critical of the gelding, is also one of his biggest
backers, and Sellers thinks he has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unshaded just gets better and better with every race,'' said
Sellers. ``He was at his best for the Travers. This horse has grown
by leaps and bounds since the Belmont (finished third despite the
heat). He used to get nervous and wash himself out. But he's been
much more calm. He's a real good horse. He's run nine times and
only been out of the money once (9-4-1-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a case for just about everybody regarding the
3-year-old division. Right now, Unshaded is good and the rest are
not. He's really coming into his own. If it weren't for the heat
exhaustion, he might even have won the Belmont.''

   Racing at Northampton, the only fair in Massachusetts to host a
meeting, begins Friday. There will be 10 days of action, spanning
three weekends: Sept. 1-4, 8-10, and 15-17. Racing secretary Tom
Creel reports that the response from horsemen has been positive,
and the track opened for training Monday . . . Scheduled to run at
Northampton is Zippy Chippy, a 9-year-old gelding who hasn't won a
race in 86 attempts, which is believed to be a record. Zippy Chippy
recently lost a match race against a minor league baseball player
for the Rochester Red Wings. The ballplayer had a 20-yard head
start in the 40-yard race and won by 3-4 lengths . . . Space
Shuttle, a top-quality pacer, lived up to his billing at
Plainridge, winning Saturday's Beckwith Memorial in the
record-shattering time of 1:49 3/5. ``Space Shuttle is an amazing
little horse,'' said driver Walter Case Jr. ``He has two or three
gears when he is asked.'' The former record at Plainridge, which is
a 5/8-mile oval, was 1:52 3/5 set by Color Me Best in last year's
Beckwith. The supporting feature, the $20,000 Pasquantonio Memorial
Trot, was won by Ringside Rocket, driven by Case. Ringside Rocket
went in 1:54 2/5, also setting a record. The trotting mark at
Plainridge was 1:56, set by American Winter earlier this year.

   Short story
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More Than Ready, once considered a bright Kentucky Derby
prospect, was finally allowed to do what he does best, which is
sprint. What resulted was a powerful victory in the $200,000 King's
Bishop at The Spa Saturday. The King's Bishop is the only Grade I
sprint restricted to sophomores, and Valiant Halory, owned by the
Celtic Pride Stable of Rick Pitino, picked up a nice credential by
finishing second. It is really very simple with More Than Ready. He
has run 14 times, and is 7 for 7 under a mile, 0 for 7 at or over
that distance. The King's Bishop, run at 7 furlongs, was perfect
for him, as he stalked the speed, then ran by the leaders under Pat
Day to score with ease in the time of 1:22 2/5. ``We always knew
that this was Plan B,'' said his trainer, Todd Pletcher. ``If he
couldn't stretch out, he could go back to sprinting. We thought it
was so important to get a Grade I on More Than Ready's resume
(which includes a fourth in the Derby, a second in the Blue Grass,
and a fourth in the Haskell). If ever there was a horse deserving
of a Grade I win, it's him. Maybe the Vosburgh (7 furlongs at
Belmont Sept. 23) and the Breeders' Cup Sprint (6 furlongs) will be
next.''

WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING ATTENTION, PETA IS TOPS

 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps no organization in the United States this side of the
American Nazi Party invites as much media derision as PETA, or
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Often the mocking is deserved. Come on, if your organization is
dumping four tons of manure in front of the Wilshire Grand Hotel in
Los Angeles, asking the Green Bay Packers to change the team name
because it glorifies meat packing, protesting the consumption of
rats by the human contestants on ``Survivor'' and campaigning to
save a rare blue lobster in a real-life scene straight out of that
infamous skit on ``Saturday Night Live,'' you know you're going to
be razzed by a largely meat-eating media.
</P>
<P>
   Members of PETA are also not above dressing up in funny animal
costumes to punch home their point and provide an easy photo-op;
for example, the PETA pranksters who dumped that manure in L.A.
were dressed as pigs at the time.
</P>
<P>
   So for material-starved columnists and commentators, PETA is a
perennial duck in a barrel, just begging to be shot. (Ooh,
unfortunate imagery!)
</P>
<P>
   PETA is also unafraid to tip over sacred cows _ so to speak _ in
the name of the greater good as they see it, e.g., their billboards
using Biblical references to hammer home a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus Was A Vegetarian,'' reads a huge sign in Corpus Cristi,
Texas. ``Show Respect for God's Creatures _ Follow Him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another PETA billboard proclaims, ``Thou Shall Not Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   (I seem to remember something about an Old Testament story about
a Passover rite involving the slaughter of a one-year-old animal
and a New Testament parable of a father who celebrated the return
of his prodigal son by killing a fatted calf, but my aim today is
not to argue with PETA, not really.)
</P>
<P>
   Also recently, PETA celebrated a victory of sorts when
McDonald's agreed to no longer purchase chicken products from
suppliers that debeak chickens or withhold food and water as a
method of increasing egg production.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these suppliers will still be cutting the heads off
said chickens, but as PETA president Ingrid Newkirk put it on the
day of the announcement, ``Today is a better day than yesterday for
the birds whose eggs are used in Egg McMuffins.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Wisconsinites were outraged by billboards that
went up depicting New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani wearing a milk
mustache, the caption reading, ``Got prostate cancer?'' In this
case PETA was not-so-subtly insinuating that Giuliani's medical
problem could have been caused by the consumption of dairy
products, which may increase the risk for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Bing! Instant controversy. Giuliani threatened to file a
lawsuit, the company that put up the billboards started to take
them down and people were debating the merits of milk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's something in the aforementioned stories that would
offend or outrage just about everyone who's not a charter member of
PETA _ but that's my point. Say what you will about PETA's
extremist tactics and sometimes nutty causes, but you have to tip
your hat to this group.
</P>
<P>
   They're good at what they do. They're really good.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1980, there was no PETA. Now they claim 600,000 members
and they have had an indisputable impact on billion-dollar
corporations as well as the personal philosophies of countless
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Larger organizations wish they could generate the kind of
publicity PETA creates every week. There have been 634 major media
mentions of PETA in the last 60 days, according to a Lexis/Nexis
search.
</P>
<P>
   We in the press go for it every time _ and how can we not, when
Tyra Banks is posing half-nude for one of those ``I'd Rather Go
Naked Than Wear Fur'' ad campaigns or Jackie Chan is urging the
prime minister of India to stop torturing cattle or there's a
campaign in Las Vegas to retire Gilda, a 42-year-old elephant used
in Siegfried and Roy's act? That's golden stuff.
</P>
<P>
   As for invoking the word of God, exploiting Giuliani's cancer,
sending out Ronald McDonald-looking dolls covered in butcher's
blood, etc., of course it's despicable and disgusting _ that's the
idea. If these tactics didn't provoke a reaction from the masses
and the media, PETA would resort to something else.
</P>
<P>
   But why change when you're ringing up the media mentions? PETA
is so well-known that it's even become the subject of a new urban
legend, in the form of a bogus letter that claims the Dixie Chicks
are donating $1 of every concert ticket sold to the organization,
even as the group tours cattle country. (Actually, the Dixie Chicks
donate a buck from each ticket sale to the World Wildlife Fund.)
</P>
<P>
   I still think a good many of PETA's crusades range from the
inane to the obscene, but when it comes to attracting our
attention, nobody does it better.

BIG-TIME REMATCH FOR THE US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the US men's team met Guatemala in a World Cup qualifier at
RFK Stadium four years ago, it marked a breakthrough in interest in
the national team. Previously, such games were held at small stadia
in Fenton, Mo., or Torrance, Calif., but expectations changed after
a crowd of 30,082 arrived in Washington Nov. 3, 1996, to set a
domestic record for a qualifying match.
</P>
<P>
   US Soccer Federation officials will be taking a more ambitious
approach to Sunday's rematch with the Guatemalans at RFK. More than
50,000 tickets have been sold, marking the first of three
successive sellouts involving US national team games over the next
five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 22,500 lower-level seats went to US fans, in an
attempt to create a concentrated support group. This appears to be
a good idea, since at least half the stadium will be pro-Guatemala,
including several busloads scheduled to depart from Boston, though
low-level seats are the most vulnerable in what could be a rowdy
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the US team must match the sophistication of the '96 team.
</P>
<P>
   Though the US did not give many inspiring performances during
qualifiers for France '98, and had a disastrous showing in the
finals, the players had experience in difficult matches. The US
struggled against Guatemala in '96, but after Eric Wynalda's goal
provided the lead, the team tactically protected it _ unlike last
month, when the current squad squandered the edge in Mazatenango.
</P>
<P>
   A US victory over Guatemala would virtually assure the team of
advancing to the final round.
</P>
<P>
   The other five teams to advance from the region _ likely Costa
Rica, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Trinidad &AMP; Tobago _also could be
determined by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The US could be vulnerable, since the Chicago Fire's Chris Armas
will miss the match with a knee injury suffered during a 7-0 win
over Barbados at Foxboro Stadium Aug. 16. Richie Williams (D.C.
United) will likely replace Armas. Goalkeeper Kasey Keller (Rayo
Vallecano), forward Jovan Kirovski (Sporting Lisbon), and
midfielder Richard Mulrooney (San Jose Earthquakes) are the other
additions to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cunningham, the Columbus Crew striker who was born in
Jamaica and moved to Florida as a teenager, had been expected to
join the team soon, but his application for US citizenship is far
from being processed. As of last week, Cunningham was still filling
out papers. Cunningham, 24, would provide the one-on-one threat the
US team is lacking.
</P>
<P>
   The starting strike combination of Brian McBride and Joe-Max
Moore seems sufficient, but Cunningham could provide a dynamic
threat off the bench and give the US the variety it will need as
the qualifying tournament progresses.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast
</P>
<P>
   The debut of Cameroon-born Jan-Christian Tchuise with the
Russian national team has been delayed. The Russians begin
Japan/Korea 2002 qualifying against Switzerland Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tchuise, who plays for Spartak Moscow, would be the first black
player in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tchuise has applied for Russian citizenship but has not been
granted it,'' said Alexander Polinsky, the team's general manager.
``Not yet, anyway. We had only applied for him a few weeks ago but
I don't know how long it is going to take. He may never get it now,
because people are beginning to question our choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tchuise case is an example of the changes in ethnic
diversity in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Germany coach Rudi Voeller recalled the Brazilian-born forward
Paulo Roberto Rink for the match against Greece.
</P>
<P>
   John Carew, 19, son of an African father and a Norwegian mother,
was expected to become Norway's goal-scoring star, though he has
been dropped for the match against Armenia. Carew, a former
teammate of Tampa Bay's Mamadou Diallo at Valerenga, has become
controversial and coach Nils Johan Semb apparently wants him to
settle in at Valencia in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Best-kept secret
</P>
<P>
   The most undervalued player in Europe might be Mario Almeida
Jardel, the Brazilian striker whose goals gave Galatasaray a 2-1
victory over Real Madrid in the Super Cup last Friday in Monaco.
Jardel, 26, was purchased by the Turkish club for about $16 million
from Porto.
</P>
<P>
   In four seasons with Porto, Jardel scored 166 goals in 170 games
and led the league in scoring four times. That total includes 19
goals in 32 Champions League matches. In his first five games with
Galatasaray, Jardel scored 10 times, including the golden goal in
the 102d minute against Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Jardel is not a high-level technical player, nor does he expend
much effort chasing the opposing. Rather, Jardel is a classic
scorer, tall and strong in the air and with excellent instincts
near the goal. He has appeared briefly with the Brazilian national
team, but does not appear to fit in because of his skill level.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Jardel fit in with the European establishment. When
Jardel became available, Galatasaray was the only European club to
seriously pursue him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jardel appears capable of providing the extra spark to lift
the Istanbul club. Galatasaray became the first Turkish team to win
a European competition when it captured the UEFA Cup title last
season. Management kept most of the team together, then hired
Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu to ensure the continuity of star
midfielder Gheorghe Hagi and defender Gheorghe Popescu.

THE MAN DID IT HIS WAY: RAP RECALLS A SWAGGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On ``Pullin' Me In,'' a cut from his new CD, ``The Ecleftic: 2
Sides II a Book,'' Wyclef Jean denounces the state of rap music
where, ``All y'all beats are soundin' the same, y'all rhymin' the
same, some of y'all even wearing the same jewelry, and y'all doin'
the same videos.''
</P>
<P>
   He has returned, he says, to bring the music ``right back to the
essence,'' then intones:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(lyrics style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by gangstas
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how they got here
</P>
<P>
   But I feel like the Haitian Frank Sinatra
</P>
<P>
   In his young years
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end lyrics style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian Frank Sinatra? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   In comparing himself to Sinatra, Wyclef seeks to distinguish
himself from the raggedy rap rabble. He's a cut above the rest, the
wise man among fools, the real deal among the poseurs playing their
stupid gangsta games. In a single line, Wyclef discovers what many
rappers have come to understand _ Frank Sinatra was a O.G., the
original Original Gangsta. Forget all this big pimpin' nonsense.
Brothers who know better want to be the Chairman of the Board.
</P>
<P>
   Given his beliefs about about rock 'n' roll _ he thought it
indecipherable noise for cretins and called it ``deplorable, a
rancid-smelling aphrodisiac'' _ one can only wonder what Sinatra
might have had to say about Nelly's ``Country Grammar'' or Eminem's
``The Way I Am.'' But whatever his view of rap, Sinatra, more than
two years after his death at age 82, is the new icon of cool in the
hip-hop nation. His name is evoked without explanation because
everyone, even those who wouldn't know ``Mama Will Bark'' from
``One for My Baby,'' understands that Sinatra was The Man. And it
has little to do with Sinatra, the voice of the 20th century. This
is about the Sinatra who lived by his own code, who made his own
rules, and who answered to no one.You can't get more hip-hop than
that.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't hurt either that Sinatra could raise hell at the
drop of the hat, had run-ins with the law, and was mythologized as
Johnny Fontaine in ``The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all like an inversion of Norman Mailer's ``White Negro,''
which launched the notion of blackness as the model that cool
whites sought to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Kool Keith notwithstanding, you won't hear too many black men
comparing themselves to Elvis Presley. But being down with Sinatra
is all the rage, because Sinatra did the things most rappers can
only rhyme about.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Sinatra was, to borrow a phrase coined by writer
Cheo Hodari Coker, ``a white mack,'' the ultimate playa who hung
with presidents, starlets and mobsters, and who lived at the heady
core of hipness. He cared about the cut of his suits, the cock of
his hat, and the ``cuff links'' _ that would be a pair of women _
on his arms. He was a street kid from a tough neighborhood who,
with a well of style, swagger and talent, rose out of his humble
surroundings. In his prime, he didn't just have the world on a
string; he created one of his own that everyone else clamored to be
a part of.
</P>
<P>
   And before the Busta Rhyme's Flipmode Squad, or Wyclef's Refugee
Camp, Sinatra was the undisputed leader of pop culture's first
posse _ The Rat Pack. Sinatra lived his life, and showed everyone
else how it was done.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Sean ``Puffy'' Combs loves to call himself ``the
black Sinatra,'' which instantly lends him a certain cachet he
couldn't get any other way. He's gone to great pains to create his
own Sinatra-like universe, aligning himself with such people as
Martha Stewart and Donald Trump, and hosting mega-parties costing
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In a GQ cover story last year, Puff even said a special room in
his midtown Manhattan recording studio was designed with the Rat
Pack in mind. With its low-slung furniture and wet bars, ``the
whole concept of it was Black Sinatra,'' he said. ``Like if Frank
Sinatra was black, and he was my age, and he was me, (this is the)
kind of hangout he would have for Dean and Sammy and the guys to
come see him at the studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Puff has probably seen himself as the heir apparent since he met
Sinatra's daughter Nancy at the American Music Awards a few years
ago. Recalled Puff, ``When she was onstage accepting her father's
award, she said, `The only daddy cooler than my daddy is Puff
Daddy.' That was enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Puff. If only.
</P>
<P>
   What Puff doesn't understand is Sinatra didn't have to play at
cool _ he just was. Through his life, Sinatra represented what's
been called ``a high-flying ultimate guyness.'' And in the
uber-masculine world of rap, there is no greater currency than the
realness _ the unabashed maleness _ Sinatra embodied.
</P>
<P>
   In his storied life, Sinatra was called The Voice, the Chairman
of the Board, and Ol'Blue Eyes. Now, in death, Sinatra has become
something even he could never have imagined _ ghetto-fabulous.

FOR MENTALLY ILL IN N.Y., JAIL MEANS CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the hours when even New York City sleeps, buses
roll onto a seedy block on the Queens side of the 59th Street
Bridge, where the only signs of life are a dozen prostitutes, the
gang members who run them, a doughnut shop hang-out, a bodega with
bullet-proof windows, and a strip-joint with brawny bouncers.
</P>
<P>
   The buses arrive every hour of the pre-dawn funk between 2 and 6
A.M. They come from Rikers Island, the city-run compound that
houses the biggest jail in the country. And they are carrying
just-released prisoners to their first concrete slab of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them have nothing more than what the guards handed them
on the way out the door _ a card worth two rides on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   For some, that's enough to get where they're going. But others
have nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the passengers have some form of mental illness. While
at Rikers, they received psychiatric care and medicine. On release,
though, with very few exceptions, they too are given nothing but
the subway card: no drugs, prescriptions, or referrals.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the bus stop in Queens has long been the revolving
door between a turbulent life on the streets and the relative
respite of jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of these guys over and over,'' the Rikers bus
driver said after a drop-off one recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when many mental institutions have shut down, due to
an odd combination of civil-liberties lawsuits and conservative
budget cuts, jails have become, as the title of a Soros Foundation
study last year put it, ``Hospitals of Last Resort.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a growing phenomenon in many cities, nowhere more than in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, there were a half-million beds in mental
hospitals nationwide, about 90,000 of them, or just under
one-fifth, in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to Heather Barr, a lawyer for the Urban Justice
Institute and author of the Soros study, New York state has fewer
than 5,000 beds.
</P>
<P>
   Probably not all 90,000 of those beds needed to be filled back
then. And some of those who might have ended up in hospitals at an
earlier time are finding care in outreach centers, outpatient
wards, or other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the untreated have wound up in jail, arrested for
petty crimes, a trend that has grown since Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
instituted the policy of prosecuting ``quality-of-life'' crimes
such as drinking or urinating in public, sleeping on the street,
and jumping subway turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a year, 33,000 inmates in New York City's
jails, a quarter the total number, receive mental-health services
while locked up. About half of those have serious ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20,000 prisoners in Rikers Island alone, 2,500 have
chronic mental disorders _ making the jail, as Barr said, ``de
facto the state's largest psychiatric facility.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that New York state law requires psychiatric
facilities to provide a ``discharge plan'' to patients who are
released to the outside world: a drug regimen (usually paid for by
Medicaid) and a referral to a doctor, clinic, or shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Jails have no such obligation.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban Justice Institute has filed a class-action lawsuit
requiring the city to provide this assistance to mental patients
released from jail, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, New York Supreme Court Judge Richard F. Braun ruled
in the institute's favor, agreeing that the distinction between
jails and hospitals is meaningless these days. He also declared
that withholding assistance from released inmates causes
``irreparable harm,'' and results in ``substance abuse, mental and
physical health deterioration, homelessness, indigence, crime,
re-arrest, and re-incarceration.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's lawyers have appealed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Ward, 37, arrived at the Queens bus stop one recent day at
5 a.m. He had served 15 days at Rikers for selling marijuana to an
undercover policeman. Ward hears voices in his head, and suffers
from severe mood swings. He was given medicine for these ailments
while at Rikers; the city has a contract with St. Barnabas Hospital
to treat mentally ill prisoners there.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``When they let me out, they didn't give me
anything but the subway card.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Ward had been living in a men's shelter in Washington
Heights, where he receives medication daily. He used the subway
card to go back there.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Serrano, 40, who was let off in Queens at 3 a.m., had no
such recourse. He avoids shelters; he'd slept in one a few years
ago and nearly got killed. So he walked toward the subway station,
unclear what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to break the law again,'' he said. ``But if it
gets cold, I'm going to have to find a hallway someplace to sleep
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates vary widely on the number of homeless adults in this
city _ around 15,000 in shelters and another 5,000 to 15,000 on the
streets _ but most analysts figure one-third to one-half of them
are mentally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has taken on a high profile in the past couple years,
as a schizophrenic named Andrew Goldstein killed Kendra Webdale by
pushing her off a subway platform; a homeless man named Bently
Louis Grant allegedly hit Tiffany Goldberg on the head with a
brick; and a still-unidentified man did the same to Nicole Barrett.
All these incidents occurred in midtown Manhattan in the middle of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, such assailants would have been in mental
institutions rather than out in the public. The fact that they were
walking the streets is the result of a strange history.
</P>
<P>
   It started as far back as the late 1940s, when books like ``The
Shame of the States'' and movies like ``The Snake Pit'' revealed
the gruesome conditions in many mental asylums.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the late 1950s, Thomas Szasz, a professor of
psychiatry, wrote an influential book, arguing that mental illness
was a myth _ the result of psychiatric diagnoses, not real
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, antipsychotic drugs, such as Thorzine, hit the
market, suggesting that mental hospitals might not be necessary for
many patients.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, President John F. Kennedy signed a bill setting up
``community mental health centers.'' All but the sickest patients
could be discharged from hospitals, receive treatment from these
centers instead, and go about living normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   However, as Dr. Howard Telson, a longtime forensic psychiatrist
at Bellevue Hospital and professor of psychiatry at New York
University, put it, ``A lot of the funding never got to the
community health centers, but patients got released from hospitals
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   This trend was accelerated by a string of court decisions in the
1960s and 1970s, ruling that the mentally ill could not be
involuntarily committed or even forced to take their medication,
unless they posed a danger to themselves or to others. Subsequent
rulings made it harder and harder to prove they posed a danger.
</P>
<P>
   All this was compounded by increasingly conservative
legislatures, which slashed mental-health budgets for both
old-fashioned hospitals and new-style community centers.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, the result, Telson said, was ``a national crisis,
massive homelessness, and total neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Dickey, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin,
wrote an article for the Criminal Law Bulletin as early as 1980,
predicting that many of the people let out on the streets would
commit petty crimes and find themselves shunted into the
criminal-justice system, and that _ as Barr's study confirmed 20
years later _ mental hospitals would be replaced by jails.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, filed
many of those lawsuits to keep mentally ill people from being
involuntarily committed. Asked recently if he had second thoughts
about the consequences of these lawsuits, Siegel replied, ``We
think about it a lot.'' However, he blames the government for
``reneging on its promise to provide mental health centers _ that's
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr sympathizes with this view, noting civil libertarians'
``good intentions.'' But she called it ``a great mistake'' that
they tore down the old system before ensuring that a new one was
really put in place.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, several states, including New York, have
devised or expanded programs to provide community services to the
mentally ill. As a result of the subway-shoving incident, New York
state, after many years of rejecting such ideas, passed ``Kendra's
law,'' which allows courts to order the mentally ill to take their
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein told police after he pushed Kendra Webdale over the
platform that he hadn't taken his medication, partly because nobody
made him take it.
</P>
<P>
   However, one psychiatrist, who was on the advisory panel that
created Kendra's law, wonders how effectively it can be enforced.
``If there's a court order on a patient, somebody has a
responsibility to monitor him while he's out there in the city,''
he said. ``But we don't even have the resources to give him
individual care in the hospital. . . . I don't believe the
powers-that-be really want to put money into making the system
work.''

STRIKE OR NOT, RAYTHEON   TAX BREAK WAS A MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon's blue-collar workers in Massachusetts are on strike,
and they are mad. They have watched their ranks thin over the years
_ from 10,000 ten years ago, to 4,200 five years ago, to 2,700
today.
</P>
<P>
   They are especially angry because in 1995 they lobbied the
Legislature to give Raytheon a tax break. In return, they thought
they were getting job security. They got some _ Raytheon is still
in Massachusetts _ but clearly not as much as they hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have a strong opinion on the strike. But we do have one
on the original tax break: It was a well-intentioned mistake. It
was based on the flawed assumption that the state could dictate the
hiring plans of a company. In an uncertain world, where whole
industries rise and fall faster than a Patriot missile, that kind
of micromanagement can't fly.
</P>
<P>
   A little history: Raytheon asked for tax relief five years ago,
to help it cope with the challenges posed by a shrinking defense
industry. With the Cold War over, there was less money around for
new weapon systems. Raytheon said it needed to cut costs so it
could compete for the few big projects the Pentagon still planned
to build. Without the tax break, the company warned, it might move
its manufacturing plants out of state.
</P>
<P>
   With the union's help, the bill became law. Raytheon, and all
other manufacturers, got lower taxes. In return, Raytheon promised
to keep its total Massachusetts payroll at 90 percent of the 1995
level for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Tolman, then a member of the state Senate, now a lawyer
in private practice, says the unions didn't get what they bargained
for. ``Raytheon hasn't abided by the spirit of the legislation,''
says Tolman, who notes that the company has since closed plants in
Waltham and Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Tolman and the union use the word spirit because Raytheon did
live up to the letter of the law. It kept its payroll above the 90
percent mark, in part by hiring more well-paid engineers and
scientists, even as it cut its blue-collar work force.
</P>
<P>
   The developments of the past five years show just how difficult
it is to forecast the economic future. On the plus side, Raytheon
survived the defense shakeout by buying up its rivals. It is now
one of the nation's three big remaining defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, survival hasn't ensured prosperity. Raytheon
has had huge problems digesting its various acquisitions. It has
gone over budget on a series of contracts. The bottom line: The
company's earnings have plunged, and so has its stock price. Last
July, the stock sold for $73 a share. Monday, it sold for $27.
</P>
<P>
   In another unpredictable twist, the tax break Raytheon fought so
hard for has turned out to be much smaller than originally
anticipated. Raytheon hoped for $100 million in tax relief over
five years. The company says it got more like $8.2 million. It
blames the shortfall on changes in federal tax law and smaller
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Raytheon bill, with its ``you give me something, I'll give
you something'' trade-off, became a model for other tax
legislation. The mutual fund industry won a tax break in 1996, in
exchange for a promise to add jobs over five years. The insurance
industry later got tax relief for a promise to boost investment in
the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the mutual fund bill is a huge success.
Fidelity Investments says it has added more than 4,000
Massachusetts jobs since 1996, an increase of 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But did the tax break really lead to the boost in payrolls? Do
you think the long-running bull market might have had something to
do with it? If the stock market had headed south instead of north,
or if investors had lost faith in mutual funds, would the tax bill
be hailed as a great success?
</P>
<P>
   The simple truth is, the future is hard to see. America seems to
have built a system that is very good at creating jobs, but not
necessarily jobs at any one company or any one industry. In
Massachusetts, more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs have
disappeared since 1984, yet the state has 400,000 more total jobs
than it did back then. Giants such as Digital Equipment and Wang
Laboratories have been swallowed up, while new giants such as EMC
Corp. have sprung up to take their place.
</P>
<P>
   None of these developments could have been predicted. Nor could
they have been dictated by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   So are we saying that the Legislature should never grant tax
relief? No, we are not. Michael Widmer, president of the
Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, says all the tax bills were
designed to improve the state's competitive posture. ``In many
cases we were just trying to maintain a level playing field,'' he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   We have no problem with that. But we do have a problem with the
notion that in exchange for tax relief, Massachusetts can get an
ironclad guarantee that the future will work out just the way it
wants.
</P>
<P>
   Making promises you can't keep inevitably leads to hard feelings
and disappointment. Just ask the union workers at Raytheon.

TAUZIAT IS BOUND AND SHE'S DETERMINED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nathalie Tauziat, the French author who also plays
tennis, is putting on a brave face over her game face, but inside
she is hurting. And as angry as the clouds that took a 100-minute
bite out of opening day at the US Open by leaking on Flushing
Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no exit,'' said Tauziat, sounding as fatalistic as
another French scribbler, Jean-Paul Sartre. ``For me there is no
way out, except with my racket. Here. This is where I have to show
I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Belongs where? After all Tauziat, finishing up a 17th
professional year in her distinguished career, is No. 8 on the
planet. She may be the most remarkable member of the game's top 10,
hanging tough on the cusp of her 33d birthday amid a juvenile
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Belongs where? Belongs in the Olympic Games, that's obviously
where, as the second-best Gallic gal, behind the Franco-American
slugger, Mary Pierce. But she won't be in Sydney, even though she
wore the flag for France in the three previous Games _ 1988, 1992,
1996 _ since the restoration of tennis to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' she said with a laugh, trying to be lighthearted
about her shameful persecution by the French Tennis Federation, ``I
should have tried to play for the Central African Republic. I was
born there, in Bangui, because my father was working there at the
time. But it's too late to apply, and I've already played for
France. I wanted very bad to play again, maybe take a medal. That
has always been a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't happen because her federation, shall we say, threw the
book at her. Her own book, ``Les Dessous du Tennis Feminin'' (``The
Underside of Women's Tennis''), which has been a hit in France,
selling almost 40,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the truth,'' Tauziat said Monday after her rebounding
victory over Ludmila Cervanova, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. ``I felt after all
my years on the tour I had a right to my opinion. But it is all
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   One undisputed truth is that three of her countrywomen _ Amelie
Mauresmo, Julie Halard-Decugis, Sandrine Testud _ did not believe
in literary freedom for Tauziat. Their reaction to the book was to
threaten the federation with their withdrawal from Olympic
consideration if she were chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fed up with her,'' Testud told a French newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat was not chosen. She appealed. The appeal was turned down
by the federation, and then an arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how your (American) Lisa Raymond feels,'' said Tauziat.
``She deserves to play, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, ranked No. 1 in the world in doubles, didn't make the
US team. Her appeal, too, was rejected by an arbitrator, but she
won't have any book royalties to comfort her.
</P>
<P>
   US captain Billie Jean King sympathizes with Raymond. But she
had to make a tough choice: Raymond, whose value in doubles has
been enhanced by her Australian partner, Rennae Stubbs? Or Serena
Williams, winner of the French and Wimbledon titles alongside
sister Venus? A woman without a customary American collaborator? Or
a team favored to win gold?
</P>
<P>
   King says that Serena also gives the US protection in singles if
injury befalls one of the starters: Venus, 1996 gold medalist
Lindsay Davenport, or Monica Seles. ``We have Lisa on the alternate
list if injury removes one of them,'' said King.
</P>
<P>
   But Tauziat isn't even accorded alternate status. How nasty was
the book that got her booked for exile from the Olympics? Not very,
say my informants who read French. She wrote that the French
Federation is incompetent. That's pretty clear if for nothing else
but their reaction to the book: not selecting the strongest team
that would include Tauziat, and neglecting its duty to tell her
detractors to grow up. But that's not news. Finding a competent
national governing body in this sport is as simple as tracking down
Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat also made fun of Halard-Decugis's husband, Arnaud
Decugis, who uses the pronoun ``we'' when discussing the family
breadwinner's game _ much like a boxing manager. Also of Mauresmo's
girlfriend, hardly a tennis expert, scolding Mauresmo about her
shortcomings on court. And also of Testud's claims of injury
whenever she loses.
</P>
<P>
   Tauziat criticized the Women's Tennis Association for peddling
sex, not an original or outlandish thought. It seems to her that
flesh counts more than earnest hard work, citing, of course, No. 14
Anna Kournikova, ranked six lengths below the industrious Tauziat.
This is a revelation?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, history is crammed with authors discriminated against for
their art. Even in France, which generally venerates writers and
names streets for them. Such as Avenue Victor Hugo, and other
Parisian thoroughfares saluting Moliere, Racine, and Villon to cite
three. But don't expect a Rue Tauziat honoring the spunky one-book
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will soothe the miserable Tauziat to know that the
great Victor Hugo (of ``Les Miserables'' fame) was exiled in 1851
for his views, and that the Marquis de Sade was jailed for writing
stuff nastier than hers.
</P>
<P>
   In the gallant spirit of an all-time French favorite, Edith
Piaf, whose theme song was ``Je Ne Regret Rien,'' Tauziat said, ``I
don't regret writing it. I wrote the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   At least she won't be burned at the stake like Joan of Arc, who
voiced the same sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been hard to concentrate with all this going on,'' said
Tauziat, a Wimbledon finalist in 1998, the first of her country to
do so well since Suzanne Lenglen won it 73 years before. ``There is
no way out but with my racket.''
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be fun if she used it to have her best Open, and
make those who objected to her words eat their own?

BUFFETT KEEPS UP WITH THE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Free agent. We know what the term means in sports, but Jimmy
Buffett is a free agent in the music business, the book business,
and in anything else he chooses to hang his ``Parrothead'' hat on.
He's one of the most admired people in the entertainment industry
because he has reached a point where he truly is making his own
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not under contract anywhere. I don't owe anybody anything.
I can sit out here and do it all on my own schedule,'' Buffett says
from his summer home on Long Island. ``You know, not many people
get to that position. And we're still out here breaking rules and
causing people grief and I like that, too. It's always good to have
a little revolutionary will left in your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 53, Buffett has two sold-out shows at the Tweeter Center in
Boston on Thursday and Saturday. Once again, they were the quickest
shows to sell out at the venue this summer _ a sign that Parrothead
mania is still alive and well, despite trends buzzing around it
from rap to heavy metal to teen pop.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, it seems, is always in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd still be here at this level,'' he says.
``At 53 still riding this crest, not slipping into the dinosaur
mode like others have, but still being a very current and
contemporary performer. I'm very lucky to be here. When I am ready
to hang it up, I'll hang it up in style.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's forgotten his early days of scuffling, back 30
years ago when he was a good ol' boy/beach bum who hadn't yet had
hits like ``Margaritaville'' and ``Changes in Latitudes, Changes in
Attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful now, but for the first 10 to 15 years, nobody
knew my name and I couldn't get arrested,'' says the Alabama
native. ``I remember vividly playing (Boston's) Paul's Mall and
them misspelling my name. I mean, I don't forget that stuff. When
you have to fight so hard for any ounce of recognition at the early
stages of your career, then when you finally achieve some success,
it's a case of, `Hey, they'll probably have to drag my (butt) off
that stage.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett can laugh at those early days now, especially on a new
home video, ``Tales From MargaritaVision,'' which collects all of
his first videos (with hilarious commentaries added) when he was
angling to get on MTV, like other would-be hipsters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   It was to no avail, for his fame would come from word-of-mouth
among fans who loved his live act, rather than from the video
airplay that propelled the likes of Duran Duran and Michael
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been on MTV and never won an award, but I kind of
cherish those facts,'' Buffett says today.
</P>
<P>
   In liner notes to the new video compilation, Buffett writes,
``While the rest of the music world charged like Sherman to the sea
toward the world of music videos, I had to be dragged by my heels
into this new arena. I was a live performer. Hell, I had enough
trouble just trying to get played on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the videos are wonderfully cheesy _ football star Joe
Namath shows up as a Hawaiian shirt salesman in one _ and the video
for ``One Particular Harbor'' even has Buffett wearing a coat he
borrowed from Mel Gibson's filming of ``Mutiny on the Bounty.''
Buffett also turns up in a flamboyant red-orange suit in ``La Vie
Dansante'' (``That suit went back to wardrobe _ it's probably up on
eBay now'') and he's shown in Key West playing before a haphazard
cast of locals (including a barefooted hippie who does an impromptu
jig) in ``Nautical Wheelers.'' Two other videos were directed by
Monkees singer/guitarist Michael Nesmith, who was introduced to
Buffett by actor Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of fun to go back and look at them. You know, back
when I had hair and I was skinnier. Some of them are real dumb and
some are not so bad, but I didn't get the big budgets for videos.
Someone else got all that money. It was an uncomfortable position
to be in, because I never perceived myself as a video-promoted
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, today video is an integral part of our stage
production,'' he says of the footage projected during his concerts
of Parrotheads tailgating before the show. ``I think we have found
our best use for video, but back then, it was kind of by default.
Nobody really knew what they were doing. And the (record company)
would force you to make videos. I tried to tell them that I'd
rather spend the money elsewhere, but that's the ongoing conflict
between the artist and record company.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Buffett avoids such conflicts because, as a free agent,
he puts out his own records on the Internet through his Web site,
www.margaritaville.com. He also has his own Internet radio station
(radiomargaritaville.com) and he's personally negotiating a own
movie deal for his novel, the picaresque, Caribbean-centered
``Where Is Joe Merchant?'' Kevin Wade is writing the script (he
also penned ``Working Girl''). And Buffett has just booked his
theatrical production of ``Carnival'' (with songs by Buffett and
script by Herman Wouk) into the Atlantis resort in Nassau for an
expected opening in February. He still hasn't given up on taking
the show eventually to Broadway, but he won't sell his soul to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett is also stepping out to play a benefit for presidential
candidate Al Gore at Radio City Music Hall on September 14 with Don
Henley, Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash, Sheryl Crow, Bette Midler, Macy
Gray, and others. While he feels his Parrothead audience is ``split
50-50 between Democrats and Republicans,'' he is an avowed Democrat
who likes Gore for his pro-environmental stand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buffett continues to sell out everywhere, though from
spending time in Internet chat rooms, he has learned to appreciate
that Parrotheads follow him for many different reasons _ and have
many strong opinions about his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got those people who don't think that I should have
changed at all, and I should still be the same guy I was in 1972,
which nobody can be,'' he says. ``And there are those who don't
think I have done anything worth a darn since 1980. And then there
are people who just come on board for the party songs. So there are
all kinds of factions out there, but at least they all still
come.''

&HT;     EUROPES' NEW CURRENCY BECOMES SMALL CHANGE FOR AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN FLINN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nobody from Brussels has called to ask my
opinion, and perhaps that's good. I just can't make up my mind how
I feel about the euro.
</P>
<P>
   For those who haven't been reading the financial pages, the euro
is the new common currency of the 11 participating European Union
countries. Introduced Jan. 1, 1999, for credit card transactions,
it will arrive as bank notes and coins on Jan. 1, 2002, and, after
a six-month phase-in period, will completely replace francs, marks,
lire, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The currencies of the euro countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain) are now marching in lockstep, and so far for
U.S. travelers this has been good _ no, great _ news: The
currencies have been marching steadily downward.
</P>
<P>
   When it debuted, the euro traded at 0.85 to the dollar; by last
week the rate had dropped to 1.10, meaning that the dollars of
Americans vacationing in Europe this summer are buying a giddying
29 percent more than they did just 20 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The currencies of all euro countries have plunged at the same
rate: Last week the French franc was trading at 7.2 to the dollar,
the German mark at 2.16, the Italian lira at 2,138.
</P>
<P>
   After years of vacationing in European countries while their
currencies were notching post-war highs against the dollar, it was
a decidedly pleasant shock to arrive in southern France a few weeks
ago and get 7.3 francs for every dollar I converted. Restaurant
bills would be presented and I'd do a double take, wondering if
perhaps the waiter had made a math mistake in my favor, for once.
Dining in restaurants we could never have afforded before, my wife
Jeri and I were enjoying four-course meals with good bottles of
wine for $40 or $50, sometimes less.
</P>
<P>
   One other, minor benefit of the new currency: Most shops and
many restaurants now post prices both in their native currencies
and the euro, and the latter trades close enough to the dollar that
it's no longer necessary to do rough conversions in your mind. A
cuckoo clock priced at 75 euros will cost you a bit under 75 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's not to like about the euro?
</P>
<P>
   To me, it's the most visible symbol of the new generic Europe,
in which the French are becoming somewhat less French, the Dutch
less Dutch, the Spanish less Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Insidiously, in almost imperceptible increments, they are
morphing into generic Europeans. From its headquarters in Brussels,
the European Union has for years been issuing regulations that are
slowly sapping the individuality out of each country. The EU
determines how the French make cheese, how Italian trattorias
operate, what the Scottish put into haggis. (OK, that last one
might not be so bad.)
</P>
<P>
   A nation's currency is a statement of its culture, and one of
the things I've always admired about the Europeans is that they
honor philosophers, artists, authors and musicians on their money,
rather than dead presidents. France, for example, currently
celebrates aviator Antoine de Saint-Expury on its 50-franc note,
artist Paul Cezanne on the 100 and engineer Gustave Eiffel, of
tower fame, on the 200. Belgium commemorates painters James Sydney
Ensor and Rene Magritte, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 months, they will be gone, replaced by generic euro bank
notes. To avoid favoritism, the EU has steered clear of any
identifiable people or buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the organization describes its new money: ``The
designs are symbolic of Europe's architectural heritage. They do
not represent any existing monuments. Windows and gateways dominate
the front side of each bank notes as symbols of the spirit of
openness and cooperation in the EU.'' The back sides are all
generic bridges, ``a metaphor for communication among the people of
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   (If you're really curious to see what the new euro notes will
look like, go have a look at
http://europa.eu.int/euro/html/entry.html)
</P>
<P>
   When the national currencies are withdrawn and replaced by the
new Etch-a-Sketch euro notes, another little piece of each
country's identity will be surrendered to the eurocrats in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, if my wife and I can get a great four-course French
dinner for what we'd spend at Sizzler back home, I'm not going to
complain too much.

&HT;     A RIDE THROUGH NATURAL WONDERS IN HAWAII'S `DITCH' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN FLINN

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAWI, Hawaii _ For four generations the boys and girls of North
Kohala, on the Big Island of Hawaii, have been climbing over
barbed-wire fences and dodging security guards in search of an
illicit thrill.
</P>
<P>
   On inner tubes or boogie boards or anything else that floats,
they've drifted down the 22 miles of man-made channels and flumes
built nearly a century ago by the Kohala Sugar Co. to carry water
from the rain-soaked Kohala Mountains to the thirsty sugar cane
fields on the dry lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   They even invented Pidgin terms for their pastime: flumin'; the
canal was ``da ditch.'' So an afternoon's fun would be ``flumin' da
ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all did it, and we'd stop and have a picnic along the
way,'' Chris Carvalho said. ``We'd gather up lots of fruit from the
sides of the ditch and bring it home to make jellies. It's what we
did for fun around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now grown up, Carvalho, 41, and his North Kohala pals are
earning a living guiding tourists in inflatable kayaks down the
irrigation canal where they once trespassed.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, called ``Fluming the Ditch,'' has become a showcase of
Hawaiian eco-tourism, and it's bringing a small measure of economic
success back to a region still reeling from the closure of the
sugar plantations 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I took the tour. From the beach resorts on the sunny
Kohala-Kona Coast, I drove an hour around the northwest corner of
the Big Island to the picturesque plantation town of Hawi.
(Pronounced Haw-vee.) Kohala Mountain Kayak Cruise, which runs the
tour, operates out of the sugar company's old headquarters in
partnership with the Japanese corporation that now owns the
23,000-acre plantation.
</P>
<P>
   After being fitted for a life jacket and signing the usual legal
waiver, we were given a short presentation on the history of the
Kohala Ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Clinging to mountainsides and tunneling through rocky cliffs
1,000 feet above the sea, the irrigation canal is a wonder of
engineering. It was built at the turn of the last century to slake
the thirst of the North Kohala cane fields, which need 500 gallons
of water to produce a single pound of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   To design the canal, a local plantation owner hired Michael
O'Shaughnessey, who later built San Francisco's Hetch Hetchy water
system. O'Shaughnessey hired 600 laborers, most of them Japanese
immigrants, because, he said, ``they seemed to like this class of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   It was brutally difficult, and dangerous. Because the steep,
unstable terrain made using earth-moving machines virtually
impossible, the laborers shoveled and dynamited their way along the
mountainsides. For this they were paid $1 a day and all the food
they could forage.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents claimed the lives of 17 workers, and no official
document records their names. An exhaustive search by the owners of
Kohala Mountain Kayak Cruise has turned up only three names so far;
eventually the tour operators hope to erect a monument with them
all.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in 1907 after 18 months of work and a cost of
$700,000, the canal features 57 tunnels and 19 wooden flumes over
its 22.5-mile length. It was an immediate success, quadrupling
harvests and transforming the North Kohala sugar plantations into
some of the most prosperous in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The good times lasted nearly 70 years, until cheap overseas
competition forced the plantations out business in the mid-1970s.
Entire communities in North Kohala were thrown out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an attempt by the state to bankroll new enterprises in
the area, unemployment remains high. Kohala Mountain Kayak Cruises
is one of the few successes: Since its start in 1996, it has been
running two tours a day, seven days a week, at near capacity.
</P>
<P>
   After the history presentation we piled into four-wheel-drive
vans for the drive to the ditch. Along the way, Carvalho pointed
out a statue of Kamehameha, the Hawaiian king who was born here and
who united the islands. Further down the road, we passed the
training grounds where a young Kamehameha once carried small
boulders, medicine ball-style, to toughen himself up for the
battles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   We turned off the paved highway, passed through a gate and
bounced up a steep, rocky, pot-holed dirt road that led us to the
Kohala Ditch.
</P>
<P>
   The tour, which lasts about three hours, covers about a third of
the canal's length. As we slid into five-person inflatable kayaks,
I was handed a sawed-off paddle and a miner's headlamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the paddle's for,'' I said, ``but what about the
headlamp?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see,'' Carvalho said as we shoved off.
</P>
<P>
   The tour wasn't what I expected. I anticipated an E-ticket
thrill ride, with frothy, fast-moving water and a high yahoo
factor. Instead, we floated at a gentle, leisurely pace,
alternating between open grassland and canopied rainforest. Mostly
I used my paddle to keep the kayak from hitting the sides of the
ditch as we swung around corners.
</P>
<P>
   As we drifted through shady forests of kakui and guava trees,
fragrant with the scent of wild ginger blossoms, Carvalho and the
other guides gave us a natural history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Leaking overhead flumes provided a bracing splash of water. As
we crossed ravines on wooden viaducts, the world opened up beneath
us, sometimes revealing hidden waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding a corner, the ditch disappeared into a dark tunnel _
and I understood what the miner's headlamp was for. The curving,
dripping tunnel was hundreds of yards long and pitch-black for most
of its length.
</P>
<P>
   Excavating it was obviously arduous, and the laborers who dug
and blasted it didn't make it any bigger than they had to. I had to
lean my 5-foot 8-inch frame back to avoid scraping my head on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   In a second tunnel further down the canal, Carvalho shone his
headlamp into a tiny grotto and pointed out big, black, freshwater
prawns, descendants of the crustaceans planted by the canal's
builders to feed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was little we used to take them home for dinner,''
Carvalho said. ``They were sweet and delicious.''
</P>
<P>
   What impressed me about the tour was that, unlike most tourist
excursions, it didn't feel contrived. The boys and girls of North
Kohala have been floating down this canal for years, and now
visitors are being invited to share the experience _ with a natural
history lesson as a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Local kids still trespass onto the property to ``flume da
ditch,'' but Carvalho and the other guides do nothing to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Back when he was a boy, those who were caught were given a
summary judgment and a stern paddling. I asked Carvalho if he ever
suffered that fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he said. ``My dad was the police chief.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   Hawi, where the tour starts, is located about 90 minutes from
the town of Kailua-Kona, at the intersections of Highways 270 and
250. Check-in is at the Chalon International headquarters, off
Highway 250 opposite the Kohala Village Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Tours: There are two three-hour tours a day, with check-in times
of 8:15 a.m. and 12:15 p.m. Prices are $85 for adults and $65 for
children.
</P>
<P>
   How hard it is?: It's easy and gentle, suitable for young
children and seniors. No previous kayaking experience is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Word to the wise: After a morning tour, or before an afternoon
tour, leave time to eat lunch and poke around the town of Hawi,
which sports a number of inviting cafes and galleries.

WILSON GIVES SWELLING CELEBRITY HEADS A MASSIVE POP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULES VERDONE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
A MASSIVE SWELLING 
Celebrity Re-examined as a Grotesque Crippling Disease and Other
Cultural Revelations 
By Cintra Wilson 
Viking, 229 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In writing about fame in these United States, Cintra Wilson is
incisive, inflamed, inflammatory, offensive, astute, vulgar, mean,
wildly funny, compassionate, and sweeping. Her dull moments are
few.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say that the subject of her book, ``A Massive
Swelling,'' is always gripping. Wilson, a columnist on pop culture
for Salon.com, has a readership that probably cares about famous
people _ and her digestion of them _ more than most. But for
someone who's not exactly fascinated by our nation's super egos and
the machinery of stardom, Wilson's smart, maniacal writing is the
draw.
</P>
<P>
   The author isn't one to mince words. Her opinions spew out in
profane knowing rants, with crass language that comes off not
self-consciously or for effect, but as if these are the exact words
she would say out loud. Alas, that means many of her sassiest
passages can't be reproduced in a family newspaper, but then, some
of her best lines can't be ruined here, either.
</P>
<P>
   Though the wording is a bit forced, Wilson sums up her thesis in
a heavy-handed introduction and the book's subtitle _ ``Celebrity
Re-examined as a Grotesque Crippling Disease and Other Cultural
Revelations.'' But she hammers the idea home elsewhere in more
potent, less affected ways: ``Fame-cum-sexual attention is like a
bad smack problem . . . you have to keep getting a maintenance
level into the bloodstream just to feel a normal level of
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Better yet: ``L.A. is the place where Satan squats with an
enormous ladle and dips deeply into his black cavity to extract
huge soiled wads of cash, which he then pitches at the heads of the
inhabitants below with such speed and force that they are rendered
first unconscious, then punchy and depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Wilson lingers on Los Angeles unduly, well, the list of
targets isn't limited to one defenseless city. She strikes without
mercy. Matt Dillon is a vampire. Tonya Harding is a martyr
``cackling dark and crazy at the end of the long ice tunnel.''
Robert De Niro's haircut ``made him look like a fat, mean
pineapple.'' Claudia Schiffer ``was built by professional
scientists and has no distracting human emotions.'' Cher ``has
stretched her face so hard that she looks constantly surprised,
like an ironed geisha.'' James Cameron is ``a totally loathable
Costnerian dullard and an ego-bloated dunce.''
</P>
<P>
   And that roundup isn't the printed equivalent of a trailer that
blows every one of a movie's funny scenes. Don't even get her
started on Celine Dion or Barbra Streisand or Michael Jackson or
Courtney Love.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson slags all types: black, brown, and white, men and women,
gay, straight, Presbyterian, Jewish, Mormon, Methodist, Lutheran,
Scientologist. It's none of those qualities under attack, though;
she homes in on bad taste and bad judgment.
</P>
<P>
   An aside: In the fourth chapter Wilson tells us she is white. It
then became clear that the photograph on the back sleeve, of a
woman donning a red velvet curtain, her upswept hair concluding in
a mushroom cloud, is the author. (Duh.) But though the image is
whimsical, her expression as much sorcerer as sexpot, are we to
take it as necessary _ or ironic or irrelevant _ that her cleavage
and bare shoulders are on display? Isn't this the kind of sexual
packaging she rails against within?
</P>
<P>
   But then, consistency isn't the mission here. Wilson is all
about hyperbole. When she is good, she is very, very good, and when
she is mean, she is ruthless. Ike Turner's new wife ``conjured
images of a rusty trailer in a desolate yard filled with dirty
toys, hedge stumps, angry dogs, and chicken wire.'' Wilson's take
on Ike and his attempted comeback is no kinder but it doesn't seem
so unfair: ``This was a circus of dismay, a terrible thawing of a
career that should have remained cryogenically frozen.'' By
contrast, her heart softens toward the opening band on the bill:
``They were local guys, bursting at the seams with Real Soul, in a
hearty, underdog homespun way that nearly made you cry if you were
tuning into the sincerity of it.'' Evidently, Wilson was.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Wilson's jet streams of foul-mouthed skepticism are
what'll make you laugh out loud, track down her words online, and
pass this book along. ``A Massive Swelling'' probably would pack
the best punch with pauses between chapters, ingested in occasional
installments, columnlike. You might even forgive her for using the
word ``hottie.'' Wilson is naturally, vividly, wonderfully
inelegant, and as sharp as a plastic surgeon's blade.

LOTS OF COWS, LOTS OF SCHNAPPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OBERHOFEN, Austria _ The cows had returned to the barn in early
evening to be milked and fed. Fresh-cut hay that 12-year-old Stefan
Feldbacher pitchforks their way is so transportingly aromatic that
you imagine the beefy sniffers and munchers ecstatically glazed on
a bovine high.
</P>
<P>
   They do look mellow, all right. A look that is enhanced whenever
they are given a massage with the large electric brushes of a
machine called ``Happy Cow.''
</P>
<P>
   But now it's time for the human beings to kick back, says
Stefan's old man, Johann ``Hansi'' Feldbacher. Husky, mustachioed
Hansi, master of a farm called Grossenbauer, believes in a happy
hour fueled by his homemade beverages, applewein and schnappes. Why
not, at the end of a 13-hour shift? After all, he was up at 6, as
always, and had earned a sip or two of Austrian white lightning. It
does make the moon shine brighter.
</P>
<P>
   The Feldbachers aren't exactly the new homesteaders on the
block, and Hansi is only distilling potions that have been passed
down through the generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has been on this farm for 350 years,'' he says as
two other villagers, friends Hella and Fritz Suppan, translate his
German remarks. ``I guess we're getting used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not too hard. Rural Oberhofen, lying about an hour's
drive northeast of Salzburg, is soft on the eyes, a mix of lazy
green hills, farmland and pastures, forests and small lakes. The
residents seem amiably-natured and like to have a good time,
especially when the volunteer band _ the Blasmusik Kapelle _ plays
for dances.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to go out for dinner, the Gasthaus, presided over by
a cordial young couple, the Ottingers _ Norbert cooks, Monika waits
on tables _ is just fine. Norbert's niftiest dessert, Salzburger
Nockerl, is an unimaginably light and fluffy souffle that he
probably laces with nectar.
</P>
<P>
   The other night at the Gasthaus we met a farmer named Michael
Rauchenschwantner, who joyfully explained that he had everything a
man could want: ``three cows, three daughters, one horse. And one
tuba'' that he plays in the local band. ``Oh, yes, and one wife.''
Not as brassy as the tuba, he added, chortling.
</P>
<P>
   Michael was also pleased at having taken advantage of a ``huge
bargain. I just got my first passport. I'll never use it, but,'' he
said with a smile, ``I was just in time _ before the price went up
five dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   A swim in a beautifully landscaped pond called Hellasee,
described by a resident as ``a woman-made lake, designed and paid
for by a generous lady of the village,'' started the day nicely,
and set the tone for pure pleasure. Only a short drive away, the
town of St. Gilgen sits on the bank of a much more substantial lake
(the second largest in Austria), Wolfgangsee, with a mountainous
skyline.
</P>
<P>
   A boat from St. Gilgen calls at other lakeside towns, such as
Furberg, where a rock-climbing school has a sheer limestone face as
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of good things here,'' Fritz Suppan said. ``If these
novice climbers fall they only plop into the lake. And have you
noticed how quiet it is? No conventional motorboats allowed. Only
electric-powered.''
</P>
<P>
   It's worth disembarking at St. Wolfgang for a look at the church
of the same name with its handsomely carved 15th-century baroque
altar that includes images of God and St. Wolfgang himself, a
village hero. As the house saint out of the 10th century, Wolfgang
has the featured position, upstaging God. A nearby fresco depicts
him as a holy hatchet man, ready to chop the devil with a fearsome
ax. He is said to have thrown the ax into the valley, vowing to
build his church where it landed.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz said, ``You can see that St. Wolfgang is big in this
neighborhood. Mozart was probably named for him. His mother,
Nannerl, came from St. Gilgen on the other side of the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunch at Weissen Kirschen, on a terrace above the lake, shaded
by the branches of chestnut and linden, included a splendid
panorama of irregular peaks (some tinted with snow), the teal green
water populated by ducks, swans, swimmers, sailboaters, skiers,
oarsmen.
</P>
<P>
   The snow must have reminded my friend Aurelio that we needed
milk for breakfast. Having seen cattle in Oberhofen, she felt that
``a farmer surely must be peddling the real, fresh kind that you
never get anymore unless you get within squeezing distance of a
cow.''
</P>
<P>
   We had moved on to the village of Mondsee for coffee and
delectable Malakoff cake at Frauenschuhn Konditoree, one of the
sidewalk cafes along Marktplatz. It should be called ice cream row
since the buildings are painted in such flavors as blueberry,
pistachio, vanilla, peach, red and black raspberry. Around the
corner is the gothic church, St. Michael's, crowded with angels and
saints, where Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer were married in
the movie version of ``The Sound of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, milk,'' said Hella, nodding. ``Hansi Feldbacher is the man
for that. And some eggs, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansi's eggs turned out to be so fresh, the yolks such a bright
orange, that you need to wear sunglasses while eating them. But the
milk! Pure ambrosia, udderly superb in its natural state before the
pasteurizers and bottlers take over.
</P>
<P>
   Hansi is saying, ``Well, of course I have to sell it to a dairy.
It helps make the living. But I'm glad to sell to people I know
before it goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Four generations of Feldbachers currently occupy the farm along
with bed-and-breakfast customers who relish the fresh environment
and food, the hiking, riding, and water sports on the lakes, or
just hanging out watching the 50-or-so cows go by.
</P>
<P>
   As we talk, his mother, ruddy-faced Teresia, pulls up on a
tractor, finished with work somewhere on the 116 acres, much of it
wooded. She says hello, and goes off to fix supper for her husband,
Johann.
</P>
<P>
   ``They work for me now,'' says Hansi, ``just as someday I will
work for Stefan here, and he'll be the boss. That's the way it goes
in this family. I'm the oldest son of 11 children. I was working as
a sales manager in a factory, marking time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to come back, and was glad when my father said
it was my turn. Then I paid $10,000, dividing it among my brothers
and sisters, for the right. I hope Stefan will have a son that he
can work for when the time comes to slow down a little. My parents
are in their 60s. My grandparents, in their 80s, are pretty much
retired.''
</P>
<P>
   He has two other boys, Bernhardt, 10, and Mickey, 5, too young
to know if they want to be farmers. But Stefan is sure. They are
introduced, then go off with their pretty mother, Anneliese, for
supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``And some TV before bed,'' says Hansi, laughing. ``We are a
religious family. The trinity is Jesus, Mary, and TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Small farms, he says, ``have a hard time staying alive. But we
work hard, and sell enough _ milk, cheese, beef, and wood _ to get
along. It is a very good life, and now we can have very good
drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   We are sitting in the living room of the immaculate 17th-
century stone farmhouse as he brings out the pink-toned applewein.
``Made from mostly apples, but some pears,'' he says, pouring.
Nice, agreeable taste, like a fruit juice. Goes down well. But look
out _ 19 percent alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of glasses of this and I'll feel like I've been
massaged by that `Happy Cow' machine in the barnyard,'' says
Aurelio.
</P>
<P>
   After three pitchers of applewein, Hansi brings out the
schnappes, diluting the clear booze with water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 65 percent at the moment, but I'll bring that down to
drinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Very sporting. Otherwise it would send you to Mars. For good.
His schnappes reminds me of Italian grappa or Chinese mao tai.
Sampling is sort of like pulling up to the high-test pump at a gas
station and imbibing from the hose.
</P>
<P>
   It can play paradiddles on you the way Hansi bangs his drums and
cymbals in the village band. But Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, and Max
Roach have their followers.
</P>
<P>
   Anneliese has shooed the kids to bed, and returns with platters
of their own cheese. Excellent. And good stomach liners with the
schnappes flowing. Hansi's brown eyes turn lovingly on his wife.
``I met her at a dance. . . . But we didn't get together for six
years.''
</P>
<P>
   A straight-faced neighbor named Friel drops by. One schnappes
and he's glowing. Ambidextrous Hansi pours well with either hand,
and no one is resisting. What happened to the dinner reservations?
Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be healthier,'' Hansi advises. ``Schnappes kills all
bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   But it enlivens the atmosphere, and soon we are singing in
German, a language that has baffled me until Hansi's schnappes.
First, hunting songs. Next the serious, political stuff:
revolutionary songs. Jah, jah.
</P>
<P>
   Hansi and Fritz, like countless Austrians, regret the World War
I treaty that gave their beloved South Tyrol, including the
stunning, craggy Dolomites, to neighboring Italy. There's still
more German than Italian spoken in that region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take back the South Tyrol!'' is our promise in song, a
trio of defiance. It is an anthem called ``Andreas Hofer,'' for a
tragic Austrian hero. Jah, jah!
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio says, ``OK, guys. Let us know how your crusade comes
out. But let's not forget the milk for breakfast.''

&HT;     HAWAIIANS REDISCOVER THE ROAM OF ANCIENT MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: With TRAVEL-HAWAII-SAILING-INFO)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN FLINN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OFF THE KOHALA COAST, Hawaii _ Skipper Casey Cho gives the order
to hoist the sail in Hawaiian _ huki kau la! _ and up goes
something you'll never see at the local yacht club. It's shaped not
like the inverted-triangle mainsail found on every sloop from
Newport to Tiburon, but like a massive lobster claw reaching toward
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   I'd seen this odd-looking sail design only once before: in
petroglyphs carved by ancient Hawaiians in the dried lava beds a
few miles away on the Big Island.
</P>
<P>
   These were the sails that carried early Polynesian explorers on
epic voyages of discovery across the vast, uncharted expanses of
the Pacific Ocean in an age when European sailors were too timid to
leave sight of land.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're at the center of a nautical renaissance, as modern
Hawaiians seek to reclaim their remarkable seafaring heritage. In
large, double-hulled voyaging canoes similar to the ones that
carried their ancestors to the islands, they've undertaken journeys
of rediscovery throughout Polynesia in recent years, navigating as
their ancestors did: without the help of maps, compasses, sextants
or GPS receivers.
</P>
<P>
   These voyaging canoes _ the Hokule'a, Hawai'iloa and Makali'i _
have become the icons of Hawaii's burgeoning cultural revival in
hula, arts and language, and the men and women who sail and
navigate them are revered as heroes here on the same scale as Tiger
Woods or Michael Jordan are on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Cadging a ride on one of these canoes is just about impossible _
believe me, I tried _ but on a recent visit to the Big Island I
found two ways for visitors to get a taste of Hawaiian-style
voyaging: a working replica of an ancient, inter-island canoe and a
free class in the basics of traditional Polynesian navigation.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, a little background. The early European explorers
who stumbled into Polynesia in the 1500s and 1600s were dumbfounded
to discover that islanders from New Zealand to Hawaii to Easter
Island _ people scattered over 10 million square miles of ocean _
spoke essentially the same language and had the same customs.
Obviously they shared a common origin. But how could these
primitive-seeming natives possibly have crossed vast reaches of
empty sea to discover and settle these tiny specks of land?
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing Western view came to be what, for want of a more
scientific term, I'll call the Gilligan Theory: That ancient
Tahitians or Marquesans had gone out for a three-hour cruise and
encountered a gale that blew them thousands of miles off course,
until they washed up on the shores of Hawaii and other islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unskillfulness of the pilot, or the unexpected change of
wind, would often carry the adventurous islanders far beyond their
reckoning,'' wrote Australian John Dunmore Lang, an author of two
books on the subject, in 1877. If the sailors were lucky enough to
drift to a deserted island, ``they would gladly settle on the
new-found land, fearful of again trusting themselves to the ocean,
and entirely ignorant of what course they should steer for their
native isle.''
</P>
<P>
   This view _ along with a twist from Thor Heyerdahl, who believed
Polynesia was populated by South Americans drifting in reed boats
similar to the Kon-Tiki _ was taught in Hawaiian schools until
fairly recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep down we were hurt by these stories,'' said Danny Akaka, a
Hawaiian historian, cultural advisor to the Mauna Lani Bay Resort
and son of Democratic Sen. Daniel Akaka. ``They played to the
stereotypes that Hawaiians are lazy and unskilled. But we knew
better.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, a group of Hawaiians got together to try to
refute these theories, to prove that their ancestors had the skill
to navigate their way among the widely scattered islands of
Polynesia.
</P>
<P>
   To recreate an ancient, massive, double-hulled voyaging canoe,
they relied on sketches made by the crews of Capt. James Cook and
other early European explorers. The lobster-claw sail design came
in part from the ancient petroglyphs found in dried lava beds on
the Big Island and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   By 1975 they'd built the Hokule'a, named for the star used by
ancient Hawaiians to steer a course home. But how would modern
Hawaiians navigate their craft? On tiny Satawal atoll in
Micronesia, they met a man named Mau Piailug, a Yoda-like master
who was one of the last remaining men in the world skilled in the
ancient navigational techniques.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 Piailug guided the Hokule'a from Hawaii to Tahiti, a
distance of 2,400 miles, without charts or instruments. Four years
later the voyage was repeated _ this time with Nainoa Thompson, a
young Hawaiian protege of Piailug, at the helm. It was the first a
Hawaiian navigator had managed this feat in 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Hokule'a and its sister canoes have voyaged
throughout Polynesia, from New Zealand to Easter Island, and even
toured the West Coast of the U.S. from Alaska to San Francisco to
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to overstate the effect this has had on Hawaiian
pride. Think of it this way: It's one thing to grow up believing
your ancestors were hapless castaways; it's quite another to know
you are descended from some of the greatest mariners the world has
ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the Hokule'a was the focal point in the reawakening of
Hawaiian culture,'' said Chad Bayaban, who navigated one of the
canoes from Hawaii to the Marquesas in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bayaban is a good case in point: In high school he was steered
away from science classes because he wasn't considered bright
enough to grasp them. Now he's developing a Hawaiian-language
science curriculum for the University of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   As in traditional Polynesian culture, the great navigators are
honored in story and song: In a single afternoon in Honolulu I
heard two different songs on the radio and saw a music video
celebrating the voyages of the Hokule'a. A few months ago a poll
commissioned by the Honolulu Advertiser newspaper found that the
most universally admired person in the Hawaiian islands was Nainoa
Thompson.

   MASTERING THE STARS
</P>
<P>
   To try to understand how Piailug, Thompson and others pulled off
these feats, I attended a program in traditional Polynesian
navigation offered through the superb cultural center at the
Hualalai Four Seasons resort on the Big Island's Kohala Coast. Held
every Monday evening, the course is free and open to the general
public. It's a subject that takes a lifetime to master, and I
didn't expect I'd become adept in one night. But the program offers
a good basic overview of how it's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our compass is the stars, the moon and the swells,'' explained
Kaleo Kuali'i, the apprentice navigator teaching the class. ``Our
sextant is this,'' he said, holding up his hand, ``and our GPS is
this.'' He pointed to his head. ``It's all in here.''

<P>
   One side effect of all those star-powered patients is that
wannabe athletes of all ages want to have the surgery, too. Which
is no different than their wanting to take the supplement
androstenedione when they heard how it had helped home run king
Mark McGwire, or wanting to rush back into play with a nagging
injury the way Pedro Martinez perpetually does.
</P>
<P>
   All the Stanford University football players who wear glasses or
contacts are asking about LASIK, says Dr. George Paris,
ophthamologist for Stanford teams and for the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer to them is that their eye has the potential to keep
growing until their early or mid-20s,'' says Paris. ``I say, `You
should wait until you're 23, 24, or 25 to make sure your eye has
stopped growing and your measurements are stable. If you have it
done when you are 20, it can correct everything perfectly, but
there may be additional growing and you may need something else
done in five years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons for waiting. College students spend so
much time reading books and working on computers that, even if they
had perfect eyesight when they enrolled, the new strains may
require them to be fitted for glasses or contacts and their
prescriptions could keep shifting. The field of laser surgery also
is evolving so fast that techniques are almost sure to keep
improving, making it wise to wait as long as possible before being
operated on. And even though LASIK is free of side effects for most
patients, a few percent report problems like blurred vision or
glare _ and almost all have to pay for the procedure without help
from their insurer, which at a cost of about $2,500 an eye can be a
major burden.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the young who need to think twice about what the
operation could do to them, but also anyone over 40. Nearsighted
people in that age group who get LASIK will see their distance
vision improve but may become more dependent on reading glasses.
And ones who are farsighted and want their near vision back would
find their distance vision impaired.
</P>
<P>
   For the average LASIK patient, a surgeon can minimize the
inconvenience by adjusting one eye to see better faraway and
leaving the other eye untreated or partially treated. But for an
athlete like Irwin, distance sight is so critical that both eyes
have to focus on it, which is why after his operation he needs
glasses to do something as simple as read a restaurant menu.
</P>
<P>
   Special concerns like those about younger patients, and older
ones, are why Dr. Dimitri Azar consults so carefully with every
patient who comes in seeking surgery. Azar, who operated on Nixon
and runs the corneal and refractive surgery program at the
Massachusetts Eye &AMP; Ear Infirmary, says, ``More than a third of the
patients who come to see me and are ready to have the surgery
realize that it's not the best procedure for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornmehl, also a leading laser surgeon in Greater Boston, says
he turns away four of every 10 patients who come through his door.
And TLC, the largest laser surgery network in North America, says
all of its patients must be 18 or older and have an eyeglass
prescription that has not changed for 6 to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Siesta, a 21-year-old art history major at Princeton,
heard the cautionary notes sounded for students like her but last
year decided to go ahead with the operation. It was partly that
she'd had the same prescription for nearly three years, and that
her eyes got tired from using glasses and contacts during long
hours of studying. She now is convinced she made the right decision
_ in no small measure because it helps her substantially when she
plays catcher, first base, or right field on the Princeton softball
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is crisper and clearer,'' she says. ``Oh yeah, and
I see the ball better. When I told a couple of my teammates about
it I could see their wheels turning. People definitely will think
about the laser surgery now that they know someone who had it
done.''

   &UR; OFF THE KOHALA COAST, Hawaii: x x x all in here.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We drove a short distance from the cultural center to a heiau, a
traditional stone temple platform and thatched lean-to built in the
dried lava on a point of land next to multi-million dollar homes.
The lean-to houses a beautifully polished outrigger canoe; the
stone platform is etched with a 10-foot circle delineating the 32
points, or ``houses,'' of a traditional Hawaiian star compass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information is all around us,'' Kuali'i said. ``The job of a
navigator is to be sensitive to it and to understand what it all
means.''
</P>
<P>
   The position of the stars and moon, the color of the sky, the
shape and size of the clouds, the temperature of the water, the
appearance of certain birds _ it's all valuable data for a master
navigator. As Kuali'i spoke, a green sea turtle poked its head out
of the water and craned his neck in our direction, as if listening
for tips.
</P>
<P>
   Swells, for example, may seem random to an untrained eye, but
there are eight distinct patterns of size and frequency rippling
across the Pacific. Navigators use them to stay a course when
clouds block out the stars and sun. With this method, a master can
detect even subtle changes in course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Mau put me in charge and laid down to get some rest.
After 15 minutes he woke up from a sound sleep and said, `Hey, what
you doing?' I'd let us drift a few degrees off course, and even in
his sleep he could tell by the tiny change in the pitch and roll of
the canoe.''
</P>
<P>
   To measure speed, a navigator will drop a piece of orange peel
off the front of the canoe and count the seconds it takes to reach
the back.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   GUIDED BY THE STARS
</P>
<P>
   As it grew dark, stars began to appear above the dark bulk of
the Mauna Kea volcano. The positions where they rise and set are
the most accurate tools for a navigator, Kuali'i explained.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiians use many of the same stars and constellations as
Western navigators _ with some local twists. Looking up into the
night sky, Kuali'i pointed out something I hadn't realized was
possible: Due to Hawaii's unique latitude, one can see both Polaris
_ the North Star _ and the Southern Cross at the same time.
Generally, the Polaris is visible only in the Northern Hemisphere,
the Southern Cross in the Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaiians, of course, have their own names and mythology for
these constellations. For example, there are no scorpions in
Hawaii, so the constellation we call Scorpio the Hawaiians call
Kamakau Nui O Maui _ ``The Great Fish Hook of the God Maui.''
Experts like Thompson are able to use the positions and relative
heights of certain pairs of stars to determine latitude with
surprising accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   For Hawaiian navigators, the most beloved star of all is
Arcturus, which they call Hokule'a _ ``the star of joy.'' At its
zenith it is directly over the latitude of the Hawaiian Islands, a
welcoming beacon to homesick sailors returning from a long voyage.
</P>
<P>
   I came away from the program with a profound admiration for
navigators like Piailug and Thompson, but I didn't pick up much I
could actually use: On my way back to my hotel room I got briefly
lost.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few days later I finally got a chance to sail on a traditional
Hawaiian canoe. The Hahalua Lele is a replica of the crafts
Hawaiians once used to sail among their home islands. It looks like
a smaller version of the Hokule'a: same basic double-hulled design,
same lobster-claw sail.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Cho, a former resources manager at Volcanoes National Park
on the Big Island, based the design on the Hokule'a and replicas of
old Hawaiian canoes on display in the Bishop Museum in Honolulu.
The hulls are rounded on the bottom, rather than V-shaped like the
Hokule'a, which makes the Hahalua Lele easier to maneuver in the
big coastal surf and easier to run up onto beaches.
</P>
<P>
   It's constructed almost entirely from wood found on the Big
Island: the hulls are koa, the mast hau, the gunnels ohia. There
are just a few concessions to modernity: an inboard motor for when
the wind goes calm, and the addition of a jib, which allows the
canoe to sail well upwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days they used to paddle upwind,'' Cho said. ``Now,
even the big voyaging canoes have jibs. If our kapunas can do it,
so can we.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahalua Lele means ``flying manta ray'' in Hawaiian, and Cho
chose the name after the large, bat-like sea creatures that blocked
the canoe's path the first time he launched it.
</P>
<P>
   Cho takes tourists out on the Hahalua Lele several times a day
from the Orchid at Mauna Lani Resort, a few miles up the Kohala
Coast from the Hualalai Four Seasons. When I visited in June the
canoe was just coming out of dry dock and wasn't quite ready for
customers, but Cho took me out on a short shakedown cruise.
</P>
<P>
   On the beach at the Orchid, I held hands with Cho and his crew
as Cho recited a traditional Hawaiian sailing prayer. It went in
part:
</P>
<P>
   Ho mai ka ike
</P>
<P>
   Ho mai ke aloha
</P>
<P>
   Eola e e olae
</P>
<P>
   (``Grant us insight, grant us love, grant us life.'')
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While two crew members used large koa-wood paddles to maneuver
us out of resort's small cove, a third blew a sonorous note on a
large conch shell, a most effective ship's horn.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the crew was hoisting the distinctive lobster-claw sail.
While traditional Hawaiian sails were made out of material woven
from lau hala leaves _ pandanus in English _ the Hahalua Lele,
Hokule'a and other modern Hawaiian canoes use Dacron, which is much
easier to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The lobster-claw design of the traditional Hawaiian sails _
wider at the top, narrower at the bottom _ allowed canoes to catch
the wind while in the troughs of big swells, Cho believes. It also
made it easier for crew members to maneuver on the small deck
between the hulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked really well _ still does _ but Hawaiians dropped
their sail design for the white man's version shortly after he
arrived,'' Cho said. ``I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Winds were light the day we went out, but what little there was
the Hahalua Lele's sail snared efficiently as we glided silently
through the blue waters off the Big Island's northwest coast. Above
us loomed the hulking volcano Mauna Kea; across the channel rose
Haleakala on Maui.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal cruise, tourists are told about traditional Hawaiian
voyaging, weave sun visors from coconut leaves and are fed such
local fare as fresh coconuts and apple bananas. Our abbreviated
voyage was too short for that; I spent the time taking a Hawaiian
language lesson from crewmember Mele McPherson, who became fluent
at the University of Hawaii in Hilo.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, I understood that Cho's command of huli akau meant
``turn right'' and huli heuna meant ``turn left,'' and that the
Hahalua Lele was, technically speaking, a wa'a kaulua _ a
double-hulled canoe.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Hawaiians, McPherson is eagerly immersing herself in a
culture that is making a remarkable comeback after being all but
exterminated by missionaries and plantation owners in the 19th and
20th centuries. The inspiration for that renaissance, she said,
came from her fellow mariners and their voyaging canoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symbol for us, the catalyst,'' she said, ``was the
Hokule'a.''

TRAINING IN THE TUNDRA FOR A TRIP TO MARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've just arrived on Mars as part of the first human mission
to the frigid, nearly airless world. You stare in horror as you
realize that crucial parts of the habitat that was to be home to
you and your crewmates _ your protection against howling winds, icy
temperatures and relentless ultraviolet radiation _ are lying
smashed on the ground after a landing failure. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   You make do and you improvise, that's what. Some 50 million
miles from home, there is no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   The situation on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic was not
quite as desperate as this scenario. But it was close enough to
provide some interesting lessons about the challenges that lie
ahead for the first Mars explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and volunteers from the nonprofit Mars Society, along
with a phalanx of journalists, were at the remote outpost last
month for the construction and initial testing of a simulated Mars
base, called the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station, designed
as a place to test methods and equipment that astronauts may
someday use to live on and explore the red planet.
</P>
<P>
   At first, despite the howling winds, everything went according
to plan. Four crates of habitat sections _ curved panels of
fiberglass that were to be assembled into a 27-foot-diameter,
24-feet-high ``landing capsule'' _ were successfully dropped by
parachute from a cargo plane, far from their target, over rough
terrain, but intact.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the crucial fifth crate separated prematurely from its
parachute 1,000 feet up. As the team of would-be Mars explorers
watched, it smashed to smithereens, destroying a crane they needed
to assemble the base, along with the module's floor panels, and a
trailer for hauling the rest of the equipment back from where the
crates fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real object lesson,'' Society president Robert Zubrin
said in an interview. ``When we go to Mars, things are going to go
wrong. We're going to have to find alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody is planning to send humans to Mars anytime
soon. NASA has been busy devising mission strategies, but it would
require a presidential decision to begin drawing up formal plans.
In the meantime, advocacy groups such as the Mars Society are
pushing for such an initiative, arguing it could be carried out
within a decade for less than the cost of the Apollo moon landings.
</P>
<P>
   This Arctic simulated base, designed to resemble structures that
could serve as living quarters and research labs for a year or
more, is an attempt to speed up the process by helping to develop
the equipment and techniques that will be needed on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   After last month's air-drop failure, the Colorado-based
construction crew flown in to assemble the simulated Mars base on
this barren terrain concluded that, unless replacements for the
smashed equipment could be found, it would not be safe to proceed
with construction. They hopped on a plane and headed home and it
appeared that the ambitious $300,000 project, funded by private
donations, was dead even before it began _ at least for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the team, including the project's leader, NASA
scientist Pascal Lee, continued to explore alternatives, but they
were resigned to the possibility that construction just might not
be possible under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, said Zubrin, a longtime believer in the importance
of human beings for planetary exploration, where a relentless
resourcefulness and determination to survive and prevail despite
adversity could prove crucial. With the society's annual meeting a
few weeks off, and the success of the Mars base planned as its
centerpiece, he was desperate to find a way to salvage the project
rather than accept a long delay.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by Zubrin, the team rallied and started brainstorming.
</P>
<P>
   Fiberglass panels that were to form the interior decks of the
two-story module were smashed beyond repair. But the team
eventually found ways to improvise replacements from plywood
obtained at Resolute Bay, the nearest town _ two hours away by
chartered Twin Otter. An old baggage cart was fixed up to replace
the trailer. But how could they assemble the dozen outer panels of
the cylindrical module _ weighing nearly 800 pounds each _ without
the ruined crane?
</P>
<P>
   Zubrin, a ravenous reader of history, happened to have with him
a book about ancient construction methods, which gave him hope.
After all, he reasoned, the Egyptians built the pyramids, and the
Druids built Stonehenge, without any cranes. This would be a lot
easier than those projects.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, a plan began to take shape, based on what Zubrin would
later describe as ``Roman construction methods,'' with a few
concessions to modernity.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a NASA researcher who has been leading scientific research
teams at the research site for four years and would bear ultimate
responsibility for the outcome, carefully reviewed every detail
with an eye toward ensuring the safety of all concerned; nobody
wanted to risk injuries on a project that was to be both an
important research program for the space agency and the crown jewel
of the year-old Mars Society's endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, after long and arduous days with teams pulling
on ropes, prying panels with levers, and slowly pulling panels into
place with pulleys and winches (the winch was electric, one of the
few modern technologies that ended up playing a part), the habitat
was completed. Local Inuit youths had been hired to help, and even
the journalists pitched in (``I wouldn't give them interviews
unless they helped,'' Zubrin saidsmugly). Construction was finished
two weeks behind schedule, and in the end everything went together
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting structure looks something like a municipal water
storage tank with windows _ a two-story-high white cylinder with
portholes on the side and a skylight on top, and a simulated
airlock (a chamber with inner and outer doors) for for its
entrance. It is designed to hold crews of up to six people for test
runs of up to three months, during which they will study the
geology and biology of the surrounding rugged terrain, using
spacesuits, rover vehicles and other tools being developed for a
real Mars mission.
</P>
<P>
   And the way this first season turned out may bode well for such
eventual missions. ``It's absolutely a story of human perseverance
and resourcefulness,'' Lee said. ``It took resilience, it took
luck, it took close calls, deep breaths, pauses and rethinking. . .
. It took humans, and that's the big lesson I will take from this
field season.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, on Mars there won't be plywood to be scavenged or locals
to be hired. Still, ``in a fundamental sense, it's the same
thing,'' Zubrin said. ``We're going into the unexpected; we're
going to have to do things in a lot of different ways than were
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, although the season of field work was cut short by
the delays, the team was able to spend a week working inside the
simulated Mars base, and began to learn the kinds of lessons that
are the heart of the whole project. In planning a real human
mission to Mars, Lee explained, there is no substitute for trying
things out under the most realistic conditions possible to find out
what works _ and what doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Already, after testing a prototype Mars spacesuit developed by
Hamilton Sundstrand (makers of the spacesuits worn by space shuttle
astronauts), the team concluded that they may want to change the
stairs leading into the habitat to make it easier to climb them
while wearing the bulky suit.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a small example, Lee said, but he is confident that,
as they test spacesuits, rover vehicles, and tools and equipment
for geological and biological investigations, ``I anticipate we'll
learn big lessons there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they were also learning about the real environment of
Devon Island, chosen because it is one of the few places on Earth
that recreates many of the key features that will be encountered on
Mars. In the years he has been studying the barren Arctic
landscape, similar in composition and topography to much of the
Martian landscape, Lee has already learned a few things that could
end up drastically revising scientists' sense of what Mars was like
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he has found channels and valleys in the frigid
terrain that are eerily similar to river channels that have been
seen on Mars. While most geologists have taken these channels as
evidence that Mars once had a climate much like that of Earth _ far
warmer and wetter than Mars is today _ Lee said that similar
features formed on Devon Island even under a climate that was
always as cold as it is today.
</P>
<P>
   While it is too soon to draw firm conclusions, he said, the
findings could end up rewriting the climatic history of the red
planet.
</P>
<P>
   In the years to come, the new research station should continue
to provide both a base for real research on this unusual and
fascinating terrain, and a test bed for technologies, tools and
methods of working that are being developed for eventual use by the
first humans to someday set foot on an alien planet.
</P>
<P>
   In thinking about how humans will get to Mars and begin
exploring this alien world, Lee said, most of the attention has
gone into the mechanics of getting there, providing basic means for
survival, and getting back home. ``There has been relatively little
attention to what you're going to do there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, after all, that's the whole point of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   For example, what is the best strategy for planning an
exploration of unfamiliar terrain and starting to study its
geology. Does it make more sense to do a quick, wide reconnaissance
and then pick areas for more systematic study, or to start slowly
and gradually widen the circle of exploration? Even on Earth, he
said, ``nobody pays attention to how field work is done from an
operational standpoint. How do geologists work?''
</P>
<P>
   Such questions need to be answered in detail, he said, before
setting out for an environment as hostile and unforgiving, and as
far away from any hope of help or rescue, as Mars.

GAS COOKING, VS. ELECTRIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I've heard that proponents of macrobiotic diets recommend
cooking with a gas flame instead of an electric burner ``so that
the food's energy won't be adversely affected.'' Is there any
scientific basis for this belief? Isn't a BTU a BTU?
</P>
<P>
   K.B., Pembroke, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Your intuition is indeed correct _ the macrobiotic notion
sounds like gobbledygook. There are some differences in how you
provide heat to food, however, and they're worth keeping in mind.
Microwaving food is based on heating water in the food and it's
difficult to get over the boiling point of water. Cooking with a
gas flame tends to give you better control over the heat than you
get with an electric burner since the temperature of the stove
reacts more quickly to changes in the heat setting, so chefs tend
to prefer it.
</P>
<P>
   Any details of how you cook food can, in principle, change the
energy content of the food but, if you're just cooking in a pot or
a pan, there should be no difference.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, the reference to ``energy'' refers to some
sort of pseudoscientific, touchy-feely, new-age nonsense, and
doesn't correspond to the usual concept of energy measured in BTUs,
or any other units.

<P>
   Looking for an unforgettable weekend, or just a great place to
visit anytime? Then head to the Basketball Hall of Fame in
Springfield, Mass. especially during the Oct. 13-16 Enshrinement
Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend includes not only the enthrinement of six people who
have risen to the top of their game, but also the groundbreaking
for the new Basketball Hall of Fame. The weekend includes the music
of Grammy Award-winning artist Bruce Hornsby during ``Overtime,'' a
new event designed to give those who attend this annual event the
opportunity to mingle with some of basketball's greatest
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The present Hall of Fame was opened in 1985 in Springfield, the
birthplace of basketball. The hall includes a three-level
entertainment center and museum with interactive exhibits that
honor the game's great players, teams, coaches, and officials.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest exhibits is a collection of basketball cards
of Jack McCue. The collection dates from 1911 to 1993 with the
majority from the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   A special Enshrinement Weekend package is available through
Sports Travel (888-310-HALL or www.basketballroadtrips.com) that
includes all events and ranges in price from $275 to $995 a person.

   The newly opened Trout Point Lodge in Nova Scotia is offering
Food Learning Vacations that include seafood cookery, cheese
connoisseurship, wild foods, even French New World Cuisine _ using
the culinary techniques and ingredients of the culturally French
areas of North America. ``We approach food and cooking more from
the ingredients side of things than most other chefs or cooking
schools,'' says Vaughn Perret, who along with Charles Leary and
Daniel Abel moved to Nova Scotia from Louisiana two years ago after
selling Chicory Farm, which had made a name in producing
European-style cheeses, growing organic foods, and operating a
Creole restaurant in New Orleans. The 10-room lodge grows all its
own foods, and uses local seafood. For information, call
902-749-7828 or visit www.troutpoint.com. The food vacations are

<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Mass. _ Aging golf great Hale Irwin threw away his
contact lenses after he had the laser eye surgery that is becoming
the hottest of high-tech fixes for high-powered athletes across
America, including five Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin can now line up a 20-foot putt with his naked eye _ but he
can no longer read the date on his wristwatch. He needs his glasses
to make out the press badge of a reporter standing directly in
front of him. And when he plays in a tournament like the
FleetBoston Classic at Nashawtuc Country Club, the 55-year-old
Irwin has to bring along a mirror with high-octane magnifying power
to let him remove an eyelash or other particle that might land in
his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has heard golfing wizard Tiger Woods trumpet the
laser procedure knows that it can eliminate the need for glasses or
contacts, enhancing an athlete's performance. What they may not
know is that anyone over 40 who has it may be trading
nearsightedness for farsightedness, the way Irwin did. Or that
legions of aspiring athletes college-age and younger are begging to
get the operation in hopes of realizing a competitive edge _
without realizing that they may need more surgery as their vision
matures. Or that Woods and other stars are being paid to proclaim
just how wonderful laser surgery can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We giveth and we taketh away,'' cautions Dr. Alan Kozarsky, an
Atlanta-based eye surgeon who performed the laser procedure on
Braves ace Greg Maddux and White Sox outfielder Jeff Abbott.
``We'll give you great distance vision but you'll lose near vision,
and for a lot of older people who are active in sports that's a
great tradeoff. But if you're a secretary or librarian, where your
whole life exists around reading and you don't do outdoor
activities, you'd be out of your head to have this kind of
corrective surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   As for aspiring athletes who are trying to emulate their sports
heroes, Kozarsky, like most responsible physicians, refuses to do
laser surgery on anyone under 18 and will treat older youths only
if it is clear their eyesight has stabilized and their eyeglass
prescription hasn't changed in at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a young athlete who is completely tolerant of
contact lenses and do perfect with them, then leave it alone,'' he
advises. ``You won't do any better with this laser surgery than
with the best set of contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   What gets doctors even more steamed is the way high-profile
sports stars are hyping the laser eye operation the same way they
might endorse sneakers or golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, personally, it's distasteful,'' says Dr. Ernest
Kornmehl, medical director of Brookline's Center for Laser Vision
Correction and a spokesman for the American Academy of
Ophthalmology. ``It's unfortunate that that's the way that medicine
has gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to hear at the end of their testimonials that `this
is a paid announcement.' It would be nice if they let people know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Kornmehl and his colleagues question athletes'
claims that they benefit from the newfangled laser surgery. They
know the testimonials are true, especially with someone like Woods,
whose eyesight was so impaired before the operation that he was,
according to one source familiar with his case, ``legally blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation that athletes are getting these days is called
LASIK, which stands for laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis. It
involves carefully cutting a small flap in the center of the cornea
or outer coating of the eye, reshaping it with an intense beam of
laser light until it corrects that patient's particular vision
problem, then replacing the flap. The only drugs needed are drops
to numb the eyes and maybe a Valium to relax nerves. The laser part
generally is over in under a minute and the entire procedure lasts
less than 15 minutes per eye.
</P>
<P>
   The results generally are spectacular. A couple of hours after
surgery, patients who were nearsighted _ which means they had
trouble seeing distant objects _ suddenly can read the Fenway
scoreboard without contacts. Likewise for those who were farsighted
and for the first time can find their way to the bathroom in the
middle of the night without bumping into anything or having to
reach for their glasses. LASIK also can clear up astigmatisms, the
wrinkles or other defects that blur vision. All without the pain,
glare, and scarring that sometimes accompanied earlier techniques,
and with such easy recovery that both eyes can be done at once.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of how well LASIK works is how many people are having
it: 360,000 patients underwent the procedure in 1998, the first
year it was approved for general use by the US Food and Drug
Administration. Last year there 846,000 operations nationwide, and
this year there are expected to be nearly 1.5 million _ almost as
many as the long-popular cataract surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The real breakthrough, however, is even more recent and has as
much to do with what's happening on the playing field as in the
operating room. It is one thing for an aging aunt or a loud-mouthed
neighbor to boast about the wonders of some novel medical
treatment. It is quite another when Trot Nixon attributes his
newfound hitting prowess to his eye-opening laser surgery, or when
Woods emerges from his operation to win an astounding three majors
in a year.
</P>
<P>
   The operation has become so popular among sports figures that
not even the teams can keep up with who has had it. In the case of
the Red Sox, club officials knew about Nixon, Jose Offerman, and
John Valentin, but not about newer arrivals Mike Lansing and
Bernard Gilkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helped me a lot,'' says sidelined third baseman
Valentin, who had the surgery in December to correct an astigmatism
that gave him ``a fuzz. I couldn't see the scoreboard that well,
the lights were more blurry,'' Valentin said. ``I really saw the
ball better in spring training, but I only played in nine games
during the season so I can't really tell the difference it would
have made.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey was equally ebullient: ``It worked for me. I was
farsighted and had an astigmatism. It corrected my vision. It's
amazing what you can do with technology.'' As for Lansing, who had
the operation two years ago, he now has ``less dust in my eyes''
than when he was relying on contact lenses. The operation, he adds,
was so free of pain and hassle that ``it's just like having your
tonsils out.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods says he had complications at first: ``One day, everything
would be blurry, the next day it would be perfect. I remember in
the third round of the Disney (his first tournament back after his
October 1999 surgery), I shot 66. The problem was, the first nine
holes, I couldn't really see.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, Woods adds, his eyes ``stabilized'' and now
``I'm able to see things the same way each and every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The benefits are obvious for major leaguers, who struggle every
day to get a bead on baseballs being hurled at upwards of 90 miles
an hour, and for golfers, who have to track even smaller balls on
faraway fairways. But the sight-improving surgery also has helped
hockey goalies like Jeff Reese of the Maple Leafs focus on pucks
slapped their way, hoop stars like Orlando's Harvey Grant steer the
ball to the basket, and scores of football stars, race car drivers,
and even wrestlers do what they have to do in their sports.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the big thing is improved eyesight, but just as often
it is eliminating the inconvenience and occasional discomfort of
wearing glasses or contacts. And for a few select athletes like
Woods, the positive surgical experience has translated into a
positive financial one, with laser surgeons signing them up for
endorsements. (TLC Laser Eye Centers, the network of more than
12,000 doctors that Woods endorses, declined to say what it pays
him, but sources say he is enough of a TLC fan that he signed up
for substantially less than he gets for other endorsements.)

<P>
   The first Globe Theatre, which opened in London in 1599, lasted
only 14 years. It was destroyed by fire in just an hour, and
although no one was injured, a man's breeches did catch on fire.
Fortunately, a quick-thinking person extinguished the flaming pants
with a tankard of ale.
</P>
<P>
   The new Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, we suspect, will have a lot
more luck. With its re-created 16th-century theatre, its
interactive exhibit area, and its restaurant and cafe, the Globe is
a pleasant place to spend a few hours. Whether you're attending a
play or not (the theater season runs mid-May to the end of
September, and you should book early), do visit the all-oak theater
and listen to the guide's tales of how it was in Shakespeare's day.
Among the facts:
</P>
<P>
   --Many audience members couldn't read, so a flag atop the
playhouse would alert them that a play was going to be given.
</P>
<P>
   --Those who bought the low-priced standing room in front of the
stage were nicknamed groundlings, or penny stinkards. They ate
garlic, you see.
</P>
<P>
   --Elizabethans rarely bathed. They thought it was bad for their
health.
</P>
<P>
   --Thieves in the crowd were known as cut-purses, for obvious
reasons. If caught, they faced hanging.
</P>
<P>
   --Apples were sold for eating, or, if you wished, throwing at
the actors.
</P>
<P>
   (Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, which was completed in 1997, is in
Bankside, about 200 yards from the original site. Tickets for plays
range from about $13 to $40. Adult admission to the extensive
Shakespeare's Globe Exhibition is about $11.50. (And it's worth it
just to hear the recording of Marlon Brando delivering the ``lend
me your ears'' oration.) For more information, call 020-7902-1400
or visit www.shakespeares-globe.org. For more information on all of
London, call 800-462-2748 or visit www.LondonTown.com.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Where in London will you find St. Stephen's Tower?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: London ``is not a pleasant place; it is not agreeable, or
cheerful, or easy, or exempt from reproach. It is only
magnificent'' _ Henry James. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A word about dining: Now that we're on the cusp of a new
millennium, it's time to discard the 20th-century notion that
London dining is uniformly bad. It just isn't so, and hasn't been
for some time. Today, the city has more than 6,000 restaurants
featuring the cuisine of 60 nations. London, in fact, boasts 27
Michelin-starred restaurants, more than any city outside Paris.
Four restaurants that we have fond memories of after our most
recent visit: Bluebird (350 King's Road), light and airy in decor
and serving contemporary cuisine; Pescatori (11 Dover St.), a good
before-the-theater spot for seafood with an Italian touch; the Rib
Room and Oyster Bar at the Hyatt Carlton Tower (Cadogan Place) for
dishes such as Irish rock oysters and the traditional roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding with a modern twist; and McDonald's at
Heathrow Airport (well, we had only 20 minutes before our plane was
to start boarding). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to go: You don't go to London for the weather, so consider
visiting off-season, as we usually do. All the history and culture
and just plain fun are still there, and off-season vacation
packages by British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are among the great
travel bargains. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Dome lives on: Come 2001, London's Millennium Dome will be
converted into a Euro-themed amusement park. A Japanese-financed
company will take over, and attractions are expected to include a
yellow submarine, a vehicle made famous by the Beatles. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A fashionable exhibit: Contemporary fashion photography will be on
display at London's beloved Victoria and Albert Museum Sept.
28-March 18. The exhibition, titled ``Imperfect Beauty,'' will
examine the work of acclaimed fashion photographers, stylists, and
art directors. For more information, call 44 020 7942 2000 or visit
www.vam.ac.uk. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? At Parliament. You may know the tower better by
its nickname: Big Ben. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every worrywart has imagined the scenarios: a golfball-sized
kidney tumor that goes undetected until it has spread
uncontrollably; clogged arteries whose first symptom is a fatal
heart attack; a seemingly innocuous cough that turns out to be lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden death lurking somewhere in the body, giving no hint of
its presence until it is too late, is many people's worst medical
nightmare. Now, with high-tech tools making it possible to view
people's innards with increasing ease and precision, a growing
number of people want a peek under the hood _ even if they have no
symptoms and it's not covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing number of doctors are ready to oblige. Through
radio and Internet advertising, tests once used only on patients
diagnosed with disease, or at least suffering from symptoms, are
now marketed to people with nothing more than a family history of
disease, or even just a touch of hypochondria. Want a computed
tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or a
positron emission tomography (PET) scan that can detect malignant
tumors? You can get one, for a price.
</P>
<P>
   In a trend that has drawn fire from some physicians, clinics
across the country _ from La Jolla, Calif., to Jacksonville, Fla.,
Cleveland and the Cooper Clinic and Aerobics Center in Dallas _
offer head-to-toe CT scans, for $2,000 to $3,000. The Army ordered
similar scans for 4,000 soldiers this year, for $1 million. And
Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center this year became the
first in New England to offer a hotly debated ``heart scan,'' an
increasingly popular $400 CT scan that checks for calcium in the
coronary arteries, which can indicate arterial blockage before
symptoms appear.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Melvin E. Clouse, the hospital's vice chairman of radiology,
dismisses head-to-toe CT scans as ``overkill,'' ``a shotgun
approach,'' ``a California thing.'' But he is a true believer in
the heart scan for men over 40, women over 50, and anyone with a
family history of heart disease, arguing that seeing the white
calcium on the computer screen can spur people to make lifestyle
changes and avoid bypass surgery later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I`m on a mission,'' he said. ``I'm worse than a Baptist
minister on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouse is Boston's flash point in a fierce debate within the
medical profession over high-tech screening of people with no
symptoms: Is it a prevention movement that will save lives and
ultimately cut health-care costs? Or is it medical make-work that
wastes resources and leads to unnecessary worry and followup tests
that could end up harming patients?
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is obvious: The tests are noninvasive, except for low
doses of radiation, and, in an extreme case, could save your life.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis G. Fryback, a professor of preventive medicine at the
University of Wisconsin, cautioned against the emotional appeal of
individual stories like the one about the Los Angeles police
officer who got a full-body CT scan on a whim and found a malignant
tumor on her kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Far more frequent, he said, are the false positives. For
example, a lump shows up on the scan, prompting invasive, sometimes
dangerous tests, which show it was nothing to fear. Or, in a more
subtle case, the scan finds a cancer that might never have
progressed to be a threat, but once found, must be treated, at
greater risk and cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an imperative to treat,'' said Fryback, who served on
a federal advisory council that in 1996 recommended against routine
prostate cancer screening for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have an incentive to offer unnecessary scans, not only
for the up-front payment, but for the followup tests, he said.
``We're creating this whole industry, and you can bet it's money
that's driving this.''
</P>
<P>
   Reimbursements paid by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts
for CT scans rose 17.3 percent from June 1998 to June 1999,
according to the company. And Imatron, a South San Francisco
company that makes the $1.8 million electron beam tomography
scanner used to look for coronary disease, sold 19 units last year
and expects to sell 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive officer S. Lewis Meyer said it is not Imatron
but insurers who are too concerned with money. He said insurers
have stayed away from covering the test because it leads to more
prescriptions for $700-a-year anticholesterol drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anne Meneghetti, director of health care policy at Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the state's largest insurer,
said the company pays for the test if a managed-care doctor
recommends it, though she could provide no data on whether that has
happened. The company's indemnity plan does not cover the test for
asymptomatic patients; not because of money, she said, but because
of doubts about effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Cardiologists and the American Heart
Association last month declared that the calcium scan does help
indicate coronary disease, but should not be used for widespread
screening until research clearly shows it prevents more deaths than
conventional lifestyle monitoring and cholesterol testing. Such
research eventually led to the acceptance of routine mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   Clouse said he doesn't want to wait, repeating his mantra,
straight from the AHA: ``Every year, 150,000 people die of their
first, last and only symptom of coronary artery disease: a fatal
heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Close has had more than 500 patients since he started
advertising last winter on sports talk and other radio shows. On
the screen in front of him one recent afternoon was the heart of
James Major, 51, depicted in 3-millimeter slices. He traced the
arteries _ left coronary, circonflex, right coronary _ and used a
mouse to circle the white spots that showed calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Major, an advocate for special education schools from Holliston,
said he was already working to keep his cholesterol down because
two paternal uncles ``dropped dead of heart attacks in their 50s.''
But the powerful image of his own arteries on the screen, he said,
would be an additional motivator.
</P>
<P>
   Clouse said patients sometimes get upset at the sight; one man
had to be sent to the emergency room for a panic attack. But Major
was calm. ``I feel a lot better when I know about a problem and am
working on a solution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar debates are going on in different specialities around
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts General Hospital doesn't actively market its
$3,500 full-body PET scan to people without symptoms, but Dr. Alan
J. Fischman, head of nuclear medicine, said about a dozen
approached him for the tests in the last year, including a member
of the Saudi royal family who was so pleased with the negative
result that his cousin flew to Boston to get one for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Fischman said preventive use of the PET scan _ which detects the
rate of glucose metabolism, highlighting fast-growing malignancies
_ might be worthwhile for a few patients with an extremely strong
family history of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in terms of overall use of health care dollars, it's a
disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, staff radiologist Dr. Michael Zalis is slowly
compiling a study of colonography testing, which uses CT technology
to produce a three-dimensional image of the inside of the colon.
Since the process is far less unpleasant than the traditional
colonoscopy _ in which the patient must empty their bowel and have
a tiny camera threaded along the colon _ he hopes it will
eventually prompt more people to get screened.

   Tests such as the heart scan need additional research to more
closely pinpoint when coronary disease becomes a threat, said Dr.
Richard Nesto, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Lahey
Clinic in Burlington. But it is promising, he said, especially for
areas with few specialists, where it could be offered at a mobile
clinic, as mammograms are today.

   ``People out there are hungry for a new test that isn't
painful,'' he said.

   And, he added, the advertising is working: ``It's the only test
that patients ask for.''

   MEXICO-LALOBA _ CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico _ ``La Loba,'' the
She-Wolf, is the intimidating nickname of Guadalupe Buendia, a
woman said to have amassed wealth and power in this vast slum of
1.2 million people next to Mexico City. Buendia was a local fixture
of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI -
which tolerated her abuses. Through a network of nepotism, she kept
herself and her family in charge here for years. But they did
little to improve conditions; garbage is picked up by donkeys and
carts, running water and toilets are luxuries. One woman blames her
for a barrage of bullets fired through her door one recent night.
La Loba is now under arrest, charged with organizing a murderous
attack on a political rival who had defeated her machine in a
recent election. The story of how she controlled people's lives
here reflects a political culture Mexico is struggling to put
behind it. (Ferris, Cox News Service) WITH PHOTOS.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A frenetic swarm hovers above a tall maple tree near Jamaica
Pond in Boston. Hundreds of male mosquitoes fly in small vertical
bursts, a dance of lust, waiting for mates in the evening breeze.
</P>
<P>
   A female spots the gathering and glides upward. It is time for
the central task of her short life _ to give birth. Any father will
do.
</P>
<P>
   She plunges in. Within seconds, a male locks on to her, grabbing
her scale-covered abdomen from below. Their wings stop beating.
They are belly to belly, drifting to the soft grass below. There,
the male, within a minute, completes his task.
</P>
<P>
   Now, comes the dangerous part, but only for the female. Though
the male's work is done, she needs blood to mature her eggs. She
points her antennae upwind. It can sense the carbon dioxide exhaled
by a potential blood meal from a hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps she'll find a person.
</P>
<P>
   In this season of the West Nile virus, the female mosquito has
become something more than a nuisance. Mosquitoes have infected
five people in New York with the occasionally-fatal virus so far
this year, and dozens of infected birds in the Boston area raises
the risk of human sickness in the region. But the chances are slim.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the world _ Southeast Asia, Africa, Eastern
Europe _ she is far more feared, even public enemy number one
because of the diseases she carries. Malaria, the world's leading
communicable disease besides tuberculosis, kills more than a
million people annually. Cases of dengue fever, a flu-like disease
that is sometimes lethal, are up 400 percent since the 1970s.
Yellow fever is rarer, but its symptoms are so horrific _ including
bleeding from orifices and kidney failure _ that the name inspires
fear. All are transmitted by female mosquitoes simply following
their mothering instincts.
</P>
<P>
   But the jet plane has unwittingly aided the spread of these
viruses, making it more difficult for Americans to think of
mosquito-borne disease as something that happens only in the
tropics. An infected person from India flies to New York, is bitten
by a local mosquito, which then begins to spread the virus. That is
how the West Nile virus likely arrived on our shores from Africa.
New York, in fact, has seen a small burst of malaria cases
recently, the result of malaria-carrying visitors whose blood
spread the disease among local mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   But our mosquito is unaware of all this. She bears no malice. To
those who study her, she is a beautiful, efficient creature, an
evolutionary marvel. It just so happens she is a lifeline for
perhaps the simplest of all beings, the virus, a creature that can
only survive if it finds a host to sustain it. She takes viruses
from host to host, where they multiply and flourish, bringing
sickness and death in the process.
</P>
<P>
   But the mosquito does not know this.
</P>
<P>
   So this, then, is a biography of the female mosquito. It is a
simple life, dedicated to children. And it is a dangerous life,
with hundreds of predators and a lifespan of usually a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Our pregnant female is on the hunt for a blood meal. The
thousands of tiny hairs on her antennae can sense moisture, lactic
acid, carbon dioxide, body heat and movement. In the distance, she
spots something _ a man, lazily dozing at dusk on a park bench. He
is wearing shorts. His calves are exposed. She goes in.
</P>
<P>
   Her proboscis, a tiny needle-like apparatus, extends. She sinks
it an eighth of an inch into the skin. Then she begins furiously
jabbing, 15, 20 times. Like a blind nurse, she is searching for a
blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, she is secreting salivary fluid. When a blood
vessel is punctured, the fluid prevents the blood from clotting. It
will flow freely into her. Later, it will cause the man to develop
a tiny, itchy red bump. It is his immune system's reaction to the
strange fluid.
</P>
<P>
   It is at this point that she can transmit virus. Even if no
blood vessel is found, the virus will seep into the body and
quickly begin replicating.
</P>
<P>
   And it is here where nature seems most diabolical: Viruses
disable mosquitoes' salivary glands. This makes it harder for them
to draw enough blood. As a result, they must bite many more hosts
than usual. More bites means more spread of virus. In essence, the
virus is forcing the mosquito to help it flourish. Scientists call
the ploy ``ingenious.''
</P>
<P>
   Our female has finally struck blood. In minutes, it fills her.
Her weight increases by 250 percent. Her body becomes a bloated red
sack. It is too much. She begins urinating drops of blood on the
man's skin. He swats his legs. She flies off.
</P>
<P>
   But the blood sac is still too heavy for flight. She finds a
vertical surface, a tree, and sits urinating the unneeded blood for
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Inside her, the blood triggers ovarian activity. For three to
four days, it nurtures her eggs. Then it is time to expel them.
</P>
<P>
   In a catch basin at the side of a Jamaica Plain road is a small
pool of rancid water. It is still. Green scum floats on it. It has
been there for days. Perfect. She gently sits on the surface. The
eggs roll out from her body. Several hundred tiny white eggs. They
bunch together in a raft, all connected and floating. The raft is
about an eighth of an inch long. Within 30 minutes, the egg raft
has a black color. Her work is done. She flies off. She will never
see her children.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, the eggs will hatch. Little aquatic larvae
will emerge, swimming with a jerking, slithering motion. Many will
eat their brothers and sisters. Most will feed on the floating scum
in the water. A few of the offspring may get any virus that the
mother carried, but, for the most part, the females will have to
contract diseases on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three days later, they will become full adult mosquitoes.
They will fly off, all looking for sugar, in honey dew or flowers,
for sustenance. Then, the life cycle repeats itself as the males
will begin their mating swarm and the females will seek a mate.
</P>
<P>
   Our female, having just given birth, seeks to do it all again.
But she doesn't need another male. She still carries some of the
first one's seminal fluid. She just needs more blood.
</P>
<P>
   But with each birth cycle, she grows more weary. Scales have
fallen off her slender body. She has lost a leg. Her wings look
ragged. The color of her two eyes, which dominate her head, has
dulled.
</P>
<P>
   That makes her more vulnerable to the swat of human hands or the
predations of predators. In this case, she does not see the
dragonfly behind her as she decends toward the storm drain of a
house, looking for a place to lay her eggs. With a hard crunch, the
massive dragonfly seizes her.
</P>
<P>
   Her short life is at an end.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the end of her legacy _ or the West Nile virus.
Even the cold of winter, the strongest defense that this region has
against tropical diseases, doesn't wipe out Culex pipiens, the
species of our now-dead mosquito and the species that carries the
West Nile.
</P>
<P>
   As the days grow shorter, the female offspring of Culex pipiens
stop producing new young. Instead their bodies become efficient
food storage machines, allowing them to survive the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most of the hibernating insects will die, some will
survive in a torpid state until the spring warmth revives them.
Then, any disease carrying females begin the cycle of infection
again, spreading the virus with each blood meal.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why public health officials, while urging people to
remain calm about the hazard, now believe that we must simply get
used to the West Nile virus.

SONGS, SCENERY INTOXICATE ALONG THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SWANNANOA, N.C. _ One thing that became very clear very fast was
that going to a music camp _ or a sports camp or anything else
along those lines _ is not the ideal way to see the sights of a
region.
</P>
<P>
   The exception, in the case of the Swannanoa Gathering, a
summer-long series of music camps at Warren Wilson College here,
came only when you might lift your eyes from your instrument _ in
my case, a fiddle _ and look across the river valley to the
progressively rising ridges of the aptly named Blue Ridge
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It could sort of be Vermont, but the hills are sharper and a
good deal higher _ a few miles off, Mount Mitchell at 6,684 feet is
the highest US peak east of the Mississippi _ and the forests that
cloak them seem a darker shade of green. (And then there is the
smoky haze that prompts the equally apt name ``Great Smokies'' for
the mountains not far to the west, along the Tennessee border.)
</P>
<P>
   Closer at hand and to the fiddler's uplifted eye, the trees are
of a size and character that a Vermont winter could not support,
great oaks and hickories that seem as if they never stop growing
taller and spreading farther.
</P>
<P>
   An early visitor, passing through the valley of the Swannanoa
River leading a military expedition against the Cherokee Indians,
paused long enough to call it ``an Eden land.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was little pausing for the 200 or so fiddlers, pipers,
harpists, bodhran players, and dancers on hand for Celtic Week, the
first of Swannanoa Gathering's seven week-long music camps at
Warren Wilson College.
</P>
<P>
   The Scotch-Irish heritage has always been strong in Appalachian
music; July's Celtic Week focused on the traditional music as it is
played today in the old countries. Appalachian music, bluegrass,
and contemporary folk music would be the focus of later weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Celtic Week's participants ranged from enviably talented
youngsters to older players, many of whom had taken up the fiddle
or other instruments only recently.
</P>
<P>
   The day started early and ended late _ or, more precisely, early
the following day _ after a full round of classes and workshops,
with concerts and dances in the evening and impromptu jams
afterward. A beer wagon with three local microbrewery beers on tap,
stationed across from the dance and concert hall, was a nightly
gathering place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep deprivation'' was accepted, even welcomed, as proof of
the experience _ and as Douglas Orr, the guitar-playing president
of Warren Wilson College, put it, ``you can catch up on your sleep
after you go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Swannanoa is one of many traditional music camps around the
country this summer. Just concluded is the acoustic music week
sponsored by WUMB, the UMass-Boston radio station, at Lake
Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. Farther afield are camps on Cape
Breton Island in Nova Scotia and others built around fiddle stars
like Mark O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   They are so much a part of the summer scene that Laura Risk of
Medford, Mass. _ who with Washington, D.C.-based Elke Baker was one
of the two Scottish fiddle instructors at Swannanoa _ had already
done three fiddle camps, including the Pinewoods Camp on Cape Cod,
and was booked for two more on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Swannanoa's Celtic Week ended with a literal bang, an explosive
crash of lightning. It sent a final Irish jam _ with South
Boston-based Brendan Bulger, who was one of a trio of fiddlers
playing for the impromptu dance in near-darkness _ scrambling for
shelter as a front of wind-driven rain swept through.
</P>
<P>
   Fiddle camp's end allowed a day to explore beyond the college's
handsomely maintained lawns and gardens _ all done, like just about
everything else at Warren Wilson, by its students during their
mandatory 15 hours of work each week.
</P>
<P>
   The neighboring city of Asheville _ the thinly disguised
``home'' of Thomas Wolfe's classic novel ``You Can't Go Home
Again'' _ was left for another time.
</P>
<P>
   But as an intriguing alternative, there was Black Mountain, just
5 miles east of the college, which advertises itself as the ``front
porch of western North Carolina'' and appears to be steering a
tenuous path between historic preservation and touristy kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow streets of its historic downtown _ all four of them _
are lined with art galleries, craft studios, and
antique/collectible shops. The Town Hardware and General Store, on
Main Street, has the look of a store where time stopped a
generation or two ago. One shop you are unlikely to find elsewhere
is Song of the Wood, which makes and sells plucked and hammered
dulcimers _ and is filled with their gentle twang.
</P>
<P>
   As for places to eat, a quiet block off Main Street holds the
Black Mountain Bakery, which serves lunch on a tree-shaded terrace.
Out-of-town newspapers are enough of a rarity in these parts that
the Dripolator Coffeehouse on Main Street advertises them in the
front window.
</P>
<P>
   The town was the site of Black Mountain College, something of a
counterculture legend, which flourished for some 25 years before it
sputtered out in the mid-1950s. Buckminster Fuller put up his first
geodesic dome there and Allen Ginsberg said his outraging poem
``Howl'' ``represented the voice of counterculture that Black
Mountain College also represented.''
</P>
<P>
   The college is long gone, but there is a small display of
photographs and other memorabilia at the Swannanoa Valley Museum on
Main Street, along with other exhibits on the region's life and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the Blue Ridge Parkway beckoned, but we indulged in
only a brief excursion to get a feel for just how beautiful a
mountain-and-forest highway can be, since the need to find a quiet
spot under a tree to work on some newly learned Scottish fiddle
tunes beckoned far more strongly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVINCETOWN, Mass. _ When Stanley Kunitz is working in his
garden, admiring passersby will often ask if it's his. Kunitz tells
them he is only the hired hand. ``They used to believe me,'' he
says with a soft chuckle, ``but nobody does anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   True, it's hard to believe a 95-year-old works as a gardener's
assistant, pruning and weeding every morning. It's even harder to
believe it when the 95-year-old is perhaps America's most
distinguished living poet, an eminence underscored last month when
Kunitz (pronounced CUE-nits) was named US poet laureate, a post he
will assume in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful selection,'' said Peter Davison, poetry
editor of The Atlantic Monthly and himself a poet. ``Stanley is
going to hold the office as a symbol of dedication to a life in
poetry. He has been a symbol, and a guide, to a couple of
generations of poets already.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz, whose ``Collected Poems'' is to be published in October,
has won the National Book Award and the Bollingen and Pulitzer
prizes. (He also represents a less-lustrous, if more common,
experience for American poets: No fewer than eight publishers
rejected the book for which he won his Pulitzer, ``Selected Poems
1928-1958.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems so appropriate at the beginning of a new century
to have somebody who knew almost everybody in the last century,''
said Prosser Gifford, director of scholarly programs at the Library
of Congress, which oversees the laureateship.
</P>
<P>
   Just out of college, Kunitz sent a sheaf of his poems to
Marianne Moore at The Dial, the most distinguished American
literary magazine of the '20s. She wrote back, ``We shall be
delighted to publish them.'' Robert Lowell and Theodore Roethke
were two of his best friends. His students and proteges include
such well-known poets as Carolyn Kizer, James Wright, Louise Gluck,
and Robert Hass (himself a former poet laureate).
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz personifies more than just a century's worth of poetry.
To be in his presence is to feel connected to a century's worth of
human experience. He had a horse-and-buggy boyhood _ literally. At
9, in Quinnapoxet, a hamlet near Worcester, where he grew up,
Kunitz drove a carriage, working as a lamplighter. The first
automobile he saw was a Stanley Steamer (no relation, he likes to
say). He's seen Halley's Comet twice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's the future he focuses on. ``I never think of myself as
having outlived my useful existence,'' he said. ``I don't wake up
as a nonagenarian. I wake up as a poet. I think that's a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pinsky, the current poet laureate, marvels at Kunitz's
``vigor'' and ``feisty energy.'' Though hunched and bent over,
Kunitz moves with an easy stride. He still has a martini before
dinner and every night goes to his desk, working until a few hours
before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poems are there,'' Kunitz says, ``but they lie under the
debris of the life. One has to dig for them very much harder than
one had to at the beginning when poetry is so largely, in one's
youth, a glandular activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky sees ``absolute conviction in the lyricism'' as the most
distinctive feature of Kunitz's poetry. ``There is no doubt or
irony about the central importance of poetry for the human spirit.
He manifests that loftiness of calling in every line and
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz started out writing a relatively formal and somewhat
opaque verse. Over the years, his writing has become, as he put it,
``simpler, more open, more intimate.'' He has remained true to his
early masters: Keats, Hopkins, late Yeats, the Metaphysical Poets,
and Blake.
</P>
<P>
   A fascination with nature is the great constant in Kunitz's
poetry. (It has also been a constant in his life: Before he began
to tend his garden, Kunitz twice tried his hand at farming.) ``I
have lived in the country most of my life,'' he said. ``I need it
desperately. Urban life is satisfying for the moment, but for
refreshment and restoration of my primitive impulses I need the
country or the seashore: the natural world.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Kunitz played in woods and quarries on the outskirts
of Worcester. It's hard to imagine the environs of New England's
second-largest city as an outpost of the natural world, but it was
in the 1910s. It's just as hard to imagine it as a hotbed of
poetry. But Kunitz's contemporaries Elizabeth Bishop and Charles
Olson were Worcester natives, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz went to Harvard, where he studied under the celebrated
philosopher Alfred North Whitehead and knew the future head of the
Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was a year behind
him. Graduating with a summa cum laude degree in English in 1926,
he planned to get a doctorate, but dropped out after getting his
master's, having been informed that ``Anglo-Saxons would resent
being taught English by a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz worked as a reporter and editor on The Worcester
Telegram. His most memorable assignment was covering the Sacco and
Vanzetti trial. It was also the most eventful: Vanzetti's letters
so impressed him he went to New York to try to find a publisher for
them. Kunitz failed in his mission, but ended up staying there.
</P>
<P>
   His first book of poems, ``Intellectual Things,'' was published
in 1930. He supported himself editing literary reference books,
something he would do off and on for the next few decades.
</P>
<P>
   There were his two attempts at farming: first in Connecticut,
then Pennsylvania. His first marriage failed. His second marriage
produced a daughter, Gretchen, but it also ended in divorce. Kunitz
married again, in 1958. His wife, Elise Asher, is a painter and
poet.
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz was a conscientious objector during World War II. Even
so, he was drafted and served in the Army, rising to the rank of
sergeant. He got his revenge on the military 20 years later when he
and Lowell organized the protest against the Vietnam War in 1965
that turned the White House Arts Festival into what he once proudly
termed ``a passionate fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Roethke got Kunitz hired to teach at
Bennington College. He later taught at the New School, Brandeis,
the University of Washington, and Columbia, among other
institutions. ``I never accepted tenure,'' he said, ``because I
recognized that it would be fatal for me to be a professor who
wrote poetry rather than a poet who had a job in the academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1957, Kunitz and Asher have divided their time between
Provincetown and Greenwich Village. Kunitz is a founder of the Fine
Arts Work Center in Provincetown, and Saturday a ceremony was to be
held rededicating the Stanley Kunitz Common Room there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had visited Provincetown in the '30s when it was a sleepy
little fishing village,'' he said. ``I never forgot walking on the
beach . . . and there were all these women in sunbonnets and long
flowing skirts. That's changed quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   What's also changed quite a bit is the 2,000 or so square feet
of front yard he so diligently tends from June to October. It began
as a sandbank, Kunitz proudly notes, ``without a single blade of
grass on it.'' He brought in soil, laid down seaweed and compost,
built terraces, transforming it from barrenness to lush splendor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To conquer a piece of earth,'' he says, ``an area of earth,
and make it as beautiful as one can dream of it being: That is art,
too. A man cannot be separated from the earth. I come out of the
garden every day feeling, oh, inspired in a way that one needs in
order to convert the daily-ness of the life into something greater
than that little life itself.''

LAUREATES RANGE FROM HONORARY TO EVANGELICAL

<P>
   The concept of poet laureate is British: an official court poet,
appointed by the king or queen. The first was Ben Jonson. Other
notable poet laureates have been John Dryden, William Wordsworth,
and Alfred Tennyson. The current British laureate is Andrew Motion.
Like his predecessors, he is paid about $300 a year and a cask of
white wine.
</P>
<P>
   The US poet laureateship began in 1937 as the position of
consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. In 1986, Senator
Spark Matsunaga, a Hawaii Democrat, added the title ``poet
laureate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction when Congress passed the law,'' said
Stanley Kunitz, who is laureate-designate and was poetry consultant
from 1974 to 1976, ``was that no one can be poet laureate. . . . We
are such a diversified culture that to assume one is actually the
poet laureate of the American people is vainglorious.'' He added
with a laugh, ``But one does the best one can.''
</P>
<P>
   The job pays $35,000. Duties are few: Give a reading at the
start of the laureate's tenure, deliver an essay at the end, and
help organize the library's literary programs.
</P>
<P>
   The three most recent laureates, Rita Dove, Robert Hass, and
Robert Pinsky, have redefined the post from one that was almost
entirely honorary _ ``Life will go on exactly as before,'' said
Robert Penn Warren upon being named first laureate _ to one that
has become almost evangelical.
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky has kept up a particularly energetic travel and speaking
schedule, which has led some to question whether a nonagenarian
like Kunitz is up to the job. ``It was a remarkable performance,
and nobody will ever duplicate it,'' Kunitz said. ``Naturally, I
don't intend to be _ how shall I phrase it? _ sedentary, though I
have no intention of being as much of an activist as Robert has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   US Poet Laureates have included: Robert Penn Warren, 1986-87;
Richard Wilbur, 1987-88; Howard Nemerov, 1988-90; Mark Strand,
1990-91; Joseph Brodsky, 1991-92; Mona Van Duyn, 1992-93; Rita
Dove, 1993-95; Robert Hass, 1995-97; Robert Pinsky, 1997-2000; and
Stanley Kunitz, 2000-01.

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute Main
Dish takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast &AMP; Fresh
gives you dinner in about 20 minutes. 
 
 The Working Cook: Mixes Can Help You Through the Week  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Products promising delicious instant meals
continue to flood the market. These flashy new items _ like
precooked pasta and marinara sauce in a fancy black plastic bowl
that's not only microwaveable but can be used as a serving dish _
can obscure the better instant products we've come to depend on.
<P>
   Thai curry pastes fall into the tried-and-true category.
Available in super-concentrated form, they only need a few things
added to them _ fish sauce, coconut milk, a handful of basil _ and
the end result can be surprisingly good.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Calamari with Thai Green Curry Sauce takes advantage of
squid, which often are overlooked even though they are inexpensive
and easy to cook. The spicy, aromatic dish is brightened with fresh
summer vegetables like red bell pepper and yellow squash.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it helped me get through college, I'd almost
forgotten about instant falafel mix. The product is widely
available and the crunchy, savory balls just need a few fixings,
like the tomatoes, greens and easy tahini sauce in today's
30-Minute Main Dish. If you feel like it, make extra falafels
because they stay crisp even when reheated the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The third recipe, Chicken Paella, doesn't really utilize any
quick-cooking products, but it shouldn't take more than an hour to
prepare and can be frozen for later meals. A kind of California
twist on classic Spanish paella, it features poultry sausage,
sun-dried tomatoes and a little kick of cayenne.
</P>
<P>
   Paella can be really difficult to cook. The trick is to use a
wide and shallow pan so it will cook evenly and form a bit of a
crust on top. This one might seem to have too much liquid at first,
but much of the liquid evaporates and it's necessary for even
cooking.

curry paste, coconut milk, broth, brown sugar and fish sauce; bring
to a simmer. Add the calamari, snow peas and basil leaves. Simmer
for 2 minutes, until the squid are just cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish each serving with basil sprigs and the optional
radishes.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  Jarred Thai curry pastes are available in many markets.
For a less spicy curry, use a bit less of the green curry, or
purchase yellow curry paste, which is milder.

   FALAFEL WITH TAHINI YOGURT SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is meant to be served family style, which means
diners put together their own falafels. Don't use high heat to fry
the falafels or they will brown on the outside but be raw on the
inside. It's a good idea to cut one in half as a test before you
remove all of them from the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups falafel mix (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups water, or follow package directions
</P>
<P>
   1 small garlic clove
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup tahini
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt + salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 ripe tomato
</P>
<P>
   6 parsley sprigs
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 ounces baby greens
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup canola oil + oil for frying
</P>
<P>
   4 large pita breads, cut in half
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Put the falafel mix in a bowl and stir in the water. Set aside
for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, finely mince the garlic and combine with the yogurt,
tahini, 1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice, the salt and cayenne
pepper. If necessary, thin with a few teaspoons of water for a
saucelike consistency. Transfer to a serving bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Core and chop the tomato and place in a small serving bowl. Pick
the parsley leaves from the stems (discard stems) and toss with the
greens in another serving bowl. Dress with the oil and a squeeze of
lemon juice; toss again.
</P>
<P>
   Form the falafel mixture into balls about 2 inches in diameter.
Flatten them slightly. You should have about 4 falafels per person.
</P>
<P>
   Set out a platter lined with paper towels. Fill a medium skillet
with enough oil to come halfway up on the falafels. Place over
medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the falafels (but don't crowd
the pan; work in batches) and fry for 6 to 8 minutes, turning once,
until golden brown on both sides. Using a slotted spoon, transfer
to the paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining falafels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat the pita breads in a warm oven, then keep them
warm in a napkin-lined basket.
</P>
<P>
   Bring everything to the table and let diners help themselves,
filling their pitas with falafels, greens and tomato, then topping
with the tahini sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

   CHICKEN PAELLA
</P>
<P>
   The green beans in this recipe are quite crisp, which gives the
dish a fresh flavor. For softer beans, add them at the beginning of
the cooking process.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 chicken thighs (about 11/2 pounds total)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon paprika
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper, stemmed, deribbed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups long-grain rice
</P>
<P>
   5 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of saffron
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   8 sun-dried tomatoes, minced
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups frozen peas, defrosted
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces spicy smoked poultry or pork sausage, cut into thick
slices
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   Lemon wedges for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Remove the skin and excess fat from the chicken. Cut each thigh
into thirds, cutting lengthwise along the bone. Season the pieces
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Add enough oil to a large, wide, heavy skillet to cover the
bottom of the pan. Place over medium-high heat until almost
smoking. Add the chicken and saute until browned, turning as
necessary. Remove the chicken from the skillet with a slotted
spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Add the paprika, cayenne and onion to the pan. Saute for 3 to 4
minutes, or until just softened. Add the bell pepper and garlic and
saute for 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the rice to the pan, stirring to coat it with oil. Return
the chicken to the pan. Add the broth, 2 teaspoons salt, and pepper
to taste. Bring to a boil, then add the saffron and stir until it
dissolves. Reduce heat to maintain a steady simmer; simmer for 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the green beans, tomatoes and peas to the pan and simmer for
5 minutes. Check the rice; it should be tender. If not, simmer for
5 to 10 minutes longer. When the rice is done, cover the pan and
let rest no longer than 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a little oil in a skillet; add the sausages and saute over
medium-high heat until browned on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the paella topped with the sausages and minced parsley.
Garnish with lemon wedges.

supermarkets.  
 
 Taster's Choice: One Brand Creams Its Peanut Butter Rivals   By Robin Davis  
 c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  So you're getting ready to make brown-bag lunches
for your children again, but you want to cut the fat a bit.
Reduced-fat peanut butter may be an option, but not all brands are
alike.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted four different reduced-fat peanut butters
and found one overwhelming favorite. All of the brands had 12 grams
of fat per 2-tablespoon serving, versus 16 grams for full-fat
peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   By a large margin, the panel preferred  &UR; Laura Scudder's &LR;  (16
ounces, $2.99 at Safeway). All the panelists liked the exceptional
peanut flavor _ this brand contains 90 percent peanuts, while the
other brands are 60 percent peanuts. The panel also liked the dark,
rich color. One panelist described this as ``a more grown-up peanut
butter.'' All would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Safeway &LR;  (18 ounces, $2.39 at Safeway).
All the panelists noted that this was sweeter than Laura Scudder's,
but many thought children would like it. Two noted a gritty
texture. Three would buy it, one might buy it and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jif &LR;  (18 ounces, $2.79 at Andronico's) came in third. One
panelist thought it didn't have enough peanut flavor, but another
thought the nutty taste was good. Two panelists disliked the gritty
texture. One would buy it, one might buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Skippy &LR;  (18 ounces, $2.59 at Safeway).
Panelists thought this brand was the sweetest. Two panelists
detected a chemical plastic-y flavor; others thought it lacked
peanut flavor. None would buy it.
</P>

the seemingly endless information is often as confusing as it is
enlightening. With Food in the News, The Chronicle's Food staff
aims to change that. This round-up column will make practical sense

 Food in the News: Boomers Need Spicier Food   By Kim Severson  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; America's restaurant customers are entering a
meatier, spicier, more experimental phase, according to a
collection of industry trends culled by the California Restaurant
Association.
<P>
   And people are spending more money at restaurants, eating more
take-out food and searching for food they can eat on the move, says
John Dunlap, president of the 3,500-member restaurant association.
</P>
<P>
   He outlined the trends at the Western Foodservice and
Hospitality Expo last week in San Francisco, where 1,100 companies
displayed the latest in large-scale kitchen equipment, mass-market
food and popular drinks for 28,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Spice is a big trend, Dunlap says. Last year, Americans used
over 3.1 pounds of spices, a pound more than used a decade ago. And
between 1992 and 1996, some 2,300 new spices, extracts and
seasonings were introduced in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Salsa and sauce makers also reported increases. The Mexican
sauce market is up about 15 percent over last year, and hot pepper
sauces have jumped by 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, he says, is the Baby Boomer generation.
</P>
<P>
   As the boomers age, their taste buds are becoming less sensitive
and they crave hotter, more flavorful food. That's the operating
principle for some of the vendors at the Expo, who targeted boomers
with items like a spicy, smoky chipotle version of the popular
cheese-stuffed jalape &LR; n &LR; o and spicier versions of chicken wings,
salsa and sausages.
</P>
<P>
   On the upscale level, restaurants are increasingly incorporating
Nuevo Latino food. Look for dishes with corn, plantains, chiles and
tropical fruit, reflecting a growth in the United States' Latino
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Among other trends Dunlap cited: &QL; 
_ As people's lives become increasingly busy and technology changes
more aspects of daily living, restaurants will serve as peaceful
respites from daily life. Dunlap says restaurants that position
themselves as offering a ``high peace'' experience will be popular
antidotes to a ``high pace'' lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   _ When it comes to health, people aren't as concerned as they
used to be, Dunlap says. Americans are less obsessed with dieting
and nutrition than they were in much of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   _ Along those lines, beef continues its comeback. Over the
course of the last decade, Americans ate 13 percent more beef, or
7.1 million servings. A survey last year by Restaurants USA
magazine showed that 41 percent of the people asked want to see
more meat on the menu. And the number of steakhouses increased by
almost 11 percent between 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ethnic food will become more popular, with regional cooking
taking the forefront. Italian food will be subdivided into
Ligurian, Venetian or Milanese, for example. People will seek out
Pueblan, Oaxacan or Yucatan food instead of the ubiquitous Mexican
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   _ The interest in experimenting in the kitchen is rising. In the
West, in particular, people want to try new things. Almost 40
percent of people living in the western half of the United States
say they experiment with their cooking regularly and almost 30
percent say they are always in search for new and unusual flavors.

 Wine Potpourri: Cabernet Kicks Merlot to the Curb   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Anyone who doesn't believe there's a lot of
disposable income floating around in Northern California should
read the latest wine buying habits survey from the Wine Club.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compiled by Gomberg, Fredrikson &AMP; Associates, the annual survey
questioned customers of the Wine Club's three California stores in
San Francisco, Santa Clara and Santa Ana. The GF&AMP;A report notes
that 83 percent of the Wine Club's customers consider themselves
wine enthusiasts who know a lot about wine. They spend
approximately $2,000 a year in retail wine purchases and another
$500 in wine purchases in restaurants. That's big money, although
the survey notes that those high numbers aren't very different from
the results of the 1999 survey.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the committed wine drinkers told GF&AMP;A that
they enjoy wine five days a week, while 28 percent say they drink
wine every day. Now you know why rare cult wines are so hard to
find.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to two years ago, 64 percent claimed they are drinking
the same amount of wine, 28 percent say they are drinking more
wine, and 8 percent say they are drinking less wine.
</P>
<P>
   Women shoppers account for 20 percent of wine purchases at the
Wine Club, up 3 percent from last year. The breakout by age shows
those 40 years and older accounting for 86 percent of the
purchases, with 65 percent reporting incomes of over $100,000 per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay is still the most popular white wine, with 47 percent
saying they purchase Chardonnay most often ($25 is the most
shoppers would pay for a bottle), followed by Sauvignon Blanc at 30
percent (and topping out at $18). Pinot Gris, Pinot Grigio,
Riesling and Viognier together constitute less than 10 percent of
white-wine purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise in buying habits is with the red wines,
with the popularity of Merlot falling way short of Cabernet. Some
35 percent of the respondents say they prefer Cabernet Sauvignon,
while 22 percent opt for Zinfandel, 12 percent for Merlot, and 9
percent for Pinot Noir.
</P>
<P>
   Wine buyers would fork over as much as $40 for a Cabernet
Sauvignon, but only $25 for a Zinfandel. Wise shoppers know, of
course, that many a Zinfandel at $25 or less is the quality peer of
a $40 Cabernet. And who hasn't found a Sauvignon Blanc for less
than $18 that is a better match with food than a $25 Chardonnay?
</P>
<P>
   In addition to wine purchases at the Wine Club stores, 69
percent of those surveyed purchase wine from wineries, 39 percent
from supermarkets, 33 percent from club stores and 10 percent from
the Internet _ double from last year's survey. For a more in-depth
look at wine and food sales on the Internet, see the Sept. 13 Food
Section.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wine Export Success &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While wineries watch domestic wine sales inch up, the wine
export picture is not as rosy, according to a survey by San
Francisco State University business professors Rick Castaladi,
Murray Silverman and Sanjit Sengupta. Out of 240 wineries in
California and the Pacific Northwest, 44 percent are involved in
exporting, although 73 percent say their export program is not
profitable, 60 percent do not consider their export program a
success and 61 percent claim that their export program has not met
their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; More Stupid Wine Tools &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The June 21 Wine Potpourri on ``Stupid Wine Tools'' got readers
thinking and poking around for more of the same. John Blackburn
Hughes e-mailed, ``At a foodie trade show at the Moscone Center, I
saw an eyedropper-size `anti-freeze' tester, complete with pocket
clip, that has a float within the glass tube neatly graduated to
reveal the `proof' of your personal martini.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the tester qualify as a ``Stupid Spirit Tool,''
but its intent as an ``anti-freeze tester'' sends the wrong message
that could be construed as overindulgence. Anti-freeze is a
negative term for spirits that should be forgotten by everyone,
including spirits marketers.

&HT;     BUSY SIGNAL SERVICE DRAWS COMPLAINT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VANESSA HUA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A consumer group is accusing Pacific Bell of
violating state rules by interrupting busy signals with a message
that the caller can get ``repeat dialing'' for a charge of 95
cents.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Ratepayer Advocates, the consumer branch of the
California Public Utilities Commission, filed a complaint charging
that Pacific Bell, a unit of SBC Communications Inc. in San
Antonio, failed to give adequate notice and wrongfully markets the
service to customers with unpublished phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Pacific Bell started pitching the service whenever a
consumer reached a busy signal with this message: ``The number is
busy. For 95 cents, let Repeat Dialing call you back when the line
is free. To use it, just press 3. If you subscribe to Repeat
Dialing, there is no additional charge.''
</P>
<P>
   The service used to be initiated by the customer, by dialing 66,
for a cost of 75 cents. Or subscribers paid $3.23 per month for the
service. Now users just press ``3'' to activate the service.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Pacific Bell sent notices with bills explaining the
new feature, touted as an ``improvement to busy signals . . . an
enhancement to Repeat Dialing.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Pacific Bell informed the PUC that it planned to raise
prices from 75 cents to 95 cents. The PUC approved the rate
increase, but was not told about the change in the manner the
service would be offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of customers choosing to do this, Pacific Bell
interjects into the phone call,'' said Laura Tudisco, a lawyer for
the Office of Ratepayer Advocates. ``Given this was a significant
change, we think it's important that the commission should have
known.''
</P>
<P>
   A telephone company official said the change of service was
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission got back to us and told us our advice letter
had cleared, go ahead and do it. What's approval if that isn't
it?'' Pacific Bell spokesman John Britton said.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said that the repeat-dialing message does not constitute
unsolicited marketing. ``Nobody calls anyone who's unlisted. When
the line is busy, it offers a choice to use technology to help them
reach that person.''

 Learning to Cook: Gremolata Brings a Drab Dish to Life  By Marion Cunningham 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; We've all heard that tired old saying, ``It's the
little things in life that matter.'' Tired or not, this is
especially true of home cooking. A very drab dish can become bright
and sparkling with the right condiment.
<P>
   Gremolata is just such a condiment. This classic Italian
garnish, traditionally served with osso buco, is made of finely
minced garlic, lemon zest and parsley, moistened with olive oil and
seasoned with a dash of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Gremolata can provide a lively finish to a multitude of dishes,
especially bland ones like plain pasta, baked potatoes, mild soups
or rice.
</P>
<P>
   Leftover gremolata often is served with chunks of bread as a
side dish. But beware, dunking bits of bread into this heady
mixture can be addictive. Before you know it, you'll be too full
for the rest of the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Making gremolata a day ahead gives the flavors a chance to
strengthen and blend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EGGS, TOMATOES &AMP; POTATOES WITH GREMOLATA
</P>
<P>
   Make the gremolata one day ahead to allow the flavors to blend.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Gremolata
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt + salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables &AMP; Eggs
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds small red new potatoes, about 11/2-inches in
diameter
</P>
<P>
   8 eggs
</P>
<P>
   4 tomatoes, cored, each cut into 6 wedges
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; To make the gremolata: &LR;  Pour the olive oil into a pint jar
that has a tight-fitting lid. Add the lemon zest, parsley and
garlic. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Screw the lid on the jar and shake
until well mixed. Remove the lid and taste the mixture. Add salt in
1/2 teaspoon increments until the gremolata tastes well balanced.
Cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature and stir well
before using.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cooking the eggs and potatoes: &LR;  Put the potatoes and eggs
(still in their shells) in a large pot of salted water. Bring to a
boil, reduce heat and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the
potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the potatoes and eggs and put them into a large bowl,
allowing them to cool enough to handle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Finishing the dish:  &LR; Cut the potatoes into quarters and place
in a serving bowl. Shell and quarter the eggs, then add to the
potatoes. Add the tomato wedges. Using your hands, lightly toss the
eggs and vegetables, adding salt as you work. Add half of the
gremolata to the mixture and stir to combine. Add more gremolata if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Any leftover gremolata may be passed at the table. It keeps well
in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PER SERVING (using half of the gremolata): &LR;   &LR; 430 calories, &LR; 
 &LR; 18 &LR;   &LR; g protein, 38 g carbohydrate, 24 g fat (5 g saturated), 416

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ZESTING A LEMON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Using a vegetable peeler, carefully strip off the yellow skin of
the lemon. Be careful to get only the yellow part, or zest. The
white part, or pith, can be bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Stack the pieces of zest on a cutting board. Using a sharp
chef's knife, cut or chop the zest into the size pieces called for
in your recipe.
</P>
<P>
   If desired, this may be done up to 1 hour ahead of time. Place
the chopped zest on a square of wax paper, fold the paper into an
air-tight parcel and set aside either in the refrigerator or at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; CHOPPING PARSLEY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Rinse a bunch of parsley under cool tap water. Shake well to rid
of excess water. Or set aside in a colander to drain for up to 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't need a whole bunch of parsley, place only what
you'll need on a cutting board. Cut off and discard the thick
stems. Fold the parsley into a rough ball and, holding the ball
together, chop into the size pieces you desire.
</P>
<P>
   Put the remaining untrimmed parsley into a plastic bag and store
in the crisper compartment of the refrigerator. (This should keep
well for up to 10 days.)

   BOSTON _ Rachel Sweet is lying still in the intensive care unit
at Children's Hospital, tubes pumping food into her stomach,
medicine into her arm and belly, and oxygen into her nostrils, as
she waits to die.
</P>
<P>
   What could save the 6-month-old with cafe-au-lait hair and
blue-grey eyes are new lungs. But they have to come from an infant
her age, or at least her size. And they must come soon; even a mild
cold would be more than she could tolerate, her doctor says.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are not good. While Americans' willingness to offer
organs for transplantation has increased in recent years, falling
rates of violent and accidental deaths, combined with rising
numbers of people living long, healthy lives are shrinking the
availability of suitable organs. That depleted organ bank is an
unanticipated and underappreciated dark side of the otherwise
upbeat trends of declining crime rates and growing acceptance of
seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good news that safety precautions taken by people
are decreasing the underlying potential for donors,'' said Sean
Fitzpatrick of the New England Organ Bank. ``But what that means
for the medical system is we have to maximize our opportunities
with those donors who do become available at hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients needing organ transplants have always faced long odds.
Only 4 in every 1,000 people who die are medically suitable for
organ donation. Some are too old. Others have died of heart disease
that robbed their organs of blood needed to remain viable. Others
died of cancer that could have spread or of AIDS or other
transmittable ailments.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves mainly those who died of severe brain injuries _
such as car crashes, bicycle mishaps, and gunshot wounds _ so that
their heart and lungs worked until the end, keeping the rest of the
body healthy. Of that group, only about 1 in 100 are of an age that
would be suitable for Rachel.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Organ Bank has been doing what it can to improve
those odds by working closely with Rachel's parents and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel's condition is ``extremely rare,'' her doctors said. It
is called alveolar dysplasia, which, together with her pulmonary
vascular disease, means that she has too few air sacs to breath
normally and that the ones she has do not function properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She cannot breathe effectively and expends tremendous energy,
even at rest, which has secondary effects on the rest of her
body,'' said Dr. Melvin Almodovar, the pediatric cardiologist
overseeing Rachel's treatment. ``Her heart works harder to
compensate, and she can't grow and develop properly, physically and
neurodevelopmentally.''
</P>
<P>
   The only solution is to get her a new set of lungs, Almodovrar
added. Since live donations are not done for infants that small,
the donation must come from an infant or very small child who has
just died. And given the short time to do a transplant, once a
donor is found, the likeliest donors would have lived in the
eastern half of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find a donor, I am optimistic Rachel could live a
reasonably normal childhood,`` her doctor said. ``The expectation
is a 60 percent chance of a transplant recipient like her being
alive in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   As she waits for a donation, Rachel is being given medicines
through a tube in her stomach and another in her arm, along with
sedatives to prevent her from becoming agitated and putting too
much pressure on her tender organs.
</P>
<P>
   She already has been through more medical stress than most
adults experience in a lifetime, with an operation to close a hole
in her heart two weeks after she was born and all sorts of
treatments during the five of her six months she has spent in the
hospital. She has also needed help breathing from the start,
spending part of her young life living under an oxygen tent and now
getting help from a tube in her nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to call her our `little cake'; when they put the lid
on her air tank, she looked like a cake does when a restaurant puts
a lid on it,'' recalled her mother, Stacey Sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet and her husband have been staying close by Rachel since
she was moved back to Children's in June from the family's home in
Barnstead, N.H. Before she was fitted with her new breathing tube,
her mother said, Rachel was talking, saying, ``Thank you,'' ``OK,''
and ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she is just making cooing sounds like other babies, but
she's very alert, intelligent, and good with her hands,'' Sweet
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel is at the top of the list of infants nationwide awaiting
a lung transplant, but that does not mean her chances are good.
Each year there are only about 100 infant donors in the nation,
which includes those giving hearts, kidneys, livers, and all other
organs.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of potential donors is shrinking for all age groups,
but the trend is especially pronounced for those under 14, as
improved bike helmets, child safety seats, and smoke detectors have
helped cut injury-related deaths for that age group by 50 percent
in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, more than 71,000 people are awaiting organ donors,
with a new one added every 14 minutes. Last year more than 6,000
patients awaiting organs died, for a rate of 16 a day.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, the list of those awaiting organ donations
includes 3,500 names, 2,400 from Massachusetts. The region has seen
its consent rate among eligible donors rise steadily since 1995,
when 53 percent of them or their relatives said yes. Last year the
rate reached 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the number of actual donors in the region was down last
year to 174, from its peak of 198 the year before, a drop that
donor bank officials attribute to an even steeper drop in the
number of people dying of conditions that would allow them to
contribute.

 Best Way: Storing Fresh Herbs  By Amber Thompson 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; I've watched many a fresh herb lose its life right
in front of my eyes. Stems start to droop, leaves lose color and
I'm left wondering how I could have delayed the inevitable.
<P>
   So what is the best way to store fresh herbs? And does the
answer vary depending on the type of herb? To test which method is
best, we stored five herbs _ parsley, thyme, cilantro, mint and
basil _ 17 ways. We checked their appearance, smell and taste every
day for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For one set of tests, we placed the stems in glasses of water
and put one glass in the refrigerator and one on the countertop.
For another test, we wrapped the stems and the whole plant in damp
paper towels. With each set, we tested the effects of pre-washing
the herbs and covering them with plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
   Not forgetting the easy route, we also tested doing nothing _
leaving the herbs in their supermarket plastic bags and placing
them in the crisper box.
</P>
<P>
   We quickly discovered that some storage methods were detrimental
to all the herbs. Any herb exposed to open air, whether it's in the
refrigerator or on the countertop, begins to wilt within a day.
Beyond that, however, results varied from herb to herb.
</P>
<P>
   Thyme and parsley were the long-distance winners and the easiest
to care for, too. Storing them in a plastic bag _ either the one
from the supermarket or a food storage bag _ and putting them in
the crisper yielded the best results.
</P>
<P>
   Mint and cilantro demand more attention. While both were ruined
by the third day in the crisper box, they thrived wrapped in damp
paper towels, placed in a plastic bag and stored on a refrigerator
shelf. Even by day 10, the mint and cilantro had solid stems, firm
leaves and pleasant aromas.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, delicate basil flourished in a few different
storage environments. But it lasted longest when the stems were
placed in a glass of water, the leaves covered with a plastic bag,
and the herb left on the kitchen counter. If you don't have extra
space on your countertops, basil also stores well, either washed or
unwashed, wrapped in damp paper towels, covered in plastic and
stored on a refrigerator shelf. Basil also likes the crisper box.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Thyme and parsley. &LR;  Keep it simple. Store both herbs in their
original plastic bags and place in the crisper box.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Mint and cilantro. &LR;  Protect these herbs by wrapping their
stems and leaves in damp paper towels then storing them in a
plastic bag on a shelf in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Basil. &LR;  This herb thrives at room temperature. Place the
stems in a glass of water, cover the leaves with a plastic bag and
keep on the kitchen counter.

 Secrets of Success: Spago's Finesse Shows in Tea-Smoked Salmon   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Tea-smoked foods, used extensively in Chinese
cuisines, have worked their way into the Western kitchen. More and
more, you find meats and poultry flavored with tea showing up on
Bay Area menus.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best examples I've seen was devised by Michael
French, the chef at Spago Palo Alto. He's concocted a process of
tea-smoking marinated salmon fillets on top of the stove.
</P>
<P>
   The only items you need are a roasting pan with a tight-fitting
lid and a rack to fit inside the pan. The pan is lined with foil
and covered by a layer of rice, tea and sugar. The ingredients will
begin to smoke; once you add the fish, it will be done in about 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Before serving, the fillets are brushed with a plum glaze and
broiled until crisp on top, adding an alluring contrast to the
salmon. These fillets make great dinner-party fare.
</P>
<P>
   At Spago Palo Alto, French serves this dish with mixed Asian
greens dressed with a citrus-black bean vinaigrette. At home the
salmon can be served on mixed greens for an appetizer, or with
steamed asparagus or other vegetables as a main course.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon dish is typical of Spago and its sister restaurant
Postrio in San Francisco. Both have been pioneers in mixing the
flavors of Europe, California and Asia. The tea-smoked salmon is a
clever example of this often subtle marriage of East and West.
</P>
<P>
   With a bright modern interior designed by Adam Tihany, Spago has
become one of the most popular restaurants in the Bay Area. The
large bar in a building next door and the patio seating in between
the buildings makes it a perfect place during the balmy summer and
fall months.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Spago Palo Alto, 265 Lytton Ave. (near Bryant), Palo Alto; &LR; 
 &LR; (650) 833-1000. Dinner nightly; lunch weekdays. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SECRETS OF SUCCESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Stove-top smoking &LR; . The salmon takes on an exotic flavor by
being smoked in a pan layered with rice, sugar and smoldering tea
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The curing &LR; . Rubbing the salmon fillets with sugar, salt and
spices and letting them marinate for an hour adds an extra dose of
flavor to balance the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Two cooking methods &LR; . The salmon is first smoked for 10
minutes, then it's brushed with plum glaze and broiled to form a
crisp skin.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TEA-SMOKED SALMON WITH PLUM GLAZE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Salmon
</P>
<P>
   1 star anise
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   4 salmon fillets with skin (about 6 ounces each)
</P>
<P>
   Glaze
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plum wine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup mirin
</P>
<P>
   1 cup tamari
</P>
<P>
   2 star anise
</P>
<P>
   2 cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   3 cardamom pods
</P>
<P>
   Smoking Ingredients
</P>
<P>
   1 cup rice (preferably jasmine or basmati)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup loose-leaf green tea
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; To cure the salmon:  &LR; Grind the star anise and peppercorns
in a spice grinder or an electric coffee grinder reserved for
spices. Transfer to a bowl. Add the sugar and salt and mix well.
Spread the mixture over the salmon and refrigerate for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the glaze:  &LR; Combine the plum wine, mirin, tamari, star
anise, cinnamon and cardamom in a medium saucepan. Simmer over
medium heat for about 30 minutes, or until the mixture is reduced
to a glaze. Do not boil. Remove from heat, strain into a bowl and
refrigerate until chilled.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To smoke the salmon:  &LR; Line the bottom of a roasting pan with
foil. Spread the rice evenly over the foil, cover the rice evenly
with sugar and top with the tea leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Place the roasting pan over low heat until the rice mixture
begins to smoke. Rinse the salmon. Place the fillets skin-side up
on a rack in the roasting pan. Cover and smoke for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; The tea should be glowing, which depending on your
stove, may require starting at medium to high heat, then reducing
the temperature to continue the smoking process.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the fillets from the pan and brush the skin side with the
glaze. Place the fish on a broiling pan skin-side up and broil for
about 4 minutes, or until crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 AUSTRALIANS AREN'T CODDLING THEIR TOURIST ICON  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Consider the three mascots of the upcoming Olympic
Games:
</P>
<P>
   The kookaburra bird, celebrated in song for its insane laugh;
the platypus, seemingly built from leftover parts; and the echidna,
which looks like the love child of an anteater and a porcupine.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing, of course, is the kangaroo, the bounding symbol
of Australia, enshrined on the national coat of arms and on every
Australian dollar coin.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizers say their mascot choices reflect a desire to
broaden awareness of the varied wonders of Australia's native
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   But kangaroo protectionists are suspicious. They say the
exclusion of their beloved marsupial reflects the fact that in the
land Down Under, sentiment toward kangaroos is often ambivalent at
best, hostile at worst.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their status as Aussie icons, millions of kangaroos are
slaughtered each year to make dog food and leather goods. Ranchers
kill them as pests that compete with cows and sheep for precious
grazing land. And increasingly, they're being killed for human
consumption as well.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the slogan here could well be, `` 'Roo _ it's
what's for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no accident that they didn't choose the kangaroo for the
mascot,'' said Maryland Wilson, president of the Australian
Wildlife Protection Council, the leading opponent of kangaroo
killings. ``If you have a kangaroo representing the Olympics, you
can't also put it on the menu.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, kangaroo is very much on the Olympic menu. Games
organizers have chosen Edna's Table, a well-regarded Sydney
restaurant known for its wild game entrees, to provide meals with
indigenous flair at the main press center during the Olympics,
Sept. 15 to Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Jennice Kersh, the restaurant's owner, said last week she plans
to serve the world's journalists a warm salad of kangaroo fillet,
with beetroot and wild yams. She raves about its distinctive taste
_ it has a strong, slightly sweet flavor, reminiscent of liver _
and its low-fat, low-cholesterol content. Still, she knows that not
everyone is quite ready for 'roo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans are a bit squeamish about eating kangaroo, I say
you're only funny about it because your eagle isn't nearly as
succulent, so you can't eat that,'' Kersh said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the commercial use of kangaroos breaks down
along familiar lines between animal protectionists and the
industry's defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say the government-authorized wild kangaroo harvest is
cruel, ecologically shortsighted, morally suspect, and foolhardy in
terms of jeopardizing the lucrative tourist industry. ``People come
here wanting to see the streets filled with kangaroos, and we're
killing them all,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   She maintained that kangaroo shooters target the largest male
animals, particularly 6-foot red kangaroos, removing the strongest
bloodlines from the reproductive cycle. She also accused kangaroo
meat processors of using unsanitary measures, a charge fiercely
denied by industry and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the $200 million-a-year kangaroo business says
the harvest is a humane, environmentally sound, economically viable
use of an abundant and fast-growing natural resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human beings have been managing kangaroos in this country for
at least 60,000 years,'' said John Kelly, executive officer of the
Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia, the leading trade
group. ``As quickly as they reproduce, it would be courting
environmental disaster to not manage kangaroos in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the harvest reduces pressure on grazing lands and
places reasonable limits on an exploding population. With enough
water available, the number of kangaroos in a given area can
quadruple in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also defended the harvest methods, particularly when
compared with the processing of pigs, cows, and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in the level of stress is enormous,'' Kelly
said. ``A kangaroo is grazing in its enviroment, wild and free, and
then it's blinded by a bright light. One second later it's killed
by a high-velocity bullet to the head. That's humane, mate.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 60 species of kangaroo and their close
relatives, some of them threatened or endangered. Of the six
species used commercially, three of the largest and most abundant
make up 95 percent of the harvest: eastern gray, western gray, and
red. No one is certain how many kangaroos are in Australia, but it
is generally agreed there are 20 million to 50 million of those
three varieties, according to David Croft, professor of biological
science at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the government sets a limit on the number of
kangaroos that can be killed, or culled, based on population
estimates. This year, the nationwide quota is 6.5 million, Croft
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, the industry official, said only about half of the quota
will be harvested, in part because animal activists have succeeded
in slowing the growth of the kangaroo market. Some 440,000 tons of
meat were exported last year, most of it to Europe, he said. About
2 million skins were exported for leather goods, largely to Asia
and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the United States banned the import of kangaroo
products out of concern about declining numbers of red, western
gray, and eastern gray kangaroos. But rising populations prompted
US officials to lift the ban in the mid-'80s. Still, the United
States remains a relatively untapped market, importing only 45 tons
of meat and 82,000 skins last year, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   All sides of the debate agree that the issue becomes emotional
in part because of kangaroos' unusual reproductive techniques.
Whenever a mature female kangaroo is killed, it is almost certain
that one or more juvenile ``joeys'' is orphaned. That is because
female kangaroos are ``perpetually pregnant,'' Croft said, with one
joey developing in utero, one in her pouch, and one outside the
pouch still dependent on her milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the population thinks they're an expert on kangaroos,''
Croft said, ``and the other half doesn't think about them much at
all'' _ unless they are about to collide with one. ``One of the
problems is when people see kangaroos in the wild, they're often in
the road just 10 meters in front of their headlights. At that
point, the only thing they're thinking about kangaroos is, `I'm
about to lose my no-claim bonus on my car insurance.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Australians' ambivalence about kangaroos is evident almost from
the moment a visitor arrives.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, kangaroo images are a cornerstone of the tourist
industry, serving as the logo of both the Australian Tourist
Commission and Qantas Airways. Popular tours to the remote Outback
promise visitors the chance to see packs of kangaroos, called mobs,
in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, kangaroo pelts and toys made from kangaroo skins are
for sale in souvenir shops throughout Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the messages are mixed. At Featherdale Wildlife Park
just west of Sydney, tourists and Australians alike come to feed,
pet, and mingle with kangaroos. The sight of a baby kangaroo, or
joey, poking its head out of its mother's pouch prompts squeals of
excitement. And yet, the gift shop at the wildlife park sells
kangaroo hides and bags of dried kangaroo jerky.
</P>
<P>
   Sidneysiders, as residents here are known, seem to regard
kangaroos the same way Americans view squirrels. Popular support is
reserved for cuddly, cute koalas, which no one eats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kangaroos are just out there, you know?'' said Trevor
Kelly, no relation to the industry official. ``I've eaten 'em, but
only the tail's any good. I prefer steak.''

 At the Source: Chioggia Beets: Mariquita Farm specializes in 
 Italian heirloom   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 WATSONVILLE, Calif. _  Andy Griffin's and Julia Wiley's stand at
the Ferry Plaza Farmers' Market in San Francisco is heaped with
organically grown produce _ lush basil and crisp spring onions;
huge green- and red-patterned peppers; pale- and dark
green-striped, ribbed zucchinis, ruby-red strawberries, and
dusky-red Chioggia beets, all destined for the tables of the
food-savvy.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But they won't wind up on the Griffins' family table _ their two
children won't eat anything ``natural'' beyond crunchy carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Aged 3 and 5, the little Griffins' general reaction to the
bounty from their parents' Mariquita Farm fields outside
Watsonville is, ``Yucky!''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Wiley has found some devious ways to feed her
children some of this healthful produce. They both scarf up
homemade versions of Popsicles, unaware that they are mom's
strategy for feeding them strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   (She whirls equal parts berries and yogurt, milk, soy milk or
fruit juice in a blender with a little sweetener, then freezes the
resulting slush in drugstore molds with a stick in the middle.)
</P>
<P>
   That works fine for the strawberries, but you can hardly
disguise beets that way.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar dark red variety and the heirloom Chioggia beet
occupy special places in Griffin's history as a farmer. They came
precariously close to spelling his financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, when organically grown produce as well as specialty
vegetables started to take off, a shipper of organics encouraged
growers in the Watsonville area _ Griffin and his then-partner
among them _ to increase their production of beets. They planted,
they harvested and they delivered, but the checks _ due 30 days
after sale by the shipper _ failed to drop into their mail boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin finally investigated the shipper's cooler and found
pallets of beets stacked to the ceiling, unsold and soon to be
unsaleable. The farmer took things in his own hands, selling two
pallets to a non-organic shipper.
</P>
<P>
   He then went home and ripped out the remaining beets to make
room for more saleable crops. It took some years for a leap of
faith and a return to beets, which are now favorites at the market
and in the baskets Mariquita delivers in the South Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, the son of a University of California biology
professor, started his agriculture career at University of
California at Davis studying cattle ranch management. But at that
time (circa 1980), courses were mainly about which defoliant to
spray where, he recalls with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't fit the young Griffin's vision of agriculture and
life in general. So he switched majors, graduating with an honors
degree in philosophy, and became a farmer, learning the
nitty-gritty of organic farming not from books but from the fields.
He spent several years working for Warren Weber at Star Route Farm
in Bolinas, a pioneer organic farm. Then he ventured out on his
own, finally settling, with his wife, Julia, on his current 25
acres.
</P>
<P>
   The Chioggia is one of Wiley's favorites out of the 100
different herbs, vegetables and berries the couple grows. From the
outside, the beet isn't much to look at, with typical straggly
roots and dull, brick-colored skin. But cut it open and it show its
true colors _ spirals of creamy white and brilliant hues that range
from tomato red to magenta.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin says some beet lovers complain that this glamour root
doesn't have the earthiness of a ``regular'' red beet and that
Eastern Europeans are sometimes disappointed because it doesn't
impart the traditional deep color to borscht. But many cooks,
including his wife, love the sweetness of this Italian beet.

   To reap the maximum benefits from both its visual and taste
appeal, she often peels it and serves it raw, sliced paper thin on
a mandoline and lightly dressed with vinaigrette and strewn with a
few torn basil leaves.

   The children may not eat it, but just about everybody else loves
it.

BUSH'S PHANTOM PRESCRIPTION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Imagine what it takes to go to the country in the
early stages of an election campaign for president, after more than
15 months of campaigning, claiming that you offer a chance at
affordable insurance coverage for prescription drug costs for the
elderly on the basis of a ``plan'' that doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Were George W. Bush not so flagrantly dishonest, it would almost
be tempting to award him points for sheer guts. However, that would
require treating the issue as pure politics _ as he does _ and not
the serious matter it is for tens of millions of Americans for whom
having a place to live, eating, and taking medicine are often in
daily competition.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the week during which we get to see one of the weird
realities of presidential politics at work. On the one hand,
boring, wooden Al Gore is slogging away from Tallahassee to
Seattle, making speeches and holding his eternal town meetings on
health care issues. You can agree or disagree, but there he'll be.
On the other hand, the Bush campaign will be out there in another
sense, on the airwaves with at least $7 million worth of 30-second
commercials in battleground state markets, selling the plan that
doesn't exist to make drug coverage available for everyone and
using large drug company propaganda lingo to slam Gore. If Bush has
taken the time to memorize his lines, he might even be able to get
off a few eight-second sound bites for the press that contain
compatible subjects and verbs.
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned pol on the stump has been talking about his
own plan for more than a year; and after having it tested in debate
with the formidable Bill Bradley, Gore even made changes to reflect
Bradley's contribution to that debate. And that's a good place to
start.
</P>
<P>
   People forget, but as their primary tussle took shape, Gore and
Bradley represented two poles in the prescription drug issue. Gore
initially concentrated on the daily grind facing the elderly,
focusing his proposal on the regular costs of drugs taken to
control serious conditions. Bradley focused so-called catastrophic
drug costs associated with long illnesses or crises, which Gore
preferred to deal with in the context of long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   As their campaign wound down, and as fresh and much larger
official estimates of the looming budget surplus were made, Gore
grafted many of Bradley's ideas onto his own and prepared to face
the man with no plan.What Gore has been talking about for months,
committing the unpardonable sin of getting very specific, is not
that complicated. For the elderly who don't have much income,
singles making $12,000, and couples making up to $14,000 whose
earnings don't exceed 135 percent of the poverty line, Gore
proposes free drug coverage under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest _ roughly two-thirds of the 39 million Americans
protected by Medicare _ he proposes subsidized coverage at premiums
ranging from $25 to a maximum of $44 per month; there would also be
an option for the purchase of drug coverage associated with
long-term, chronic illness. The basic benefits would cover half of
all drug costs up to $5,000 and all of the costs above that.
</P>
<P>
   On the odd assumption that people want to know what the cost of
a major initiative like this would be, the Gore campaign used
government data (undisputed even by insurance and drug company
opponents) to come up with a figure of a bit more than $250 billion
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Agree or disagree, that's pretty straightforward. For most of
the 15 months Bush has been on the trail, the governor has been
putting his comparative noninterest in health care broadly and in
elderly issues in particular on display, in keeping with his
generally wretched record in stingy Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, his response has been that prescription drug coverage
needs to await a ``reform'' in medicare itself. Translation:
Cutbacks in benefits can produce the ``savings'' out of which at
least a modest drug benefit could be financed.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, however, as it has become obvious that voters
appreciate Gore's detailed attention to the issue, Bush has begun
saying he supports the ``concept'' of ``bipartisan legislation'' in
the Senate. His advisers have encouraged reporters to believe this
means a measure sponsored by Senators John Breaux, Democrat of
Louisiana, and Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, that would
offer less than one-fifth the Gore program to private insurance
companies to provide some coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, however, is that Bush will not commit to signing such
a measure. That's because he has yet to propose Medicare cutbacks
and because his ridiculous income tax cut gobbles so much of the
available ``surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a proposal, however, hasn't kept Bush from making
the patently fraudulent assertion in one of his latest ads that he
has one that will put coverage within reach of all seniors. Nor has
it kept the Republican National Committee from spending money this
week on the drug industry canard that ``big government'' will
interfere with doctors' judgments. Naturally, the Democratic
National Committee is matching that one on Gore's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if Gore and Bush were to debate competing
ideas. Until Bush thinks of one, however, it will at least be
interesting to see in the pre-Labor Day atmosphere how something
matches up against nothing.

 STATE SENATE OKS LICENSES ON HANDGUNS  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Democratic lawmakers approved a bill Monday
requiring potential buyers of handguns to get a license first _
despite the objections of Republicans, one of whom argued that lawn
mowers and microwaves can be as dangerous as guns.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters, including gun-control advocates, say mandatory
safety training for handguns will save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do (licensing) for the operation of a motor vehicle, we
should do the same for an equally dangerous piece of equipment,''
said Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, who shepherded the bill through
the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control, the chief backer of the bill, estimates that
200,000 handguns are bought each year in California.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, led by gun-owner groups such as the National Rifle
Association, argue that licensing is the first step toward
confiscating handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let 16-year-olds drive a car, but we don't let 16-year-olds
have a gun,'' said Sen. Ray Haynes of Riverside, who led GOP
opposition to the bill. ``A car in the hands of a 16-year-old is a
heck of a lot more dangerous than a gun in the hands of a
16-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Approved on a mostly party line vote of 22 to 15 by the state
Senate, the bill _ AB273 by Assemblyman Jack Scott, D-Pasadena _
now goes to the Assembly, where its passage is less certain.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill first passed the Assembly, all it did was increase
penalties for violence against schoolchildren. It was gutted by the
Senate and replaced with the measure on gun-owner licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the licensing bill is passed by the Assembly, it faces a
chilly reception from Gov. Gray Davis, who said through a spokesman
that he has no position on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis has said that he does not want to sign any gun control
measures this year.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants time for the gun measures passed last year _ a
ban on so-called assault weapons, a one-a-month limit on handgun
purchases and an end to the sale of poorly made ``Saturday Night
Special'' handguns _ to take effect before enacting more laws.
</P>
<P>
   The height of the Senate debate found Haynes railing against the
bill, saying it would do nothing to protect people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot say we are actually making the ownership of guns
safer,'' Haynes said. He said his wife, who wants a gun, would be
in greater danger because the bill makes it more difficult for her
to obtain a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawn mowers are more dangerous than guns. If you misuse your
microwave, it's more dangerous than a gun. We cannot say we're
helping people become safer by this law,'' Haynes continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most domestic violence doesn't involve a very angry person
picking up a microwave oven and using it as an offensive weapon,''
countered Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democratic governor does sign the bill, licensing would
begin July 1, 2002. It would work this way:
</P>
<P>
   Someone who wants to buy a handgun goes to the police or
sheriff's department and provides a thumbprint and proof of
California residency. That information is forwarded to the state
Department of Justice, which would issue the license.
</P>
<P>
   The thumbprint is used to run a background check on the
applicant.
</P>
<P>
   To get a handgun ownership license, a training course must be
taken. The would-be owner also must pass a written test on firearm
laws and the responsibilities of gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The gun buyer then must show an instructor approved by the state
that he knows how to shoot a gun and handle it safely.
</P>
<P>
   The price: No more than $12 for the thumbprint. No more than $25
for the license. The bill is silent on the fees that would be
charged by the training courses.
</P>
<P>
   A license would last five years or until the person's driver's
license expires, whichever comes sooner. A person could buy
additional handguns during those five years but would undergo a new
background check with each purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Felons and people younger than 21 not eligible for a license,
which can be suspended if a person does not notify the state within
10 days of a change of name or address.
</P>
<P>
   Gun owners would have to take a written test to renew the
licenses. There would be a $100 fine for any violation of the
handgun safety license law.
</P>
<P>
   The state already requires gun buyers either to take a test,
watch a gun safety video or complete a state-administered training
course before buying a handgun. A buyer also undergoes a background
check and must wait 10 days before taking possession of the
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's bill is far more comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a candidate for the Senate, is one of the Assembly's
strongest gun-control advocates. His 27-year-old son, Adam, was
killed in 1993 at a party by someone demonstrating how to use a
shotgun that he thought was not loaded.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Because most of those in the know
are dead, there is no way to prove whether Richard Nixon beat his
wife Patricia, as a new book claims. But plenty of evidence on the
record shows that during the White House years the Nixons had a
chilly relationship. Pat Nixon was probably the last president's
spouse in modern history to be ignored and pushed aside by her
husband. By MARIANNE MEANS.

AN IDIOM GIVES THAT SINKING FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the consternation of science and math adepts _ and sometimes
of usage mavens _ specialized jargon will occasionally migrate into
the general population, and rarely does it keep its original
meaning once it's being bandied about by the rabble.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still find arguments over the casual use of quantum leap,
for instance, since the original quantum leap was a small (though
significant) jump. Still, the everyday use of the term to mean
``major change'' is now generally accepted, even by scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Usage writers are still trying to rein in parameter, however,
and I've had letters protesting the ignorant use of exponential
increase and the bizarre concept of salaries 200 percent lower than
other people's. Now comes Bob Alexander with a new complaint: What,
he wonders, do we think we mean by lowest common denominator?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is generally used to refer to the people in the population
who are the dumbest, or the weakest, or the slowest, or are in
other ways inferior,'' he writes. ``For example, critics of TV
shows might say that the networks are appealing to the lowest
common denominator.'' (They might indeed, and every season, it
seems, they have more occasion to do so.) But why should lowest
common denominator be a pejorative?
</P>
<P>
   I turned for help to the sixth-grade math book I had at hand
(thanks to a family that never willingly deaccessions, as the
libraries say, a book). Heath Mathematics calls it the least common
denominator (though lowest has been an accepted alternative for a
century), but the LCD, by either name, has nothing ``low'' about
it, except that it's the bottom half of a fraction. You remember
how it's done: If you want to add 13 and 12, you have to convert
them to fractions with the same _ that is, a common _ denominator.
The LCD here would be 6, and our problem would be 26 plus 36 equals
56.
</P>
<P>
   Denominator as a mathematical term dates to the mid-1500s,
according to the Oxford English Dictionary; the first figurative
use is recorded in 1831. But in the early examples, common
denominator (often without the least) carries no stigma; we get a
reference to a common denominator language _ that is, a lingua
franca _ in 1898, with no hint of disapprobation. Just a dozen
years later, though, H. G. Wells uses the term with a distinctly
contemptuous air: ``Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common
denominator in the Club Bore, who spares no one.''
</P>
<P>
   While the neutral sense (emphasizing commonality) and the
derogatory sense (emphasizing lowness) coexisted for decades, the
negative connotations seem to have pretty much taken over in our
time: A New York Times summary of a 1973 Supreme Court ruling on
obscenity spoke of ``adjusting all sex-related literary, artistic
and entertainment production to the lowest common denominator of
toleration'' _ i.e., giving veto power to the most narrow-minded
members of a community. In 1983, the Times described a ``slippage''
of educational standards ``toward `minimum competency' or the
lowest common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   And today, when reviewers say TV shows like ``Survivor'' or
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' aim at the lowest common
denominator, they don't mean to congratulate the productions on
their mass appeal; they mean that they pander to the rabble, the
great unwashed, lowbrows and yokels, Mencken's booboisie. Sure, the
writers sometimes include themselves among the deluded masses, but
self-contempt is still contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those earlier terms of insult, though, lowest common
denominator has a nice scientific ring to it. Taken literally, it
wouldn't even be an insult: A lowest common denominator isn't
necessarily low, and common in the original term has nothing to do
with vulgarity. But the combined words, perhaps inevitably, now
suggest a contrast with a higher, less ``common,'' taste.
</P>
<P>
   And thus a term that might have connoted simply ``a level at
which we can all communicate'' has come to mean instead ``a level
to which we should be embarrassed to slip.'' Lowest common
denominator has sunk, as it were, to its lowest common denominator.

 &HT;    AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN ACCUSED BY RUSSIA OF SPYING SOON TO FACE
TRIAL
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Wasted and weary after being held for five months in a
Russian jail on charges of espionage, American businessman Edmond
Pope has little hope of going free or receiving a fair trial,
relatives and U.S. officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pope's wife, Cheri, who was allowed a two-hour visit with him in
the notorious Lefortovo prison on Tuesday, reiterated her husband's
innocence. She said his health has deteriorated so much that she is
afraid Pope, 54, who has a rare form of bone cancer, will die if
not released soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very shaky and very weak. When he does come home it is
going to take a very long time to get back the husband and son and
father that left here,'' she said, her voice cracking.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service, Russia's intelligence agency (or
the FSB, its Russian acronym), arrested Pope, an independent
businessman and former naval intelligence officer, on April 3.
Shortly after he arrived in Russia. They accuse him of trying to
steal state secrets, but have not released details of the case to
the press or to the U.S. government. Pope could face 20 years in
prison, if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media, citing anonymous intelligence sources, say Pope
was trying to buy Russia's latest torpedo technology, the same
weapon that the military was testing the day the submarine Kursk
sank, killing all 118 crewmembers aboard.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. John Peterson, R-Pa., denied this claim. Peterson,
who represents the Popes' district in Congress, explained that the
technology Pope was negotiating for was a 10-year-old underwater
propulsion system, not a weapon, that had been available on the
world market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology was not secret nor was it the latest thing''
the Russians have, Peterson said. ``The Canadian government has
bought the technology from the Russians ... how can they claim it's
top-secret?''
</P>
<P>
   The Pope case unfolded at a sensitive time in U.S.-Russian
relations, just one week after the election of President Vladimir
Putin, a career KGB officer and former head of its successor, the
FSB. For the first few weeks after the arrest, the U.S. State
Department refused to comment on Pope's circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The profile rose after President Bill Clinton met with Cheri
Pope in mid-July and promised to intervene on her husband's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But despite high-level pressure from U.S. officials to settle
the case, the Russian government appears to be pressing ahead to
try Pope. Last week, a municipal court rejected a plea by Pope's
lawyer to release the businessmen on bail so that he could seek
medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Pope's cancer is in remission but requires constant monitoring,
according to his family. He has also been diagnosed with Graves'
disease, a thyroid condition aggravated by stress. Cheri Pope, who
had dark circles under her eyes and appeared tired, said Tuesday
her husband has lost about 30 pounds while in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Court sources here say a trial date will not come before
mid-October, a situation that Peterson says is untenable, not only
for Pope but also for U.S.-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case against Edmond Pope would not hold up in court if it
ever made it to an open court of law. This case is about an agency
fighting for their budget and people who need to prove that they
are tough,'' the two-term congressman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation that will damage relations between two
countries that should be friends,'' Peterson added.

<P>
   HERMOSA BEACH, Costa Rica _ From 120 feet up in a tree in the
Costa Rican rainforest, the view of the broad, blue Pacific is
breath taking.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear howler monkeys up here, jabbering as they dance
among the branches. You might even spot a bright-winged quetzal
bird, a cute sloth or a slow-moving iguana creeping along the
forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   That's if you keep still.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Chiclets Canopy Tour, keeping still is the last thing
you do.
</P>
<P>
   You're too busy gasping for breath as you plunge off the tiny
wooden platforms lashed in the high treetops. One step and whoosh,
you're zipping down a steel cable, plummeting through the branches,
securely suspended from a harness and pulley, screaming your head
off at the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' gushed one gringo tourist, sweating from the tropical
heat and the excitement as she zipped from one high platform to
another. ``They don't have anything like this in Orlando! The
lawyers would never let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica was a pioneer in the field of eco-tourism in the
1980s, turning its lush landscape of rumbling volcanoes, high cloud
forests, rushing mountain streams, vibrant rainforests and gorgeous
deserted beaches into a nature-lover's vacation paradise.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Central American hideaway has put action
into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can raft through raging whitewater streams, mountain
bike through dense forests, kayak along unspoiled rocky beaches,
windsurf on a stunning lake in the shadow of a smoking volcano,
explore the azure Caribbean in scuba gear, horseback ride through
the rainforest or surf some of the world's best waves.
</P>
<P>
   For more tranquil souls, there are butterfly farms, orchid
farms, teak reserves, bird- and nature-watching tours, and hikes
along the rim of a volcano. There are also canopy tours high in the
rainforest treetops that let you walk on swinging bridges or ride
in suspended tramcars instead of launching into the great void
clipped to a steel cable with a harness.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think you have to be a high-adventure junkie or an
eco-freak to enjoy a trip to Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   There's also plenty of traditional vacation fare, including
deserted beaches perfect for meandering, sparkling new golf
courses, five-star hotels, day-sailing trips to nowhere, and
casinos and discos offering plenty of night-time action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much to do here,'' said Dave Klostermann, 40, a
California transplant who now runs a horseback-riding outfit in the
Pacific coast surf town of Jaco Beach. ``You can ride horses on a
gorgeous beach, kayak, white-water raft, mountain-bike, surf or
take a canopy tour. But it's also a great place to just hang out
and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   The message appears to be getting out. Costa Rica is now Central
America's top tourism destination, luring more than 1 million
visitors in 1999 who spent nearly US$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They are drawn by the tiny country's natural beauty, the long
list of activities and Costa Rica's reputation as a peaceful,
relatively prosperous oasis in the midst of a region marred by
poverty, civil war and unstable governments.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors spent decades embroiled in wars and
dictatorships, Costa Rica abolished its army in 1949, investing the
money in developing the country's infrastructure and social
services.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary leaders also jumped on the conservation bandwagon
early, and have set aside nearly 25 percent of Costa Rica's
territory as nature preserves or national parks. There are more
than 75 such parks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The country offers a staggering array of flora and fauna: more
than 9,000 species of plants, including 1,200 varieties of orchids
and 800 different types of ferns. As for animals, there are more
than 850 species of birds, while 10 percent of the world's
butterflies call Costa Rica home. There are more than 5,000
different species of grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   And it's all so close together. Wedged between Nicaragua and
Panama, with the Caribbean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the
west, Costa Rica is only 200 miles long. You can drive almost
anywhere in the country within a day _ although be warned: the
roads are notoriously rough and can be dangerous after dark as
livestock and wild animals like to bed down on the warm pavement.
</P>
<P>
   But driving around Costa Rica is fun. Rent a car in the Central
Highlands at the capital, San Jose, and within a half-hour, you can
be hugging curves on a high mountain road, zipping past coffee
bushes planted on unbelievably steep terraces.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later and you can be standing on the rim of the Poas
Volcano, or dodging drops at the La Paz waterfall. Half an hour
more and you can be touring a butterfly farm, then hiking in the
rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   The country is actually made up of several distinct ``climate
zones,'' and the weather can vary from hot and dry to summer
monsoon to surprisingly brisk. The rainy season runs from May to
December, and the high tourist season, which is dry, lasts from
January until May.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular destinations are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Arenal Volcano, about five hours northwest of San Jose. This
5,000-foot peak is one of the country's most active, and regularly
throws off showers of sparks and smoke. Hiking to the rim is not
recommended, although you can hike along the slopes and see plenty
of dramatic action.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You can also windsurf on Lake Arenal in the volcano's shadow,
enjoying some of the most predictable high-wind conditions in the
world. Rental equipment is available at several resorts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also in this area is the Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological
Preserve, which has earned a reputation as one of the most
outstanding tropical reserves in the Americas. Take a guided tour
and you may glimpse any of the hundreds of species of animals
living here, from pumas to exotic moths to 30 species of
hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About three hours southwest of San Jose, beach-lovers flock to
Manuel Antonio National Park, a small but gorgeous park bordering
the blue Pacific. Visitors can sun on magnificent white sand
beaches, or hike through the park's rainforest, where they are
almost guaranteed to see monkeys, sloths, scarlet macaws and other
exotic wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with your beach picnic, as the monkeys are notorious
thieves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For whitewater rafting, enthusiasts have their choice of
multi-day trips that include camping by the river or one-day
excursions that range from the relatively tranquil Rio Corobici to
wild, high-adrenaline rapids on the Rio Reventazon. More than a
half-dozen companies offer guided trips, with most departing from
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For those interested in a more relaxing time, several
companies offer daylong sailing cruises on both the Caribbean and
the Pacific. Most stop on nearby islands, and some offer gourmet
picnic lunches so that visitors can delight their palates as well
as soak up sun and sand.
</P>
<P>
   While Costa Rica has been in the news lately for a few
high-profile crimes against tourists, most veteran travelers will
recognize that it is still much safer than other Latin American
countries. Petty theft is a problem, but robberies and more serious
crimes are still rare. Visitors who take reasonable precautions
should have few problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costa Rica really is a utopia,'' said David Reid, 56, owner of
Calypso Tours, who moved to Costa Rica 30 years ago and helped
pioneer the country's tourism offerings with his daylong cruise and
gourmet lunch adventure. ``It's such a beautiful place. There are
more people now than before, but there's still so much to do and
see.''

<P>
   ---------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO GO: The rainy season runs from May until December. The
dry season, which lasts from January to May, is the most popular
time to visit. However, prices are higher during the dry season and
it doesn't rain all the time during the wet season, so you might
consider a summer visit. Climate ranges from cool in the central
highlands year-round to steamy along the coasts during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Many major U.S. carriers, including American,
Delta and Continental, have daily flights to San Jose, Costa Rica's
capital, from cities including Houston, Atlanta and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND: All international flights arrive in the capital,
and unless you are staying at an all-inclusive resort that offers
transportation, you'll likely need a rental car. Traffic is bad in
San Jose, but outside the capital, it thins out and driving can be
a gorgeous adventure, with curvy mountain roads and stunning views.
Watch for potholes and road repair crews, as well as livestock and
rural residents, who use the highway as a sidewalk. You will need a
4-wheel-drive vehicle during the rainy season if you plan to visit
a volcano or rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY: In San Jose, you can find everything from US$15
barebones rooms to a luxurious new five-star Marriott built in the
midst of an old coffee plantation, where rooms start at US$150 a
night. Outside the capital, there are lots of hotels with varying
price ranges in the most popular tourist destinations, including
Puerto Viejo and Limon on the Caribbean and Tamarindo, Jaco Beach
and Quepos on the Pacific side.
</P>
<P>
   SECURITY: Crime against tourists has unfortunately been
increasing in Costa Rica but the country is still relatively safe
compared to other Latin destinations. Petty theft is very common so
don't leave items unattended, even in a locked car. Take the same
common-sense precautions as in other strange places: don't walk
alone at night; don't carry and flash lots of cash; be wary of
over-friendly strangers.
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE: The native Costa Ricans, called ``Ticos,'' speak
Spanish, but most tourism-related businesses have English-speakers.
Even in the remote countryside, Ticos are accustomed to dealing
with tourists and you'll probably get by fine even if you don't
even know how to order a ``cerveza,'' (beer) in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ACTIVITIES: The list is nearly endless. There's whitewater
rafting, mountain-biking, hiking, bird-watching,
butterfly-watching, rainforest canopy tours, cloud forest tours,
volcanoes you can hike or drive up, windsurfing, surfing, scuba
diving, beach-combing, golf, tennis, sailing and sport-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to do is decide which activities you want to try
and build a vacation around them. You could start in San Jose, do a
day-trip to whitewater raft, then rent a car and drive to the
Pacific coast for some beachtime and a tour of a rainforest. Then
move on to the Arenal Volcano and the Monteverde Cloud Forest
Preserve.

   HERMOSA BEACH, Costa Rica _ From 120 feet up in a tree in the
Costa Rican rainforest, the view of the broad, blue Pacific is
breath taking.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear howler monkeys up here, jabbering as they dance
among the branches. You might even spot a bright-winged quetzal
bird, a cute sloth or a slow-moving iguana creeping along the
forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   That's if you keep still.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Chiclets Canopy Tour, keeping still is the last thing
you do.
</P>
<P>
   You're too busy gasping for breath as you plunge off the tiny
wooden platforms lashed in the high treetops. One step and whoosh,
you're zipping down a steel cable, plummeting through the branches,
securely suspended from a harness and pulley, screaming your head
off at the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' gushed one gringo tourist, sweating from the tropical
heat and the excitement as she zipped from one high platform to
another. ``They don't have anything like this in Orlando! The
lawyers would never let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica was a pioneer in the field of eco-tourism in the
1980s, turning its lush landscape of rumbling volcanoes, high cloud
forests, rushing mountain streams, vibrant rainforests and gorgeous
deserted beaches into a nature-lover's vacation paradise.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Central American hideaway has put action
into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can raft through raging whitewater streams, mountain
bike through dense forests, kayak along unspoiled rocky beaches,
windsurf on a stunning lake in the shadow of a smoking volcano,
explore the azure Caribbean in scuba gear, horseback ride through
the rainforest or surf some of the world's best waves.
</P>
<P>
   For more tranquil souls, there are butterfly farms, orchid
farms, teak reserves, bird- and nature-watching tours, and hikes
along the rim of a volcano. There are also canopy tours high in the
rainforest treetops that let you walk on swinging bridges or ride
in suspended tramcars instead of launching into the great void
clipped to a steel cable with a harness.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think you have to be a high-adventure junkie or an
eco-freak to enjoy a trip to Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   There's also plenty of traditional vacation fare, including
deserted beaches perfect for meandering, sparkling new golf
courses, five-star hotels, day-sailing trips to nowhere, and
casinos and discos offering plenty of night-time action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much to do here,'' said Dave Klostermann, 40, a
California transplant who now runs a horseback-riding outfit in the
Pacific coast surf town of Jaco Beach. ``You can ride horses on a
gorgeous beach, kayak, white-water raft, mountain-bike, surf or
take a canopy tour. But it's also a great place to just hang out
and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   The message appears to be getting out. Costa Rica is now Central
America's top tourism destination, luring more than 1 million
visitors in 1999 who spent nearly US$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   They are drawn by the tiny country's natural beauty, the long
list of activities and Costa Rica's reputation as a peaceful,
relatively prosperous oasis in the midst of a region marred by
poverty, civil war and unstable governments.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors spent decades embroiled in wars and
dictatorships, Costa Rica abolished its army in 1949, investing the
money in developing the country's infrastructure and social
services.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary leaders also jumped on the conservation bandwagon
early, and have set aside nearly 25 percent of Costa Rica's
territory as nature preserves or national parks. There are more
than 75 such parks in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The country offers a staggering array of flora and fauna: more
than 9,000 species of plants, including 1,200 varieties of orchids
and 800 different types of ferns. As for animals, there are more
than 850 species of birds, while 10 percent of the world's
butterflies call Costa Rica home. There are more than 5,000
different species of grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   And it's all so close together. Wedged between Nicaragua and
Panama, with the Caribbean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the
west, Costa Rica is only 200 miles long. You can drive almost
anywhere in the country within a day _ although be warned: the
roads are notoriously rough and can be dangerous after dark as
livestock and wild animals like to bed down on the warm pavement.
</P>
<P>
   But driving around Costa Rica is fun. Rent a car in the Central
Highlands at the capital, San Jose, and within a half-hour, you can
be hugging curves on a high mountain road, zipping past coffee
bushes planted on unbelievably steep terraces.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later and you can be standing on the rim of the Poas
Volcano, or dodging drops at the La Paz waterfall. Half an hour
more and you can be touring a butterfly farm, then hiking in the
rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   The country is actually made up of several distinct ``climate
zones,'' and the weather can vary from hot and dry to summer
monsoon to surprisingly brisk. The rainy season runs from May to
December, and the high tourist season, which is dry, lasts from
January until May.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most popular destinations are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Arenal Volcano, about five hours northwest of San Jose. This
5,000-foot peak is one of the country's most active, and regularly
throws off showers of sparks and smoke. Hiking to the rim is not
recommended, although you can hike along the slopes and see plenty
of dramatic action.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You can also windsurf on Lake Arenal in the volcano's shadow,
enjoying some of the most predictable high-wind conditions in the
world. Rental equipment is available at several resorts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Also in this area is the Monteverde Cloud Forest Biological
Preserve, which has earned a reputation as one of the most
outstanding tropical reserves in the Americas. Take a guided tour
and you may glimpse any of the hundreds of species of animals
living here, from pumas to exotic moths to 30 species of
hummingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About three hours southwest of San Jose, beach-lovers flock to
Manuel Antonio National Park, a small but gorgeous park bordering
the blue Pacific. Visitors can sun on magnificent white sand
beaches, or hike through the park's rainforest, where they are
almost guaranteed to see monkeys, sloths, scarlet macaws and other
exotic wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful with your beach picnic, as the monkeys are notorious
thieves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For whitewater rafting, enthusiasts have their choice of
multi-day trips that include camping by the river or one-day
excursions that range from the relatively tranquil Rio Corobici to
wild, high-adrenaline rapids on the Rio Reventazon. More than a
half-dozen companies offer guided trips, with most departing from
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For those interested in a more relaxing time, several
companies offer daylong sailing cruises on both the Caribbean and
the Pacific. Most stop on nearby islands, and some offer gourmet
picnic lunches so that visitors can delight their palates as well
as soak up sun and sand.
</P>
<P>
   While Costa Rica has been in the news lately for a few
high-profile crimes against tourists, most veteran travelers will
recognize that it is still much safer than other Latin American
countries. Petty theft is a problem, but robberies and more serious
crimes are still rare. Visitors who take reasonable precautions
should have few problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costa Rica really is a utopia,'' said David Reid, 56, owner of
Calypso Tours, who moved to Costa Rica 30 years ago and helped
pioneer the country's tourism offerings with his daylong cruise and
gourmet lunch adventure. ``It's such a beautiful place. There are
more people now than before, but there's still so much to do and
see.''

<P>
   ---------------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO GO: The rainy season runs from May until December. The
dry season, which lasts from January to May, is the most popular
time to visit. However, prices are higher during the dry season and
it doesn't rain all the time during the wet season, so you might
consider a summer visit. Climate ranges from cool in the central
highlands year-round to steamy along the coasts during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Many major U.S. carriers, including American,
Delta and Continental, have daily flights to San Jose, Costa Rica's
capital, from cities including Houston, Atlanta and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND: All international flights arrive in the capital,
and unless you are staying at an all-inclusive resort that offers
transportation, you'll likely need a rental car. Traffic is bad in
San Jose, but outside the capital, it thins out and driving can be
a gorgeous adventure, with curvy mountain roads and stunning views.
Watch for potholes and road repair crews, as well as livestock and
rural residents, who use the highway as a sidewalk. You will need a
4-wheel-drive vehicle during the rainy season if you plan to visit
a volcano or rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY: In San Jose, you can find everything from US$15
barebones rooms to a luxurious new five-star Marriott built in the
midst of an old coffee plantation, where rooms start at US$150 a
night. Outside the capital, there are lots of hotels with varying
price ranges in the most popular tourist destinations, including
Puerto Viejo and Limon on the Caribbean and Tamarindo, Jaco Beach
and Quepos on the Pacific side.
</P>
<P>
   SECURITY: Crime against tourists has unfortunately been
increasing in Costa Rica but the country is still relatively safe
compared to other Latin destinations. Petty theft is very common so
don't leave items unattended, even in a locked car. Take the same
common-sense precautions as in other strange places: don't walk
alone at night; don't carry and flash lots of cash; be wary of
over-friendly strangers.
</P>
<P>
   LANGUAGE: The native Costa Ricans, called ``Ticos,'' speak
Spanish, but most tourism-related businesses have English-speakers.
Even in the remote countryside, Ticos are accustomed to dealing
with tourists and you'll probably get by fine even if you don't
even know how to order a ``cerveza,'' (beer) in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ACTIVITIES: The list is nearly endless. There's whitewater
rafting, mountain-biking, hiking, bird-watching,
butterfly-watching, rainforest canopy tours, cloud forest tours,
volcanoes you can hike or drive up, windsurfing, surfing, scuba
diving, beach-combing, golf, tennis, sailing and sport-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing to do is decide which activities you want to try
and build a vacation around them. You could start in San Jose, do a
day-trip to whitewater raft, then rent a car and drive to the
Pacific coast for some beachtime and a tour of a rainforest. Then
move on to the Arenal Volcano and the Monteverde Cloud Forest
Preserve.

the Most of S.J. Perelman,'' a portmanteau of Perelmania in the
Modern Library Humor and Wit Series, Woody Allen is quoted as
saying: ``What happens to you when you read Perelman and you're a
young writer is fatal because his style seeps into you. He's got
such a pronounced, overwhelming comic style that it's very hard not
to be influenced by him.'' That influence can be seen by comparing
Allen's movie, ``Small Time Crooks,'' and ``The Night Before
Christmas,'' a play by Perelman and his wife, Laura. By Mel Gussow,
in a Critic's Notebook.

   GERMAN-EXILES (Undated) _ During the 1930s and '40s, hundreds of
German writers, Jews and non-Jews alike, fled Hitler and sought
refuge in the United States. But finding asylum, they were harassed
and spied upon by the FBI and other government agencies which
referred to them as ``Communazis.'' The government tapped their
phones, intercepted their mail, dug through their trash, hired
informants to spy on them, sometimes monitored their sex lives, and
conducted intimidating interviews with them, according to
``Communazis,'' a new book to be published in October by Yale
University Press. By Dinitia Smith.

&HT;     RULING RESTRICTS POLICE IN USING FORCED ENTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal appeals court has put the brakes on
eager police officers who crash through front doors to execute
search warrants with little warning.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here tossed out the case Monday against an accused drug dealer who
shot and wounded two officers after the police kicked in his front
door just five seconds after knocking.
</P>
<P>
   The panel ruled that the officers did not give the suspect, an
alleged member of an Oakland-based drug gang, sufficient
opportunity to let them into his home before they forced opened the
door. Federal law generally requires that a warrant-armed officer
be refused entry before forcibly storming a residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has said that you cannot just knock and then bust
open the door without giving the person whose house is being
searched some reasonable notice,'' said Peter Keane, the dean of
Golden Gate University Law School. ``The court is telling the
police, `We want you to take this very seriously. A person needs a
chance _ more than a few seconds _ to respond intelligently.'''
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. on Aug. 31, 1994, investigators converged on a Hayward
apartment intent on arresting Emmitt Granville, a suspected figure
in an organization thought to be selling large quantities of
narcotics throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Granville said when he was arrested that he did not know the
intruders were officers and, fearing it was a robbery, opened fire,
according to the court. He later pleaded guilty to attempted murder
charges.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's unanimous opinion, Chief Judge Proctor Hug noted
that the search was conducted at a time when many people are still
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five seconds . . . simply did not provide Granville with a
reasonable opportunity to ascertain who was at the door,'' the
judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Hug, who was joined in the opinion by Judges Warren J. Ferguson
and Kim McLane Wardlaw, pointed out that ``a reasonable wait'' for
an occupant to answer the door ``protects citizens and law
enforcement officers from violence; it protects individual property
rights and it protects against needless destruction of private
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Hug noted that there are exceptions in which authorities do not
always need to follow the knock-and-announce rule. This includes
cases in which the police have a reasonable suspicion that
announcing their presence would be dangerous, futile or would
thwart their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the government agreed that authorities
had no information that Granville posed a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Because Granville's guilty pleas to the attempted murder counts
were entered conditionally on the presumption that the premise of
his arrest would be appealed, he can withdraw the pleas and go to
trial on those charges, said defense attorney Arthur Pirelli. The
court's ruling also said that federal prosecutors cannot use 1.5
pounds of crack cocaine seized in the raid as evidence against
Granville.

   The loss of 118 sailors on Russia's nuclear submarine, the Kursk

general ingratitude and indifference of the American public.
Despite the consensus that the country is on the right track, the
voter turnout in November is expected to be abysmally low. There
are many answers to these riddles, but one thing often lurks behind
the indifference and ingratitude: an obsession with local issues.

   CHICAGO _ Ask any unmarried, overworked middle-class person

company. You should ``outsource'' your social calendar to one of an
increasing array of sophisticated matchmaking services that provide
``assisted dating.'' ``It's Just Lunch'' is a firm that arranges
``pre-screened lunch dates'' for busy professionals.

   CHICAGO _ The annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll of attitudes

teacher in every classroom.'' Bob Chase, president of the National

salaries so that more qualified candidates will enter the
profession and stay there. Al Gore has won cheers from Democrats

   PRAGUE _ Highly organized, ruthless gangs of sex traffickers are
luring and smuggling young women, mostly from Eastern and Central
Europe, into prostitution throughout the continent. There are some
20,000 women in 600 or so brothels in the Czech Republic alone,
most of them foreigners smuggled into the country's thriving sex
industry. While the illicit and violent nature of the trade makes
accurate monitoring impossible, a clear pattern has emerged since
the collapse of communism. Simplistically, there is a two-step
movement of women from east to west. First, of Russians,
Ukrainians, Moldovans and Belarussians into Central Europe; second,
of these women and Central Europeans into western cities. &QL;

   TOKYO _ Japan's annual ghost season is underway. Ever since the
Edo era (1600-1868), telling ghost stories has been a traditional
way to while away the sweltering summer evenings. The kabuki
theatres run their traditional ghost plays. Programs about
supernatural experiences and photographic phantasms abound on
television. Youngsters organize gut-testing nocturnal trips to
cemeteries to gauge one another's courage. But ghost stories in
Japan are more than mere summer entertainment. The constantly
evolving Japanese ghost story reflects the changes in the country's
social and cultural values. &QL;

   The loss of 118 sailors on Russia's nuclear submarine, the Kursk
_ and the bungling that followed _ have dented President Vladimir
Putin's reputation for controlled efficiency and may yet make
Russians rethink the sort of government they deserve. After giving
the impression that he had a tightening grip on Russian affairs,
Putin and his administration seemed to be flailing about
hopelessly. &QL;

   This has been a miserable summer in California. Thanks to a
surge in electricity consumption, Californians and other Americans
have endured several power failures. A growing angry chorus is
arguing that electricity deregulation has gone too far and too
fast. The problem is just the opposite. The real culprits behind
this summer's power failures are the muddle and hesitation
surrounding the introduction of competition in much of America. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Politics is always an illogical business. But two of
the hardest things to explain in the current election are the
general ingratitude and indifference of the American public.
Despite the consensus that the country is on the right track, the
voter turnout in November is expected to be abysmally low. There
are many answers to these riddles, but one thing often lurks behind
the indifference and ingratitude: an obsession with local issues.
For many Americans, parking now matters more than prosperity. &QL;

looking for love, and he or she will tell you it all seems
hopeless. Finding Mr. or Ms. Right is harder than ever. So what is
a single person to do? The answer, it appears, is to think like a

increasing array of sophisticated matchmaking services that provide
``assisted dating.'' ``It's Just Lunch'' is a firm that arranges
``pre-screened lunch dates'' for busy professionals.

   CHICAGO _ The annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll of attitudes
towards public education released this week found that a majority
of Americans feel it is important to put ``a qualified, competent
teacher in every classroom.'' Bob Chase, president of the National
Education Association (NEA), the main teachers' union, wasted no
time in pointing out that this will require raising teachers'
salaries so that more qualified candidates will enter the
profession and stay there. Al Gore has won cheers from Democrats
for suggesting a pay hike for teachers. Would it really help? &QL;

   PRAGUE _ Highly organized, ruthless gangs of sex traffickers are
luring and smuggling young women, mostly from Eastern and Central
Europe, into prostitution throughout the continent. There are some
20,000 women in 600 or so brothels in the Czech Republic alone,
most of them foreigners smuggled into the country's thriving sex
industry. While the illicit and violent nature of the trade makes
accurate monitoring impossible, a clear pattern has emerged since
the collapse of communism. Simplistically, there is a two-step
movement of women from east to west. First, of Russians,
Ukrainians, Moldovans and Belarussians into Central Europe; second,
of these women and Central Europeans into western cities. &QL;

Edo era (1600-1868), telling ghost stories has been a traditional
way to while away the sweltering summer evenings. The kabuki
theatres run their traditional ghost plays. Programs about
supernatural experiences and photographic phantasms abound on
television. Youngsters organize gut-testing nocturnal trips to
cemeteries to gauge one another's courage. But ghost stories in
Japan are more than mere summer entertainment. The constantly
evolving Japanese ghost story reflects the changes in the country's
social and cultural values. &QL;

 AUSTRALIANS AREN'T CODDLING THEIR TOURIST ICON  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ Consider the three mascots of the upcoming Olympic
Games:
</P>
<P>
   The kookaburra bird, celebrated in song for its insane laugh;
the platypus, seemingly built from leftover parts; and the echidna,
which looks like the love child of an anteater and a porcupine.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing, of course, is the kangaroo, the bounding symbol
of Australia, enshrined on the national coat of arms and on every
Australian dollar coin.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic organizers say their mascot choices reflect a desire to
broaden awareness of the varied wonders of Australia's native
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   But kangaroo protectionists are suspicious. They say the
exclusion of their beloved marsupial reflects the fact that in the
land Down Under, sentiment toward kangaroos is often ambivalent at
best, hostile at worst.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their status as Aussie icons, millions of kangaroos are
slaughtered each year to make dog food and leather goods. Ranchers
kill them as pests that compete with cows and sheep for precious
grazing land. And increasingly, they're being killed for human
consumption as well.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the slogan here could well be, `` 'Roo _ it's
what's for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no accident that they didn't choose the kangaroo for the
mascot,'' said Maryland Wilson, president of the Australian
Wildlife Protection Council, the leading opponent of kangaroo
killings. ``If you have a kangaroo representing the Olympics, you
can't also put it on the menu.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, kangaroo is very much on the Olympic menu. Games
organizers have chosen Edna's Table, a well-regarded Sydney
restaurant known for its wild game entrees, to provide meals with
indigenous flair at the main press center during the Olympics,
Sept. 15 to Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Jennice Kersh, the restaurant's owner, said last week she plans
to serve the world's journalists a warm salad of kangaroo fillet,
with beetroot and wild yams. She raves about its distinctive taste
_ it has a strong, slightly sweet flavor, reminiscent of liver _
and its low-fat, low-cholesterol content. Still, she knows that not
everyone is quite ready for 'roo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans are a bit squeamish about eating kangaroo, I say
you're only funny about it because your eagle isn't nearly as
succulent, so you can't eat that,'' Kersh said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the commercial use of kangaroos breaks down
along familiar lines between animal protectionists and the
industry's defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say the government-authorized wild kangaroo harvest is
cruel, ecologically shortsighted, morally suspect, and foolhardy in
terms of jeopardizing the lucrative tourist industry. ``People come
here wanting to see the streets filled with kangaroos, and we're
killing them all,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   She maintained that kangaroo shooters target the largest male
animals, particularly 6-foot red kangaroos, removing the strongest
bloodlines from the reproductive cycle. She also accused kangaroo
meat processors of using unsanitary measures, a charge fiercely
denied by industry and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the $200 million-a-year kangaroo business says
the harvest is a humane, environmentally sound, economically viable
use of an abundant and fast-growing natural resource.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human beings have been managing kangaroos in this country for
at least 60,000 years,'' said John Kelly, executive officer of the
Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia, the leading trade
group. ``As quickly as they reproduce, it would be courting
environmental disaster to not manage kangaroos in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the harvest reduces pressure on grazing lands and
places reasonable limits on an exploding population. With enough
water available, the number of kangaroos in a given area can
quadruple in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also defended the harvest methods, particularly when
compared with the processing of pigs, cows, and other animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in the level of stress is enormous,'' Kelly
said. ``A kangaroo is grazing in its enviroment, wild and free, and
then it's blinded by a bright light. One second later it's killed
by a high-velocity bullet to the head. That's humane, mate.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 60 species of kangaroo and their close
relatives, some of them threatened or endangered. Of the six
species used commercially, three of the largest and most abundant
make up 95 percent of the harvest: eastern gray, western gray, and
red. No one is certain how many kangaroos are in Australia, but it
is generally agreed there are 20 million to 50 million of those
three varieties, according to David Croft, professor of biological
science at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the government sets a limit on the number of
kangaroos that can be killed, or culled, based on population
estimates. This year, the nationwide quota is 6.5 million, Croft
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, the industry official, said only about half of the quota
will be harvested, in part because animal activists have succeeded
in slowing the growth of the kangaroo market. Some 440,000 tons of
meat were exported last year, most of it to Europe, he said. About
2 million skins were exported for leather goods, largely to Asia
and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the United States banned the import of kangaroo
products out of concern about declining numbers of red, western
gray, and eastern gray kangaroos. But rising populations prompted
US officials to lift the ban in the mid-'80s. Still, the United
States remains a relatively untapped market, importing only 45 tons
of meat and 82,000 skins last year, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   All sides of the debate agree that the issue becomes emotional
in part because of kangaroos' unusual reproductive techniques.
Whenever a mature female kangaroo is killed, it is almost certain
that one or more juvenile ``joeys'' is orphaned. That is because
female kangaroos are ``perpetually pregnant,'' Croft said, with one
joey developing in utero, one in her pouch, and one outside the
pouch still dependent on her milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the population thinks they're an expert on kangaroos,''
Croft said, ``and the other half doesn't think about them much at
all'' _ unless they are about to collide with one. ``One of the
problems is when people see kangaroos in the wild, they're often in
the road just 10 meters in front of their headlights. At that
point, the only thing they're thinking about kangaroos is, `I'm
about to lose my no-claim bonus on my car insurance.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Australians' ambivalence about kangaroos is evident almost from
the moment a visitor arrives.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, kangaroo images are a cornerstone of the tourist
industry, serving as the logo of both the Australian Tourist
Commission and Qantas Airways. Popular tours to the remote Outback
promise visitors the chance to see packs of kangaroos, called mobs,
in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, kangaroo pelts and toys made from kangaroo skins are
for sale in souvenir shops throughout Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the messages are mixed. At Featherdale Wildlife Park
just west of Sydney, tourists and Australians alike come to feed,
pet, and mingle with kangaroos. The sight of a baby kangaroo, or
joey, poking its head out of its mother's pouch prompts squeals of
excitement. And yet, the gift shop at the wildlife park sells
kangaroo hides and bags of dried kangaroo jerky.
</P>
<P>
   Sidneysiders, as residents here are known, seem to regard
kangaroos the same way Americans view squirrels. Popular support is
reserved for cuddly, cute koalas, which no one eats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kangaroos are just out there, you know?'' said Trevor
Kelly, no relation to the industry official. ``I've eaten 'em, but
only the tail's any good. I prefer steak.''

   Nations, like individuals, can react in unpredictable ways when
they are convulsed with grief and anger.
</P>
<P>
   The 118 sailors who perished on the Kursk submarine will not be
the only Russian servicemen to forfeit their lives in ugly, violent
circumstances this year. Indeed, the toll in this incident is tiny
compared with the sickening casualties which Russian forces
continue to suffer, and inflict, in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the loss of the Kursk, and the bungling that followed, have
dented President Vladimir Putin's reputation for controlled
efficiency and may yet make Russians think again about the sort of
government they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the Kursk fiasco has had a bigger effect on
Russia's national psyche than any other recent news event is that
the navy, which gave out conflicting reports of the accident and
then fouled up the attempt to find survivors, had previously
enjoyed a higher reputation than other bits of the battered defense
establishment. Now Russia's admirals look tarnished too.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the repercussions from the tragedy are growing for
Russia's civilian masters. After giving the impression that he had
a tightening grip on Russian affairs, Putin and his administration
seemed to be flailing about hopelessly.
</P>
<P>
   If the correct lessons are eventually learned, the submariners
will not have died for nothing. But the affair seems bound to
affect Russia's political atmosphere and its relations with the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the Kursk has already boosted Russia's opposition,
both in the political arena and in the media. Only a few weeks ago,
Putin was proceeding rapidly with a plan to transform Russia's
internal balance of power in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   As the new presidential team regrouped the country into seven
``super-regions'' with Kremlin loyalists in charge, they seemed
confident of solving the abiding problem of Russia's rulers: how to
assert federal control in a sprawling land where power
disintegrates unless actively husbanded.
</P>
<P>
   But their vision leaves precious little room for what America's
founders called ``checks and balances'' on executive power _ or for
a western-style separation of powers. For the most part, Russians
have seemed ready to go along with this, preferring almost any sort
of order to the chaos that went before. That may now change.
</P>
<P>
   The families in mourning in the Russian Arctic may not yet see
it, but there is a connection between their plight and the need for
some counterweight to central authority, including robust media, in
a country where absolute power has so often corrupted its holders
absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   If the rage of the garrison community in Murmansk has been
transmitted to the nation and the world, it is only because
Russia's journalists, under renewed pressure from the Kremlin in
recent months, are still able to denounce error and dishonesty in
high places.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents can happen anywhere, but more accountable governments
are more likely to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   In defense matters, the trade-off between secrecy and
accountability is never simple; western countries do not find it
easy either. But in a democratic society, the media develop a nose
for the difference between real and invented national-security
concerns. When security is being used to mask incompetence, a
whistle is blown.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the fate of the Kursk has already focused attention
on another attempted cover-up: the refusal by officialdom to
discuss honestly the ecological danger posed by at least 100
disused nuclear submarines whose reactors could poison the Arctic
with radioactive material unless they are stored more safely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of responding to international criticism by tackling the
problem, officials have tried to press treason charges against
Alexander Nikitin, an ex-naval officer who denounced the ecological
threat to the region through a Norway-based pressure group,
Bellona.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a fitting memorial to the sailors lost on the Kursk
if the authorities heeded Nikitin instead of persecuting him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the loss of one of their most modern submarines, and
the public anger at their handling of the incident, should prompt
Russian policymakers to reexamine basic assumptions about defense
and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of the Kursk affair should be a fresh look at
the cuts and reforms needed in Russia's oversized armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been holding the ring in a dispute between Russia's
ground troops and its strategic-rocket forces over which should be
sharply reduced; in reality, both need to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   Because it continued to function, and could play cat-and-mouse
games with NATO, the submarine fleet had seemed comparatively
immune from the hard choices posed by shrinking budgets. Yet its
bungling and obfuscation over the Kursk affair suggests the navy,
too, must rethink priorities.
</P>
<P>
   It is encouraging to see how many Russians, and not only the
bereaved families of the Kursk crew, feel the government was too
slow to accept assistance offered by Britain and Norway. The
message to Russia's ruling class is that xenophobia as a political
tactic _ one much favored in recent years _ does not always pay.
</P>
<P>
   In a country with a long tradition of regarding all transactions
with foreigners as adversarial, ordinary Russians seem to have
recognized that these offers of help were made in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   On this, as on the need for greater openness and accountability
over the whole affair, Russia's government would be wise to listen
to its voters. &QL;

STANLEY KUNITZ: REJECTION TO POET LAUREATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes sidebars KUNITZ-POEMS and KUNITZ-LAUREATE; a and e
coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVINCETOWN, Mass. _ When Stanley Kunitz is working in his
garden, admiring passersby will often ask if it's his. Kunitz tells
them he is only the hired hand. ``They used to believe me,'' he
says with a soft chuckle, ``but nobody does anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   True, it's hard to believe a 95-year-old works as a gardener's
assistant, pruning and weeding every morning. It's even harder to
believe it when the 95-year-old is perhaps America's most
distinguished living poet, an eminence underscored last month when
Kunitz (pronounced CUE-nits) was named US poet laureate, a post he
will assume in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful selection,'' said Peter Davison, poetry
editor of The Atlantic Monthly and himself a poet. ``Stanley is
going to hold the office as a symbol of dedication to a life in
poetry. He has been a symbol, and a guide, to a couple of
generations of poets already.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz, whose ``Collected Poems'' is to be published in October,
has won the National Book Award and the Bollingen and Pulitzer
prizes. (He also represents a less-lustrous, if more common,
experience for American poets: No fewer than eight publishers
rejected the book for which he won his Pulitzer, ``Selected Poems
1928-1958.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems so appropriate at the beginning of a new century
to have somebody who knew almost everybody in the last century,''
said Prosser Gifford, director of scholarly programs at the Library
of Congress, which oversees the laureateship.
</P>
<P>
   Just out of college, Kunitz sent a sheaf of his poems to
Marianne Moore at The Dial, the most distinguished American
literary magazine of the '20s. She wrote back, ``We shall be
delighted to publish them.'' Robert Lowell and Theodore Roethke
were two of his best friends. His students and proteges include
such well-known poets as Carolyn Kizer, James Wright, Louise Gluck,
and Robert Hass (himself a former poet laureate).
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz personifies more than just a century's worth of poetry.
To be in his presence is to feel connected to a century's worth of
human experience. He had a horse-and-buggy boyhood _ literally. At
9, in Quinnapoxet, a hamlet near Worcester, where he grew up,
Kunitz drove a carriage, working as a lamplighter. The first
automobile he saw was a Stanley Steamer (no relation, he likes to
say). He's seen Halley's Comet twice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's the future he focuses on. ``I never think of myself as
having outlived my useful existence,'' he said. ``I don't wake up
as a nonagenarian. I wake up as a poet. I think that's a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pinsky, the current poet laureate, marvels at Kunitz's
``vigor'' and ``feisty energy.'' Though hunched and bent over,
Kunitz moves with an easy stride. He still has a martini before
dinner and every night goes to his desk, working until a few hours
before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poems are there,'' Kunitz says, ``but they lie under the
debris of the life. One has to dig for them very much harder than
one had to at the beginning when poetry is so largely, in one's
youth, a glandular activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky sees ``absolute conviction in the lyricism'' as the most
distinctive feature of Kunitz's poetry. ``There is no doubt or
irony about the central importance of poetry for the human spirit.
He manifests that loftiness of calling in every line and
sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz started out writing a relatively formal and somewhat
opaque verse. Over the years, his writing has become, as he put it,
``simpler, more open, more intimate.'' He has remained true to his
early masters: Keats, Hopkins, late Yeats, the Metaphysical Poets,
and Blake.
</P>
<P>
   A fascination with nature is the great constant in Kunitz's
poetry. (It has also been a constant in his life: Before he began
to tend his garden, Kunitz twice tried his hand at farming.) ``I
have lived in the country most of my life,'' he said. ``I need it
desperately. Urban life is satisfying for the moment, but for
refreshment and restoration of my primitive impulses I need the
country or the seashore: the natural world.''
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Kunitz played in woods and quarries on the outskirts
of Worcester. It's hard to imagine the environs of New England's
second-largest city as an outpost of the natural world, but it was
in the 1910s. It's just as hard to imagine it as a hotbed of
poetry. But Kunitz's contemporaries Elizabeth Bishop and Charles
Olson were Worcester natives, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz went to Harvard, where he studied under the celebrated
philosopher Alfred North Whitehead and knew the future head of the
Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was a year behind
him. Graduating with a summa cum laude degree in English in 1926,
he planned to get a doctorate, but dropped out after getting his
master's, having been informed that ``Anglo-Saxons would resent
being taught English by a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz worked as a reporter and editor on The Worcester
Telegram. His most memorable assignment was covering the Sacco and
Vanzetti trial. It was also the most eventful: Vanzetti's letters
so impressed him he went to New York to try to find a publisher for
them. Kunitz failed in his mission, but ended up staying there.
</P>
<P>
   His first book of poems, ``Intellectual Things,'' was published
in 1930. He supported himself editing literary reference books,
something he would do off and on for the next few decades.
</P>
<P>
   There were his two attempts at farming: first in Connecticut,
then Pennsylvania. His first marriage failed. His second marriage
produced a daughter, Gretchen, but it also ended in divorce. Kunitz
married again, in 1958. His wife, Elise Asher, is a painter and
poet.
</P>
<P>
   Kunitz was a conscientious objector during World War II. Even
so, he was drafted and served in the Army, rising to the rank of
sergeant. He got his revenge on the military 20 years later when he
and Lowell organized the protest against the Vietnam War in 1965
that turned the White House Arts Festival into what he once proudly
termed ``a passionate fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, Roethke got Kunitz hired to teach at
Bennington College. He later taught at the New School, Brandeis,
the University of Washington, and Columbia, among other
institutions. ``I never accepted tenure,'' he said, ``because I
recognized that it would be fatal for me to be a professor who
wrote poetry rather than a poet who had a job in the academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1957, Kunitz and Asher have divided their time between
Provincetown and Greenwich Village. Kunitz is a founder of the Fine
Arts Work Center in Provincetown, and Saturday a ceremony was to be
held rededicating the Stanley Kunitz Common Room there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had visited Provincetown in the '30s when it was a sleepy
little fishing village,'' he said. ``I never forgot walking on the
beach . . . and there were all these women in sunbonnets and long
flowing skirts. That's changed quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   What's also changed quite a bit is the 2,000 or so square feet
of front yard he so diligently tends from June to October. It began
as a sandbank, Kunitz proudly notes, ``without a single blade of
grass on it.'' He brought in soil, laid down seaweed and compost,
built terraces, transforming it from barrenness to lush splendor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To conquer a piece of earth,'' he says, ``an area of earth,
and make it as beautiful as one can dream of it being: That is art,
too. A man cannot be separated from the earth. I come out of the
garden every day feeling, oh, inspired in a way that one needs in
order to convert the daily-ness of the life into something greater
than that little life itself.''

<P>
   This has been a miserable summer in California. Thanks to a
surge in electricity consumption, Californians and other Americans
have endured several power failures.
</P>
<P>
   Since brownouts were rare in the past, some wonder if recent
steps to liberalize the power market are to blame. Politicians are
meddling, arbitrarily imposing rate freezes and price caps. This
week President Bill Clinton offered federal subsidies to poor
people and small firms hit by higher power prices in California.
</P>
<P>
   A growing chorus is arguing that electricity deregulation has
gone too far and too fast. The problem is just the opposite. The
real culprits behind this summer's power failures are the muddle
and hesitation surrounding the introduction of competition in much
of America.
</P>
<P>
   In places such as Britain, Scandinavia and Australia, which
began liberalizing long ago, the transition to competitive power
has been orderly and free of mishap; consumers there enjoy reliable
power, lower prices and better service.
</P>
<P>
   California's deregulation has failed to yield such gains largely
because it neglected a variety of market realities.
</P>
<P>
   Companies will invest in generation only if the rules of the
game are clear. In America, they seldom are. That is partly because
of the country's federal structure, which has left the states to
take the initiative in electricity deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   About half have opened up their markets, but each has its own
peculiarities. This patchwork, plus changing environmental
regulation, explains why so many utilities have avoided building
new plants for years.
</P>
<P>
   State governments should base reforms on clear and consistent
rules. The federal government also needs to bring order to
interstate power trading. Regulators must break the monopoly of the
aging and overloaded distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   Merely generating more power at big central plants far from
markets means little unless it can reach consumers _ and
bottlenecks on the grid mean that not enough of it does. Expanding
distribution capacity is often impossible in crowded urban areas,
and elsewhere people dislike new power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic advances in technologies such as fuel cells and
microturbines, which generate power efficiently and cleanly on a
smaller scale, may make up the shortfall. But regulators still tend
to imagine that power will flow in one direction only: from big
plants to small consumers.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the bottlenecks, they should follow the recent move by
New York state to facilitate access to the grid for small
micropower plants.
</P>
<P>
   The other area of reform is the hardest but also the most
crucial: the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, liberalization and competition will deliver
lower electricity prices for companies and households alike.
However, in many places, retail prices remain fixed by government
fiat.
</P>
<P>
   There is a case for protecting domestic households from price
volatility until a genuinely competitive retail market emerges.
However, the zeal with which politicians have introduced arbitrary
price ``rollbacks'' suggests that they may turn any exception into
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a mistake, for unless consumers see fluctuations
in prices (especially at peak times), they have no incentive to
conserve power or shift their use off-peak.
</P>
<P>
   The right way forward is to allow retail prices to fluctuate
with market conditions. This will encourage consumers to use power
more judiciously and speed the arrival of such innovations as
fixed-price ``energy service'' contracts, which promise outcomes
such as certain levels of heating, rather than merely delivery of a
set amount of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Price transparency will also allow micropower plants to buy and
sell power on the grid as demand dictates, so improving the grid's
reliability.
</P>
<P>
   In fits and starts, America is heading toward the promise of
competitive energy markets. Consumers in Pennsylvania, for example,
now pay $3 billion a year less for their electricity than they did
before 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The populism and shortsightedness of its regulators and
politicians must not stop California from getting there too. &QL;

   The concept of poet laureate is British: an official court poet,
appointed by the king or queen. The first was Ben Jonson. Other
notable poet laureates have been John Dryden, William Wordsworth,
and Alfred Tennyson. The current British laureate is Andrew Motion.
Like his predecessors, he is paid about $300 a year and a cask of
white wine.
</P>
<P>
   The US poet laureateship began in 1937 as the position of
consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress. In 1986, Senator
Spark Matsunaga, a Hawaii Democrat, added the title ``poet
laureate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction when Congress passed the law,'' said
Stanley Kunitz, who is laureate-designate and was poetry consultant
from 1974 to 1976, ``was that no one can be poet laureate. . . . We
are such a diversified culture that to assume one is actually the
poet laureate of the American people is vainglorious.'' He added
with a laugh, ``But one does the best one can.''
</P>
<P>
   The job pays $35,000. Duties are few: Give a reading at the
start of the laureate's tenure, deliver an essay at the end, and
help organize the library's literary programs.
</P>
<P>
   The three most recent laureates, Rita Dove, Robert Hass, and
Robert Pinsky, have redefined the post from one that was almost
entirely honorary _ ``Life will go on exactly as before,'' said
Robert Penn Warren upon being named first laureate _ to one that
has become almost evangelical.
</P>
<P>
   Pinsky has kept up a particularly energetic travel and speaking
schedule, which has led some to question whether a nonagenarian
like Kunitz is up to the job. ``It was a remarkable performance,
and nobody will ever duplicate it,'' Kunitz said. ``Naturally, I
don't intend to be _ how shall I phrase it? _ sedentary, though I
have no intention of being as much of an activist as Robert has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   US Poet Laureates have included: Robert Penn Warren, 1986-87;
Richard Wilbur, 1987-88; Howard Nemerov, 1988-90; Mark Strand,
1990-91; Joseph Brodsky, 1991-92; Mona Van Duyn, 1992-93; Rita
Dove, 1993-95; Robert Hass, 1995-97; Robert Pinsky, 1997-2000; and
Stanley Kunitz, 2000-01.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Politics is always an illogical business. But two of
the hardest things to explain in the current election are the
general ingratitude and indifference of the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the consensus that the country is on the right track,
very few people want to give much credit to the Clinton
administration (or at least its chosen heir, Al Gore). Similarly,
although the election is both close and important, with both the
White House and Congress up for grabs, the turnout will be
abysmally low.
</P>
<P>
   There are many answers to these riddles _ from the assumption
that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan matters more
than President Bill Clinton to the current addiction to
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   But one thing often lurks behind the indifference and
ingratitude: an obsession with local issues. For many Americans,
parking now matters more than prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   One good place to look at this is Chicago. Its most famous
mayor, Richard J. Daley, ruled the city through a ward system,
which not only allowed local aldermen to solve local problems but
also linked local politics to the national ticket (Daley famously
delivered Illinois to Jack Kennedy in 1960).
</P>
<P>
   One of Daley's sons is now mayor, the other the chairman of the
Gore campaign. But today the focus of the city's ward system seems
to be entirely local; there is no connection to any national
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, Lincoln Park, a prosperous area of the
city. To any visitor, including Bill Clinton (who dropped in
earlier this month), the signs of urban renaissance are pretty
clear. Crime and unemployment have plunged; property values have
shot in the opposite direction. The public schools are still dicey,
but most people think it is Mayor Daley's job to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear much about Washington in Lincoln Park politics.
What you do hear about is property taxes. The same skyrocketing
urban property values that have made many families rich on paper
have also pushed up taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The tax hikes after the recent three-yearly assessment by the
city were especially brutal. In Lake View, a neighborhood just
north of where Clinton visited, the median tax bill climbed 53
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are fears that the artists, small manufacturing
businesses and working-class residents that have always given
Lincoln Park a diverse, slightly Bohemian feel will be driven out.
</P>
<P>
   People also worry about the folks who are moving in. Wealthy new
neighbors do not just buy houses; because land is scarce, they
often buy houses, knock them down, and then build bigger houses
that tower over other structures on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, large national retailers are eager to go where the
money is. The list of chains looking for space around Lincoln Park
includes Home Depot, Costco and IKEA _ all names that remind local
residents of suburban shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's host, DePaul University, has been gobbling up
green space, adding 10 big buildings in Lincoln Park in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   One result: nobody has enough room to park.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's zoning laws, written in 1957, require that property
developers provide one parking space for each new unit of housing.
In reality, new families arrive with several cars, at least one of
which is likely to be a hulking sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents would like to see street parking limited to
permit holders; local businesses claim it would be their death
warrant. ``It's one of the most divisive issues I've ever
encountered, outside of dogs,'' says Judy Casey, president of the
Sheffield Neighborhood Association.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, dogs. Chicago residents are now more likely to have a mutt
than they were a decade ago, pitting an estimated 750,000 dogs and
their owners against non-dog owners in the battle for open space.
(If your labrador frolics off the leash in a local park, prepare
yourself for a visit to the criminal court.)
</P>
<P>
   The Sheffield Neighborhood Association is wrestling with the
weighty policy issue of whether or not a local park should have a
drinking fountain exclusively for dogs, and if so, where it should
be located.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the frustrations have bubbled over. Community activists
in Lincoln Square, a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood on Chicago's
northwest side, recently took to the streets to protest against the
opening of a third Starbucks coffee shop in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Starbucks comes in,'' explained one protester, ``there
goes the diversity. Property values go up, rents go up, taxes go
up. A Starbucks is the first sign that much worse things are going
to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these complaints are beginning to bubble up to the
national stage. At the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, Beverly O'Neill, the mayor of Long Beach, Calif., told her
peers that prosperity-related pressures are the number one problem
facing the country. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 825, OR CONTINUE TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She had a sympathetic audience. In San Francisco, where
high-tech wealth has had an even more pronounced effect, the
entrepreneurs who were once the pride of the city now find
themselves referred to as ``e-holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty thousand San Franciscans signed a petition supporting a
November ballot initiative that would limit the growth of
technology companies in the city. A group calling itself the Yuppie
Eradication Project has been slashing the tires of sport-utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Such local resentments can be found in suburbs, farms and cities
_ but they seem particularly ungrateful in the latter.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, American cities are far more pleasant places
to live than they were a decade ago. One Chicago neighborhood
leader recalls that 30 years ago his main challenges were cracking
down on slum landlords, massage parlors and street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, even mayors with forceful local records, such as
Rudy Giuliani in New York, have had trouble in reminding the locals
of those achievements (his latest crime: spraying for mosquitoes).
</P>
<P>
   And the gap between local and national politics seems far
greater: zoning and property taxes seem no more on the mind of
George W. Bush and Gore than missile defense is on the mind of
Lincoln Park.
</P>
<P>
   The ``friendship'' that people like the older Daley enjoyed with
voters, and the involvement Chicagoans once felt in national
debates, has ebbed away into a series of local squabbles over
things like utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   It has also given a new twist to an old saying. If you want a
friend in American politics, get a dog (and do please keep him on a
leash). &QL;

   She had a sympathetic audience. In San Francisco, where
high-tech wealth has had an even more pronounced effect, the
entrepreneurs who were once the pride of the city now find
themselves referred to as ``e-holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty thousand San Franciscans signed a petition supporting a
November ballot initiative that would limit the growth of
technology companies in the city. A group calling itself the Yuppie
Eradication Project has been slashing the tires of sport-utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Such local resentments can be found in suburbs, farms and cities
_ but they seem particularly ungrateful in the latter.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, American cities are far more pleasant places
to live than they were a decade ago. One Chicago neighborhood
leader recalls that 30 years ago his main challenges were cracking
down on slum landlords, massage parlors and street gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, even mayors with forceful local records, such as
Rudy Giuliani in New York, have had trouble in reminding the locals
of those achievements (his latest crime: spraying for mosquitoes).
</P>
<P>
   And the gap between local and national politics seems far
greater: zoning and property taxes seem no more on the mind of
George W. Bush and Gore than missile defense is on the mind of
Lincoln Park.
</P>
<P>
   The ``friendship'' that people like the older Daley enjoyed with
voters, and the involvement Chicagoans once felt in national
debates, has ebbed away into a series of local squabbles over
things like utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   It has also given a new twist to an old saying. If you want a
friend in American politics, get a dog (and do please keep him on a
leash). &QL;

   CHICAGO _ Ask any unmarried, overworked middle-class person
looking for love, and he or she will tell you it all seems
hopeless. Finding Mr. or Miss Right is harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, the median age of marriage for women in the United
States was 20, and it was not much more for men. Most well-educated
women met their husbands at university, where there was an ample
supply of suitable partners. Men could do the same, or find a wife
in the suburbs where they grew up, or marry a girl in the office.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage age has crept steadily upwards since then. The Ally
McBeal classes, in particular, are usually finished with university
and graduate school before they grow serious about finding a
partner.
</P>
<P>
   A rising divorce rate means that more older people are searching
for love for a second or a third time.
</P>
<P>
   And in the past quarter of a century there has been no reliable
institution where you can search for a prospective mate, says
Bernard Beck, a sociologist at Northwestern University at Evanston,
Ill. Places like singles bars or health clubs often leave much to
be desired.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is always the workplace, where so many
Americans seem to be spending an increasing amount of their time.
But the lawyers are busy thwarting that possibility: insurers
against sexual-harassment litigation are starting to tell companies
that they ought to have ``no-dating'' policies.
</P>
<P>
   And even employees who regard such restrictions as Orwellian
tend to be hesitant about flirting in the office. Some
relationships are bound to fail, and the only thing worse than a
rotten colleague is a rotten colleague who is also an ex-lover.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a single person to do? The answer, it appears, is to
think like a company. You should ``outsource'' your social calendar
to one of an increasing array of sophisticated matchmaking services
that provide ``assisted dating.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Just Lunch (IJL) is a firm that arranges ``pre-screened
lunch dates'' for busy professionals. IJL customers pay $1,000 a
year for a minimum of 12 dates. After each date, the customer
reports to the firm on the quality of the match. In theory, each
date should bring him or her closer to the desired perfect partner.
</P>
<P>
   The firm does its business the old-fashioned way, face to face.
But the Internet is almost certainly going to be a growing part of
the dating business.
</P>
<P>
   Match.com, for instance, claims 3 million members since it
began, and 38,000 new ones each week. It charges $40 a month to
match members with others whom the computer deems compatible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about numbers, and it's also about time,'' says Fran
Greene, Match.com's Director of Flirting and Dating. Indeed: your
correspondent received 95 matches as soon as he started his trial
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the process involves screening. Goodgenes.com is open
only to graduates of Ivy League universities and a handful of other
superior colleges.
</P>
<P>
   JDate.com caters to Jewish singles. Singleswithscruples.com is
``an Internet dating site for people who have morals and a sense of
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which guarantees anything. ``The probability of
deception is quite high,'' says Norval Glenn, a sociologist at the
University of Texas. (Your correspondent now wonders whether he
should have mentioned in his Match.com profile that he is married
with two children.)
</P>
<P>
   Many sites do not use real names until members have grown
comfortable with one another. The advice that one Internet dating
executive offers for the first face-to-face meeting sounds like a
Cold-War espionage manual: meet in public, drive yourself, let
someone know where you will be.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger problem is more banal. Since most matches
arranged in such a way are liable to fail, the Internet may
generally be introducing singles to even more people they don't
particularly like.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to kiss a lot of frogs,'' concedes Laurie, a
37-year-old who works in Silicon Valley and joined Match.com after
learning that her roommate was secretly already a member. She was
further encouraged when her roommate married an online match.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of Laurie's matches was interested in Gregorian
chants. Another asked her to compare herself to a character on
``The Simpsons.'' And then there was the guy with the Budweiser
watch and gold nugget ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be such a time-saver in the long run,'' says Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   It is really more like shopping. You go out looking for one
thing, and come back with something else. But for single people
longing for a suitable partner, here at least is a different way of
finding one. &QL;

AN IDIOM GIVES THAT SINKING FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes garbled fractions)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the consternation of science and math adepts _ and sometimes
of usage mavens _ specialized jargon will occasionally migrate into
the general population, and rarely does it keep its original
meaning once it's being bandied about by the rabble.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still find arguments over the casual use of quantum leap,
for instance, since the original quantum leap was a small (though
significant) jump. Still, the everyday use of the term to mean
``major change'' is now generally accepted, even by scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Usage writers are still trying to rein in parameter, however,
and I've had letters protesting the ignorant use of exponential
increase and the bizarre concept of salaries 200 percent lower than
other people's. Now comes Bob Alexander with a new complaint: What,
he wonders, do we think we mean by lowest common denominator?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is generally used to refer to the people in the population
who are the dumbest, or the weakest, or the slowest, or are in
other ways inferior,'' he writes. ``For example, critics of TV
shows might say that the networks are appealing to the lowest
common denominator.'' (They might indeed, and every season, it
seems, they have more occasion to do so.) But why should lowest
common denominator be a pejorative?
</P>
<P>
   I turned for help to the sixth-grade math book I had at hand
(thanks to a family that never willingly deaccessions, as the
libraries say, a book). Heath Mathematics calls it the least common
denominator (though lowest has been an accepted alternative for a
century), but the LCD, by either name, has nothing ``low'' about
it, except that it's the bottom half of a fraction. You remember
how it's done: If you want to add 1/3 and 1/2, you have to convert
them to fractions with the same _ that is, a common _ denominator.
The LCD here would be 6, and our problem would be 2/6 plus 3/6
equals 5/6.
</P>
<P>
   Denominator as a mathematical term dates to the mid-1500s,
according to the Oxford English Dictionary; the first figurative
use is recorded in 1831. But in the early examples, common
denominator (often without the least) carries no stigma; we get a
reference to a common denominator language _ that is, a lingua
franca _ in 1898, with no hint of disapprobation. Just a dozen
years later, though, H. G. Wells uses the term with a distinctly
contemptuous air: ``Most clubs have a common link, a lowest common
denominator in the Club Bore, who spares no one.''
</P>
<P>
   While the neutral sense (emphasizing commonality) and the
derogatory sense (emphasizing lowness) coexisted for decades, the
negative connotations seem to have pretty much taken over in our
time: A New York Times summary of a 1973 Supreme Court ruling on
obscenity spoke of ``adjusting all sex-related literary, artistic
and entertainment production to the lowest common denominator of
toleration'' _ i.e., giving veto power to the most narrow-minded
members of a community. In 1983, the Times described a ``slippage''
of educational standards ``toward `minimum competency' or the
lowest common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   And today, when reviewers say TV shows like ``Survivor'' or
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' aim at the lowest common
denominator, they don't mean to congratulate the productions on
their mass appeal; they mean that they pander to the rabble, the
great unwashed, lowbrows and yokels, Mencken's booboisie. Sure, the
writers sometimes include themselves among the deluded masses, but
self-contempt is still contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those earlier terms of insult, though, lowest common
denominator has a nice scientific ring to it. Taken literally, it
wouldn't even be an insult: A lowest common denominator isn't
necessarily low, and common in the original term has nothing to do
with vulgarity. But the combined words, perhaps inevitably, now
suggest a contrast with a higher, less ``common,'' taste.
</P>
<P>
   And thus a term that might have connoted simply ``a level at
which we can all communicate'' has come to mean instead ``a level
to which we should be embarrassed to slip.'' Lowest common
denominator has sunk, as it were, to its lowest common denominator.

   CHICAGO _ The annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll of attitudes
towards public education released this week found that a majority
of Americans feel it is important to put ``a qualified, competent
teacher in every classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association
(NEA), the main teachers' union, wasted no time in pointing out
that this will require raising teachers' salaries so that more
qualified candidates will enter the profession and stay there.

<P>
   Al Gore has won cheers from Democrats for suggesting a pay hike.
Would it really help? Work over the past five years by two
economists, Dale Ballou at the University of Massachusetts and
Michael Podgursky of the University of Missouri, suggests that the
quality of America's teachers has more to do with how they are paid
rather than how much.
</P>
<P>
   The pay of American public-school teachers is not based on any
measure of performance (the NEA opposes merit pay); instead, it is
determined by a rigid formula based on experience and years of
schooling, factors that Podgursky calls ``massively unimportant''
in deciding how well students do.

   The uniform pay scale invites what economists call adverse
selection. Since the most talented teachers are also likely to be
good at other professions, they have a strong incentive to leave
education for jobs in which pay is more closely linked to
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   For dullards, the incentives are just the opposite. The data are
striking: when test scores are used as a proxy for ability, the
brightest individuals shun the teaching profession at every
juncture. Clever students are the least likely to choose education
as a major at university.
</P>
<P>
   Among students who do major in education, those with higher test
scores are less likely to become teachers. And among individuals
who enter teaching, those with the highest test scores are the most
likely to leave the profession early.
</P>
<P>
   Ballou and Podgursky have studied the effects of a nationwide 20
percent real increase in teacher salaries during the 1980s. They
conclude that it had no appreciable effect on overall teacher
quality, in large part because schools do a poor job of recruiting
and selecting the best teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, even if higher salaries lure more qualified candidates
into the profession, the overall effect on quality may be offset by
mediocre teachers who choose to postpone retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Ballou and Podgursky also take aim at teacher training. Every
state requires that teachers be licensed, a process that can
involve up to two years of education classes, even for those who
have a university degree or a graduate degree in the field they
would like to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Einstein would have had to go back to the local community
college for 12 months of training in pedagogy and first aid before
he could teach high-school physics.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, this system does little to lure in graduates of top
universities or professionals who would like to enter teaching at
mid-career.
</P>
<P>
   None of this proves that all training courses are useless _ or
that America's teachers are being paid enough. Many patently
deserve more money. Good ones would get it under any system with
merit pay. But the current system of training, licensing and pay
could not have been better designed to protect bad teachers from
competition. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ The annual Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll of attitudes
towards public education released this week found that a majority
of Americans feel it is important to put ``a qualified, competent
teacher in every classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association
(NEA), the main teachers' union, wasted no time in pointing out
that this will require raising teachers' salaries so that more
qualified candidates will enter the profession and stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has won cheers from Democrats for suggesting a pay hike.
Would it really help? Work over the past five years by two
economists, Dale Ballou at the University of Massachusetts and
Michael Podgursky of the University of Missouri, suggests that the
quality of America's teachers has more to do with how they are paid
rather than how much.
</P>
<P>
   The pay of American public-school teachers is not based on any
measure of performance (the NEA opposes merit pay); instead, it is
determined by a rigid formula based on experience and years of
schooling, factors that Podgursky calls ``massively unimportant''
in deciding how well students do.
</P>

selection. Since the most talented teachers are also likely to be

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   DETROIT _ Now that they were wired to the Internet, Carol and
Bill Tragar thought it would be easy to order their dream car.
After all, more than two-thirds of all American new-car buyers are
turning to the Web at some point in the process.
</P>
<P>
   For the Tragars, that meant surfing one of the many car sites
where consumers can ``spec out'' a vehicle equipped exactly the way
they want, then find a dealer near their home.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part. But they only had to visit one dealer to
discover the Internet's big lie. It may be easy to specify the car
you want. Getting the vehicle is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Tragars were told they would have to wait up to three months
to have what they desired. So, like nearly 90 percent of American
buyers and 80 percent of Europeans, they settled for something
standard on the forecourt.
</P>
<P>
   Things are about to change, though, as car makers prepare to
launch a concept known as either Order-to-Delivery or
Build-to-Order (BTO).
</P>
<P>
   Harold Kutner, head of purchasing for General Motors, calls it
``the most dramatic change I've ever seen in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but all it means is that a motorist will be able to
order a car customized at the factory without having to grow old
waiting to have it delivered.
</P>
<P>
   BTO is based on a system pioneered by Dell Computer: go online
or call a freephone number, and your tailored product will be
assembled and shipped within days.
</P>
<P>
   A car is a far more complex product than a computer, but many
manufacturers believe they can cut the order-to-delivery time to
less than two weeks. The Internet will play a critical role in
making BTO work.
</P>
<P>
   In the system that GM is building, a customer picks his
preferred package and, within seconds, the transaction reaches a
central database that checks to make sure the order matches an
approved design. The car is then scheduled for assembly, based on
the earliest date that parts can be shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Car makers have all sorts of reasons to be interested in BTO.
Giving a customer precisely what he wants is a sure way to
strengthen his loyalty. And studies show that buyers are likely to
load on more expensive options when they custom-order.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, says GM's Kutner, ``I'd consider myself a failure if
I don't take 50 percent out of (overall) inventory in this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   With at least $20 billion in parts on hand at any one time to
support assembly systems, the savings on carrying costs alone could
add up to several hundred million dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is also experimenting with a BTO system at its plant in
Ontario, Canada, which builds Camry Solara coupes and convertibles.
Ford, meanwhile, has launched a BTO program that allows buyers in
Canada's capital city of Ottawa to custom-order any of four models.
</P>
<P>
   But car firms are reluctant to make too many promises. Ford's
Brian Kelley expects that it will take a series of halfway measures
before BTO becomes the normal way of doing business in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The first step he dubs ``build-to-demand,'' where companies like
his try to guess ahead what buyers will request and build
``predictive'' models, so that dealers will have a more desirable
mix of cars on hand.
</P>
<P>
   GM's Cadillac division is trying that approach already. A
network of regional vehicle depots stock the most popular paint and
gadget configurations, allowing dealers to reduce their
inventories; customers can get all but the most unusual packages
within a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is effective, but it means that Cadillac must carry
the costly burden of stocking those depots _ so GM is trying to set
up an across-the-board BTO system in America by as early as 2003.
It even plans to place cameras along its assembly lines, so that
buyers will be able to watch their vehicles being built.
</P>
<P>
   Will the car makers match the nimbleness of the Dell system?
Probably not, but there are plenty of reasons why they need to try.
</P>
<P>
   And if they succeed, customers like the Tragars will at last be
able to get what they want _ without having to choose between
second-best and an interminable wait. &QL;

   DETROIT _ Now that they were wired to the Internet, Carol and
Bill Tragar thought it would be easy to order their dream car.
After all, more than two-thirds of all American new-car buyers are
turning to the Web at some point in the process.
</P>
<P>
   For the Tragars, that meant surfing one of the many car sites
where consumers can ``spec out'' a vehicle equipped exactly the way
they want, then find a dealer near their home.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part. But they only had to visit one dealer to
discover the Internet's big lie. It may be easy to specify the car
you want. Getting the vehicle is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Tragars were told they would have to wait up to three months
to have what they desired. So, like nearly 90 percent of American
buyers and 80 percent of Europeans, they settled for something
standard on the forecourt.
</P>
<P>
   Things are about to change, though, as car makers prepare to
launch a concept known as either Order-to-Delivery or
Build-to-Order (BTO).
</P>
<P>
   Harold Kutner, head of purchasing for General Motors, calls it
``the most dramatic change I've ever seen in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but all it means is that a motorist will be able to
order a car customized at the factory without having to grow old
waiting to have it delivered.
</P>
<P>
   BTO is based on a system pioneered by Dell Computer: go online
or call a freephone number, and your tailored product will be
assembled and shipped within days.
</P>
<P>
   A car is a far more complex product than a computer, but many
manufacturers believe they can cut the order-to-delivery time to
less than two weeks. The Internet will play a critical role in
making BTO work.
</P>
<P>
   In the system that GM is building, a customer picks his
preferred package and, within seconds, the transaction reaches a
central database that checks to make sure the order matches an
approved design. The car is then scheduled for assembly, based on
the earliest date that parts can be shipped.
</P>
<P>
   Car makers have all sorts of reasons to be interested in BTO.
Giving a customer precisely what he wants is a sure way to
strengthen his loyalty. And studies show that buyers are likely to
load on more expensive options when they custom-order.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, says GM's Kutner, ``I'd consider myself a failure if
I don't take 50 percent out of (overall) inventory in this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   With at least $20 billion in parts on hand at any one time to
support assembly systems, the savings on carrying costs alone could
add up to several hundred million dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is also experimenting with a BTO system at its plant in
Ontario, Canada, which builds Camry Solara coupes and convertibles.
Ford, meanwhile, has launched a BTO program that allows buyers in
Canada's capital city of Ottawa to custom-order any of four models.
</P>
<P>
   But car firms are reluctant to make too many promises. Ford's
Brian Kelley expects that it will take a series of halfway measures
before BTO becomes the normal way of doing business in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The first step he dubs ``build-to-demand,'' where companies like
his try to guess ahead what buyers will request and build
``predictive'' models, so that dealers will have a more desirable
mix of cars on hand.
</P>
<P>
   GM's Cadillac division is trying that approach already. A
network of regional vehicle depots stock the most popular paint and
gadget configurations, allowing dealers to reduce their
inventories; customers can get all but the most unusual packages
within a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is effective, but it means that Cadillac must carry
the costly burden of stocking those depots _ so GM is trying to set
up an across-the-board BTO system in America by as early as 2003.
It even plans to place cameras along its assembly lines, so that
buyers will be able to watch their vehicles being built.
</P>
<P>
   Will the car makers match the nimbleness of the Dell system?
Probably not, but there are plenty of reasons why they need to try.
</P>
<P>
   And if they succeed, customers like the Tragars will at last be
able to get what they want _ without having to choose between
second-best and an interminable wait. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Everybody loathes it, but everybody does it. A recent
poll showed that 40 percent of Americans, the world's most lavish
tippers, hate the practice.
</P>
<P>
   It seems so arbitrary, after all. Why does a barman get a tip,
but not a fast-food worker or a doctor who saves lives?
</P>
<P>
   In America alone, tipping is now a $16 billion-a-year industry _
all the more surprising since it is a behavioral oddity. Consumers
acting rationally ought not to pay more than they have to for a
given service.
</P>
<P>
   Tips, which are voluntary, above and beyond a service's
contracted cost, and delivered afterwards, should not exist. So why
do they?
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that tips both reward the efforts of
good service and reduce uncomfortable feelings of inequality. The
better the service, the bigger the tip.
</P>
<P>
   Such explanations no doubt explain the purported origin of
tipping _ in the 16th century, boxes in English taverns carried the
phrase ``To Insure Promptitude'' (later just ``TIP'').
</P>
<P>
   But according to new research from Cornell University, tipping
no longer serves any useful function. The paper analyzes data from
2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The correlation between larger tips and better service was very
weak: only a tiny part of the variability in the size of the tip
had anything to do with the quality of service. Customers who rated
a meal as ``excellent'' still tipped anywhere between 8 percent and
37 percent of the meal price.
</P>
<P>
   Tipping is better explained by culture than by economics. In
America, the custom has become institutionalized: it is regarded as
part of the accepted cost of a service. In a New York restaurant,
failing to tip at least 15 percent could well mean abuse from the
waiter. Hairdressers can expect to get 15-20 percent, the man who
delivers your groceries $2.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, tipping is less common; in many restaurants,
discretionary tipping is being replaced by a standard service
charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on
at all.
</P>
<P>
   How to account for these national differences? Look no further
than psychology. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell paper's
co-author, countries in which people are more extrovert, sociable
or neurotic tend to tip more.
</P>
<P>
   Tipping relieves anxiety about being served by strangers. And,
says Lynn, ``in America, where people are outgoing and expressive,
tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think
less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.''
</P>
<P>
   Icelanders, by contrast, do not usually tip _ a measure of their
introversion and lack of neuroses, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   While such explanations may be crude, the hard truth seems to be
that tipping does not work. It does not benefit the customer. Nor,
in the case of restaurants, does it actually incentivize the
waiter, or help the restaurant manager to monitor and assess his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   The cry of stingy tippers that service people should ``just be
paid a decent wage'' may actually make economic sense. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Though Internet firms have found many a strange
bedfellow, who would have guessed that a dalliance with
philanthropy would prove fertile?
</P>
<P>
   Any self-respecting charity sends newsletters and solicits
donations over the Web, yet it is a clever capitalist who can make
money out of online giving. Now a cottage industry offering
services to not-for-profit types is trying.
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, GreaterGood.com, a two-year-old Seattle firm,
is the biggest of the bunch. It is essentially a matchmaker,
bringing together consumers, charities and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the Web site and you find a series of shopping villages,
each run for the benefit of a particular cause _ UNICEF, say, or a
local school _ and with links to the Web sites of retailers such as
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   At these sites, a small box reminds you that a percentage of
money spent will be donated to charity; an equal portion goes to
GreaterGood.
</P>

   Although online retailers, who charge the same price to a
GreaterGood-referred customer as to a regular one, see their
margins shaved by paying a commission, they are eager to take part,
happy to encourage others to send them customers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Amazon, the granddaddy of Web retailers, has been
running such a pay-the-referrer scheme for years.
</P>
<P>
   Much of GreaterGood's business comes from shoppers following a
link from their favorite charity's site, or reading about the
service in a newsletter. Still more customers are drawn in by stage
two of the marketing plan.
</P>
<P>
   In February, GreaterGood bought The Hunger Site, a Web site that
shot to Internet stardom as soon as it launched. The gist is: look
at a few advertisements, help end hunger.
</P>
<P>
   When a user clicks on the site's ``donate free food'' button, he
is shown half a dozen ``banner ads,'' the colorful rectangles
festooned with slogans that have become ubiquitous _ and
increasingly ignored _ on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For reaching a prospective customer, each advertiser pays half a
cent (the equivalent of a quarter of a cup of food aid) to the
site, which passes it on to the U.N. World Food Program. Which is
good for everybody: users feel virtuous, advertisers entice
customers, and the hungry get food, lately about 1,000 tons a
month.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a win for GreaterGood, whose own message accompanies
each batch of ads, exhorting users to help even more by visiting
its site and shopping for hungry children.
</P>
<P>
   GreaterGood has a patent pending for its Hunger Site model, a
worrying development for genuine nonprofit sites, such as
ClearLandmines.com, which also use banner-ad profits to help good
causes.
</P>
<P>
   GreaterGood recently opened its newest variation on the theme,
TheRainForestSite.com, and has registered scores of other domain
names, including TheHelpingWomenSite.org.
</P>
<P>
   It may not like competitors, even nonprofit ones, muscling in on
its turf. Although GreaterGood is yet to break even, it is already
considering a stock market listing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ironically, the company is part of a breed much threatened
by the Internet: a bit of Web publishing and helpline-manning
aside, it is simply an intermediary, adding little value for its
cut of the action.
</P>
<P>
   That may be fine for now; with revenues still low, charities
seem happy to let it beaver away. But if commissions continue to
grow, charities may soon tire of losing half and try to do without
GreaterGood, dealing with retailers directly.
</P>
<P>
   As many a matchmaker has found, when a couple hits it off, they
end up more loyal to each other than to the soul, however helpful,
who introduced them. &QL;

 &HT;    JAILED 'SHE WOLF' WAS ONE OF MEXICO'S CLASSIC RULING PARTY
BOSSES
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: Chimalhuacan is southeast, and adjacent to Mexico City.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico _ Just talking about ``La Loba,'' the She
Wolf, makes Teresa Gonzalez's palms break out in a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Mexico's July 2 election, Gonzalez dared to argue
with La Loba over who she was going to vote for. Days later
somebody pumped a barrage of bullets through the front door of
Gonzalez's cinderblock hovel.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt in Gonzalez's mind that the assault was ordered
by La Loba, who's real name is Guadalupe Buendia, a woman who used
nepotism, high-level connections _ and fear and favors _ to run
this vast slum of 1.2 million people like a fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the law here. She had the power to make things better
here and she never did it,'' said Gonzalez, a seamstress who lives
on a tiny plot that La Loba sold her in this urban stew of trash,
mud, sewage and snarling street dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Plump and middle-aged, Buendia's looks belie her intimidating
nickname. But she is an infamous figure in Mexico these days, a
symbol of the abusive local party bosses that this country's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI, nourished during its
71-year monopoly on most government offices power.
</P>
<P>
   After a week on the lam, La Loba is now in jail, charged with
gathering a mob armed with wooden boards, pistols and homemade
bombs to attack a rival during his inauguration on Aug. 18 as the
city's new mayor. Ten people died in the melee, which pit one
faction of PRI loyalists against another.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened there is part of Mexican politics that continues
to be savage,'' said political analyst Edna Jaime. On July 2, the
PRI lost the presidency for the first time in seven decades, a
phenomenon that represents ``the civilized Mexico,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But as the PRI's power slips, more violence could erupt as local
party bosses fight to keep the wealth and control they amassed,
Jaime said. ``The PRI knew how to handle these predators before.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Buendia was a behind-the-scenes power in this city
and a PRI operative in a vote-rich area. In exchange for virtual
impunity for abuses and looting _ a traditional arrangement _ she
mustered votes for the party from slum dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   She let poor migrants from provinces squat on land and
shepherded them into PRI-affiliated neighborhood groups that
promised they would one day obtain better services for residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother died, she bought the casket,'' said Elsa
Arrieta, who sells chickens on a street _ one of the few that's
paved _ where La Loba had one of her many homes.
</P>
<P>
   Buendia served jail time for extortion in connection with a land
swindle, but she was released in early 1999 and was still going
strong up through April, when her empire began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI declined to put La Loba's son up for mayor in the July 2
election. And La Loba had a lot at stake. Her cousin was mayor,
husband the treasurer, son the municipal secretary and sister the
director of family services. La Loba was in charge of water, and if
one person failed to pay a bill or did something to displease her
she would halt service to an entire block.
</P>
<P>
   She was also director of retrieving garbage _ at which she was
an obvious failure _ using donkey-drawn carts whose owners were
also affiliated with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talked about mechanizing the garbage collection, she
felt threatened,'' said the new mayor, Jesus Tolentino, also of the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   He said everyone complained about getting charged for
non-existent garbage collection. And they griped about the police,
who they said extorted with La Loba's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   La Loba's questionable land sales began to make her enemies,
too. Gonzalez, for example, doesn't have the title to her property
nine years after paying La Loba. She paid to have a water pipe put
in four years ago and only got her hook-up in June. Like so many
others here, Gonzalez's only toilet is an outhouse. She steals
electricity from power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said La Loba was furious with the PRI for turning down
her son, so she lobbied to have a nephew named mayoral candidate
for Mexico's leftist Democratic Revolution Party, which had tried
to make inroads in Chimalhuacan.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to force Gonzalez, who is also considered a local
leader, to gather votes for her nephew. When Gonzalez refused, her
house was sprayed with gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   La Loba did manage to stick with the PRI's candidates for
president and Congress. On Mother's Day, she threw a huge fiesta,
featuring male strippers who peeled off boxers that spelled: ``Vote
PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   That event embarrassed the party. But the PRI was mortified when
followers of La Loba launched an attack during Tolentino's
inauguration at Chimalhuacan's city hall.
</P>
<P>
   La Loba claims she is innocent, and accused followers of
Tolentino that belong to another PRI slum dwellers' group, Peasant
Torch, with inciting the violence.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the city hall, Tolentino brushed off unsavory
stories about Peasant Torch, which has also been accused of
shock-troop tactics against enemies.
</P>
<P>
   He said his job now is to restore order and help improve the
party's image here. Tolentino and the new treasurer, for example,
said they didn't find one official document on file here and the
strong box was completely empty. Because of unpaid bills, the city
is about $8 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also clear,'' Tolentino said, ``that authorities in the
state of Mexico and within our party _- the PRI _ always knew what
was going on here.''

&HT;     TIGER ON `SURVIVOR' ISLAND? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Normally, I'm a purist. Junk sports may grab my
eye, but I always know I'm slumming.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Monday night's round of match-play golf between
Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia. It met all the requirements for
utter disdain, the snob's snub. It was a made-for-TV event,
promoted with silly shots of Garcia in a matador's outfit and
Woods' face morphing into a roaring tiger's. It was golf played
under artificial light. It employed carts for two able-bodied
players with a combined age of 44.
</P>
<P>
   It was silly, all show, no substance. It was also irresistible.
And not in a cheap way. If you watched, you know. It was like
buying a skin magazine and becoming absorbed in the articles. Even
the sports purist had to give this event its due.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Garcia's little win did a service to golf, reminding
us that Woods is not a machine. Tiger too often makes what he does
look easy, as if all the victories and records are fate, a destiny
set on auto-pilot. This summer, in particular, he has been the
perfect storm. He has laid waste to the game as it existed before.
</P>
<P>
   The whole time, he has worn an expression that says he expected
this all along. To understand the absurdity of his runaway wins at
Pebble Beach and St. Andrews, you couldn't look at his face. You
had to watch his playing partners.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, at the U.S. Open, looked up at the leaderboard during
the final round and just laughed, shaking his head. David Duval, at
the British, hacked away at a bunker as if he were trying to
dismantle it. Duval was so determined to give Woods a run that he
started swinging like Dave Kingman.
</P>
<P>
   The bunker didn't go anywhere, and neither did Woods. He was
untouchable, unflappable, almost inhumanly so. The Opens are
designed to humble a golfer. Woods strode down the fairways like
John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the made-for-TV contrivance, held on a course tricked
up to flatter the golfers, that Tiger stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   He looked exhausted Monday night, occasionally coughing into his
palm as he walked. He'd caught the flu in Ohio, where less than 24
hours earlier he had won the NEC Invitational by 11 strokes,
finishing after nightfall. Then he conducted a morning clinic and
flew to California to tee off for the showdown with Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   That schedule suggests Woods didn't take this event too
seriously _ which only proves that he, too, is a purist. The best
thing about Tiger's last year is the way he has homed in on the
majors, pointed his whole game in that direction. By contrast, this
match was a trifle, and he treated it accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't bring his A game, perhaps because he had wrung it dry
in the NEC Invitational. Still, throughout Monday's match, I kept
waiting for that mask of determination to come over his face. It
never did. He didn't go after Garcia the way he pursued Bob May in
the PGA playoff eight days before. Apparently, he can't just turn
his intensity on with a switch, and it's a comfort to know his
mental energy isn't that shallow.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be surprised if next year Tiger can pack his schedule
and still sink his teeth into a match-play opponent after a
cross-country trip. He keeps getting better, looking for flaws the
rest of us can't see. Eventually, the only way to challenge him
might be through junk sports.
</P>
<P>
   Make Tiger run a marathon, then shoot 18 against the No. 2
flavor of the summer? Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Have him dive into a shark tank, take a turn on a flying
trapeze, then do a 10K pogo-stick ride to the first tee? Sounds
like a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger lives on a deserted island for 39 days with 15 strangers,
then paddles a canoe across the Pacific to go one-on-one with Phil
Mickelson? Here, we have a collision of the summer's two ratings
bonanzas. I'm sure the networks are already on the case.

   (UNDATED) _ Your product, despite loyal customers, is not
selling, and your protests against heavy taxes go ignored. Sales
are suffering. If only some of the tax burden could be shaken off.
What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Why, team up with your foreign partners to smuggle, of course.
And, according to the Canadian government, this is exactly what
several North American tobacco companies did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit currently winding its way through the courts in the
United States is a tale of conspiracy and intrigue as compelling as
any John Grisham novel.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's case rests on four facts, disputed by nobody, and a
crucial piece of conjecture. The facts are these. First, from 1981
until 1994, the Canadian government increased cigarette taxes, more
than doubling the retail price of a pack in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Canada's cigarette exports, largely to the United
States, boomed 36-fold at the same time. True, both the
Canadian-American free-trade agreement and later the North American
free-trade deal came into effect during this period; true again, no
two countries anywhere trade back and forth more than America and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Yet consider facts three and four. Neither Canadians nor
Americans, eager traders though they are in general, are
particularly keen about each other's tobacco blends; rare is the
year when Canadian exports capture more than 1 percent of the big
neighbor's market.
</P>
<P>
   And, lastly, cigarette exports fell back again after the
Canadian government drastically cut tobacco taxes in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden boom, then the sharp drop? Canada's lawyers
connect the dots to draw an interesting picture.
</P>
<P>
   As galloping taxes began to trample profits, cigarette
manufacturers in Canada started exporting to agent companies south
of the border. (Tobacco exports remained largely tax-exempt.)
</P>
<P>
   Although these companies were purportedly selling the cigarettes
in the United States or re-exporting them to third countries, they
were really _ runs the accusation _ handing them to smugglers, who
then carried them back across the 5,522 miles (8,893 km) of border
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, even tobacco firms did not deny that some sort of
smuggling was going on, though they denied responsibility for it.
Smuggling was rampant, lobbyists agreed, but the blame lay with
high taxes, not with the manufacturers, who were simply filling
orders.
</P>
<P>
   After protests from sellers in Quebec, irate over sales lost to
smugglers, Canada relented, slashing taxes dramatically. At this
point, opinions diverge.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's lawyers argue that at least one American cigarette
company, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, helped to smuggle
cigarettes made by its Canadian sister-company across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing is RJR the firm named in the case. The Canadian
wing, RJR-Macdonald, has been badly hit by two recent defeats in
court.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago a subsidiary based in the United States,
Northern Brands International, pleaded guilty to smuggling and was
fined $15 million. Then Leslie Thompson, a former senior manager at
RJR-Macdonald and NorthernBrands, was sent to prison for his part
in the affair.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes Canadian lawyers believe that they can trace the
smuggling across the border. They have yet to prove their point. A
lower-court judge in the United States said in June that his
country's courts could not enforce Canadian tax laws, and handed
Canada a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The case is now on appeal and the Canadians are optimistic.
Anti-smoking groups are happy, too, because the Canadian government
seems likely to raise taxes back to the 1994 level.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry has had a horrible few months. First a
Miami jury awarded an amazing $145 billion in punitive damages to
sick Florida smokers. Then a report by the World Health
Organization, its great enemy, accused it of a ``systematic
effort'' to discredit the WHO, and of trying to get the WHO's
budget cut.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also faces smuggling-related lawsuits from the
European Union, Ecuador and, of all places, Colombia. If the appeal
in the Canadian case goes against it, share prices _ like those
cigarettes _ may head sharply southwards. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Your product, despite loyal customers, is not
selling, and your protests against heavy taxes go ignored. Sales
are suffering. If only some of the tax burden could be shaken off.
What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Why, team up with your foreign partners to smuggle, of course.
And, according to the Canadian government, this is exactly what
several North American tobacco companies did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit currently winding its way through the courts in the
United States is a tale of conspiracy and intrigue as compelling as
any John Grisham novel.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's case rests on four facts, disputed by nobody, and a
crucial piece of conjecture. The facts are these. First, from 1981
until 1994, the Canadian government increased cigarette taxes, more
than doubling the retail price of a pack in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Canada's cigarette exports, largely to the United
States, boomed 36-fold at the same time. True, both the
Canadian-American free-trade agreement and later the North American
free-trade deal came into effect during this period; true again, no
two countries anywhere trade back and forth more than America and
Canada.

   PRAGUE _ In the brothels off Wenceslas Square, in central
Prague, sexual intercourse can be bought for $25 _ about half the
price charged at a German brothel. Step inside and upstairs, past
the strip joint and the peep show, and the cut-price approach
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Spent condoms fill plastic buckets in the corridor; stained
carpets line sweaty little rooms; young women guard the doorways,
wearing not so much bored as vacant expressions.
</P>
<P>
   The corpses of several hundred trafficked women _ strangled,
shot, or beaten to a pulp _ fetch up around Europe each year. Many
more bodies, Europol reckons, are never found.
</P>
<P>
   The organized gangs of traffickers who lure and smuggle young
women, mostly from Eastern and Central Europe, into prostitution
are ruthless. In January, a group of 22 women being led across a
mountain range into Greece via Bulgaria were abandoned by their
traffickers when a blizzard struck. Two women froze to death before
Greek border troops could reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative estimates put the number of women smuggled each
year into the European Union and the more prosperous Central
European countries at 300,000, though not all end up in the sex
trade. But the figure could well be double that.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 20,000 women in 600 or so brothels in the Czech
Republic alone, most of them foreigners smuggled into the country.
Ukraine's interior ministry reckons that many of the 400,000
Ukrainian women who have left the country since independence have
been drawn into the sex industry.
</P>
<P>
   While the illicit and violent nature of the trade makes accurate
monitoring impossible, a clear pattern seems to have emerged since
communism's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Simplistically, there is a two-step movement of women from east
to west. First, of Russians, Ukrainians, Moldovans and Belarussians
into the trade in Central Europe; second, of these women and
Central Europeans to western cities.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Slav women have supplanted Filipinas and Thais as
the most common foreign offering in Europe's brothels.
</P>
<P>
   Some trafficked women do prosper in the sex business, which in
Europe is thought to be worth some $9 billion a year. They are the
ones who graduate to work for the lucrative escort agencies. But
many more, seduced by false promises of a better life, are
financially, physically and mentally scarred.
</P>
<P>
   Recruitment follows a familiar pattern. A young woman, say from
provincial Ukraine, almost certainly under 23 and often far
younger, is approached by a trafficker. She is offered employment,
usually as a waitress or maid, in Central or Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Having agreed, her underground journey takes her to a squalid
way station. There, her passport and identity papers are stolen,
and she is sold, more or less as chattel, to brothel owners _ many
of them based in Germany, the chief destination for trafficked
women _ for a few thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   If she resists, she is isolated, beaten, and often raped. Thus
broken, she begins her brothel career, held by means of physical
abuse and debt bondage in involuntary sexual servitude.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year or so, the EU has been much exercised by the
trafficking of immigrants in general. But that of women is a
particularly tricky category.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the mainly Russian-speaking gangs who dominate
this business _ Albanian gangs concentrate on drugs _ are highly
organized. Often, the best that any police raid can hope for is to
disrupt, or divert, the flow of women.
</P>
<P>
   For another, there is a powerful silence on the part of the
women themselves. ``Who is to say this Russian is a student and
this one is a prostitute?'' asks one Czech police chief. ``Unless
someone complains, we are powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   This also makes it difficult for human-rights groups to help.
``Their concern is survival, not feminism,'' says Iveta Bartumkova,
of La Strada, an organization which assists victims of trafficking
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Various ideas are circulating about how to combat this trade. In
the Czech Republic, where prostitution is already legal, a new law
is being drafted which is designed to crack down on ``unlicensed''
streetwalkers, while enforcing health and labor standards at
state-sanctioned brothels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot suppress,'' argues Radim Bures, of the country's
organized-crime unit, ``but we can regulate prostitution, just as
the Dutch and Austrians do, in order to minimize the negative
aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-trafficking groups think greater transparency might
empower the prostitutes, who often receive, at best, a meager share
of the cash paid by their clients.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission is also pushing EU members to bring in a
minimum common penalty for the crime of trafficking itself.
</P>
<P>
   A second approach is education. The International Organization
for Migration, a United Nations body, has underwritten several
graphic campaigns in Central and Eastern Europe to stress to young
girls the risks involved.
</P>
<P>
   The list of needs is long: safe houses for those fleeing pimps;
witness protection for those ready to speak out; medical and
psychiatric help. An accompanying effort to educate the men who pay
for sex, suggest campaigners, might help curb demand.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of moralizing, however, will have much effect unless a
broader problem feeding the supply of women is confronted: the
feminization of poverty in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of communism, women have experienced a
disproportionate share of economic hardship. Two-thirds of Russia's
unemployed, for example, are women.
</P>
<P>
   Women have increasingly become breadwinners for drunk or absent
husbands, even as they have been squeezed from the workplace thanks
to industrial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of opportunity compels East European women to take risks
their peers in Western Europe would never contemplate. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ A stone's throw from The Economist office in the
Otemachi financial district of Tokyo lies Japan's most accursed
plot of land: a shrine erected to pacify the furious spirit of
Taira no Masakado, a vindictive Japanese warrior who lost a power
struggle against the emperor in the year 940 and had his head
lopped off.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the ghost is supposed to have brought misfortune
upon an arrogant establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, after the Kanto earthquake killed 130,000 people, the
Ministry of Finance decided to halt work on new offices being built
on top of the shrine because 14 of its officials, including the
minister himself, had died during construction.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, plans to build a car parking lot over the
sacred tomb were hastily reconsidered after terrified city
officials, not to mention repeated accidents, made the sacrilegious
American occupying forces think twice.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, superstitious office workers in nearby banks and
trading firms avoid turning their desks and backs disrespectfully
to the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Masakado's ghost is not alone in Tokyo. The city has always had
its haunted places and wandering souls, and Tokyoites remain a
superstitious lot.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Edo era (1600-1868), telling ghost stories has
been a traditional way to while away the sweltering summer
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   August is the month of the Buddhist Obon festival when ancestors
from the netherworld make their annual visit to their former homes
to dance and celebrate, and families from Tokyo and other big
cities return to their ancestral homes to welcome back the spirits.
</P>
<P>
   As the living and dead make their travel plans, Japan's ghost
season gets truly under way. The kabuki theatres run their
traditional ghost plays. Programs about supernatural experiences
and photographic phantasms abound on television. Cinemas show
spine-chilling films announced on billboards dripping in
signwriter's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters organize gut-testing nighttime trips to cemeteries to
gauge one another's courage. And for the less brave, the Hato Bus
company arranges sightseeing tours to the sites of famous Japanese
hauntings.
</P>
<P>
   But ghost stories in Japan are more than mere summer
entertainment. The constantly evolving Japanese ghost story
reflects the changes in the country's social and cultural values.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded wraith appears in the 10th-century ``Tale of
Genji,'' but many of Japan's traditional ghost stories come from
the Bunka-Bunsei period in the early 19th century. This renaissance
in ghost stories occurred when the urban entertainment culture of
Edo (old Tokyo) reached its zenith of creative decadence.
</P>
<P>
   In most of Japan's folk art of the day _ including pulp fiction,
puppet theatre, storytelling, kabuki, scroll painting and woodblock
prints _ vengeful spirits were among the most popular motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants and socialites played a party game called hyaku
monogatari where they told each other 100 ghost stories through a
summer night. One hundred candles were lit for the occasion, with
one blown out after each tale. After the 100th candle, the room was
plunged into darkness and something spooky was supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Such ghost-revellers would have expected to see a scowling,
long-haired woman in a white funeral gown and with no feet _ the
classic image of the wife who, betrayed and murdered by her
husband, returns from the dead to punish her tormentor.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, such as the eminent Yukio Hattori, have argued that
such apparitions reflected the low status of women in feudal Japan,
not to mention the belief that women were thought to be more
spiteful and attached to life than men.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries on, Japanese spooks have become more modernized
and westernized, just like Japanese society itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Second World War fuelled a whole corpus of supernatural
tales. People saw apparitions of dead soldiers and heard the
wailing voices of bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dreams,'' Akira Kurosawa has an eerie episode in which an
officer who survived the war is haunted by a platoon of his men who
died in battle.
</P>
<P>
   A different set of troubled souls haunt contemporary Japanese.
The most emblematic ghost of the 1990s _ popularized in the
``Ring'' series of books that sold more than 5 million copies _ is
a cursed videotape that kills viewers within a week. The only way
to avoid the curse is to copy the tape and force unsuspecting
friends to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Such supernatural terrorism, combining modern technology with
traditional ghost motifs, has become increasingly common.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide, long associated with spiritual reincarnation in Japan,
has likewise become an increasing source of ghostly tales. With the
country's worst recession since the war driving bankruptcy,
violence and unemployment to record levels, more than 31,000 people
in Japan committed suicide last year _ a 30 percent increase over
two years before.
</P>
<P>
   The prominence of tales about bullied children and stressed-out
salarymen haunting their schools and offices after taking their own
lives adds a sad postscript to this tragic statistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horror stories increasingly mirror contemporary ills,'' says
Hideki Sato, the editor of Kadokawa Horror Novels which published
the ``Ring'' series. Not satisfied with mere fringe manias, more
and more readers want the macabre of real life stirred into their
horror stories.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kadokawa's newest chillers, ``Aoi Honoo,'' is a
psychothriller about a juvenile murderer. After a spate of recent
murders by knife-and-bat-wielding teenagers, this comes as no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese media's fascination with the killings of the past
year does seem to have pushed many of the country's more
traditional ghosts into the shadows. Despite that, nostalgia for
the headless warrior or long-haired harridan has not vanished
completely.
</P>
<P>
   At times Japan's ghosts from the past strike back. The mighty
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan had its head office in Otemachi on
an urban site that overshadowed the Masakado shrine. Rumor has it
that the bank did not show decent respect to its spiritual
neighbor, and was too mean to pay for proper Shinto purification
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The LTCB failed in 1998 and soon passed into foreign hands _ in
Japanese banking, a fate worse than death. That surely cannot have
been mere coincidence. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ A stone's throw from The Economist office in the
Otemachi financial district of Tokyo lies Japan's most accursed
plot of land: a shrine erected to pacify the furious spirit of
Taira no Masakado, a vindictive Japanese warrior who lost a power
struggle against the emperor in the year 940 and had his head
lopped off.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the ghost is supposed to have brought misfortune
upon an arrogant establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, after the Kanto earthquake killed 130,000 people, the
Ministry of Finance decided to halt work on new offices being built
on top of the shrine because 14 of its officials, including the
minister himself, had died during construction.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, plans to build a car parking lot over the
sacred tomb were hastily reconsidered after terrified city
officials, not to mention repeated accidents, made the sacrilegious
American occupying forces think twice.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, superstitious office workers in nearby banks and
trading firms avoid turning their desks and backs disrespectfully
to the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Masakado's ghost is not alone in Tokyo. The city has always had
its haunted places and wandering souls, and Tokyoites remain a
superstitious lot.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Edo era (1600-1868), telling ghost stories has
been a traditional way to while away the sweltering summer
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   August is the month of the Buddhist Obon festival when ancestors
from the netherworld make their annual visit to their former homes
to dance and celebrate, and families from Tokyo and other big
cities return to their ancestral homes to welcome back the spirits.
</P>
<P>
   As the living and dead make their travel plans, Japan's ghost
season gets truly under way. The kabuki theatres run their
traditional ghost plays. Programs about supernatural experiences
and photographic phantasms abound on television. Cinemas show
spine-chilling films announced on billboards dripping in
signwriter's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters organize gut-testing nighttime trips to cemeteries to
gauge one another's courage. And for the less brave, the Hato Bus
company arranges sightseeing tours to the sites of famous Japanese
hauntings.
</P>
<P>
   But ghost stories in Japan are more than mere summer
entertainment. The constantly evolving Japanese ghost story
reflects the changes in the country's social and cultural values.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded wraith appears in the 10th-century ``Tale of
Genji,'' but many of Japan's traditional ghost stories come from
the Bunka-Bunsei period in the early 19th century. This renaissance
in ghost stories occurred when the urban entertainment culture of
Edo (old Tokyo) reached its zenith of creative decadence.
</P>
<P>
   In most of Japan's folk art of the day _ including pulp fiction,
puppet theatre, storytelling, kabuki, scroll painting and woodblock
prints _ vengeful spirits were among the most popular motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants and socialites played a party game called hyaku
monogatari where they told each other 100 ghost stories through a
summer night. One hundred candles were lit for the occasion, with
one blown out after each tale. After the 100th candle, the room was

 &HT;    Barrage of new products inundate the palate
 &HT;    By Christine Vasconez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As if you didn't have enough sauces, salsas,
marinades and compotes in your kitchen, there are some new products
worth looking for in Miami Valley gourmet food and wine stores.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers at the Fancy Food Show in New York this summer
inundated the palate with sweet, sour, savory and salty flavors in
a barrage of new products.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit _ raspberries, mangoes, kiwi, guava, pear and pineapple _
showed up in vinegars, oils, sauces and dips at the show, which is
sponsored by the National Association for Specialty Food Trade. But
there was no overwhelming trend at the show, where approximately
1,700 manufactures displayed their creations to 24,000 people. But
several unique products made in southwestern Ohio were shown.
</P>
<P>
   Several area companies won awards for their specialties, which
include mouth-watering items like Key Lime Curd Sauce, Oregon Black
Raspberry Preserves and Roasted Red Pepper Ravioli with Goat
Cheese.
</P>
<P>
   All of these products and more are available at specialty food
and wine shops throughout the Miami Valley, with each priced under
$8.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of Dayton in Urbana, Robert Rothschild Berry Farm
continually kicks out high-impact flavorful sauces, dips, vinegars
and dessert toppings. The new hit _ and a finalist for Outstanding
New Product at the Fancy Food Show _ was the Key Lime Curd Sauce.
The sweet and tart combination tastes like Key lime pie without the
crust. It's best served over angel food cake, pound cake or
cheesecake. It's even good folded into whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Other Rothschild favorites include the popular Raspberry Honey
Mustard Pretzel Dip and one of its new products _ Lemon Mango
Raspberry Sauce. Use it to fill crepes or drizzle it over
cheesecake for a fruity delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing director Jill Broering said she mixes the sauce with
yogurt or ice cream. She said the curd sauce is also good blended
with cottage cheese or stirred into a fruit salad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ship it when it's still warm because we can't keep up with
the demand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Broering said Bob and Sarah Rothschild have come a long way _
from selling food at a roadside fruit market to their current list
of more than 150 products.
</P>
<P>
   The farm, formed in 1984, offers tours and visitors can pick
fresh raspberries. Call (800) 356-8933.
</P>
<P>
   South of Dayton, 40 minutes away in Sharonville, is Clearbrook
Farms, a fourth-generation business. It won one of the most
prestigious awards at this year's show, Outstanding Classic, for
its velvety Oregon Black Raspberry Preserves.
</P>
<P>
   The award, judged by retailers, is given to a product that's
been in distribution for at least 10 years. It competed against
other foods like Terrine of Foie Gras, Bremner Cracked Wheat Wafers
and Classic Reserve VT Cheddar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a very established product in the industry,''
Clearbrook Farms Vice President Dan Cohen said. ``We introduced the
raspberry preserves in 1979. To be a finalist is a tremendous
honor, then to win that honor _ it's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The seedless preserves, made from berries hand-picked in Oregon,
are tart, yet sweet with no added preservatives or colors. Spread
it onto a bagel, pancakes or muffin. It also can be added to yogurt
or ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was preserves, teas, coffee, crackers, soup or pasta,
there was a bite or sip of something for everyone at the Fancy Food
Show.
</P>
<P>
   When you think of Italian you think of pasta, and when you think
of pasta you think red or white sauce. But some of Pasta Fresca's
ravioli tastes nothing like traditional Italian.
</P>
<P>
   The New Lexington company, just southeast of Columbus, that
started in 1988 combines several spicy ingredients in its Black
Bean and Salsa Ravioli with Corn in a Jalapeno Shell and Jalapeno
Cheddar Ravioli in a Sweet Bell Pepper Shell.
</P>
<P>
   Both should be served as recommended with olive oil, cheddar
cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Pasta Fresca's Roasted Red
Pepper Ravioli with Goat Cheese was a finalist at the Fancy Food
Show for Outstanding Pasta Rice, Bean or Soup. Also be on the
lookout for its Frittatine appetizers, which many food show
attendees waited in line to eat. The egg-based souffles shaped like
seashells come in broccoli cheddar, Parmesan zucchini and
four-cheese potato flavors.
</P>
<P>
   The Fancy Food Show is a national and international glimpse of
what new products are on the shelves. Be assured you'll see these
products and more at gourmet food and wine stores here.

 &HT;    Incredibly, stemware really does affect a wine's flavor
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - It makes no sense.
</P>
<P>
   It defies logic.
</P>
<P>
   Logic tells us that an identical liquid sitting in two different
containers is going to taste and smell _ well, identical. No
brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Then along comes some smarty-
</P>
<P>
   pants to prove us wrong, to turn logic on its head, to flout the
laws of physics. What next? The sun rising in the west?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But it's true. I was there. So were others. It was no mass
hallucination.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the smarty-pants was Barbara Fredell, a
representative of Riedel Crystal, who came to town a few weeks back
to lead a demonstration of her company's glasses at a wine tasting
at Fairfield Wine in Beavercreek. The idea: show how her company's
stemware outperforms lesser ``regular'' wine glasses by
accentuating certain aromas and flavors in wine.
</P>
<P>
   Riedel _ the company rep pronounced it as if it rhymes with
``needle,'' which means I've been mispronouncing it for years _
pioneered the concept that the shape and contour of a wine glass
can have a noticeable effect on how wine tastes and smells. The
Austrian-based company, founded in 1756 and owned by the Riedel
family for 10 generations, produces approximately 5.1 million
lead-crystal wine glasses a year. So let's acknowledge they know a
thing or two about this business.
</P>
<P>
   The company offers an incredible array of glasses in different
sizes and shapes, each designed to be used with a different variety
of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Not just a white-wine glass. Different glasses for sauvignon
blanc, chardonnay, riesling and on down the line, each built to
emphasize each grape varietals strengths (or perhaps hide its
weaknesses). Riedel's top-of-the-line, handmade ``sommeliers''
series features more than 30 shapes and sizes of glasses costing
$60 to $90 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Riedel family also offers less expensive, machine-made
alternatives in its Vinum, Vinum Extreme, Wine and Ouverture
series, with prices ranging from about $8.50 to $30 each. To have a
look, point your Web browser to www.riedelcrystal.com.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Riedel's glasses are so mammoth that an entire
standard-sized bottle (750 ml) can be poured in. To the last drop.
This brings whole new meaning for those who have been told by their
medical professionals, ``You should be limiting yourself to only
one glass of wine a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that would defeat the purpose of being able to swirl
the wine to release the aromas.
</P>
<P>
   And swirling is exactly what Riedel rep Fredell tells the
Fairfield Wine tasting group to do to launch her demonstration,
comparing the aroma and taste of a chardonnay from a generic, but
decent, wine glass against the Riedel Vinum chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   The Riedel glass is redolent of butterscotch and tropical fruit
aromas. The generic glass doesn't yield much in the way of aromas
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fredell tells us to taste the wine. Again, the difference
is clear and noticeable. The Riedel glass has a brief wave of sweet
fruit, followed by some pleasant tartness, then a little of that
butterscotch. The chardonnay from the generic glass tastes tart and
acidic, but with little else. Just kind of ... flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unbelievable,'' one audience member said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if someone took all the tone out of the stereo,'' a
second taster suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The scene repeated itself with other wines: sauvignon blanc,
cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir.
</P>
<P>
   Fredell can offer a plausible, physical explanation for some of
the differences. The inside of the Riedel glass has tiny, invisible
peaks and valleys because of its 24 percent lead crystal content,
and those allow for greater surface area for the wine, and thus
more pronounced aromas compared with the smooth glass of the
generic stemware.
</P>
<P>
   The rim and bowl of the Riedel glass is much thinner than the
generic, which has a particularly thick, rounded rim. That means
when you lift the generic glass to your lips, the wine has to spill
over the top of the rim to strike your tongue at about its
midpoint. The Riedel glass, with its thin rim, delivers the first
splash of wine directly to the tip of your tongue, where some
mighty sensitive taste receptors lie in wait.
</P>
<P>
   That thinness of the glass also makes the Riedel glasses
dangerously fragile _ I wonder whether half of the 5.1 million
glasses a year Riedel produces are replacements.
</P>
<P>
   But when Fredell asks us to taste wines out of the ``wrong''
Riedel glasses _ chardonnay out of the cabernet glass and vice
versa, for example _ the differences are less striking than she
would have us believe. Some of her observations seem plausible,
others sound like power of suggestion. But the superiority of the
Riedel stemware to the generic remains unshaken.

<P>
   Now, these fancy glasses won't make bad wines taste good. If
anything, they'll make bad wines taste worse, by accentuating the
faults. And who in their right mind has the room to store a few
gazillion different wine glasses?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the demonstration has left everyone in the room
scratching their heads and questioning the various rules and laws
that they counted on to guide their daily existence.

&HT;     NINERS' CARMAZZI MAY WIN A TRIP TO NFL EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ For his rookie season, Giovanni Carmazzi
will start out on a low simmer. Very low. In fact, his burner won't
even be turned on.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Garcia's coils will be glowing red, Rick Mirer's will be on
low and Tim Rattay's will be on warm. At least Carmazzi has a spot
on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   As the San Francisco 49ers' fourth quarterback, Carmazzi won't
get closer to a game this season than the sidelines. The only way
he'd get in a game is if Garcia, Mirer and Rattay were all trapped
in an elevator with kickoff approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I have to learn through watching,'' said Carmazzi,
the 49ers' third-round draft pick from Hofstra. ``I guess I'll
probably be the fourth guy. You have to prepare as if you're going
to play every week. That can be difficult, I'm sure. It's something
I have to learn to do. It will prepare me for the day I'm actually
out there playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers had planned on keeping three quarterbacks, as they
usually do, until the dynamics of training camp changed things.
Mirer came in and proved himself worthy of the backup job. Rattay,
drafted on the seventh round, earned the No. 3 job by demonstrating
he was more game-ready than Carmazzi.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't throw away a third-round draft pick these days,
especially a quarterback, so the 49ers were compelled to keep
Carmazzi on the 53-man roster. This they did by leaving themselves
short at tight end, where oft-injured Greg Clark and unproven
Justin Swift are the only players at the position.
</P>
<P>
   With the 49ers set to open the regular season this Sunday in
Atlanta, Carmazzi is in for a yearlong routine of throwing to
receivers in individual drills, watching the other three
quarterbacks get all the repetitions in team drills, studying video
ad nauseum and then being inactive on game days.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a misconception that since I struggled (in
training camp) I lost some confidence,'' Carmazzi said. ``I am
certain I'm going to be a damn good quarterback in this league.
It's going to take some time but it's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not discouraged. Discouraged implies a lack of confidence.
I was disappointed in the way I played, especially in the first
(exhibition) game. I wasn't discouraged. I still believe in
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this will be a non-season for Carmazzi, the 49ers are
thinking about shipping him off to NFL Europe next spring to get
some valuable game experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we're going to talk about,'' coach Steve
Mariucci said. ``He needs to play. His experience at Hofstra,
playing before 7,000 people, doesn't prepare him to play in the
Georgia Dome. We have to talk about that with Gio to see if playing
in one of the offseason leagues is in his best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, quarterbacks coach Greg Knapp will work with
Carmazzi on his mechanics during and after practice and again in
the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the mental part of the game that's almost as difficult as
the physical,'' Knapp said. ``He's going to be challenged every
week. It's like the old way with quarterbacks, when 10 or 15 years
ago you brought a quarterback in and hoped to train him for two or
three years. It's kind of nice to have the luxury to do that.''

 BOISE, Idaho: budget surpluses.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``These times are generally very scary,'' said Marcia Craig, an
executive assistant at Boise Cascade, who had to change jobs last
year when her previous employer, Ore-Ida Foods, moved to
Pittsburgh. ``It seems that no matter what you've done, no matter
how long you've done it, there are kids coming out of school that
are going to knock your socks off,'' said Craig, who is raising two
teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a generation gap has emerged at work. Younger
employees, particularly those with a strong educational background,
often view today's job market as a giant bazaar where their skills
are handsomely rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother gets nervous every time I take a new job,''
said Jill Feeler, 30, who since 1996 has worked for a bank, a
hospital and now for Hewlett-Packard in the marketing department.
``She says, `What about your pension?' I'm like, `Pension,
shmension. It's 401(k)'s, grandma.'''
</P>
<P>
   Workers like Feeler, who has both a bachelor's degree and a
master's degree from Boise State University, say it does not bother
them that the bonds between companies and employees have loosened
over the last decade. They have a hard time imaging spending 20
years with one employer anyway. And they are grateful for all the
pay raises and job offers many have received.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Bell, a recent engineering graduate of Brigham Young
University, for instance, moved to Boise this summer with her
sister and two friends. All quickly received full-time job offers,
said Bell, an engineer at Micron Technology, including the two who
had not yet graduated from college and were coming to Idaho just
for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   For most older workers _ be they carpenters and government
employees here who have received scant raises in recent years, or
bank managers watching their companies merge _ the changes are more
unsettling. The message from companies, said Jerry Bresina, an
employee of Idaho Power for the last 27 years, is: What you did
yesterday is not good enough today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough pill to take,'' Bresina said, noting that Idaho
Power has sent him to more classes in the last five years than in
the previous 20 years altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the glazier, said, ``I don't think we're humanly
engineered for the stress level.'' With his wife planning to become
a full-time worker this fall, their children can look forward to
more ``fish-stick and macaroni-and-cheese dinners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aggravating the uncertainty, many workers say, are a number of
trends that the low unemployment rate does not capture. People are
working harder _ per family, three more hours a week than a decade
ago, according to the Economic Policy Institute _ complicating
other areas of life. And household debt is up while health
insurance coverage is down, raising the stakes for people who do
leave their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Boise, Idaho's capital, is a particularly poignant example of
the contradictions. An old gold-mining town, Boise has evolved from
a city filled with headquarters of manufacturing and food companies
to one that boasts Micron, a semiconductor maker, as its largest
employer and a Hewlett-Packard office of 4,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The city ``has transformed itself from a prototypical
old-economy area to a new-economy area,'' said Mark Zandi, the
chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester,
Pa., which tracks regional statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Help-wanted signs are common, despite an influx of new workers.
The region's economy, covering a metropolitan area of about 450,000
people, is growing more quickly than the rest of the nation,
according to Economy.com. And compared with the rest of Idaho,
where agriculture and heavy industry dominate, the city is wealthy
and becoming more so.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also churn in Boise. The most telling example may
be Ore-Ida, a company that sells potatoes, the region's signature
product, to the world and even has Idaho as part of its corporate
name. Travelers who step off planes into the small airport here are
still greeted by an advertisement for the company: ``Welcome to
Boise,'' it states, ``A city we've been proud to call home for over
a quarter-century!''
</P>
<P>
   But today, all that is left of Ore-Ida in Idaho _ besides the ad
_ are four employees closing up shop in an office just east of
downtown.  &UR; H. &LR; J. Heinz, which owns Ore-Ida, has moved it to
Pittsburgh during the last two years to combine it with its Weight
Watchers frozen-food product line to save money. Boise lost about
300 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly the only turmoil here. West One Bancorp was bought
by U.S. Bancorp in 1995, and First Security is disappearing into
Wells Fargo. Hewlett-Packard has shed many of its production jobs
but is adding white-collar workers. Albertson's, a fast-growing
supermarket company based in Boise, has been trying to integrate
its operation with the American Stores Co., which it bought last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, mergers have more than quadrupled in the
last decade to about 8,000 a year, according to Mergerstat, leaving
jobs in jeopardy in nearly every instance. And corporate
relocations have roughly doubled in the last four years, according
to Site Selection Magazine, a trade journal based in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But to judge from Ore-Ida, losing a job today does not mean what
it did a few years ago. Nearly all of the company's former
employees seem to have received job offers elsewhere. A surprising
number are earning a salary close to their old one, say both the
workers and Bae Emilson, a consultant with the out-placement firm
Drake Beam Morin that Heinz is paying to help the employees with
their job search.
</P>
<P>
   While they say they miss their old colleagues, some even
consider Ore-Ida's departure to be a good development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every single person I know says this is the best thing
that has happened to them,'' Craig said. Her salary at Boise
Cascade is slightly lower than what Ore-Ida was paying her, and her
new job as an executive assistant is a notch lower. But she finds
the work more creative _ a discovery she suspects she never would
have made had she not been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Ore-Ida alumni agree that few of them will
ever feel as secure in their jobs as they once did.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That view is common in Boise, not just among those who have had
to change jobs but also with those who have only heard about
dislocation through friends or the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said she now keeps her resume updated, especially after
Boise Cascade considered eliminating her department only weeks
after she arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a different attitude,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Miren Lolley, who ran Ore-Ida's information technology
department, has decided to use her severance pay to take about a
year off after working for the company for 21 years. Then she hopes
to become a consultant so she can control her own schedule, leaving
time to eat lunch and dinner with her friends and two sons, as she
has been able to do since Ore-Ida left.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Lolley said, she wants to avoid working long
hours for a company without knowing whether her job is secure.
``Nobody,'' she said, ``trained us for that.''

WEST TEXAS TOWN FINDS A WAY AROUND CURBS ON PREGAME PRAYERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pregame high school football prayers are as big a problem for
Texas schools this season as are the win-loss record, cross-town
rivalries and good chili-cheese dogs that won't drip.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this year that public,
student-led prayers before football games are unconstitutional,
school districts nationwide have been wrestling with options to
have prayers without violating the legal restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a confusing situation. On the one hand, the high
court said there can be prayers, but on the other, it said those
prayers cannot be organized, performed, sanctioned or linked to the
school district or its administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to make sure that people are not coerced into
sitting through prayers that might run counter to their beliefs; to
make sure that no student feels peer pressure to participate in a
religious ceremony that violates his or her faith.
</P>
<P>
   Some districts have simply given up the concept of pregame
prayers, believing that the landscape is laid with legal land
mines. Others still hold that pregame prayers _ such as those
pleading for safety and sportsmanship _ are as much a part of
Friday night football as are cheerleaders, crashing shoulder pads
and face painting.
</P>
<P>
   One Mississippi school has decided that before the game, the
folks in the stands will break out into a spontaneous Lord's
Prayer. Critics ask how anyone can break out in ``planned''
spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Texas town of Albany, they think they have a better
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for prayers before Albany home games were announced last
week at the school board meeting, but the school board didn't come
up with the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   David Mallory, pastor at First Christian Church (Disciples of
Christ), told trustees that the Albany Ministerial Alliance decided
it will lead prayers in a grassy area near the home bleachers
before each home game.
</P>
<P>
   Fans from both teams _ visitors and home _ will be invited to
pray before the Pledge of Allegiance and other pregame activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alliance feels compelled to offer opportunities for people
to manifest their faith,'' Mallory said in a telephone interview.
``Obviously, the Supreme Court has put restrictions on them, and we
understand that. But many people still want to vocalize their faith
and that's what we're going to help them do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallory said that at each home game, a minister in the grassy
area will lead prayers. The alliance is made up of about a
half-dozen churches in town, he said. Among them are Baptist,
Presbyterian, Methodist, Catholic and an independent.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Jewish congregation in Albany, a community of 1,985,
about 30 miles east of Abilene, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grassy area is not near the stadium seating,'' Mallory
said. ``But it is inside the gate, and it is a public access area.
The ministers will lead the prayers before the actual, official
activities begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be there 5 or 10 minutes, just long enough to have a
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallory said he doesn't know whether the alliance plan will draw
``a small circle of people, a mob or a block.'' The plan will be
promoted through local churches and the local newspaper, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is completely within the confines of the law. And the
school board cannot validate it or encourage it, but because it is
in a public area, they can't stop it either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mallory said the players can't take part in the prayers, but he
emphasized that they never did. ``They were always in the locker
rooms when the school prayers were given,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no opposition to the plan from any quarter in the
community, the clergyman added.

&HT;     RAIDERS DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR HAS REASON TO HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ Raiders defensive coordinator Chuck Bresnahan
is cautiously optimistic about how his unit will perform Sunday
afternoon against the San Diego Chargers and for the rest of the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I think the sky is the limit with this defense,''
Bresnahan said. ``But we are so unproven at so many positions right
now. We could have as many as six new people on the field at one
time. So I don't want to make any brash statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it sounded as if Bresnahan really had to fight the urge.
And based on the unit's improvement during the preseason, his
excitement is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rams effortlessly rolled through the defense for 344
yards in the exhibition opener in St. Louis, the improvement was
marked. The next week, the Cowboys managed only 256 yards rushing
and passing. Detroit was almost completely stymied when it had the
ball, accumulating 221 yards. And in the final preseason tuneup,
when the defense shut out Seattle, 20-0, the Seahawks had 279 total
yards, including only 39 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to question this statistical improvement. The
Cowboys are adjusting to life under a new coach, Dave Campo, and
went 0-5 in the preseason. The Lions began their game with backup
Mike Tomzcak starting at quarterback, then lost him to an injury.
And the Seahawks, a conference opponent Oakland will play Oct. 22,
appeared to phone in their effort.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one lingering memory from the preseason, it is the
way the first-string Super Bowl champion Rams shredded the Raiders
first-string defense, moving down the field effortlessly whether
NFL MVP Kurt Warner or Trent Green was taking the snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have got a tremendous arsenal of weapons in their
offense,'' Bresnahan said. ``So to be tested by them early, in
their home stadium, on that turf, with them already having a
game-type preparation against Tennessee, there was no reason to
panic at that point. There really wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the game was over, the coach wasted no time at all making
sure his players got that message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told our guys, `hey, don't get discouraged. Understand,
that's what it's going to be like. And we have to raise our bar up
to that level. Just keep doing the things you're doing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's what they've done. There was no loss of confidence.
There was no panic. They just kept working.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Bresnahan is reluctant to declare his defense
ready to take on the world just yet is that he hasn't seen his
first-stringers for an entire game. And the defensive line has
hardly worked together at all.
</P>
<P>
   End Lance Johnstone missed the final two exhibition games with a
groin injury. Nose tackle Grady Jackson made a brief appearance
against Detroit and sat out the Seattle game with an ankle injury.
Both returned to practice on Monday and are expected to start
against the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little concern,'' the coach said. ``You definitely
want to see how these guys work together. For the linebackers to
see how the linemen play. But it's different than the offensive
line. Offensive football is so much assignment football. Whereas we
are an attacking, aggressive-style of defense. So it (playing as a
unit in the preseason) is not as critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Regan Upshaw started three of the four games at left end. He may
start again against the Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, I don't know if there's a true starter,'' Bresnahan
said. ``Tony Bryant brings some things that Regan may lack, and
Regan brings some things that Tony Bryant may lack. And you've got
Josh Taves, too. I'm a firm believer you've got to keep people
fresh. You're going to see a rotation there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was the starting left end when the 1999 season ended. He
says he's not upset about having to share playing time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with it,'' he said. ``Regan's been around the
league awhile. This is just my second year. And with my ankle
injury (last season), I haven't played a full year yet. So I'm
still learning.''
</P>
<P>
   While his line coach may urge caution about the defense's
potential, Bryant is having none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up front, we're looking good,'' he said. ``The linebacking and
secondary are good. In the preseason, when the ones and twos were
in there, we did good. I think we've got great depth. We're going
to be great.''

CRAVING FOOD THAT CAN KILL, OR AT LEAST BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TED LEE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's most fascinating food book, ``Noodling for
Flatheads: Moonshine, Monster Catfish and Other Southern
Comforts,'' is not at first glance a book about food. The only
photo is on the cover, an unappetizing shot of writhing catfish,
thorny mouths agape. The lone recipe in 250-odd pages is for
``sugar liquor,'' moonshine distilled from sugar, malt,
Fleischmann's yeast and horse feed.
</P>
<P>
   The book, by Burkhard Bilger (Scribner, $24), is a collection of
powerful essays about the people who keep vanishing Southern
traditions alive, and because foodways are among the South's most
enduring regional distinctions, five of the eight essays are about
food. Bilger, German-born but Oklahoma-reared, has assembled a cast
of food devotees that would shock and enthrall the most jaded urban
epicure.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Steve Rector, is willing to die for his favorite
dish. Like more than a few rural Kentuckians, he hunts squirrels
for their brains, long considered a delicacy. In 1997, two Kentucky
neurologists posited a link between Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a
variant of mad cow disease, and eating squirrel brains. Health
officials no longer allow Rector to serve the brains at the state's
annual folklife festival, but he still eats them. ``You gotta die
of somethin', '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the title essay, Bilger spends a day with a former high
school classmate, Lee McFarlin, who catches catfish using his
fingers as both bait and hook. ``Noodling'' is slang for this
method of fishing; ``flatheads'' are a variety of catfish that
don't bite as hard as ``blue cats.'' Yes, catfish have teeth, and
Bilger loses some skin noodling a 25-pound flathead.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Patridge, in the essay ``Low on the Hog,'' endures a less
physical challenge to satisfy his passion for chitlins, aka
chitterlings, or hog intestines. At Scholars, his restaurant and
teaching center at Morris Brown College at Atlanta, he teaches
continental cuisine and soul food. But chitlins were once slave
rations, and their gamy aroma can be a painful reminder. When
Patridge steams up his kitchen with a potful, his student chefs
steer clear.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Bilger's cooks, Patridge has an enviable closeness to
his ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has any idea ... where their food comes from,'' the
manager of a chicken processing plant tells Bilger in ``Enter the
Chicken,'' an essay on cockfighting, as he takes the author on a
gruesome tour of the plant. Bilger's subjects know exactly where
their food comes from, and their taste for certain foods has become
an almost physical need over a lifetime. Patridge was 14 when he
slaughtered his first hog. McFarlin noodled his first fish when he
was 8. Rector has hunted squirrel since he was 6.
</P>
<P>
   Progress has turned these foods into fringe indulgences. In
Atlanta, hot dogs have replaced chitlins in some soul food joints.
In Kentucky, coal mining and development have all but obliterated
the nut trees that sustained squirrels. Noodlers fear that the Army
Corps of Engineers' dredging of rivers deprives them of catfish.
</P>
<P>
   But Bilger's book is not a catalog of dying traditions. His
lyrical narratives thrum with energy and affection. They celebrate
cravings as being deeply personal, utterly illogical and
irrepressibly alive.

ESSENCE OF FRUIT, CRYSTALIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Granitas are the most primitive frozen desserts,
reportedly originating in imperial Rome, where Alpine ice was mixed
with fruit juice to make a crunchy, cold treat for the emperors.
They have the flavor of sorbet if not the creaminess, and they take
very little work and even less equipment to make.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect smooth texture from granitas; that's not what
they're about. Granitas are most similar to the shaved ice served
on some New York street corners in the summer _ superrefreshing but
hardly elegant. While shaved ice is just that, with overly sweet,
artificially flavored syrup poured over it, a granita is a frozen
flavored liquid. When you make it yourself, you control the quality
of the ingredients, and, of course, the level of sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   All you need is a freezer, an ice tray or shallow bowl and a
fork or spoon to make granitas, but they do require a little
attention. You must stir them every half-hour or so while they're
in the freezer, to keep large chunks of ice from forming. The ideal
granita is a slushy blend of juicy crystals in ice-cold liquid. It
attains this texture after about two hours of freezing, and will
retain it for a couple of hours more with occasional stirring.
</P>
<P>
   If you pack a granita in a tightly sealed container and keep it
frozen, it will hold for a week or more. You can get it to return
to something approaching its original texture by letting it thaw
slightly and raking through it with a fork (or pulsing it several
times in a food processor). But I suggest making granitas the day
you plan to eat them.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor combinations for granitas are unlimited. Fruit or citrus
juices, coffee or chocolate, and fruit purees or juices are best.
You can also take granitas further and add a little coffee to your
chocolate (or vice versa), or try making them with a sweetened
brewed tea, like jasmine or Earl Grey. Or you can simply freeze a
sweetened canned juice like pineapple. But don't use pieces of
fruit, which will become unpleasantly hard when frozen.
</P>
<P>
   To speed the process, chill the bowl or tray before adding the
liquid. The broader the tray, the faster the mix will freeze.
</P>
<P>
   COFFEE GRANITA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes, plus 2 to 3 hours' freezing
</P>
<P>
   3 cups freshly brewed strong coffee
</P>
<P>
   { cup sugar, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cocoa powder, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Stir coffee, sugar and cocoa together; taste and add more
sugar if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pour mixture into shallow metal or glass pan or bowl. Freeze
about 30 minutes, or until ice crystals begin to form at the edges.
Gently stir the crystals back into the liquid, not breaking them up
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   3. Continue to stir and break up clumps of crystals every
half-hour or so. When the entire mixture has the texture of soft
crushed ice, it's ready to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: News, gossip from the wrestling industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is considered to be one of the World Wrestling Federation's
centerpiece pay-per-views and by most accounts ``SummerSlam'' lived
up to the hype.
</P>
<P>
   With additional advertising from MTV, last Sunday's pay-per-view
should be one WWF's most-watched shows for the year. Despite
another main event that featured The Rock and Triple H, the show
was highlighted by some high-flying stunts that only the WWF can
supply (are you listening WCW?). The three-tag team match between
Edge and Christian, the Dudley Boyz and the Hardy Boyz featured
some of the toughest stunts in the history of the WWF. The ``TLC''
match _ which featured tables, ladders and chairs _ resembled a
hardcore match and had all the high-flying antics the Hardy Boyz
have helped fuse into WWF action.
</P>
<P>
   While that was a classic match in terms of the physical
performances, it was the emotional drama of the main event that
helped to sell a match that fans have seen in some form at least 12
times in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Angle made the jump from mid-carder to main-event status
and showed fans that he will be around for a long time. His
``friendship'' with Triple H's wife, Stephanie, helped build a rift
between Angle and Triple H. That split allowed the Rock to retain
his title. The WWF wisely found a way to increase the feud between
Angle and Triple H. As a result, expect those two to be the main
event for the next pay-per-view in the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights from ``SummerSlam'' were a return to the ring
for Jerry ``The King'' Lawler. His match with Tazz has really put
the former ECW champion back in the forefront of the WWF fans'
minds. This should propel Tazz into solid mid-card status in hopes
of sending him back to the main event status he enjoyed for years
with ECW. Also, Stephen Richards continues his climb up the WWF
ladder with his censorship group. They are creating good television
and the act is getting the WWF's ``no censorship'' message across.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monday night was a big night for the ``Nitro'' show with the
introduction of the New World Order 2000. Vince Russo has merged
Jeff Jarrett, Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner into the new power of
the WCW. They are pitted against ``Stone Cold'' _ oops _ I mean
Goldberg, Booker T and Mike Awesome. Hopefully this storyline will
last longer than just the next pay-per-view. Putting some
consistency in the storylines would really help WCW's rating more
than anything else they have tried. For those of you who watched
the whole ``Nitro,'' you caught Bret Hart's return. Although the
Hitman was there, it doesn't look like he's in any shape to return
to the ring anytime soon. Too bad for WCW and the fans.

SWEET CORN SOUFFLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the third of several columns by Eberhard Mueller, the
executive chef and an owner of Lutece. They are being written with
Jack Bishop.) 
 By EBENHARD MUELLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I moved to the United States 18 years ago, corn
was a discovery to me, but it seemed shockingly sweet and
one-dimensional. I now love all that sweetness, but it took me a
while to figure out how to deal with it. Over the years, I have
learned that spiciness and acidity are necessary to balance corn
sugars. That's why I add chilies to the batter for corn fritters
and lime or lemon juice to corn chowder.
</P>
<P>
   I use both those ingredients in my savory corn souffle, which is
a perfect vehicle for appreciating old-fashioned corn flavor. Any
hot chili can be used, but a super-hot habanero keeps the corn and
sweet bell peppers from tasting cloying. (Wear gloves while you
chop it, because it will burn your skin.)
</P>
<P>
   The acidity comes in the form of grated lime zest and a few
drops of lime juice. To understand the importance of some acidity,
taste the souffle base before adding the lime juice. It will seem
flat and underseasoned. Add the lime juice, and taste again. The
flavors will be rounder, fuller and more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh herbs, especially mint, cilantro, basil or tarragon, will
also make corn taste less sweet and more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I infuse mint into the milk for this souffle. It adds
a bracing but not overwhelming bite.
</P>
<P>
   Serve this souffle in small portions as a first course, or spoon
out larger portions for brunch or a light supper.
</P>
<P>
   SWEET CORN SOUFFLE WITH PEPPERS AND MINT
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   { cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig mint
</P>
<P>
   2{ cups corn kernels (cut from 5 ears sweet corn)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus extra for pan
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 yellow bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   1 red habanero chili, stemmed, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and ground white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon flour, plus extra for pan
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   { lime.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place milk and mint sprig in medium saucepan and heat until
warm. Remove from heat and let steep about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Puree 2 cups corn kernels in food processor until smooth.
Reserve remaining { cup kernels.
</P>
<P>
   3. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large skillet. Add peppers and
cook over medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes. Season with
salt and pepper. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   4. Fill large roasting pan with 1 inch of water and place in
middle of oven. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   5. Remove and discard mint from milk. Return saucepan to
medium-low heat, add 2 remaining tablespoons butter and bring to a
simmer. When butter melts, slowly whisk in flour and cook, whisking
frequently, until mixture is smooth and quite thick, about 5
minutes. Remove pan from heat and cool a minute or two. Whisk in
egg yolks. Grate zest from lime into mixture and stir to
incorporate. Stir in pureed corn and \ cup corn kernels. Stir in
sauteed peppers. Season with salt and pepper and a few drops of
lime juice. At this point the mixture should be somewhat too spicy
and a bit overseasoned. Scrape mixture into large bowl. (Bowl can
be covered and refrigerated several hours.)
</P>
<P>
   6. Butter and flour a 2-quart souffle dish.
</P>
<P>
   7. With electric mixer, whip egg whites until stiff but not
overbeaten. With rubber spatula, gently fold egg whites into corn
mixture. Scrape mixture into souffle dish and sprinkle with
remaining corn kernels.
</P>
<P>
   8. Place dish in water bath in oven and bake until souffle is
well browned and puffed, about 1 hour. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 first-course servings.

 &HT;    JAILED 'SHE WOLF' WAS ONE OF MEXICO'S CLASSIC RULING PARTY
BOSSES
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    EDs: Chimalhuacan is southeast, and adjacent to Mexico City.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico _ Just talking about ``La Loba,'' the She
Wolf, makes Teresa Gonzalez's palms break out in a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Mexico's July 2 election, Gonzalez dared to argue
with La Loba over who she was going to vote for. Days later
somebody pumped a barrage of bullets through the front door of
Gonzalez's cinderblock hovel.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt in Gonzalez's mind that the assault was ordered
by La Loba, who's real name is Guadalupe Buendia, a woman who used
nepotism, high-level connections _ and fear and favors _ to run
this vast slum of 1.2 million people like a fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the law here. She had the power to make things better
here and she never did it,'' said Gonzalez, a seamstress who lives
on a tiny plot that La Loba sold her in this urban stew of trash,
mud, sewage and snarling street dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Plump and middle-aged, Buendia's looks belie her intimidating
nickname. But she is an infamous figure in Mexico these days, a
symbol of the abusive local party bosses that this country's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI, nourished during its
71-year monopoly on most government offices power.
</P>
<P>
   After a week on the lam, La Loba is now in jail, charged with
gathering a mob armed with wooden boards, pistols and homemade
bombs to attack a rival during his inauguration on Aug. 18 as the
city's new mayor. Ten people died in the melee, which pit one
faction of PRI loyalists against another.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened there is part of Mexican politics that continues
to be savage,'' said political analyst Edna Jaime. On July 2, the
PRI lost the presidency for the first time in seven decades, a
phenomenon that represents ``the civilized Mexico,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But as the PRI's power slips, more violence could erupt as local
party bosses fight to keep the wealth and control they amassed,
Jaime said. ``The PRI knew how to handle these predators before.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Buendia was a behind-the-scenes power in this city
and a PRI operative in a vote-rich area. In exchange for virtual
impunity for abuses and looting _ a traditional arrangement _ she
mustered votes for the party from slum dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   She let poor migrants from provinces squat on land and
shepherded them into PRI-affiliated neighborhood groups that
promised they would one day obtain better services for residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother died, she bought the casket,'' said Elsa
Arrieta, who sells chickens on a street _ one of the few that's
paved _ where La Loba had one of her many homes.
</P>
<P>
   Buendia served jail time for extortion in connection with a land
swindle, but she was released in early 1999 and was still going
strong up through April, when her empire began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI declined to put La Loba's son up for mayor in the July 2
election. And La Loba had a lot at stake. Her cousin was mayor,
husband the treasurer, son the municipal secretary and sister the
director of family services. La Loba was in charge of water, and if
one person failed to pay a bill or did something to displease her
she would halt service to an entire block.
</P>
<P>
   She was also director of retrieving garbage _ at which she was
an obvious failure _ using donkey-drawn carts whose owners were
also affiliated with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talked about mechanizing the garbage collection, she
felt threatened,'' said the new mayor, Jesus Tolentino, also of the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   He said everyone complained about getting charged for
non-existent garbage collection. And they griped about the police,
who they said extorted with La Loba's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   La Loba's questionable land sales began to make her enemies,
too. Gonzalez, for example, doesn't have the title to her property
nine years after paying La Loba. She paid to have a water pipe put
in four years ago and only got her hook-up in June. Like so many
others here, Gonzalez's only toilet is an outhouse. She steals
electricity from power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said La Loba was furious with the PRI for turning down
her son, so she lobbied to have a nephew named mayoral candidate
for Mexico's leftist Democratic Revolution Party, which had tried
to make inroads in Chimalhuacan.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to force Gonzalez, who is also considered a local
leader, to gather votes for her nephew. When Gonzalez refused, her
house was sprayed with gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   La Loba did manage to stick with the PRI's candidates for
president and Congress. On Mother's Day, she threw a huge fiesta,
featuring male strippers who peeled off boxers that spelled: ``Vote
PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   That event embarrassed the party. But the PRI was mortified when
followers of La Loba launched an attack during Tolentino's
inauguration at Chimalhuacan's city hall.
</P>
<P>
   La Loba claims she is innocent, and accused followers of
Tolentino that belong to another PRI slum dwellers' group, Peasant
Torch, with inciting the violence.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the city hall, Tolentino brushed off unsavory
stories about Peasant Torch, which has also been accused of
shock-troop tactics against enemies.
</P>
<P>
   He said his job now is to restore order and help improve the
party's image here. Tolentino and the new treasurer, for example,
said they didn't find one official document on file here and the
strong box was completely empty. Because of unpaid bills, the city
is about $8 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also clear,'' Tolentino said, ``that authorities in the
state of Mexico and within our party _- the PRI _ always knew what
was going on here.''

 &HT;    SAT SCORES REMAIN STABLE
 &HT;    360&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Average scores on SAT college aptitude tests
reached a 30-year high in math and stayed steady for the fifth
straight year on the verbal portion, the College Board announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston Caperton, president of the College Board, described the
trend as ``encouraging,'' especially since the tests _ once taken
by an elite that included fewer than one-third of high school
graduates _ now are taken by 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise in math scores is cause for cautious optimism, as is
the stability of verbal scores,'' Caperton said at the National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the SAT test-takers this year included a
higher proportion than ever before of people who usually score
slightly lower _ women, non-whites, students whose parents didn't
go to college, and those for whom English is a second language.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum possible score on an SAT test is 800 in math and 800
in verbal skills. This year, the average SAT scores:
</P>
<P>
   _ Reached 514 in math, up 3 points since last year and 13 points
since 1990. This year's math scores were the highest since 1969,
when the average was 517.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stayed at 505 on the verbal portion, as it has since 1996.
That was up five points from 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Two new patterns emerged from the statistical studies of test
scores by experts at the New York-based College Board, a non-profit
consortium of colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   First, more college-bound high school students are taking the
tough courses recommended for anyone who wants to go to college.
More than 1.2 million students took the latest exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last decade, male and female students from all ethnic
backgrounds have been taking more pre-calculus, calculus and
physics,'' Caperton said. ``The SAT math scores of students who
take these courses are well above the national average.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the high school grade-point averages of SAT test-takers
are rising faster than their SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, 40 percent of students reported grade averages in
the A range (A-plus, A or A-minus), up from 28 percent 10 years
ago. We believe this reflects some improvement, but it also
indicates some grade inflation,'' Caperton said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Although women tend to get higher grades in college, men still
get higher SAT scores. Critics of standardized testing once again
pounced upon this anomaly, since SAT scores are touted as a way for
college admission officers to tell how well students will do in
college.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest of
Cambridge, Mass., a nonprofit group that urges colleges to make
aptitude tests optional, said, ``On the rival admissions test, the
ACT, male and female scores are essentially the same. So the SAT
gender gap says more about the test's biases than educational
attainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending the SAT tests, Caperton said the SAT gender gap is
getting narrower.
</P>
<P>
   Men had an edge of 41 points on the math portion and 9 points on
the verbal portion a decade ago. Since then, because women's SAT
scores have been rising faster than those of men, the gap has been
reduced to 35 points on the math portion and 3 points on the verbal
portion.
</P>
<P>
   He said the gap may linger because women are more numerous, more
ethnically diverse and more likely than men to come from families
where neither parent attended college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also know that there's a difference in their course-taking
patterns,'' he said. For example, he said, women in college may
major in areas like the humanities, in which he believes grades
tend to be higher than in male-dominated majors such as engineering
or math.
</P>
<P>
   This year's results also show that whites continue to get the
highest average verbal scores and Asian Americans the highest
average math scores. Over the past 10 years, the only minority
groups whose SAT scores rose faster than those of whites were
Asian-Americans, Puerto Ricans and American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   On the verbal tests since 1990, scores have risen by an average
of 21 points for Puerto Ricans, followed by Asian Americans, 16;
American Indians, also 16; whites, 9; African Americans, 6, and
other Hispanics, 2, while falling 4 points for Mexican Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On the math tests during that decade, scores rose by 19 points
for Asian Americans, followed by whites, 15; Puerto Ricans, 14;
American Indians, 13; African Americans, 7, and other Hispanics, 3,
while remaining unchanged for Mexican Americans.

   NEW YORK _ It is possible that friendship with a country is not
so different from a friendship with a person. You close your eyes
to flaws, sometimes significant ones, preferring not to see them,
even as others point them out.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it was with Lois Wheeler Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Edgar Snow, was an American journalist who came to
know Mao Tse-tung and Zhou Enlai when they were struggling
communist revolutionaries in the '30s, and he remained on cordial
terms with them even when China was closed to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Snow is one of the few Americans to have been buried with
honors in communist China. After her husband's death, Snow, a
onetime Broadway actress who gave up her career to follow her
husband abroad, made several trips to China and was treated as an
honored guest.
</P>
<P>
   Those days, of what she calls ``the nice well-behaved Snow,''
are now over.
</P>
<P>
   Snow, who turned 80 last month, has been protesting human rights
violations in China since the violent suppression of the Tiananmen
Square demonstrations in 1989. This April, she traveled to Beijing
from her home in Switzerland to try to meet with Ding Zilin, whose
son was killed during the Tiananmen crackdown, and was prevented
from doing so by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as Li Peng, the chairman of China's National People's
Congress, who was prime minister in 1989, comes to New York as a
delegate to the Conference of Presiding Officers of National
Parliaments at the United Nations, Snow is also here. Working with
the group Human Rights in China, she is demanding an investigation
of the Tiananmen killings and the release of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   She has also said that she may have to consider removing her
husband's ashes from China.
</P>
<P>
   Is such a thing possible?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very difficult physically,'' Snow says, at Human
Rights' Manhattan office. ``I know that they are buried in a cement
or stone container deep in the earth. But what is important is that
I maintain that threat, and if it gets to a point it is necessary
to get the ashes out, at least it will be a worldwide scream. It
would be a tremendous blow to the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   How did a Broadway actress become an activist?
</P>
<P>
   ``I married Edgar Snow. That's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Their story begins in 1945 in New York. Snow, then Wheeler, 25,
who had grown up in a conservative Republican home in Stockton,
Calif., was a leading lady on Broadway. Edgar Snow, 15 years her
senior, was a journalistic star, the author of the 1937 classic
``Red Star Over China.'' The two met at a party for Russian War
Relief and married four years later.
</P>
<P>
   The McCarthy era was difficult for both. Though Lois Snow says
she never joined any political party, she was blacklisted. She was,
however, able to continue working in a television soap opera, ``The
Guiding Light.'' (``Nurse Janet Jackson,'' Snow remembers. ``She
was after all the doctors in the hospital.'')
</P>
<P>
   Her husband fared less well.
</P>
<P>
   ``China was a dirty word and a very dangerous one, and nobody
was willing to publish Edgar Snow,'' Snow said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 the Snows, now with a son and daughter, moved to
Switzerland, where Snow was able to work and Mrs. Snow could not.
In 1970, when Snow was reporting on China, the Snows were invited
to stand with Mao on the reviewing stand during a National Day
observance.
</P>
<P>
   It was the time of the Cultural Revolution, with those critical
of Mao sent to prisons and work camps, but that was not apparent to
the Snows. Her husband tried to learn what was happening, Snow
says, but ``the facts were not there, plus he was ill.''
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half later, as her husband was dying, Prime
Minister Zhou sent three doctors and a nurse to Eysins, the Snows'
small village in Switzerland. They stayed for three weeks, until
his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything Ed needed was immediately supplied. It was one of the
most wonderful things in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next 15 years, Snow traveled yearly to China, for many
years blind to the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. ``I was
surprised the central bookstore in Peking had nothing but
propaganda,'' she says, using the older word for Beijing. ``I knew
that was crazy, but I accepted it as part of _ I don't know. The
schools were closed, the students were out working, they didn't
have time for books.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she made a living after her husband's death, Snow at
first sidesteps the question. Later, she returns to the subject
herself. She did a lecture tour in the United States and Europe,
she says, telling people how ``wonderful'' the Cultural Revolution
was. In the '80s, as books on the abuses of the Cultural Revolution
appeared, she resisted them. Tiananmen changed her.
</P>
<P>
   Does she now feel foolish about that lecture tour?
</P>
<P>
   A sad, small little smile, which would be recognized by anyone
who has been disappointed in a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe how I feel. I feel I was used. I know I
was naive. They encouraged my lecture series. When a few years
later it turned out that what I was talking about was nonsense, it
is true I felt used. They needed Ed; without him, they needed me.
And I fell for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard even for me to realize that I went for such a long
time without being aware of the transgressions of human rights,
that it took Tiananmen to wake me up. There it was on television;
in the living room, in front of your face. The kids, my children,
were with me. We were screaming. It was like being there.''

RECORD DRYNESS IN TEXAS LIKELY TO UNCORK RICHER WINES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By GORDON DICKSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAPEVINE, Texas _ The scorched, yellow grass along highways is
a depressing sight for many as Dallas-Fort Worth eclipses its
50-year-old record for consecutive days without rain.
</P>
<P>
   For 59 days, the area has gone without rain, breaking a record
set in 1934 and repeated in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nobody feels the effects more than farmers and ranchers.
State agricultural officials estimate $595 million in losses this
year because of the parched conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But not all farmers are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless dryness, which conjures images of the 1930s Dust
Bowl, is helping Texas grape growers produce sweeter fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Wine drinkers can look forward to richer libations from Texas'
38 commercial vineyards, growers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sunshine and heat make them sweet, and once that sugar
content is up, you've got to harvest,'' said Camille McBee,
marketing director at La Buena Vida Vineyards in Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   The Metroplex has had 36 days with temperatures of 100 degrees
or more this year, including five in a row. The high Tuesday was
expected to hit 102 at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, and forecasters
at the National Weather Service call for much of the same
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions are similar in wine-growing areas of Texas, from the
High Plains to the Hill Country, and a wave of optimism is blowing
across the wine industry like a November breeze.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, a hot and dry summer has aided
grape production. The results of harvests will be available for
tasting during fall festivals across the state, including the 14th
annual GrapeFest Sept. 8-10 in Grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   La Buena Vida harvested a week early because the fruit ripened
quickly at its vineyards in Grapevine and Springtown, McBee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that grapes are an arid plant,'' she
said. ``They don't like a lot of water when the fruit is hanging.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine production probably will slip below last year's level of
1.2 million gallons, said Tim Dodd, director of the Texas Wine
Research Institute. Still, wine producers are expected to surpass
the million-gallon mark and bottle high quality wine because of the
dry heat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers' grapevines suffered early this year because of
depleted water supplies at the start of the growing season, which
contributed to the projected decrease in overall production, Dodd
said.
</P>
<P>
   Grapes, which are among the world's hardiest plants, can endure
hot, dry weather, but they need a generous supply of water in the
spring and early summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers whose crops made it to a rainy June that was followed by
eight weeks of savage summer dryness _ a nearly perfect combination
for grapes _ are being rewarded with high-quality harvests, Dodd
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a nice dry spell,'' Dodd said. ``It's usually really
good for grapes to have a dry spell when people are harvesting.
Most of the growers have just gone through harvest. Overall, things
have been excellent for grapes this year, especially up on the High
Plains.''
</P>
<P>
   After three consecutive dry summers in Texas, bottles of wine on
store shelves should be among the best-tasting ever offered by
state wineries, wine enthusiasts said. Many of the white wines in
stores now were manufactured in 1999, and many of the red wines
were made in 1999, 1998 or 1997.
</P>
<P>
   John Brancato, owner and managing partner of La Bodega Winery in
Grapevine, buys some grapes from farmers who used to deal solely in
crops such as cotton and grains.
</P>
<P>
   La Bodega, which is in D/FW Airport, buys grapes from
independent producers and bottles about 1,300 cases of wine each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three years in a row, we are getting a lot of the old
cotton growers who are saying, `You know what? Maybe I need to put
in 50 acres of vines to hedge against the bad times.' A person we
buy from has 900 to 1,000 acres, and 100 acres is grapevines. It is
a hedge crop.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Texans have prayed for rain since early July, but many
grape growers silently hoped for the status quo, winemakers said.
</P>
<P>
   Rainy summers may increase the volume of grapes, but the quality
often is not as good, Cap Rock Winery President Dewayne ``De''
Pierce said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give up a little bit of quality when you get a bumper
crop,'' said Pierce, whose winery operates a 1,200-acre vineyard in
the Lubbock area of West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Now that harvest is over in most Texas vineyards, it is safe for
everyone _ including grape growers _ to pray for rain.

BLOODY MARTINI, ANYONE? 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps no other drink has been humiliated by
interpretation the way the martini and the Bloody Mary have. For
the serious drinker these days, even a straight one invites
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   The Peppar Tomato at Wallse in the West Village, however, could
be the first (and only) exception, for it manages to be an
interpretation that plays it straight. It is part martini and part
Bloody Mary, with the best qualities of both.
</P>
<P>
   There is the crispness and chill of the vodka _ quickly
converted to a flash of alcoholic warmth on the tongue. It is
joined by the familiar tomato and salt, and finally a pinch of heat
at the back of your throat. It is as startling as it is delightful.
It is clean yet meaty. Savory yet sweet. A martini yet a Bloody
Mary.
</P>
<P>
   After a few sips _ which you will surely take in quick
succession _ a sweetness sinks in. Not a cloying sweetness but a
round, fresh sweetness like that of a ripe plum.
</P>
<P>
   The drink uses two kinds of vodka, but its foundation is tomato
water, made with ripe beefsteak tomatoes, from the Greenmarket.
Kurt Gutenbrunner, the chef at Wallse, purees them with salt and
strains the mixture overnight in cheesecloth. What is left is a
pale yellow juice, as thin as water, as concentrated and saline as
oyster liquor.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender mixes the tomato water with Absolut vodka and
Absolut Peppar vodka, and lets in a drop of Tabasco and a dash of
celery salt. Then he shakes it and shakes it, straining it into a
chilled martini glass.
</P>
<P>
   The first sip, if you get it quickly enough, will be frothy, as
a well-made drink should be. Then the salt will come. Then the
sweetness. Soon it will be gone, and all that will be left is a
question: Why on earth did he call something so lovely such a
peculiar name?

BUYING SIRLOIN? GRILL THE BUTCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN WILLOUGHBYand CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A thick, juicy sirloin steak is an American culinary
classic, up there with cheeseburgers and apple pie. Pound per
pound, sirloin far outsells all other steaks bought by home cooks,
who prize its relatively tender texture and low price.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sirloin may well be the most misunderstood steak of all, as
not all steaks that bear the name are alike. One may be tender and
juicy, and another quite tough, even a bit gnarly. So it pays to
understand the nature of the beast _ or at least the part of the
beast where these steaks originate.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's eliminate one source of misunderstanding. When you
order a sirloin steak in a restaurant, what you are most likely to
be served is not technically a sirloin at all. Instead, it is a
steak cut from the top loin muscle, which is located in the short
loin of the steer, just behind the ribs. This popular little steak,
also called New York strip or just plain strip steak (among other
things), is very tender and very pricey. In a supermarket, you may
find this cut labeled as strip sirloin and it will cost about 40
percent more than real sirloin.
</P>
<P>
   Real sirloin steak is cut from the hip of the steer. In culinary
terms, it is a kind of bridge between the luxuriously tender short
loin and the rather tough rump area, which is most often cut into
roasts. Because the sirloin section contains the large hipbone,
cutting it into portions can be problematic. This leads to a lot of
variation _ and confusion. These steaks come in two basic
categories, depending on how the butcher decides to approach the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, butchers commonly cut the sirloin against the grain
through the bone, and some still do. This creates four different
steaks, named according to the part of the hipbone they contain.
Working from the front to the back of the animal, they are known as
pin bone, flat bone, round bone and wedge bone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pin bone steak is tender, since it is closest to
the ultratender short loin, it also has a very high proportion of
bone to meat, as does the flat bone. So the best choice among these
four bone-in sirloins is the round bone. It is relatively tender,
has excellent flavor and a good proportion of meat to bone. It can
also run three pounds or more when cut an inch thick, offering a
primal, Flintstone-style steak experience.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, the most widespread method of cutting the sirloin
is with the grain, producing boneless steaks. These are labeled
according to the particular muscle they come from.
</P>
<P>
   The best options come from the top sirloin muscle. These may be
called top sirloin or top butt steaks, hip sirloin steaks, bifteck
sirloin steaks or center-cut sirloin steaks. Although they can be a
bit chewy, all are tender enough to treat as you would steaks from
the short loin: grill or broil them and serve them in all their
juicy glory.
</P>
<P>
   Steaks from the bottom sirloin, usually called bottom sirloin
butt or ball tip steaks, are considerably tougher. The best
approach with these tougher steaks is to treat them like London
broil: grill them fast over high heat and cut them very thin
against the grain.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a trendy little steak known as the tri-tip. This
boneless steak, fashioned from a small triangular muscle at the
bottom end of the bottom sirloin and the front of the rump, is also
known as the triangle or culotte steak. It has become the darling
of in-the-know carnivores, but in our experience it is somewhat
overrated. Tri-tips can be hard to find, but if you happen across
some, by all means buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever sirloin you choose, you will get the best flavor by
grilling it over a hot fire. For the large bone-in steaks, it's a
good idea to use a two-level fire so the steak can sear over high
heat and then finish cooking more slowly. Then get out the steak
knives and dig into the real thing.

</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus 1 tablespoon for figs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   \ cup roughly chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   { small red onion, peeled and finely diced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and cracked black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 2{- to 3-pound round-bone sirloin steak, about 1{ inches thick

<P>
   \ cup cracked coriander seeds (or 2 tablespoons ground
coriander)
</P>
<P>
   8 fresh figs, halved
</P>
<P>
   1. Build a two-level fire in your grill. Put about } of the
coals on one side to make a hot fire (you will be able to hold your
hand 5 inches above grill surface for only 1 to 2 seconds). Put
about \ on the other side to make a medium fire (you will be able
to hold your hand 5 inches above grill surface for only 3 to 4
seconds).

4 to 5 minutes. Turn and sear well on second side, another 4 to 5
minutes. Move to cooler part of fire and continue to cook until
done to your likeness, about 8 to 10 minutes for rare. To check for
doneness, cut \-inch into thickest part of meat and peek; it should
be slightly less done than you like it. Remove steak from grill,
cover loosely with foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. While steak is resting, rub fig halves with 1 tablespoon
olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and place on
grill around edge of coals. Grill until browned on all sides, about
3 minutes.

<P>
   3. Sprinkle steaks generously with salt and pepper and place on
grill. Sear well on one side, about 4 to 5 minutes; turn and sear
well on second side, another 4 to 5 minutes, then continue to cook

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Lycee Francais de New York, the prestigious
school that attracts Europeans and American Francophiles, is
selling all six of its buildings on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The school expects to sell the town houses to wealthy people who
want to restore them to single-family homes. And the school hopes
to make a big profit, more than $100 million, on the sale, enough
to create an endowment and build a new school.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered too costly for private use, town houses are
making a comeback as private residences in a new era of opulence
that has left investment bankers, Internet entrepreneurs and
investors flush with cash from the longest economic boom in
history. And with names like Vanderbilt, Gould, Pulitzer and McKim,
Mead &AMP; White embedded in the schools buildings, brokers expect a
rash of bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these properties are going to be bought by private
individuals, Wall Street money,'' said Jed Garfield, a broker at
Leslie J. Garfield &AMP; Co., which specializes in town house sales.
``There's no question that the dollars in private purchasers'
pockets today are deeper than those of the institutions. It's an
end of an era for some of these institutional buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months of this year, the average price for a
town house on the West Side climbed 34 percent to $2.9 million.
During the same period, houses on the Upper East Side sold for $4.4
million, or $814 a square foot, up 19 percent from a year ago,
according to the Corcoran Group, a residential broker specializing
in luxury properties. In contrast, the average price of a
condominium on the Upper East Side is $673 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is rare that six houses would come on the market at
once, real estate brokers said that the school's portfolio was not
expected to dampen prices, because there are so few buildings
available.
</P>
<P>
   In June, an investment banker who took early retirement from
Goldman Sachs paid $5 million for the town house at 25 E. 92nd St.,
between Fifth and Madison Avenues. The house had been divided into
five condominiums. The buyer plans to knock down the walls and make
a home for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Benny Shabtai, president of Raymond Weil-Seville
Watch Corp., paid $8.2 million for the town house at 870 Park Ave.,
between 77th and 78th Streets. The house has a three-story atrium,
fireplaces, a library and a spiral staircase leading to five
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Elsa Berry, who heads the board at Lycee Francais, said it was
hard to part with the school's six illustrious old buildings, which
sit in two clusters on the Upper East Side and serve 1,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the buoyant real estate market provided the
school with an opportunity to create an endowment and to build a
new and more efficient, if less historic, school building at a
single location. The school is negotiating to buy a site on either
the Upper East Side or the Upper West Side for a
115,000-square-foot school building, nearly double the current
space. According to one broker, the school is close to a deal for a
site in the East 80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to improve our operations from a technological
standpoint and add new facilities for sports, student lounges and a
cafeteria,'' said Berry, who attended the Lycee Francais as a girl
and now runs the corporate finance department for BNP Paribas, a
French investment bank. ``The board is working aggressively on a
long-term strategic plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycee Francais was founded in 1935 by Count Charles de Ferry de
Fontnouvelle, the French consul general at the time; Forsythe
Wicks, a businessman who was president of the Alliance Francaise;
and Paul Windels Sr., the city's corporation counsel. The school's
alumni include Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art; Michel David-Weil, managing partner of Lazard Freres
&AMP; Co., and Danielle Steel, the novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to be similar to a French lycee, the school emphasizes
a classical education, including Latin and Greek. Instruction is
primarily in French, although the school does provide an
understanding of American language and culture. Berry said that 40
percent of the school's students are the children of French
diplomats or business executives and 40 percent are American, with
48 other nationalities accounting for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The most valuable building owned by the lycee is the Henry T.
Sloane residence at 9 E. 72nd St., which is regarded by architects
as one of the finest Beaux-Arts town houses in the city. The
five-story structure, which has an intricately carved limestone
facade, Ionic columns and French windows, was built in 1896 by
Sloane, son of the founder of the W&AMP;J Sloane furniture store. But
he lived there only briefly before a scandalous divorce in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Pulitzer, the newspaper publisher, lived there before it
was bought in 1901 by James Stillman, president of the National
City Bank, then one of the most important commercial banks in the
world. Stillman worked closely with William Rockefeller, a founder
of Standard Oil, and Jacob Schiff and Edward Harriman in
reorganizing American railroads.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in the late 1920s, most tycoons abandoned such
luxurious town houses for more fashionable estates in the Long
Island and Westchester countryside or for duplexes on Park and
Fifth Avenues. Too costly to maintain, the buildings were
demolished or converted into apartments, stores or museums. Many of
the original details and fixtures were lost, although the Lycee's
buildings remain in relatively good shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Lycee is also selling the Oliver Gould Jennings mansion, a
Beaux-Arts house next door at 7 E. 72nd St., named after the man
who built it in 1899, who was a director of Bethlehem Steel and the
National Fuel Gas Co.
</P>
<P>
   The third property, at 60 East 93rd St., was built in 1931 for
Virginia Graham Fair Vanderbilt, a racehorse breeder and former
wife of William Vanderbilt, the railroad tycoon. Her father was
Senator James Fair of Nevada, who made a fortune from the Comstock
Lode and the Big Bonanza mine. The limestone building resembles a
French hotel during the reign of Louis XV.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth site is a neo-Classical-style limestone building with
a mansard roof at 3 E. 95th St. It was commissioned by Marion B.
Carhart, after the death of her husband, Amory Carhart, a banking
and railroad executive. She died shortly after its completion, in
1917. The school is also selling the adjoining three-story building
at 5 E. 95th St. and a limestone building at 12 E. 73rd St. that
was built in 1920 by Henry Allan Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, one former student and some brokers lamented, the
school may well lose some of the cachet of old New York as it moves
to a modern home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a sense of history going to school in mansions,''
Garfield said. ``But I'm sure the new building will be more
efficient.''

IT'S THE LADIES' SHOW: WOMEN PRODUCERS IN CHARGE AT `LATE SHOW WITH
DAVID LETTERMAN'  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 AARON BARNHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   David Letterman's brush with
mortality this year showed us a side of him we'd never seen. Now
one of TV's most familiar faces is revealing another new wrinkle:
For the first time in 20 years he has a female sidekick.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maria Pope, unlike the other women who appear on camera with
Letterman, is not a giggly actress or supermodel. Nor is she a
high-powered celebrity like Barbara Walters or Kathie Lee Gifford.
When Letterman and Pope banter during the show's ``Campaign 2000''
segment, it's like he's talking across the fence to a neighbor.
They have good-natured, entertaining rapport on the show, and it
has helped humanize Letterman.

<P>
   By coincidence, Pope and her colleague Barbara Gaines also were
promoted this year to executive producers on the ``Late Show.''
They are the first two women Letterman has put in charge since
1982, when he and his then-girlfriend Merrill Markoe created the
old ``Late Night'' show back at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the timing of Pope as sidekick couldn't have been better.
Since Letterman got a new lease on life after undergoing heart
bypass surgery last January, there's been a noticeable spring in
his step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem like there's been a resurgence and renewal, and
that certainly shows on the air,'' Pope said in a recent interview
at her office inside the Ed Sullivan Theater.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dave-and-Maria show goes on in front of the cameras,
Barbara Gaines watches from backstage and worries. Worrying is her
forte. Gaines has worked for Letterman 20 years, handling (as she
puts it) ``the stuff people don't write about,'' mundane details
that are crucial to a live TV show _ running the daily rehearsal,
handling staff issues, fixing broken elevators.
</P>
<P>
   In the man's world that was once late-night TV, women always
played essential roles. But now they are starting to assume key
positions that were held exclusively by men.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``Tonight Show,'' executive producer Debbie Vickers, a
University of Kansas graduate, helped Jay Leno turn around his
foundering ship in 1993. Now she runs late night's top-rated
program. Cynthia Garrett did so well as guest host on NBC's
``Later'' that she was tapped earlier this year to be the regular
host.
</P>
<P>
   At CBS, Letterman's company this year replaced the top producers
at ``Late Show'' and the ``Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn'' with
women. Kilborn's new executive producer is Mary Connelly, a former
``Mad About You'' show-runner who cut her teeth at NBC working for
Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   It's significant if you think of Letterman and Kilborn as
avatars of the ``frat boy'' lifestyle. That image seemed to be
reinforced a couple of years ago, when the people who issue tickets
to the ``Late Show'' began asking young men at local colleges to
bring their buddies along.
</P>
<P>
   Pope said the show isn't trying to exclude women but rather ``to
get a studio audience representative of our (home) audience, with
people _ male or female _ who know and love the show,'' she said.
``We don't want people who say, `Oh, we can't get tickets for
``Cats,'' let's go see the Letterman show.'/i ''
</P>
<P>
   And Gaines and Pope take issue with the idea that they were ever
associated with a ``guy show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a misconception,'' Gaines said. ``Madeleine
Smithberg (executive producer of `The Daily Show') came from here.
Jude Brennan (now at Oxygen) came from here. Mary came from here.
They say this was a boys' club, but all these women came from
here.''  &LR; brk:Early days Few women or men have spent as much time
with Letterman, or know him so well, as Barbara Gaines. They met at
NBC in May 1980. Letterman was scheduled to begin his live morning
show in three weeks. Gaines, then a 22-year-old Long Island native,
had heard from a friend that there was an opening for a
receptionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a big TV watcher,'' Gaines recalled. ``They said it
was the guy who always hosts for Carson. And then the associate
producer said, `Can you type?'/i''
</P>
<P>
   She typed Letterman's jokes and other scripted matter into a
prompting device, the kind used by news anchors. But after two
weeks on the air, Letterman ditched the prompter and went to cue
cards. Dejected, Gaines went back to reception duty. Then a
production assistant quit, and Gaines applied for and got the job.
</P>
<P>
   One of the duties of a production assistant is to make sure all
the blue note cards are placed on Letterman's desk. Another is to
make sure the host's coffee mug is filled. To this day, Gaines
still performs both tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The morning show died after four months. In early 1982 NBC gave
Letterman what he really wanted: a late night venue where he could
carry on for the amusement of college kids, not housewives.
</P>
<P>
   Pope joined the show that year and worked her way up through the
creative ranks, writing jokes and handling guest talent.
Ironically, though, it was Gaines who first had a role on camera.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime fans of the NBC show will remember her as the backstage
screamer. It all started one night when Letterman was rummaging
around his desk for a certain blue note card. Before the show,
Gaines had placed the card practically in front of his nose. Now he
couldn't find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started saying, `Where's the thing? Where's the thing?' and
finally I yelled, `It's on the left!''' Gaines recalled. ``If I
wrote down that the movie opens on the 19th, he'd say, `When does
the movie open?'/i''
</P>
<P>
   Screaming Barbara soon became a staple on the show. Finally a
viewer wrote in asking Letterman, ``Is this the humiliation it
takes to work on the show?'' He read the letter on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very shy in real life, but I'm different with Dave,''
Gaines said.
</P>
<P>
   When Letterman signed on at CBS _ it was seven years ago tonight
_ he had trouble finding his way from the 11th-floor office suite
to the stage. So he had Gaines escort him to and from rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, at one of the ritual publicity photo shoots
loathed by Letterman, writer Bill Zehme saw Gaines trying to coax a
smile out of her boss by chanting, ``Happy Dave! Happy Dave!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she said she was always nauseated at the thought of carrying
on with him on TV. It amazes her to watch ``Campaign 2000'' and see
Pope so at ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely envy her,'' Gaines said. ``I would not be able to
do my job and do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Pope said, she sometimes doesn't even think about
``Campaign 2000'' until a few minutes before the taping. Her day is
tied up managing the more show-bizzy aspects of ``Late Show,'' and
besides, Letterman has made it clear he wants their banter to sound
as unrehearsed as possible. Most nights they just go out and do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would never want to know what I wanted to talk about,''
Pope said. ``If I said to him before the show that this thing
happened to me with a cabdriver, he'd say, `Oh, really?' and then
he'd say, `Never mind! Never mind! Save it for the show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Both these women work long hours and always have, although there
was more time to goof off at NBC. The network had them on a lighter
schedule, doing about 160 shows a year. At CBS, they crank out more
than 200 shows a year, including two tapings every Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Gaines worries about the show on weekends, something
she said she never did before. And when Letterman needs something
during the show, instead of running it out to him, Gaines hands the
item to Pat Farmer, a production assistant who appears routinely in
the show's comedy bits. She still sets down the blue note cards and
Dave's coffee cup on his desk, but those are reminders of a more
carefree time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a decision to become more professional,'' she added, a
bit wistfully. ``And the more professional you are, the less fun I
guess you have.''

PHILIPPINES REBELS SAY THEY HAVE KIDNAPPED AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Muslim rebels who thrive on kidnapping
seized an American on a remote Philippine island Tuesday and
threatened to kill him if the United States does not meet
unspecified demands.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels, who have been holding a group of
Europeans, South Africans and Asians for four months, said in a
radio broadcast that ``we have been trying very hard to get an
American.''
</P>
<P>
   They identified him as Jeffrey Craig Schilling, 24, asserted he
was an agent for the CIA and said, ``We will not hesitate to
execute this American guy if the Philippine government and the
United States will not listen to our demands.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they would announce their demands within three days.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the group executed two Filipino hostages when
one of their demands went unfulfilled. They wanted Washington to
release several Arab terrorists imprisoned in the United States
after the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine government confirmed the abduction, saying that
an envoy had seen Schilling being held in an Abu Sayyaf camp. The
U.S. embassy in Manila said it was sending six officials to
Zamboanga, the nearest city, where Schilling had been living for
several months with his fiancee, a Philippine citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction is the latest twist in a kidnapping spree that
started on April 23 when Abu Sayyaf gunmen abducted 21 mostly
Western hostages from a diving resort on a nearby Malaysian island.
Since then, several hostages have been freed and several more have
been seized. Before Schilling's abduction, the gunmen were holding
six Westerners and a dozen Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Six other Westerners were freed on Sunday and Monday in exchange
for reported payments of $1 million each. Libya acted as go-between
in these releases, raising the possibility that the United States
might find itself turning to Libya for help in freeing Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   A Libyan official said Tuesday his nation would be happy to help
if asked.
</P>
<P>
   In the radio interview, the Abu Sayyaf spokesman, Abu Sabaya,
suggested that the ransom for an American should be 10 times as
much as for a European.
</P>
<P>
   If they decide to kill Schilling, he said, ``Then next week we
will get another hostage and do the same thing to him. The
Americans may think we are afraid of them, but we are really
determined to get an American.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its negotiations for the Western hostages, the Philippine
government has relied on intermediaries from Libya, which for years
has had close relations with Muslim separatist fighters in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have suggested that Libya's mediating role _
including a total ransom payment that has been estimated to be as
high as $25 million in ``development aid'' _ is an attempt to
burnish its international image.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others have blamed the Libyan leader,
Moammar Gadhafi, for a number of terrorist acts around the world.
Two Libyans are now on trial in the bombing in 1988 of a Pan Am
jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 277 people.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time Schilling was being kidnapped, the six
recently freed hostages were arriving to a festive welcome in the
Libyan capital, Tripoli, after being flown there on a Libyan
airliner. The freed hostages, from France, Germany, South Africa
and Lebanon, were to be sent home later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget the name that delivered you from the humiliation
of captivity; that name is Moammar Gadhafi,'' a Libyan official
said in a televised speech at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   A Libyan foreign ministry official, speaking on Qatar's
satellite television station, said his nation would try to help win
Schilling's release if asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to carry out a role to save the life of a human
being, whether he is an American or European, we will not hesitate
to help,'' said the official, Hassounah el-Shawish.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines on Tuesday, immigration authorities provided
a copy of Schilling's passport to reporters. It said he was born in
Minnesota on Feb. 4, 1976 and had entered the Philippines on March
8, extending his visitor's visa twice.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf, which is a small splinter group from a long-running
Muslim separatist insurgency in the southern Philippines, has
focused more on the business of kidnapping than on ideological
warfare. Kidnapping is so common in the area that it has been
somewhat formalized, with the going rate for ransoms at about
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the kidnappings of the Western vacationers in April, the
island of Jolo became flooded with unheard-of amounts of money. Two
of the bandits were arrested last week when they went to a small
local bank and tried to change $240,000 into Philippine pesos.
</P>
<P>
   However, Abu Sayyaf, small as it is, is broken into several
factions. Philippine officials say that the gunmen's squabbles over
tactics and over the division of ransom money have complicated
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials have also complicated negotiations on some
occasions with contradictory or threatening public statements. The
belligerence of some of the statements contrasts with the
helplessness of the government in dealing with kidnappers who have
in the past tortured and executed their hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the spokesman for President Joseph Estrada said the
kidnappers had only made matters worse for themselves by seizing an
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to galvanize international action against
them,'' said the spokesman, Ricardo Puno. ``The world will unite in
the realization of what a big problem the Abu Sayyaf poses.''

GRAY MATTERS:OLDER AMERICANS ARE CARVING OUT A SPACE OF THEIR OWN
 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 LISA GUTIERREZ  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   HUTCHINSON, Kan. _ Strapped in and
spread-eagle on a giant gyroscope called a three-axis trainer, Ann
Schaefer looked like she'd rather be walking across hot coals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the contraption slowly flipped and twisted her upside-down
like ribs on a barbecue spit, she yelled out: ``Wait! Stop!'' But
the gyroscope kept gyrating.
</P>
<P>
   Launching that mock satellite on that mock moon had been so much
easier, she thought.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 32 other students in the Elderhostel Astronaut Training
Program, all with at least 60 years logged on Earth, Schaefer spent
last week at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center here testing
her reflexes, depth perception and ability to climb into the tight
confines of both a spacesuit and a space capsule.
</P>
<P>
   These aging astronauts-in-training represent what demographers
call the changing face of maturity, a healthier, wealthier and
wiser generation than those that went before. They are also role
models for baby boomers who are themselves inching their way closer
to AARP membership.
</P>
<P>
   Older Americans 60-plus are the ``younger-older'' who sniff at
labels like senior citizen and who marketers suddenly realize
control nearly 90 percent of the financial assets in this country
and whose faces we're seeing more of in everything from L.L. Bean
catalogs to Old Navy commercials hawking cargo pants.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees? Think again. Two years ago AARP officially changed its
name to simply AARP _ it's not an acronym anymore _ to reflect that
at least one-third of the 34 million people older than 50 it
represents are not retired.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her fellow classmates _ homemakers, teachers, pilots,
travel agents _ who have toured Southern mansions and studied
native plants on the plains of South Dakota through other
elderhostel programs, this was Ann Schaefer's first such
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like stepping into an invisible world, a world I never
knew existed,'' said the 61-year-old, an outreach teacher at the
St. Louis Science Center. ``I come here, and there are women 20
years older, and they have so much energy. So I know that old folks
aren't fuddy-duddies.''
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye to that image.
</P>
<P>
   While baby boomers fight over the White House, 70-year-old Clint
Eastwood and his Ensure-swilling ``Space Cowboys'' are saving the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so thrilled to see that movie get top box office,'' said
Allison Patterson in Silver Spring, Md., editor of ``Selling to
Seniors'' newsletter, an industry publication for companies that
market to consumers 65 and older. ``It reflects our demographics,
that the age of our population is getting older.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a comedy that didn't laugh at older people, it laughed
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago AARP redesigned its Modern Maturity
magazine to look, for lack of a better description, more sprightly,
said AARP spokesman Tom Otwell in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Newman and Sophia Loren have both graced the cover since
then, but the list of possible candidates lengthens every day. This
is what 60 looks like today: Ted Koppel, Raquel Welch, Smokey
Robinson, Ringo Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Andrews, Phil Donahue and Woody Allen all turn 65 this
year. Gene Hackman, George Steinbrenner, Joanne Woodward and Sandra
Day O'Connor are five years older.
</P>
<P>
   Do any of those people strike you as geezers? Marketers and
demographers struggle to create new labels for a graying population
that is living longer, working longer and playing harder.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers used to call anyone over the age of 50 a senior, but
that doesn't work anymore, Patterson said. Thus you get labels like
``primers'' and descriptions of people entering the ``third age''
of their lives. Or how about a governmental term: ``nearly
elderly''?
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that Madison Avenue advertising companies, still
fueled by a 20- and 30-something mentality, move at glacier-speed
to change the way they portray older Americans, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, for instance, a television commercial for an
Internet search engine portrayed its competitors as slovenly,
feeble-minded old men shuffling around in bedroom slippers. The
National Council on Aging fired off a letter of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think baby boomers have been afraid of these negative images
of older people, and they want to change that because they see what
it has done to people, to their parents, to our parents,'' said
Burton Halpert, a social gerontologist in the Center for Aging
Studies at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Images of old men in bedroom slippers don't even begin to fit
teachers Bud Johnson and Ron Maxson, friends from Canandaigua,
N.Y., who came to the space-camp elderhostel.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who flew single-engine planes in the Civil Air Patrol,
had applied in 1980 to be NASA's first teacher in space, something
he has mixed emotions about today, considering the eventual
disaster of that mission.
</P>
<P>
   The two friends went through all the training stations together,
including strapping themselves inside a monster of a centrifuge
machine that spun them around like a carnival ride, locking their
bodies into their seats by pressure five times their body weights.
</P>
<P>
   Maxson almost set a record on the stress test in which students
sat inside what one woman called the ``dishwasher'' and punched at
red lights that flashed quickly on a control panel in front of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around at their classmates, Maxson, 61, noted how much
more healthier and wealthier this generation is than just the one
before. ``You're not told when you turn 55, `Don't get up and
walk.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With at least one baby boomer turning 50 every seven seconds in
this country, age has suddenly, but maybe not surprisingly, become
relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that this huge bulge of boomers is entering this age
group, like everything else they have touched, (is) going to have
some impact on how we perceive aging in this country,'' said AARP
spokesman Otwell. ``I think they will start to redefine what it
means to grow old or be old in America.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they turn that corner at 50, AARP has a new magazine
waiting for them. The group next spring will launch an offshoot of
Modern Maturity magazine designed specifically for aging boomers.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have a name yet. But you can bet it won't be Modern
Geezers.

   A CRIMINAL PAST
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years back, I was convicted of assault _ a felony. I
was in college and had been drinking. I've since moved on to the
professional world and, to secure my last two corporate jobs, I had
to lie on my application regarding my criminal history. I hate the
daily anxiety of being discovered but believe I had no recourse.
What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous
</P>
<P>
   A: You should think about fessing up. Your crime is an old one
and is unrelated to your current job, where you've had a chance to
show your merit. Many people are forgiving of youthful wrongdoing,
particularly if you appeal to them forthrightly. It is more
honorable (and less uncomfortable) to volunteer your history than
to wait fearfully for your boss to discover it. And by doing so,
you can present your story in the most favorable light. What you
should not have done was lie on a job application. While an
employer may not probe every aspect of your life _ your religious
views, your sexual habits _ he or she may legitimately ask certain
questions, and you must answer honestly. That there may be a price
for your candor does not lessen this obligation. You may have more
recourse than you realize. You can apply for a ``Relief from Civil
Disabilities'' certificate, notes Deborah A. Scalise, an assistant
attorney general in New York state who frequently lectures on legal
ethics. ``While a felony conviction can never be expunged from the
record,'' says Scalise, ``the certificate prevents an outright
forfeiture of a position.'' Your boss would not be able simply to
fire you upon learning about your conviction. Instead, you'd have
the right to argue in a hearing that your youthful misdeed does not
diminish your ability to do your job. Of course, the boss still
gets the final word on your continued employment, but at least you
get a measure of due process. To obtain the certificate, you have
to persuade a judge that you have not been convicted of a felony
more than once and that you have been rehabilitated. Such laws
differ from state to state, so you should talk to a lawyer to see
how you can come clean without putting yourself in more peril.
While your situation is grave, it is not apt to be fatal: You are
not Jean Valjean, and your boss is not Javert.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I bought a $70 sweat shirt on sale for $30. It was very
fashionable, and one of the most comfortable articles of clothing I
wore. I lent it to a friend of mine, and the next day she claimed
it disappeared. How much money should I ask her for, $30 or $70?
</P>
<P>
   _ M. Pavlovsky, Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm a replacement-cost kind of guy myself. But I add this
qualification: If your friend wants to replace the actual sweat
shirt, she's free to get one however inexpensively she can. If you
intend to replace it, she should give you enough money to do so.
But if you've had your fun with it and do not intend to replace it,
then she should give you only the $30 you were out of pocket. Any
of these approaches will restore you to your original preloss
state. I can't help asking, though: $70?! For a sweat shirt?!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a sales rep for a fine-wine distributor. One local wine
shop requires his distributor reps to work in his store. Customers
who ask for suggestions are usually helped by a rep who often
recommends a wine he distributes. Isn't this a conflict of
interest?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, Minneapolis
</P>
<P>
   A: I quite agree. If the customers assume they're receiving
unbiased advice, they're being deceived. Perhaps that explains how,
a few years ago, I ended up serving my guests poached salmon
accompanied by a chilled glass of maple syrup. (But I really should
have been put on my guard by the Log Cabin logo on the salesclerk's
shirt.)

WIFE OF AMERICAN HELD BY RUSSIANS FOR ESPIONAGE FEARS FOR HIS
HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The wife of a an American who has been in jail here for
five months on espionage charges came here Tuesday with her
congressman to call on the Russian government to allow Western
doctors to examine her 54-year-old husband, who has bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cheri Pope looked shaken and fatigued after visiting Moscow's
Lefortovo Prison on Tuesday, where her husband, Edmond, a former
naval intelligence officer, has been incarcerated since early
April. He was arrested for supposedly trying to buy classified
plans for a high-technology Russian torpedo system.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian press reports have identified the torpedo
propulsion system, known as the Squall, as the same one carried
aboard the nuclear submarine Kursk, which sank in the Barents Sea
on Aug. 12, killing all 118 crewmen aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing my husband and having to leave him there was extremely
difficult,'' Mrs. Pope said at a news conference, dressed in a gray
suit and speaking in subdued and emotional tones. ``And now I have
to go back to my room and call his mother and father and our sons
and tell them that Ed is not doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John E. Petersen, R-Pa., who accompanied her, was more
blunt. ``If his cancer has returned and we do not catch it soon,
Edmond Pope will die.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say Edmond Pope has been examined 10 times
since April and is not facing any imminent health threat.
``Allegations about the deteriorating mental and physical condition
of the U.S. citizen spread by U.S. representatives are
groundless,'' the Federal Security Service said on Friday. Last
week, a Russian court denied Pope's request to be released to
receive medical treatment while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. embassy officials have been allowed to visit Pope 11 times,
and Tuesday's visit was Mrs. Pope's second. She said her husband is
being kept in a cell with five Russian prisoners, who all share a
sink and toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson castigated Russian authorities for arresting Pope over
the attempted purchase of ``10-year-old'' torpedo technology that
the Russian government openly sells to foreign governments, most
recently to Canada, he asserted. He asked that all details of the
charges against Pope be made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in America knows that Ed Pope is not a spy,''
Peterson said, ``He is an independent businessman who has been
working with the Russians for five to six years'' to develop and
sell high-technology products. He warned that Pope's incarceration
spelled ``a very bad day for the future of American-Russian
business relations.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials in Washington have said that
President Clinton raised the plight of Pope in a telephone call to
President Vladimir Putin during the frantic rescue operation for
the Kursk. Tuesday, Peterson said that Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright have been raising the issue of Pope's
``unfair imprisonment'' and asking that his case be resolved ``each
time they meet with a Russian official.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Russia's intelligence service, reached by
telephone, said the agency would not comment Tuesday on the charges
against Pope. Nor would a spokesman say when a trial might take
place.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russian press accounts, quoting intelligence officials here, say
that Pope was arrested as he was handing over $30,000 to a
professor from Bauman State Technical University, Anatoly Babkin,
in order to purchase the plans for the high-speed Russian torpedo
system known. Babkin is a specialist in torpedo development and
design.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some reports said that Babkin, 70, was subsequently released
because of his advanced age and a heart condition, raising the
question of how seriously Russia's security services are taking his
offense, normally treated as an act of treason.
</P>
<P>
   The Squall torpedo, according to a report from the Russian
institute that designed it, was developed over two decades as a
``versatile'' design that could be fitted with various warheads and
rocket motors depending on its mission. Its versatility included
configurations for underwater attacks, or for firing over the
horizon at surface ships or distant submarine targets.
</P>
<P>
   Its most remarkable feature is its speed, more than 220 miles an
hour in its own gas bubble, making it the fastest torpedo in the
world, according to an article by Valery Kulbitsky, chief designer
of the Russian Research Institute of Marine Technology.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy navy officials have reportedly shown a great deal of
interest in the Squall system, and two U.S. submarines, one of them
the Memphis, were monitoring the military exercises during which
Kursk was slated to fire a variety of weapons. Two senior Russian
officials connected with the investigation into the Kursk sinking
have asserted that Kursk was carrying an experimental torpedo and
that an accident involving the weapon or its engine could have
contributed to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   A source at the Russian navy headquarters told the news agency
Interfax on Tuesday that navy officials have not ruled out a
torpedo explosion as a cause of the Kursk's sinking, along with
some collision that triggered the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Tuesday that
``There were no new torpedoes on the submarine.'' He said Kursk,
during the military exercises, had launched a type of torpedo that
had been used for 20 years, but he added that some new features had
been added to the torpedo, which he identified as ``a new
accumulator unit with a large resource.''

 UNDATED: same thing.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wireless phone industry, meanwhile, operates under its own
system. A wireless subscriber who dials 411 is generally connected
to a directory assistance operator affiliated with his wireless
carrier. Those operators generally use a national database.
</P>
<P>
   But no one disputes that the quality of directory assistance
service varies from provider to provider.
</P>
<P>
   The listings themselves are generally compiled and controlled by
the roughly 1,300 individual local phone companies around the
country. Big carriers like AT&AMP;T and Verizon contract with outside
companies to pull together phone listings from the multitude of
local phone databases around the nation. To save money, other,
smaller companies may sometimes try to compile listings by scanning
phone books, property records or other sources that are less likely
to be up to date and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, big phone companies say that directory assistance
listings are about 95 percent accurate. But if there are, as is
estimated, 3 billion directory assistance calls in a year (the
actual figure may be higher), that adds up to 150 million wrong
numbers annually.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Louis S. Richman is restive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a really annoying aggravation that when you call
for the headquarters number for a major corporation that you get
some branch office delivery dock,'' said Richman, finance editor of
Consumer Reports magazine, in New York. ``Or you call for a major
hospital in a major city and they never heard of it, or a
restaurant that you knew was there a week ago but they can no
longer find it or you get a fax number.''
</P>
<P>
   It may help if callers understand that there are gazetteering
limitations with today's patchwork directory assistance. And the
limitations begin with four words: United States Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone listings are almost always governed by the post office
address of the residence or business listed. Take Brighton, the
town in upstate New York supervised by Frankel. A letter to her
town must be addressed to Rochester; the Postal Service does not
recognize Brighton as an official mailing location. Given this, and
the fact that there is another community in New York known as
Brighton, near Buffalo, it is understandable that a directory
assistance operator in Omaha, Neb., or elsewhere may become a bit
confused.
</P>
<P>
   But the Postal Service rationale carries little weight with
Frankel. ``I would think that the telephone directory services are
something that should be upgraded,'' she said. ``The technology is
there to do it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It may depend on which company is wielding the technology.
Although the main local phone company for most of New York state is
Verizon, the local phone company for the Brighton that is near
Rochester, and for Rochester itself, is Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In an unscientific test conducted from phones in Manhattan,
directory assistance operators for AT&AMP;T and Verizon were routinely
able to find numbers in Brighton for the Twelve Corners Apothecary,
the Bagel Bin Cafe and Frankel's two home numbers. In most cases,
though, the operator would note that the listing was in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   And in a second unscientific test, directory assistance calls
placed from Rochester and within Brighton, also succeeded without
exception in finding those same numbers. The volunteer tester,
Jennifer Leonard, president of the Rochester Area Community
Foundation, a charitable group, called various directory assistance
services to obtain the listings for the apothecary and Frankel's
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who lives in Brighton, called a Frontier operator from
her office in Rochester, a Frontier operator from a pay phone in
Brighton, an operator affiliated with her local phone company, Time
Warner Communications, and a Verizon operator from her wireless
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the operators were located in Rochester and all of them
had both numbers and had no problem with the location of Brighton,
N.Y.,'' Leonard reported.
</P>
<P>
   Whether directory assistance in Brighton is as truly bad as
Frankel has found it, or as reasonably good as this informal test
might indicate, it is certain that there are many more paths than
there used to be to that tantalizingly helpful operator's greeting,
``What listing?''
</P>
<P>
   With all the variables, it may be that the best hope for a
caller _ besides keeping those keypad fingers crossed _ is to be
very, very precise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases you can find the one you're looking for,'' said
Agerton at BellSouth, which handles more than 500 million directory
assistance calls a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what happens a lot of the time,'' Agerton said, ``is
someone calls and says, `I want Bill Smith in Roanoke, Va.' And so
you pull it up and there's Bill Smith, so you put them through. But
then they call back and in fact they wanted William T. Smith on
Lovers' Lane.''

AFRO'S OK _ ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN STILL GROW ONE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Afros are back. I realize that styles are cyclical. I've seen
the camouflage pants that the kids are wearing now. I've noticed
the colorful shirts reminiscent of the '70s disco days. Even the
cars are going retro. No, I'm not blind to the cultural continuum.
</P>
<P>
   However, some fashions hibernate for so long that you forget
about them. They're like vogue training wheels. They're cute for a
while but once they're gone, you really don't think that they'll
come back en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as an African-American I understand the cultural and
historical perspective of Afros. The natural state of my hair is
curly. I'm just a perm away from an Afro myself.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, a group of women have banded together and formed an
organization called The Nappy Hair Affair. The members all wear
natural hairstyles like Afros, braids, and dreadlocks that don't
require chemicals and curling irons to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   I'm all for that. If my head had a less oblong shape, I'd shave
this mop off and do a Jordan myself.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not referring to those folks when I talk about this new
trend. I'm talking about these teen-age boys like my son, T-Bone.
That's what he calls himself now. He's USDA prime, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the problem is that this child's Afro is expensive! When
he was young and we kept his hair cropped, most mornings he brushed
his hair and we left home. Many days, he didn't brush his hair
because he didn't care and I didn't notice until we were at our
destination. All we needed to maintain his former dome was shampoo.
A bottle lasted six months.
</P>
<P>
   Honey, those days are over.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has three kinds of shampoo. He has conditioner. He has
oil sheen, picks, brushes, big combs and a few other bottles of
stuff that I swear were in my bathroom at one time. After football
practice the other day, I thought I'd surprise the boys and stop at
the ice cream parlor. My youngest son and I hopped out of the car
as soon as it rolled to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   T- Bone looked at me in dismay and said, ``What about my hair?''
</P>
<P>
   Who is this child? Six months ago he didn't know he had hair. I
constantly had to remind him to give it a little attention.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he wouldn't go out in public because his natural looked
like the inside of a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   I looked through the window of Braum's and told him, ``Son,
there is no one in there under 30.''
</P>
<P>
   He still looked skeptical but he got out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   My youngest son tried to grow his hair out too but all of that
washing and picking was just too much for him. I came home one day
to find him pouting and sheared like a lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad cut my hair off!'' he said, pointing to the trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the trash can was a mass of dark, dirty locks that looked
liked a bird's nest. My son looked to me for sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is the last time that you washed your hair?'' I asked,
pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped his head and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   That night at dinner, he was still perturbed. He stared at his
father's shaved head a while and said, ``Dad, you can't grow an
Afro can you?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband smiled and said, ``Not now, but I used to have a huge
'fro. Sometimes my sister would braid it into cornrows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a picture of your braids?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband thought a moment and said, ``No, I don't think I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   My son said: ``That's too bad. You should have taken a picture.
You'll never have that chance again.''
</P>
<P>
   The room got real quiet. My meat was gone so I started slicing
my beans so I wouldn't have to look at anyone. Finally, my husband
started laughing and we all laughed until we had tears in our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Kids, you gotta love 'em.

WOULD-BE LAME VIDEO GAMES ARE ACTUALLY COOL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, a roundup of video games that ``should'' be lame, but
for whatever reason are kinda cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecco the Dolphin _ Defender of the Future'' (Sega for
Dreamcast): Funny how the video-game world works. Heroes like
Superman and James Bond have to fly around, shoot people, make it
with the ladies, and have X-ray vision and big weapons to save the
Earth. Ecco the Dolphin can do it with his, um, fins.
</P>
<P>
   For this game, players take on the role of Ecco, a friendly
Flipper that must complete a series of tasks in order to save
dolphins _ and, apparently, mankind _ from extinction. To do this,
players must fend off evil fish (hey, where's Jaws?) and other
deep-sea dangers, which, for some reason, do not include pollution
and drunken teen-agers out for a Saturday boat ride.
</P>
<P>
   Really, it's a fascinating game, with wonderfully designed
graphics and lighting effects. The sunsets are as beautiful as
anything you'd see if you stepped outside tonight around 8:30, and
the underwater scenes look like they were swiped from ``National
Geographic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega must have spent some time checking out the fish at local
aquariums, because the ones here, as the game box touts, react and
move about like real fish _ a nice touch to an already impressive
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seaman'' (Sega for Dreamcast, ages 13 and up): OK, I'm gonna
try to explain this without confusing you. Or me. This is a title
to be used with Sega's Visual Memory Unit and Dreamcast Internet
Web site. If you don't have _ or want _ either one of those
add-ons, don't even mess with this.
</P>
<P>
   If you do, this could be a bit fun. Players basically raise an
aquarium fish, which, using a special microphone that comes with
the game and Sega's Web site, you can control, command and even
groom. It's like an interactive Chia Pet.
</P>
<P>
   But it does have a mind of its own; the fish often smarts off
and makes mildly suggestive comments, which will undoubtedly irk
parents. After a while, saying ``turn left,'' ``go right,'' and
watching the fish turn left and go right, gets a little old, so
there's not much of a repeat-play factor. If only it would go eat
Ecco, that would be cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones Bedrock Bowling'' (WB for PlayStation, all
ages): This is like a music CD that goes straight to the cut-out
bin or a movie that goes straight to video, it's so seemingly lame.
Catch it somewhere for $20, though, and it's not a bad time-killer.
</P>
<P>
   The game premise is self-explanatory: Pick your fave 'stoner and
hit the lanes. It's easy, brainless fun and kinda like listening to
Celine Dion _ you're embarrassed to, but you do anyway.

the colorful shirts reminiscent of the '70s disco days. Even the
cars are going retro. No, I'm not blind to the cultural continuum.
</P>
<P>
   However, some fashions hibernate for so long that you forget
about them. They're like vogue training wheels. They're cute for a
while but once they're gone, you really don't think that they'll
come back en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as an African-American I understand the cultural and
historical perspective of Afros. The natural state of my hair is
curly. I'm just a perm away from an Afro myself.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, a group of women have banded together and formed an
organization called The Nappy Hair Affair. The members all wear
natural hairstyles like Afros, braids, and dreadlocks that don't
require chemicals and curling irons to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   I'm all for that. If my head had a less oblong shape, I'd shave
this mop off and do a Jordan myself.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not referring to those folks when I talk about this new
trend. I'm talking about these teen-age boys like my son, T-Bone.
That's what he calls himself now. He's USDA prime, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the problem is that this child's Afro is expensive! When
he was young and we kept his hair cropped, most mornings he brushed
his hair and we left home. Many days, he didn't brush his hair
because he didn't care and I didn't notice until we were at our
destination. All we needed to maintain his former dome was shampoo.
A bottle lasted six months.
</P>
<P>
   Honey, those days are over.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has three kinds of shampoo. He has conditioner. He has
oil sheen, picks, brushes, big combs and a few other bottles of
stuff that I swear were in my bathroom at one time. After football
practice the other day, I thought I'd surprise the boys and stop at
the ice cream parlor. My youngest son and I hopped out of the car
as soon as it rolled to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   T- Bone looked at me in dismay and said, ``What about my hair?''
</P>
<P>
   Who is this child? Six months ago he didn't know he had hair. I
constantly had to remind him to give it a little attention.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he wouldn't go out in public because his natural looked
like the inside of a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   I looked through the window of Braum's and told him, ``Son,
there is no one in there under 30.''
</P>
<P>
   He still looked skeptical but he got out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   My youngest son tried to grow his hair out too but all of that
washing and picking was just too much for him. I came home one day
to find him pouting and sheared like a lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad cut my hair off!'' he said, pointing to the trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the trash can was a mass of dark, dirty locks that looked
liked a bird's nest. My son looked to me for sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is the last time that you washed your hair?'' I asked,
pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped his head and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   That night at dinner, he was still perturbed. He stared at his
father's shaved head a while and said, ``Dad, you can't grow an
Afro can you?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband smiled and said, ``Not now, but I used to have a huge
'fro. Sometimes my sister would braid it into cornrows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a picture of your braids?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband thought a moment and said, ``No, I don't think I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   My son said: ``That's too bad. You should have taken a picture.
You'll never have that chance again.''
</P>
<P>
   The room got real quiet. My meat was gone so I started slicing
my beans so I wouldn't have to look at anyone. Finally, my husband
started laughing and we all laughed until we had tears in our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Kids, you gotta love 'em.

ARTS CENTER, AIDED BY ALBANY, IS TO RISE ON WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki said Monday that the
state would help finance plans for a new performing arts and music
center on the site of the original Woodstock festival in Bethel,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki was to appear Tuesday with the developer, Alan Gerry, at
the festival site to unveil a proposal for the $40 million center,
to which the state would contribute $15 million. It would be the
first permanent structure built on the gently sloping hillside that
once served as Max Yasgur's alfalfa field and, more famously, as
the amphitheater for the Aug. 15-17, 1969 festival, a defining
moment for some Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry, 71, who built his television antenna business into one of
the largest cable television operations in the country, bought 37
acres of the Yasgur farm in 1997, and has since spoken of creating
a tourist attraction and shrine to the Sixties counterculture
there.
</P>
<P>
   He said the arts center would stage a variety of theater, dance
and music performances _ from classical to rock _ in a 4,000-seat
indoor theater that could be partly opened to accommodate another
15,000 spectators sitting on the back lawn. He said that ground
would be broken next spring and that the center would open in the
summer of 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's one of the few things that Sullivan County has to
offer that has brand recognition and is known worldwide,'' said
Gerry, a lifelong resident of the county who has created a
multimillion-dollar foundation to promote economic and cultural
development there. ``It's a natural franchise and no one can take
it away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The new arts center, which has not yet been named, is intended
to attract thousands of tourists and help revive the Catskills, a
struggling area whose fortunes have declined along with its grand
resort hotels. In recent years, county officials and residents have
tried to draw weekend visitors and other tourists by supporting
proposals for at least two Indian-run casinos and building a $4
million corporate office park for high-tech and start-up companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Monday, Pataki said he hoped the
Woodstock center would evolve into a cultural institution like the
Saratoga Performing Arts Center or Tanglewood in the Berkshire
Mountains of Massachusetts. The $15 million in state money, which
will come from discretionary funds controlled by Pataki and the
Legislature, will be used for the construction of the theater and
for road and land improvements. The state will not have any
ownership of the new project, but invested the money to spur the
sagging economy of the area, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a great facility for the Catskills,''
Pataki said. ``They have always been one of the tourism centers for
New York and they have lost that over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that as a 23-year-old law student, he had to stay
home to tend his parents' farm while his friends went to the
original Woodstock festival. Since then, he said, he has wanted to
attend a concert there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of makes up for that,'' he said. ``I wasn't at
Woodstock but I loved the music and it's going to be great to go up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry bought the 37 acres for roughly $1 million in 1997, and
later acquired more than 1,300 surrounding acres for an undisclosed
price. Gerry said the idea of preserving the site came from his
daughter, Robyn, who makes a pilgrimage there every summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry staged two festivals at the site in 1998 and 1999 by
building a temporary metal stage and importing lights and sewage
lines. More than 60,000 people went to the first concert, which
included performers like Joni Mitchell and Pete Townsend, and
35,000 more attended the following year to see Britney Spears and
other stars. They paid $19 to $65 for tickets, but Gerry said the
concerts lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Many Sullivan county officials and residents praised the planned
Woodstock center Monday. Harvey Smith, the acting county manager,
said it would bring a needed influx of customers for nearby hotels,
restaurants, and stores, and also contribute to an active arts
community that already stages classical music concerts and operas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Smith said, the county is used to coping with large
crowds because of its past as a resort area. ``As someone said to
me, ``Happiness is a traffic jam,'' Smith said. ``I think there's
enough infrastructure here for what's planned and I'm sure there
will be enhancements. We are absolutely looking forward to this
kind of economic activity. It's clean, and very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the hoped-for economic benefits, the Woodstock center
seeks to transform what was once a makeshift concert ground into a
place where people can bring their families, relive their memories,
or simply find out what the fuss was all about. Even today, many
people still walk through the meadows to a monument that
commemorates the 1969 Woodstock festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come from all over the world,'' Gerry said. ``This site
is on so many people's calendars that it's become a historic
site.''

APPLES, THE EUREKA MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By   MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I suppose you could call it an apple epiphany. I was trying a
recipe that called for apples, apple butter and apple cider because
it's that time of year: the early apples are turning up at roadside
stands and farmers' markets. Having grown bored with apples from
storage by the end of winter, I look at these with the pleasure
associated with the first strawberry of spring or the first peach
of summer.
</P>
<P>
   My epiphany came with the first bite of this apple-three-ways
dish of pork, mustard, onions and red wine. There is no cream, no
butter and only a modest amount of oil, but it tasted surprisingly
satisfying. It never occurred to me that something rich was
missing, because it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   For most cooks, it is easiest to reach for butter and cream, but
for certain dishes, those that become more interesting when subtle
flavoring is added, an apple is by far the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   This discovery made me feel even more kindly toward apples,
which otherwise offer modest nutritional value. They have small
amounts of vitamins A and C, selenium and potassium, and are a
reasonable source of fiber. At least for now. One day scientists
may learn that apples are a storehouse of micronutrients that make
them a worthy competitor of the cantaloupe. Think of what they now
know about ketchup and how its cooked tomatoes are loaded with
lycopene, a phytochemical that appears to reduce the risk of
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But neither ketchup nor cantaloupe provides the ingredients
often missing in dishes low in fat and calories: rich taste.
</P>
<P>
   The pork with three forms of apple had intensity, but also
subtlety because the sweetness was balanced by the wine and
mustard. It is included in Alison Becker Hurt's book, ``Kitchen
Suppers'' (Doubleday, 1999). For the most part, the recipes are not
from her well-known restaurants, Alison on Dominick in New York or
Alison by the Beach in Bridgehampton. They are ones she cooks at
home, and while the book hardly features low-fat or low-calorie
dishes, she never goes overboard on fat.
</P>
<P>
   The way apples add richness was confirmed by another dish I
tried, a squash soup thickened with potatoes and seasoned with
roasted carrots and onions, garlic and thyme. It has wonderful
earth tones, its richness coming from its complexity. The soup,
from ``Out of the Earth'' by Kerry Downey Romaniello (Spinner
Publications, 1999), is as satisfying as anything laced with cream.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking apples with the skin on provides more body in dishes
where richness and heartiness are the object. Apples are not
interchangeable. For the pork, I would choose tart-sweet apples,
like Macintosh, Gravenstein or even Granny Smith, types that hold
their shape and do not dissolve into sauce. Stay away from
Delicious. For the soup, any apple with a nice balance of sweet and
tart works well, like a Paula Red, a variety that has just started
appearing.
</P>
<P>
   Right now you can compare the flavor and texture of fresh
apples. There were 10 varieties where I shopped last week. But
fresh apples do not have a long season. Before you know it, your
apples will be from storage, which makes them mealy, fit only for
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Both the soup and the pork reflect the change in seasons, with
cooler nights when warm savory food seems just right.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT DRUM, N.Y. _ Staff Sgt. Andrew Laskoski is still waiting.
And infantry sergeants are not known for graceful patience.
</P>
<P>
   Laskoski is one of tens of thousands of American troops waiting
for the Army and Marine Corps to make good on their intention to
replace the frayed, patched and obsolete soldiering gear with a new
generation of modern, lightweight equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years ago Laskoski, then a platoon sergeant in the
10th Mountain Division, paused during combat maneuvers in the
jungle of Panama to explain how beat-up old stuff was hampering
operations. He'd heard that new lightweight gear _ including body
armor and combat harnesses _ was on its way.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Laskoski confirmed his worst suspicions.
``The regular grunts still aren't getting the new stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love this institution and I don't want to bad-mouth
it,'' said Laskoski, who is now an advanced infantry instructor at
the Army's Light Fighter School here. ``But there are some bad
things going on. Too much spending money on glitter. Not enough on
what (GI) Joe needs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most powerful military force on earth serving the richest
nation in history, many soldiers are using hand-me-down gear so
ancient it's actually on display at the National Infantry Museum at
Fort Benning, Ga., along with swords and suits of armor. Some
soldiers, despairing of ever getting the new gear, buy their own.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a simple issue of not enough money in the defense
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, experts say, it illustrates how the defense budget
already is so contorted by political pressures and irrational
fiscal burdens that it produces results that defy common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very basic issue of the culture of the Pentagon and the
influence of the military industrial complex, and don't forget
congressional pork-barreling,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
a senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Readiness is always the poor cousin, and people who are
endangering their lives out there aren't getting what they need,''
Grassley said. ``But readiness is always an excuse for spending
more money, and when we do, the people out there still don't get
what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress just appropriated $287.8 billion for the Pentagon to
spend in fiscal year 2001, which begins Oct. 1. There is $3.9
billion for 10 F-22 fighters, $2 billion for a new submarine, even
$5 million for armored limousines for the top brass to ride around
in.
</P>
<P>
   There is enough money to float the annual compensation for the
top executive and directors of Lockheed Martin, the nation's
largest defense contractor. Chairman and CEO Vance D. Coffman last
year took home $1.4 million; members of the board of directors were
each paid $60,000 cash and $60,000 worth of stock. Lockheed
apportions these costs to the Pentagon indirectly as contract
``overhead'' costs.
</P>
<P>
   But there is not enough money in the defense budget to purchase
new body armor for soldiers and Marines whose job it is to be where
people are shooting back.
</P>
<P>
   The new lightweight armored vests, unlike the current model,
will actually stop a 9mm round. The Army developed them several
years ago. They cost $500 each. It will take the Army seven years
to get a new one to each of its soldiers. Most soldiers on active
duty today will be gone from the Army before the new gear arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for new tactical vests. At present, most soldiers and
Marines wear a World War II-style web harness and belt from which
they hang canteens, ammo, first aid pouches and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Army developers came up with a new integrated system that
includes a thin lightweight harness, rucksack and water bladder
carried on the back. A trooper can sip water through a tube over
his shoulder without taking his eye off his target.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fight and still be drinking water, not hauling out
your canteen,'' Laskoski had said in Panama two years ago. ``It's
kind of a necessity, but we gotta buy our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Most troops still have to buy their own water bladder, called a
Camelbak on the civilian market.
</P>
<P>
   The Army will begin issuing the new gear, called MOLLE (for
Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment), sometime between
March and September of next year. Each unit costs about $400. It
will be 2008 before every soldier has one.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines started issuing MOLLE gear just over a year ago, at
a rate of 3,500 a month. It will take three years to outfit every
Marine, said Marine Capt. Skip Church, who directs the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had the money I would field them faster, there's no issue
there,'' Church said. ``We're spending every dime we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Sweeney, president of Specialty Defense Systems, which
makes the MOLLE gear, confirmed that his company could make more
MOLLE sets if the money were available.
</P>
<P>
   The same problem affects the issue of lightweight helmets, new
lightweight combat boots, tents and other essential gear.
</P>
<P>
   Lightweight, rugged tents arrived on the civilian outdoor market
two or three decades ago but are still not common in the military,
which relies on ponchos or the two-piece, button-up-the-middle pup
tent.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes not even these crude shelters are available. In a
combat exercise in the California desert last spring, Marines slept
huddled on the open ground in 40-degree, windy weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines have started issuing rugged new waterproof and
lightweight boots of the type available to civilians for a decade.
The Army soon will issue them to new recruits. All other soldiers
will have to buy their own, at about $90 a pair, with an annual
clothing allowance of $255.60 that is also supposed to replace
fatigues, dress uniforms, caps, rucksacks and other gear that wears
out.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   And the gear does wear out. Near the front gates of almost every
Marine Corps and Army post are military gear stores such as U.S.
Cavalry, where soldiers throng to replace their worn-out, broken or
lost issue gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell a lot of everything to soldiers,'' said Kirby Chaffee,
manager of the U.S. Cavalry store in Fayetteville, N.C., where Fort
Bragg and the 82nd Airborne Division are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camelbaks are the big sellers,' she added, referring to the
commercial version of the not-yet-issued water bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Watching troops shell out their own money for gear makes some
noncoms see red.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why _ except for politics _ they can spend
billions and billions of dollars and still not equip the people
they send out to the places they send us,'' said Sgt. Maj. Frank
Grippe of the 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th Mountain Division is one of the Army's busiest, with
recent lengthy deployments to Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. ``After
all we been through, there's no reason to accept any slack in
equipping the troops,'' Grippe said.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The military services themselves are part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the Army simply lost almost a billion dollars worth of
gear, according to a report by the General Accounting Office, the
investigations arm of Congress. It detailed $900 million the Army
couldn't account for after the equipment was shipped from one place
to another.
</P>
<P>
   One Pentagon financial investigator said it is increasingly
difficult to match invoices to payments. ``We found accounting so
bad, one guy was paying big checks to his mother and girlfriend, a
million dollars worth, and nothing had been bought or received at
all,'' said Ernest Fitzgerald, management systems deputy for the
Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald was astonished to be informed by a Pentagon
accountant that expenditures of under $100,000 are called ``budget
dust,'' not worth any detailed record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief about gear is that we buy the wrong stuff, we pay
too much for it, then we lose it,'' said Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that troops have no champion, no lobbyist in
Washington to watch out for their interests at budget time.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin, which makes the F-22 fighter among dozens of
other weapons systems, employs 26 lobbyists in Washington and has a
stable of 28 private lobbying firms to guide its programs safely
through Congress. Its lobbying operations cost $5.9 million in
1998, according to the most recent data published by the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In this election cycle, Lockheed Martin has donated $734,000 to
candidates for Congress, according to FEC data. The contributions
are skewed heavily toward powerful legislators who sit on defense
budget committees: $9,000 to Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., of the House
Appropriations Committee, for example, and $6,000 to Sen. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine., of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors such as Specialty Defense Systems have no Washington
lobbyists, Sweeney acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Small budget items such as soldier gear escape the attention of
more senior government budget managers, partly because most budget
documents don't show line items for body armor, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``In five years at OMB (the White House Office of Management and
Budget) I never got down to that level,'' said Gordon Adams, who
was a senior defense budget analyst at OMB during much of the
Clinton administration. He now teaches at George Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, few legislators have the time or knowledge, or
the inclination, to examine budget requests for boots, say, and to
add a few million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal of deference to the Pentagon on this
issue, and it's all very complicated and you have to really study
to be on top of it,'' said Grassley. ``I kind of feel like a lone
wolf out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Without lobbyists or bureaucrats to guide their programs through
the budget maze, program managers like Marine Capt. Church can only
watch helplessly as their cherished programs for grunts fall victim
to budget politics.
</P>
<P>
   Budget requests from the Army and Marines for boots, MOLLE gear,
body armor and other routine gear go to Congress as part of the
Pentagon's annual request for Operations and Maintenance funds.
This includes ``need-to-have'' money for fuel, tires, ammunition,
food and other things the military cannot do without.
</P>
<P>
   That gives Congress some powerful leverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll cut that stuff out of the O&AMP;M budget and put it in an
emergency spending bill,'' said Dan Koslofsky, a budget analyst
with the Council for a Livable World, a liberal interest group that
supports military readiness. ``Then they'll load up the emergency
spending bill with pork projects, and some of the routine stuff
gets cut to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has to be accepted because it contains critical funding.
</P>
<P>
   This year Congress added $7 billion worth of home-district
``pork'' projects the Pentagon hadn't asked for. That prompted Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., to label the legislation ``a travesty, a
thorough slap in the face to all Americans concerned about fiscal
responsibility (and) national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Grassley, ``Right now from both the Democratic and
Republican standpoint this is an era of throwing more money at the
Defense Department, and that's going to make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Well-intentioned top executives at the Pentagon can't seem to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at the level of OSD (Office of the Secretary of Defense)
you can say, `We're going to do thus and so,' but the reality is
you cannot watch 7,000 different budget lines,'' said Lawrence J.
Korb, who was the Pentagon's manpower and logistics czar under
President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Why the Army doesn't yell and scream about this is a matter of
culture, experienced officers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army could wrap itself in the flag and go over there (to
Congress) and pull the heartstrings'' to get more money for basic
gear, said a retired Army infantry officer now working for a major
defense contractor. He asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we see ourselves as the humble servants of the nation. Our
culture is to take what we are given,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Lt. Col. Steve Pinter, who manages soldier equipment
programs for the Army: ``We compete against all other priorities in
the budget and I am funded at a level the Army can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Less visible than the political shenanigans, but just as
powerful, is the rising cost of military operations that crowds out
funding for basic gear.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 years ago, the Pentagon began fielding a new generation
of new aircraft, ships, tanks, helicopters and other major weapons
systems intended to be cheaper to operate and maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have been more expensive, burning more fuel than
predicted, wearing out faster and proving more difficult and
time-consuming to fix. The cost of spare parts has risen
dramatically. And the cost of replacing weapons has skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1985 and 1997, the overall defense budget declined by 34
percent. The military shrank even faster. Ground maneuver
battalions declined from 160 to 90 in number. Fighter wings
declined from 40 to 20. The Navy went from 560 ships to 316.
</P>
<P>
   With this huge decline, operations and maintenance costs went
down only 17 percent. Measured against the number of people on
active duty, operations and maintenance costs rose from $50,000 per
person in 1985 to almost $70,000 per person today, according to
Defense Department figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us is satisfied'' with this situation, said Jim
Hodges, who oversees testing of new Army gear at Fort Polk, La.
``Bills have to be paid. We get what they can give us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Marine Corps Air-Ground Training Center at Twentynine
Palms, Calif., last spring, Lt. Brian Kaveney surveyed the ratty
state of his men's worn-out gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only that, they have to buy their own flashlights,
camouflage (face) paint, waterproof notebooks'' and other
necessities, said Kaveney, a platoon leader in Golf Company, 3rd
Battalion, 4th Marines. ``This is unsat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys don't get paid that much to begin with.''

WIFE OF AMERICAN HELD BY RUSSIANS FOR ESPIONAGE FEARS FOR HIS
HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (SUBS 12th graf, beginning XXX Russian press XXX, to remove
`known') 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The wife of a an American who has been in jail here for
five months on espionage charges came here Tuesday with her
congressman to call on the Russian government to allow Western
doctors to examine her 54-year-old husband, who has bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cheri Pope looked shaken and fatigued after visiting Moscow's
Lefortovo Prison on Tuesday, where her husband, Edmond, a former
naval intelligence officer, has been incarcerated since early
April. He was arrested for supposedly trying to buy classified
plans for a high-technology Russian torpedo system.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian press reports have identified the torpedo
propulsion system, known as the Squall, as the same one carried
aboard the nuclear submarine Kursk, which sank in the Barents Sea
on Aug. 12, killing all 118 crewmen aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing my husband and having to leave him there was extremely
difficult,'' Mrs. Pope said at a news conference, dressed in a gray
suit and speaking in subdued and emotional tones. ``And now I have
to go back to my room and call his mother and father and our sons
and tell them that Ed is not doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John E. Petersen, R-Pa., who accompanied her, was more
blunt. ``If his cancer has returned and we do not catch it soon,
Edmond Pope will die.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say Edmond Pope has been examined 10 times
since April and is not facing any imminent health threat.
``Allegations about the deteriorating mental and physical condition
of the U.S. citizen spread by U.S. representatives are
groundless,'' the Federal Security Service said on Friday. Last
week, a Russian court denied Pope's request to be released to
receive medical treatment while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. embassy officials have been allowed to visit Pope 11 times,
and Tuesday's visit was Mrs. Pope's second. She said her husband is
being kept in a cell with five Russian prisoners, who all share a
sink and toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson castigated Russian authorities for arresting Pope over
the attempted purchase of ``10-year-old'' torpedo technology that
the Russian government openly sells to foreign governments, most
recently to Canada, he asserted. He asked that all details of the
charges against Pope be made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in America knows that Ed Pope is not a spy,''
Peterson said, ``He is an independent businessman who has been
working with the Russians for five to six years'' to develop and
sell high-technology products. He warned that Pope's incarceration
spelled ``a very bad day for the future of American-Russian
business relations.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials in Washington have said that
President Clinton raised the plight of Pope in a telephone call to
President Vladimir Putin during the frantic rescue operation for
the Kursk. Tuesday, Peterson said that Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine K. Albright have been raising the issue of Pope's
``unfair imprisonment'' and asking that his case be resolved ``each
time they meet with a Russian official.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Russia's intelligence service, reached by
telephone, said the agency would not comment Tuesday on the charges
against Pope. Nor would a spokesman say when a trial might take
place.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russian press accounts, quoting intelligence officials here, say
that Pope was arrested as he was handing over $30,000 to a
professor from Bauman State Technical University, Anatoly Babkin,
in order to purchase the plans for the high-speed Russian torpedo
system. Babkin is a specialist in torpedo development and design.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some reports said that Babkin, 70, was subsequently released
because of his advanced age and a heart condition, raising the
question of how seriously Russia's security services are taking his
offense, normally treated as an act of treason.
</P>
<P>
   The Squall torpedo, according to a report from the Russian
institute that designed it, was developed over two decades as a
``versatile'' design that could be fitted with various warheads and
rocket motors depending on its mission. Its versatility included
configurations for underwater attacks, or for firing over the
horizon at surface ships or distant submarine targets.
</P>
<P>
   Its most remarkable feature is its speed, more than 220 miles an
hour in its own gas bubble, making it the fastest torpedo in the
world, according to an article by Valery Kulbitsky, chief designer
of the Russian Research Institute of Marine Technology.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy navy officials have reportedly shown a great deal of
interest in the Squall system, and two U.S. submarines, one of them
the Memphis, were monitoring the military exercises during which
Kursk was slated to fire a variety of weapons. Two senior Russian
officials connected with the investigation into the Kursk sinking
have asserted that Kursk was carrying an experimental torpedo and
that an accident involving the weapon or its engine could have
contributed to the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   A source at the Russian navy headquarters told the news agency
Interfax on Tuesday that navy officials have not ruled out a
torpedo explosion as a cause of the Kursk's sinking, along with
some collision that triggered the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Tuesday that
``There were no new torpedoes on the submarine.'' He said Kursk,
during the military exercises, had launched a type of torpedo that
had been used for 20 years, but he added that some new features had
been added to the torpedo, which he identified as ``a new
accumulator unit with a large resource.''

WOMEN WELCOMED BACK TO CAREER PATH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELINDA LIGOS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gwen Hahn, a stay-at-home mother, decided this summer that
it was time to re-enter the work force, she braced herself for
rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worried that employers might not take me seriously,'' said
Hahn, who had quit her job as a catering manager for a Phoenix
hotel six years ago to spend more time with her three children.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hahn received a job offer even before she had a chance
to send out her resume. Her boss-to-be, Nancy Nachman, president of
a firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., that plans meetings for companies, was
a guest at a party she held and was immediately taken with her
people skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw Gwen, I knew that she was a natural for the
job,'' Nachman said. Not long after, she offered Hahn a position as
a planner with the company, the Meetings Concierge, starting in
early September, and Hahn accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, housewives with resume gaps spanning several
years faced tough slogging in the job market. No more. In today's
full-employment economy, employers are actively wooing women who
held jobs once upon a time and finding in them a rich new source of
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that employers are taking a second look at
women who are re-entering the work force.'' said Marcia Brumit
Kropf, vice president for research and information services for
Catalyst, a New York research group that studies women's issues.
``Today's job market is so tight that employers are opening their
mind to nontraditional candidates. If a woman has talent and a good
track record, a gap in her resume is no longer as relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   And it does not seem to matter if the gap is more a chasm.
Katherine Goldman quit her job as creative director for an
advertising agency in Princeton, N.J., after her first child was
born more than 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always kept my eyes and ears open,'' said Goldman, who spent
the next 11 years doing freelance work for ad agencies while caring
for her two children, who are now teen-agers. When Goldman decided
last year to go back to work full time, she called a contact at
Jack Morton Worldwide, a branding communications firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a returning mother, I thought I might have to explain
myself,'' she said. ``Instead, after I told him that I'd like to
work for him, he said, `Wow, that's great, you're hired.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Kuker, Goldman's boss, says the hot economy has forced
her company's executives to soften their old hiring requirements.
``We're a niche market without a large employee pool, so we're
bringing in applicants who on paper might not look like the ideal
candidate, but who might have just the skills we're looking for,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And, as was the case with Hahn, those skills went beyond
workplace credentials and centered on personality. The company was
attracted by her maturity and confidence as well as her broad
background in writing and advertising, Kuker said. ``She was
bringing something totally different to the table that somebody who
had just gotten out of school, or maybe had one job, wouldn't
have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So eager are some employers to tap into the stay-at-home-mom
pool that many are courting them with flexible-work arrangements,
day care and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, I'm seeing a few law firms offer four-day
workweeks to working mothers,'' said Jillian Winoker, director of
associate placements for Corrao Miller Rush &AMP; Wiesenthal, a New
York employment firm. ``You would never have seen that in the legal
profession five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just law firms. In 1998, Ernst &AMP; Young, the big
accounting firm, created a host of flexible work arrangements, from
compressed work schedules and telecommuting to job sharing. ``Women
returning to the work force are typically highly skilled, and we
have to be creative in attracting them,'' said Deborah Holmes,
national director of the firm's office of retention.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who was attracted was Sharon Kurtz, now a manager of
internal audit services for the firm. Kurtz had previously worked
for Ernst &AMP; Young until her second child was born in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   She decided to apply for a second job there in March 1999, after
taking a break to spend time with her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left, the climate for working mothers was totally
different,'' said Kurtz, who now works a three-day week. ``I would
leave after a nine-hour day, and a co-worker would say, `Oh,
half-day today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kurtz said, so many employees have flexible arrangements
that nobody questions that she works three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason women are finding it easier to re-enter the work
force is that they are becoming more adept at keeping their foot in
the door while they are gone. Although they are often busy raising
children, some women make a point of updating their skills, taking
classes and networking with peers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Consider Cindy Bateman, a mother of two from Seattle. Soon after
Bateman left her position as a vice president at the Pacific
National Bank in Newport Beach, Calif., in December 1998, to spend
more time with her children, she enrolled in an MBA program at the
University of Washington. She also accepted a position as a public
affairs officer for an association for women who work in the
financial industry. She plans to resume working in another year,
when her younger child starts school and she has earned her
master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Though by then she will have been out of the work force for
about three years, she is confident she will find work as a senior
bank manager. ``I'm already getting calls from prospective
employers,'' Bateman said. ``I've gotten so much positive feedback
that I hadn't really considered that there was any difference
between me and a job candidate who hadn't taken time off.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey back to the office is not all smooth sailing, of
course. Hahn, for example, worries about whether her computer
skills are up to speed. Even though her husband is coaching her,
she said, ``It's kind of intimidating; in my old job, I had a
support staff to do this kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the inevitable culture shock. Goldman said
reporting to people who are younger than she is could be tough.
</P>
<P>
   But her biggest struggle, she said, has been making her family
accustomed to the fact that she is working again and to share
household chores like making dinner and doing the laundry. ``We're
having to renegotiate roles,'' she said. `My working is something
we're all still getting used to.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   As an integral part of his personal life and a guiding force in
his political life, Joe Lieberman's deep religious conviction is
one of his most appealing aspects. As a continuing theme in
Lieberman's national campaign, it is quickly losing its charm.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman moved up to the line and probably crossed it in
remarks Sunday in Detroit, as he began his first solo campaign
swing as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   As a people we need to reaffirm our faith and renew the
dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's purpose,
Lieberman said at Fellowship Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   As true as that may be, I don't want a candidate for national
office _ or, for that matter, any political post _ to be the one to
tell me about it.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman tried to sugarcoat his message, even resorting to the
favorite dodge of the current breed of Christian theocrats: The
Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, not freedom from
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Then in a phrase sure to send Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell
into an approving swoon, Lieberman added: There must be and can be
a constitutional place for faith in our public life.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that neither Lieberman nor any of the other
adherents of this sweet-sounding line have yet illustrated how to
dissect sectarian religion from faith so that it passes
constitutional muster. George W. Bush and Al Gore both made a stab
at it earlier in the campaign, with calls for government assistance
that would be administered through ``faith-based institutions,''
and failed.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is, of course, not the first candidate to play the
religious card so vigorously. Bush, who once implied that Jews
could not go to heaven, has named Jesus as his favorite political
philosopher and said that in making tough decisions he asks
himself, ``What would Jesus do?''
</P>
<P>
   I will admit to some hesitancy in writing about this issue.
</P>
<P>
   When I first read the reports of Lieberman's weekend remarks, I
cringed. It was the same reaction I had to some of Lieberman's
expressions of religiosity at the time of his selection as Gore's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   If a conservative Southern Baptist had said the same things,
eyebrows and then voices would have been raised in correctly
questioning such an emphasis by a national candidate on religious
themes.
</P>
<P>
   I fretted over the issue and then put it aside as a column
topic, deciding that Lieberman was new enough at the national game
and deserved to be cut some slack. And did a columnist who happens
to be a Christian have the right to tell the first Jewish candidate
on either major national ticket to can the God shtick?
</P>
<P>
   My reservations, however, receded when a statement from leaders
of the Anti-Defamation League expressed exactly what I had felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates should feel comfortable explaining their religious
convictions to voters,'' said Howard P. Berkowitz, ADL national
chairman, and Abraham H. Foxman, ADL national director. ``At the
same time, however, we believe there is a point at which an
emphasis on religion in a political campaign becomes inappropriate
and even unsettling in a religiously diverse society such as
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Their statement, an open entreaty to Lieberman to cool it, was
prompted by the senator's remarks in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Language such as this risks alienating the American people,''
the ADL leaders said. ``We feel very strongly ... that appealing
along religious lines, on belief in God, is contrary to the
American ideal. The First Amendment requires that government
neither support one religion over another nor the religious over
the non-religious.''
</P>
<P>
   I was comforted, not to say emboldened, by their statement. The
ADL has fought anti-Semitism and promoted tolerance in this country
for almost a century, and I am happy to be in its company.
</P>
<P>
   The ADL and I apparently are not alone in feeling uneasy about
Lieberman's approach. A Gallup poll taken last Thursday-Sunday
suggests Americans are reluctant to mix religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although 57 percent of Americans say religion plays a very
important role in their life, only a third say their religious
beliefs and faith will be important in deciding their vote for
president this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman should show his deep faith through his life and
career, not in his speeches.

<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Muslim rebels who thrive on kidnapping
seized an American on a remote Philippine island Tuesday and
threatened to kill him if the United States does not meet
unspecified demands.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels, who have been holding a group of
Europeans, South Africans and Asians for four months, said in a
radio broadcast that ``we have been trying very hard to get an
American.''
</P>
<P>
   They identified him as Jeffrey Craig Schilling, 24, asserted he
was an agent for the CIA and said, ``We will not hesitate to
execute this American guy if the Philippine government and the
United States will not listen to our demands.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they would announce their demands within three days.
</P>
<P>
   ((In Washington, the State Department demanded Schilling's &UR; 3 &LR; 
unconditional release. ``The United States does not make deals with
terrorists and this organization,'' said the department spokesman,
Philip Reeker. &UR; 4 &LR; ``The Abu Sayyaf &UR; 2 &LR;  group is an organization which
is listed in our patterns of global terrorism as one of the radical
Islamic separatist groups operating in the southern Philippines.''
.
</P>
<P>
   He could not say whether Schilling &UR; 3 &LR;  was employed by the U.S.
States government. Reuters quoted an administration official as
denying that Schilling &UR; 3 &LR;  worked for the CIA ``To my knowledge he
is not a U.S. government employee,'' he said.))
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the group executed two Filipino hostages when
one of their demands went unfulfilled. They wanted Washington to
release several Arab terrorists imprisoned in the United States
after the bombing of New York's World Trade Center in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine government confirmed the abduction, saying that
an envoy had seen Schilling being held in an Abu Sayyaf camp. The
U.S. embassy in Manila said it was sending six officials to
Zamboanga, the nearest city, where Schilling had been living for
several months with his fiancee, a Philippine citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The abduction is the latest twist in a kidnapping spree that
started on April 23 when Abu Sayyaf gunmen abducted 21 mostly
Western hostages from a diving resort on a nearby Malaysian island.
Since then, several hostages have been freed and several more have
been seized. Before Schilling's abduction, the gunmen were holding
six Westerners and a dozen Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Six other Westerners were freed on Sunday and Monday in exchange
for reported payments of $1 million each. Libya acted as go-between
in these releases, raising the possibility that the United States
might find itself turning to Libya for help in freeing Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   A Libyan official said Tuesday his nation would be happy to help
if asked.
</P>
<P>
   In the radio interview, the Abu Sayyaf spokesman, Abu Sabaya,
suggested that the ransom for an American should be 10 times as
much as for a European.
</P>
<P>
   If they decide to kill Schilling, he said, ``Then next week we
will get another hostage and do the same thing to him. The
Americans may think we are afraid of them, but we are really
determined to get an American.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In its negotiations for the Western hostages, the Philippine
government has relied on intermediaries from Libya, which for years
has had close relations with Muslim separatist fighters in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have suggested that Libya's mediating role _
including a total ransom payment that has been estimated to be as
high as $25 million in ``development aid'' _ is an attempt to
burnish its international image.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and others have blamed the Libyan leader,
Moammar Gadhafi, for a number of terrorist acts around the world.
Two Libyans are now on trial in the bombing in 1988 of a Pan Am
jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 277 people.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time Schilling was being kidnapped, the six
recently freed hostages were arriving to a festive welcome in the
Libyan capital, Tripoli, after being flown there on a Libyan
airliner. The freed hostages, from France, Germany, South Africa
and Lebanon, were to be sent home later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget the name that delivered you from the humiliation
of captivity; that name is Moammar Gadhafi,'' a Libyan official
said in a televised speech at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   A Libyan foreign ministry official, speaking on Qatar's
satellite television station, said his nation would try to help win
Schilling's release if asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to carry out a role to save the life of a human
being, whether he is an American or European, we will not hesitate
to help,'' said the official, Hassounah el-Shawish.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines on Tuesday, immigration authorities provided
a copy of Schilling's passport to reporters. It said he was born in
Minnesota on Feb. 4, 1976 and had entered the Philippines on March
8, extending his visitor's visa twice.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf, which is a small splinter group from a long-running
Muslim separatist insurgency in the southern Philippines, has
focused more on the business of kidnapping than on ideological
warfare. Kidnapping is so common in the area that it has been
somewhat formalized, with the going rate for ransoms at about
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the kidnappings of the Western vacationers in April, the
island of Jolo became flooded with unheard-of amounts of money. Two
of the bandits were arrested last week when they went to a small
local bank and tried to change $240,000 into Philippine pesos.
</P>
<P>
   However, Abu Sayyaf, small as it is, is broken into several
factions. Philippine officials say that the gunmen's squabbles over
tactics and over the division of ransom money have complicated
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials have also complicated negotiations on some
occasions with contradictory or threatening public statements. The
belligerence of some of the statements contrasts with the
helplessness of the government in dealing with kidnappers who have
in the past tortured and executed their hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the spokesman for President Joseph Estrada said the
kidnappers had only made matters worse for themselves by seizing an
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to galvanize international action against
them,'' said the spokesman, Ricardo Puno. ``The world will unite in
the realization of what a big problem the Abu Sayyaf poses.''

   MEXICO-ABORTION _ MEXICO CITY _ The governor of Mexico's
Guanajuato state on Tuesday vetoed a controversial new state law
that would have mandated jail time for rape victims who get
abortions. Abortion, which is mostly illegal in Mexico, has been a
sensitive topic lately as the right and left fight over whether to
further restrict or liberalize abortion rights. The governor, who
belongs to same conservative party that pushed the new law in the
Guanajuato legislature, backed up his decision with an opinion poll
of attitudes in his state that he recently commissioned. (Ferriss,

   RUSSIA-SPY _ MOSCOW _ Wasted and weary after being held for five
months in a Russian jail on charges of espionage, American

wife, Cheri, who was allowed a two-hour visit with him in the
notorious Lefortovo prison on Tuesday, reiterated her husband's
innocence. She said his health has deteriorated so much that she is
afraid Pope, 54, who has a rare form of bone cancer, will die if
not released soon. (Coker, Cox News Service)

   MEXICO-LALOBA _ CHIMALHUACAN, Mexico _ ``La Loba,'' the
She-Wolf, is the intimidating nickname of Guadalupe Buendia, a
woman said to have amassed wealth and power in this vast slum of
1.2 million people next to Mexico City. Buendia was a local fixture
of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI -
which tolerated her abuses. Through a network of nepotism, she kept
herself and her family in charge here for years. But they did
little to improve conditions; garbage is picked up by donkeys and
carts, running water and toilets are luxuries. One woman blames her
for a barrage of bullets fired through her door one recent night.
La Loba is now under arrest, charged with organizing a murderous
attack on a political rival who had defeated her machine in a
recent election. The story of how she controlled people's lives
here reflects a political culture Mexico is struggling to put
behind it. (Ferris, Cox News Service) WITH PHOTOS.

   STATEOFSOUTH _ CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - A new report analyzing the
South recommends a politically dicey approach to spreading
prosperity across the region: Nurturing the already-booming New
Economy cities, such as Atlanta and Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill,
because their prosperity ripples to outlying communities. For
decades, the notion of government and business nurturing its strong
cities has been a sore spot among rural area and their politicians.
But noting that ``the challenge before Southerners is at once
sweeping and exhilarating,'' MDC says, ``It is to ensure that the
region's prospering places and people continue to thrive, while
helping the people and places that are falling further behind gain
the capacity to adapt and flourish in a rapidly changing economy.''

   OUTBACK _ Keyed to the opening of the Summer lympics (9/15): The
vast majority of the Australian continent is nothing like Sydney or
Melbourne. It's an arid, sparsely populated moonscape that the

Red Centre, after the red sand that ripples under the hot wind. We
journey into the region aboard the Ghan train, kick around the
funky town of Alice Springs and make a pilgrimage to Uluru, the

sacred to Aborigines and iconic to all Australians. (Auchmutey,

fortune worth it? Child stars, for instance, are often robbed of a
normal childhood. Growing up is hard enough. Imagine having to do
it in front of millions of people watching your every move or
snickering about every goofy-looking pimple you get. The pressure
to perform is also insanely intense. Many adult actors can't even
take the heat and

<P>
   often resort to drugs and alcohol to cope. Just think what it's
like for a kid to overhear a producer angrily talking about low

child's psyche? (Thompson, Palm Beach Post)

bites as well as an agonizing struggle with multiple myeloma, a
bone marrow cancer. And so, when the 46-year-old McLaurin was
diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus a few months ago, he was
well prepared to die. He had lived a full life, he told himself. An
ex-Marine who had kicked a debilitating drinking habit after 20
years, he had been married and divorced twice, had two teenage
children, and had worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in Tunisia. ``I

 &HT;    HAMMERING ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore, turning his focus to children's health, says it is
``put up or shut up time'' for George W. Bush to begin dealing with
the specifics of campaign issues. ``The time for generalities
without specifics I think is just about over,'' Gore told
reporters. He said he was largely at a loss to evaluate Bush's
proposals since they lack details. ``I don't really know how they
make it all add up,'' he said. The Bush campaign said that kind of
talk is ``not very presidential.'' Gore plugged away again Tuesday,
in Albuquerque, N.M., for his proposed $100 billion expansion of
child health insurance. Political strategists say that issue can be
used to target Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING EDUCATION ATTACK TO SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   Just as he did after his 18-point defeat by John McCain in New
Hampshire in February, George W. Bush responded to his recent sag
in the polls with a sharp attack on Al Gore, unleashing sharp
criticism on education. Bush accused Gore of offering a plan ``with
an illusion of accountability,'' presiding over a ``national
tragedy'' in reading, and of being ``locked in old ways.'' Bush was
holding an education discussion Tuesday at a middle school in
Portland, Maine. Today he is scheduled to hold another education
discussion at a high school in Hampton, N.H. In between, he was to
attend a $5,000-a-couple fund-raiser for the state Republican Party
in Rye, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   CHARACTER AND RELIGIOUS VALUES
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney is promoting popular conservative themes _
character-building and a strong defense _ on a three-day tour
through Missouri, Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida.
He told a gathering of Christian athletes in Kansas City, Mo.,
today that teaching children about character is as important as
showing them how to read and write. Cheney shared the podium with
members of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, a national group
that encourages students and coaches to practice Christian values
and influence others to get involved with churches. One student
participant, Erica Garris, quoted scripture and told the gathering,
``I stand here today professing God as my savior.''
</P>
<P>
   A SCOLDING ON RELIGIOUS OVEREMPHASIS
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about his recent statements on the campaign trail, the
Anti-Defamation League called on Joe Lieberman to refrain from
overt expressions of religious values and beliefs, stating that
``appealing to voters along religious lines is contrary to the
American ideal.'' Said a statement from Howard Berkowitz and
Abraham Foxman of the ADL: ``Candidates should feel comfortable
explaining their religious convictions to voters. At the same time,
however, we believe there is a point at which an emphasis on
religion in a political campaign becomes inappropriate and even
unsettling in a religiously diverse society such as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   APPLYING PRESSURE FOR DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign chairman tried today to increase pressure on
George W. Bush to accept three nationally televised, prime-time
debates in October, saying they would ``give the greatest number of
voters the chance to hear the candidates directly.'' Bush has
agreed to three presidential debates without specifying which ones.
Bush responded, ``I would welcome all three being in prime time,''
but his campaign said that didn't necessarily mean he would accept
any of the debate commission's proposed dates or formats. Bush has
said he prefers relatively informal debates, such as a session
during the primaries when the participants were seated around a
table with CNN's Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   TWO NEW POLLS SHOW A TIE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Al Gore are locked in a dead heat in two new
presidential polls, evidence that Gore is holding his
post-convention poll bounce. The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of
likely voters showed Bush at 46 percent, Gore at 45 percent, Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader at 3 percent and Reform Party candidate
Pat Buchanan at 1 percent. A poll by ICR of Media, Pa. showed Gore
at 44 percent and Bush at 41 percent among registered voters. Both
polls had error margins of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   TAX ISSUE JUST NOT CUTTING IT
</P>
<P>
   Even as George W. Bush pursues his call for a broad federal tax
cut, a new ABCNEWS.com poll shows that three-quarters of Americans
express other priorities for the budget surplus. Twenty-five
percent give top priority to cutting income taxes, up 7 points
since July. But many more _ 42 percent _ prefer to use the surplus
to strengthen Social Security, 16 percent favor debt reduction, and
14 percent give priority to ``other domestic programs.'' When those
``other programs'' are specified as education and health care,
according to the poll (3 percentage point margin of error), support
for that spending rises and support for a tax cut shrinks to 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   NAMING NAMES IN DRUG COMPANY ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore escalated his attacks against the pharmaceutical
industry, criticizing two drug companies by name and calling for
greater competition in the industry. Gore singled out
Schering-Plough, which makes Claritin, and American Home Products,
the parent company of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which makes
Lodine. In the case of Claritin, Gore said the manufacturer spent
more money on advertising than on research. And in the case of
Lodine, an arthritis medicine prescribed for both people and pets,
he said American Home Products charged pharmacies more than
veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA NOW ONE OF THOSE BATTLEGROUND STATES
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's tough talk against Cuba _ publicly
accusing the communist regime of denying exit permits to Cubans
holding U.S. visas _ came as Al Gore stepped up his efforts to win
Florida, an electoral powerhouse that is home to thousands of
Cuban-American voters. Florida is considered crucial to George W.
Bush's hopes of winning the White House, but Gore appears to be
running a surprisingly strong campaign in the state where Bush's
brother, Jeb, is governor. ``Florida is in play. We're all
surprised,'' said Jim Kane of Florida Voter, a nonpartisan polling
organization.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY TRAIL FOLLOWED TO 9 STATES
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials pumped $6.1 million into nine states
last month, providing an early road map of where they plan to
compete this fall. The list includes Pennsylvania, Illinois,
Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, California, Oregon and Washington.
Topping the list was Florida, where the national GOP sent more than
$1 million to the state party last month. ``None of the states are
any surprise,'' said Republican political consultant Eddie Mahe.
``Those are the same states (both candidates) have been visiting
since Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN CHARGED WITH PLAGIARISM
</P>
<P>
   A Southern Methodist University economics professor has sued Pat
Buchanan and his publisher, Little Brown &AMP; Co., for copyright
infringement. A lawsuit filed in federal court by Ravendra Batra
alleges that Buchanan's 1998 book, ``The Great Betrayal,''
plagiarized parts of Batra's books, including charts and graphs.
Buchanan's book argues against globalization of economies, and he
blasts the major political parties for seeking trade treaties that
he believes hurt American workers and undermine the nation's
sovereignty. Batra appeared on the CNN news program ``Crossfire''
in the early 1990s when Buchanan was co-host.
</P>
<P>
   WEIGHING REFORM IN THREE STATES
</P>
<P>
   California, Oregon and Missouri will offer voters the chance in
November to overhaul their campaign finance laws. California's
Proposition 34 would limit political donations from most sources at
$20,000 for gubernatorial candidates, $5,000 for other statewide
candidates and $3,000 for legislative candidates. Initiatives in
Missouri and Oregon would finance campaigns with taxpayer money,
putting those states in the forefront of the campaign-finance
reform movement. California, on the other hand, is considering the
kinds of donation caps that 44 states already have. In California
now, individuals, corporations and other special interests can
donate as much as they want.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA CLUB SPENDING IN 12 RACES
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club is returning to the airwaves with $8 million in
TV and radio ads praising a few Republicans and many more
Democrats. Positive ads will air about Democratic Reps. Lane Evans
of Illinois; Mark Udall of Colorado; Joseph Hoeffel of
Pennsylvania; Rush Holt of New Jersey; and Brian Baird, Jay Inslee
and Adam Smith of Washington state; Republican Rep. Jim Leach of
Iowa; and Republican Sens. Jim Jeffords of Vermont and William Roth
of Delaware. Critical ads are airing against two Republicans: Sen.
Slade Gorton of Washington state and former Virginia Gov. George
Allen, a Senate hopeful running against Democratic Sen. Charles
Robb.
</P>
<P>
   THE CASE OF THE STOLEN SIGNATURES
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader barely met the deadline for filing to get on
Wyoming's general election ballot, but the theft of nearly 650
petition signatures on his behalf is casting doubt on whether his
name will appear at all. Someone walked off with a clipboard full
of signatures at restaurant in Laramie last week, according to
Nader volunteer Roberta Harper-McIntosh. Supporters turned in about
4,000 signatures to state election officials just one minute before
Monday night's filing deadline, but they had hoped to deliver
between 5,000 and 6,000 _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   UNION MOBILIZATION IN KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, although not as heavily organized as some other
states, is fertile ground for labor this year. One of the most
competitive races in the nation has Democrat Scotty Baesler trying
to win back his House seat from Republican Rep. Ernie Fletcher.
Baesler lost the seat in 1998 when he ran unsuccessfully for the
Senate. GOP Reps. Anne Northup and Edward Whitfield, whose
districts have sizable union populations, also face spirited
challenges. Bill Londrigan, head of the Kentucky AFL-CIO, is well
aware that the three races could help decide who controls the House
next year.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN SENATE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   In Florida's Senate contest, state Insurance Commissioner Bill
Nelson, a Democrat, and Rep. Bill McCollum, a Republican, are
locked in a race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Connie Mack
that is critical to Democrats' uphill fight to win control of the
Senate. But the race is more than that. Coupled with the Democrats'
likely recovery of a Senate seat in Georgia _ although they might
lose one in Virginia _ the Florida race could be an important
marker in the evolution of two-party politics in the South.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNING ON WITH A MORE VIABLE CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Tim Goeglein, who described his two-year stint as spokesman for
conservative activist and unsuccessful presidential candidate Gary
Bauer as ``two really terrific years,'' is joining George W. Bush's
campaign Friday. Goeglein, in an e-mail to correspondents covering
the Republican campaign, said that he will be working as part of
the Bush-Cheney communications team.
</P>
<P>
   `BASIC POLITICS'
</P>
<P>
   Joe Eszterhas, the high-priced screenwriter behind such sexually
charged films as ``Showgirls'' and ``Basic Instinct,'' wants
Hollywood to withhold support from Al Gore because of the
anti-media rhetoric of his running mate, Joe Lieberman. Eszterhas,
whose own work has often been critically panned for its lurid
nature, came out swinging against Gore and Lieberman in a full-page
open letter in the entertainment trade paper Daily Variety. ``No
more Hollywood money for Al Gore,'' Eszterhas admonishes, in the
ad. ``I'm a writer who likes pushing the envelope, and Joe
Lieberman frightens me.''

ADVERTISING: MASTERCARD SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you reach people in the fastest-growing segment of the
American population? Simple. Speak their language.
</P>
<P>
   Mastercard, the latest mainstream company to acknowledge the
buying power of Latinos, has decided to speak directly to them, in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is language important, but culture is also important
to the Hispanic community,'' said Petra Pasquina, director for
Hispanic marketing at Mastercard International in Purchase, N.Y.
``So speaking to them in Spanish, we find that messages are better
communicated and more understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   Other credit card marketers, including Mastercard's rival, Visa
USA, have run ads in English with a Latin flair. But the new Visa
campaign is a first.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are huge. According to federal statistics, the
estimated annual buying power of Hispanics is expected to surpass
$440 billion this year. In the last 10 years, disposable income for
Hispanic Americans has more than doubled and is expected to double
again the next decade. That is twice the income growth rate of
non-Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, Spanish-language advertising has
increased in popularity as Latin culture has move more into the
mainstream with Grammy-winning artists like Santana and pop
celebrities like Marc Anthony, Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin.
Plenty of marketers have tried to ride the trend by adding a Latino
touch to their ads. But to make sure the audience is really getting
the message, more and more marketers are turning to advertising in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any marketer that wants to realize their full sales potential
in the U.S. has to be addressing this population,'' said Tony Ruiz,
partner and director for advertising at the Vidal Partnership in
New York, the agency that created Mastercard's Spanish-language
campaign. Latinos are close to overtaking blacks as the nation's
largest minority, rising to 32 million from 23 million a decade
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mastercard's Spanish-language campaign was adapted from the
company's successful ``Priceless'' campaign, which was created
three years ago by McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New
York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies. That campaign features intangible
moments that transcend price tags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to preserve the power of the priceless campaign and
communicate it in as relevant a manner to consumers,'' Ruiz said.
The agency reviewed existing Mastercard ads and tried to select
those most relevant to the Latino consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't necessarily just take them as they existed, we did
work on them,'' Ruiz said. The agency adapted the spots by playing
with the shots and putting across the right communication in the
audio. One criterion was to present ``real environments so that the
consumer could see themselves as a participant, as opposed to a
spectator, and to leverage the strongest insights.'' After
extensive consumer research two spots were created.
</P>
<P>
   One, titled ``Grandma,'' features a grandmother and
granddaughter shopping for the secret ingredients to a special
meal. As the grandmother selects certain items, like an iron
cooking pot, an announcer lists the price in Spanish: ``Una buena
olla, 22 dolares,'' or, for onions, ``Cebollas, 4 dolares.'' This
is followed by ``the time it takes to simmer: priceless'' (``El
tiempo que toma en cocinarse: no tiene percio.'') The spot ends
with the familiar tagline: ``There are some things that money can't
buy: for everything else there is Mastercard. Accepted everywhere,
even in the fruit stand.'' (``Hay cosas que el dinero no puede
comprar: par todo lo demas esta Mastercard. Aceptada en todas
partes: hasta en pequenos comercios.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grandma commercial presents the existence of the extended
family,'' Ruiz said. A second spot, titled ``Fatherhood,'' features
a new father fumbling as he tries to diaper and dress his newborn.
An announcer states: ``A lot of diapers: $95.'' (Panales, muchos
panales: 95 dolares.) The announcer states the price of other items
like booties and a baby carriage followed by: ``Being a father:
priceless.'' (``Ser papa: no tiene precio.'')
</P>
<P>
   The ``Fatherhood'' spot, Ruiz said, depicts the changing roles
in the Hispanic household today. ``The added value to that ad is
breakthrough because a lot of what you see on Spanish-language
television revolves around the Mom being the primary gatekeeper and
caretaker.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, for which the spending was not disclosed, are
running on the two largest domestic Spanish-language television
networks, Univision and Telemundo. The ads began on July 31 and
will run through the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing ads in Spanish, Mastercard is joining a
lengthening list of mainstream American companies, including AT&AMP;T,
Sprint, Coca-Cola, Heineken, McDonald's, General Motors and
Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With newfound credit from cards like Mastercard, there also
comes debt. So Mastercard is also introducing a consumer financial
management educational program specifically for Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a need for reaching out to the community not
only from an advertising standpoint, but also with educational
initiatives so that we're delivering cards to the hands of
Hispanics but also doing it responsibly,'' Pasquina said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that only 63 percent of Hispanic Americans have a
relationship with a bank, Mastercard says, compared with 88 percent
of the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Cummings, vice president for consumer affairs for
Mastercard, said the company would work closely with member banks
to help them appeal to Hispanics and make Mastercard's
Spanish-language materials available to members. In addition,
Mastercard formed a partnership with the League of United Latin
American Citizens in Washington, the oldest and largest Hispanic
organization in the United States, to develop educational
materials. The league will be holding local workshops offering
information on everything from how to set up and manage a budget to
the importance of building a solid credit history.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Mastercard had plans to aim at other segments of
the American population in various languages, Pasquina said, ``I
don't know that for sure. At this point, we've taken the first step
with the Hispanic market.''

<P>
   Hot sun and cobalt blue sea, red cliffs and golden beaches,
peaceful villages and throbbing night clubs _ the French Riviera
beguiles and seduces. It should be no surprise that this stretch of
Mediterranean coast where sea and sky blend with green forests and
silver-gray olive trees has attracted artists for hundreds of
years.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 19th century, many painters became fascinated
by the clear light of the south of France. Impressionists such as
Berthe Morisot (who settled in Nice), Claude Monet (Antibes) and
Auguste Renoir (Cagnes-sur-Mer) sought to portray the subtle
effects of light on Mediterranean landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pointillist Paul Signac established himself in St.-Tropez,
while Fauvists Raoul Dufy and Henri Matisse settled in Nice. Later,
Marc Chagall found that the light and flowers of Vence stimulated
his multicolored dreams, and Pablo Picasso, while in Antibes,
created joyful works inspired by the marine and mythological life
of the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Today's traveler can surely see what inspired these artists as
they transmuted the landscape, light, fruits and flowers of this
glorious coast into great works of art.
</P>
<P>
   In retracing the footsteps of these artists, Nice is a good
place to start. Matisse lived here for 37 years and there's a
magical Chagall museum. As a bonus, the culinary specialties of
this seaside resort are some of the tastiest on the Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the cooking of the Ligurian region of Italy as well
by that of nearby Provence, ``la cuisine nicoise'' takes delicious
advantage of the flavorful local olive oil, all manner of fruits
and vegetables and an abundance of Mediterranean fish and
shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow streets of Old Nice overflow with opportunities to
try such delicacies as ``pissaladiere,'' an onion tart topped with
a rich anchovy sauce and garnished with black olives, and the famed
``salade nicoise,'' a lively combination of tomatoes,
beans,radishes, peppers, onions and hard-boiled eggs garnished with
anchovy and basil and moistened with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   For a snack to be eaten in the street, there is the chick-pea
flour cake called ``socca,'' often accompanied by a glass of local
wine. And a good lunchtime choice is the ubiquitous ``pan bagnat''
(literally ``soaked bread''), a sandwich of tomatoes, onions,
anchovies and garlic, the bread moist with olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   The glisteningly fresh raw materials of these dishes and more
can be bought _ or simply admired _ in the Cours Saleya market.
Once the elegant promenade of Old Nice, this picturesque quarter is
now lined with shops and restaurants. It is also the site of a
colorful flower market and, on Mondays, an antiques emporium.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for some art? The Musee Marc-Chagall, in the sophisticated
Cimiez Hill area of town, houses the most important permanent
collection of the painter's works. The building was designed
especially to display his 17 ``Biblical Message'' canvasses;
recessed walls and large windows opening onto the bright
Mediterranean light show these masterpieces to their best
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Such subjects as the Creation of Man, the Garden of Eden and the
Song of Songs are treated with Chagall's signature poetic lyricism:
Dreamlike figures drift among glowing colors above the rooftops of
sleepy villages. These intensely spiritual paintings took the
master 13 uninterrupted years to create.
</P>
<P>
   Before checking out the work of Henri Matisse, especially if
it's summer, you might want to stop in one of the ice cream parlors
in the Cours Saleya and do a bit of shopping. Local olive oil is
available at Chez Alziari; eau de Nice (mimosa-scented toilet
water) and many other perfumes can be had at Au Parfum de Grasse,
and Provencal crafts such as whimsically patterned tablecloths and
napkins are available in numerous shops on the streets around the
Baroque Ste.-Reparate Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   During his Fauve period, a reaction against Impressionism, Henri
Matisse attempted through the use of pure and brilliant colors
juxtaposed in simplified forms and perspectives to express not just
the fleeting sensations evoked by nature but his own thoughts and
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   He is represented in Nice by the Musee Matisse, housed in a
splendid patrician villa and dedicated entirely to his work. A
large composition of cutout gouaches, ``Flowers and Fruit,'' the
master's last work (1953), greets visitors at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 canvasses show his progression from a dark, realistic
style to one influenced by the bright Mediterranean light,
culminating in an explosion of pure and brilliant color. Among the
235 works are sketches for his extraordinary mural, ``The Dance,''
as well as bronze sculptures and silkscreen prints.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Nice is just the beginning of an artistic tour of the
Riviera. Matisse moved on to Vence, where he designed the
magnificent Chapelle du Rosaire. (``Despite its imperfections I
think it is my masterpiece ... the result of a lifetime devoted to
the search for truth.'') Also in Vence is the Fondation Emile
Hugues, which offers exhibitions by 20th-century masters including
Chagall, Dubuffet and Dufy.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Picasso....

`THE ROYAL FAMILY': THE LIFE, AND ITS DESPAIRING UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The royal family of ``The Royal Family'' is a group of women
from San Francisco who are in what is knowingly called ``the
life'': the life of prostitution, mostly, but the attendant lives
of drugs, bohemian despair and middle-class strivings frustrated by
abuse or poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Royal is thus an ironic term, though not entirely, since in the
prolific William T. Vollmann's new novel, the ``whores,'' as he
generally calls the members of the family, are given both humanity
and stature. More important in Vollmann's new novel, other people
who are not in the life pay a kind of fealty to those who are, or
as Vollmann writes in a brief foreword, ``Let this book, like its
characters, be devoted to Addiction, Addicts, Pushers, Prostitutes
and Pimps.''
</P>
<P>
   An immense literary talent is on display as Vollmann fulfills
the mission he declares in those lines. Not for nothing has this
author of books like ``The Rainbow Stories'' (in which prostitutes
also figure prominently) and ``An Afghanistan Picture Show'' been
declared a leading member of a new wave of hip, darkly sexual
novelists who appeal mainly to a jaded, gilded youth.
</P>
<P>
   But in rambling through the luxuriant undergrowth of this new
novel, you do wonder about the purpose to which his talent is being
put. ``The Royal Family,'' which starts out with a brilliant sort
of causticity, demonstrates Vollmann's verbal power and
inventiveness. Yet it is a frustrating, tiresome and conceptually
precious book as well, overwhelmed by logorrhea, a numbing
repetitiveness and an underlying moral vision that, despite the
electrical shock treatment that Vollmann gives it, has been old hat
since the days of William Burroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Vollmann has such a penchant for glittery meta-elaboration, for
relentless, spoofy gamesmanship that he leaves the saturated reader
begging for surcease.
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``The Royal Family'' is relatively simple.
Vollmann's sympathetic main character is Henry Tyler, a San
Francisco private investigator who is in love with Irene, the
Korean wife of his brother, John, a smart, ambitious, unlikable
lawyer. Henry has been hired by an unscrupulous businessman named
Brady to find a certain Queen of the Whores, who is reputed to hold
court among San Francisco prostitutes. When Irene, who gives up
striving to endure her life with the disapproving, coldhearted
John, kills herself, Tyler finds a bitter sort of solace by
entering into ``the life'' himself, as a special friend of the
Queen and her stable of women.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of this novel is much less to tell a story than to
depict the unconventional moral universe of the royal family, which
exists parallel to that of us more conventional commoners.
Vollmann, whose research among prostitutes from San Francisco to
the south of Thailand has been well reported in the press, has done
ample reporting of his own on the subject for this novel, too, and
his characters, with names like Domino, Strawberry and Chocolate,
are brought vividly and lengthily to life.
</P>
<P>
   Vollmann, who makes occasional appearances in his book, tells
us, for example, that he made Strawberry up ``out of three sad
women I know.'' He provides a witty disquisition on bail and bail
bondsmen drawn from his own reporting. He thoroughly explores the
psychic underworld of pimps and johns and others, like Henry, who
discover within themselves hidden reservoirs of sado-masochism, of
urges to be humiliated and hurt, to descend, in other words, into
luscious degradation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperate and confused to the very bottom of his soul, he
struggled among square tomblike openings far-spaced in the yellow
walls of death, wanting to escape back into pure numb death but the
Queen would not let him,'' Vollmann writes of Henry, who becomes a
sort of abused lover of the Queen of the Whores. ``It hurt so much!
Tear-streams gushed like pale urine from his eyes. He was weeping
for Irene and gagging on his own grief.''
</P>
<P>
   So forth at considerable length, for there is nothing
epigrammatic in Vollmann, who seems unable to leave out anything
that he has learned or thought during his researches. ``The Royal
Family,'' which starts out with plenty of narrative intrigue, as
Henry searches for the Queen and thinks of Irene, turns into an
extended series of literary displays by Vollmann.
</P>
<P>
   He gives us portraits drawn from ``the life,'' like that of Dan
Smooth, who fantasizes having sex with children and talks about it
with a kind of jaundiced eloquence. He introduces a lengthy
digression on ``a character without a name'' whose fetish is
retarded women. (``They could be called perpetual children. That
was the usual way to think of them, two-day piglets, puny and
short-furred like monkeys.'' )
</P>
<P>
   He writes a series of chapters, parodies of criminal underworld
fiction, on the ``Feminine Circus,'' a virtual erotic emporium
created by Brady in Las Vegas. (``I'm just amazed no one ever
thought of it before,'' Vollmann has a Las Vegas taxi driver tell
Tyler. ``It sums up the national mood, you could almost say. It's
brilliant. It's as real as you want it to be.'')
</P>
<P>
   All along, Vollmann bears us aloft on the swelling currents of
his prose, which is psychedelic, hallucinatory, slyly
self-referential and confiding. It creates a bond of mutual
knowingness and sophistication between writer and reader, who
become brothers and sisters in this extended appreciation of the
perverse side of human nature, refusing ever to be so hokey as to
actually be shocked.
</P>
<P>
   Is Vollmann daring, as the dust jacket contends? Given how
fashionable it is to be jadedly amoral in fiction today, to be
transgressive (a word often used to describe Vollmann), ``The Royal
Family'' is probably less daring than it is chic, with the author
not so much creating a new sensibility as catering to an
established, vicarious, middle-class bohemianism spiced by
recreational drugs.
</P>
<P>
   His novel is in many ways extraordinary, and I will always be
interested in knowing what is stewing in Vollmann's furious
imagination. But this book, despite his talent, is less a fully
realized work of literature than the protracted reverie of an
especially precocious adolescent, full of energy and brilliance.
But it is the kind of brilliance that flares and then fades,
leaving vague, transient afterimages in the mind, but nothing
permanent to alter your vision.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to talk seriously about the painter Bridget Riley,
then let's dispose of Twiggy and Mary Quant and the whole '60s Op
Art craze. Thirty-five years ago, Riley was the That Girl of
contemporary painting. Her suave, buzzing, high-octane
black-and-white abstractions woke up sleepy English art and caused
a transcontinental sensation. Her first show in New York sold out
before it opened. But some kinds of success are deadly, or at least
they could be in the days before celebrity at any price was
considered the same as ambition.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1965, Riley was in a car on her way from the airport
to the Museum of Modern Art, where she was one of the stars of a
big multi-artist survey. As she drove up Madison Avenue, she saw _
in one store window after another _ dresses by a variety of makers
whose designs were lifted from her paintings. ``The whole thing had
spread everywhere even before I touched down at the airport,'' she
recalled years later.
</P>
<P>
   She was horrified and tried to sue _ never mind that the dresses
looked awful. Fame turned to fad. The show was a mess. Americans
lumped her with artists whose paintings were one-note eye-teasing
stunts. Op enjoyed its 15 minutes as a gimmick hitched to
psychedelia, Carnaby Street and groovy wallpaper before dropping
into oblivion. ``It will take at least 20 years before anyone looks
at my paintings seriously again,'' Riley predicted.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than 30, in America at least. But now abstract art
is accepted in art's inner circles again. The art of the '60s is
being mined, and Riley has become a touchstone to an eclectic
generation that includes Damien Hirst, Diana Thater, Julian Opie
and Rachel Whiteread. Even if they don't relate to her old-style
Modernist ideals for pure abstraction, they can't help
acknowledging her intelligence, style, perseverance and moral
rectitude, which manifests itself in the astringency of her art.
Besides, the work looks great.
</P>
<P>
   The change has been rapid. Two years ago, a modest overview of
her career, in the out-of-the-way Lake District, got raves in the
London papers. Then last year, a London exhibition of her '60s and
'70s pictures at the Serpentine Gallery surprised even her,
attracting 130,000 people, the most ever for a show there, with
lines literally out the door. Now, the Dia Center in New York is
opening a show next month of her pre-1984 work, while the
PaceWildenstein Gallery surveys her work since the early '80s and
presents a group of '60s drawings. At 69, Riley is finally
receiving her long-deserved second look.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has a way of seeming slightly reserved and also looking
very hard at you. Hair cropped and tousled, in shirt and jeans, she
keeps a workingman's appearance: straight, tough, no-nonsense. She
is formidable and charming, with a gritty, jaunty voice.
</P>
<P>
   Her character was focused during childhood. A distant descendant
of Gladstone, she was born in 1931 in London to a family she
describes as ``not badly off but not wealthy, either.'' She spent
the war in a primitive cottage near the coast in Cornwall with her
mother, sister and aunt, a household of women. Her aunt had studied
art. Her mother, the daughter of an English inventor who worked for
Thomas Edison, lived on Park Avenue and made and lost several
fortunes, was ``very visually aware,'' she says. During the war
years, Riley spent hours with her mother and aunt walking the
countryside in Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about different light effects and the intricate
characteristics of trees and water and plants was one way of not
focusing on the anxiety of her father's absence: Riley's father, a
British soldier captured by the Japanese in 1941, survived forced
labor on the Siamese railway but, like many war prisoners, took a
while to readapt to family life. ``He had learned to live in a
self-contained way, to isolate himself from what was around him,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenomena hunting,'' as she has called her intense encounters
with nature, became for her a form of constructive distraction. To
look very closely at a certain thing, after all, means you are also
looking away from something else. This is one way, at least, of
explaining what separates her work from shallow, gimmicky Op and
gives it its intensity. Her abstract patterns, mesmerizing, are
similarly expressions of psychological displacement. Their
eye-riveting quality makes them like self-contained and beneficent
universes, independent from, and overwhelming of, what's around
them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, she enrolled at the Royal College of Art, where she
studied for three frustrating years, getting no guidance from the
old-fashioned faculty, knowing that she wanted to be a painter but
not knowing what kind of painter. She had her first real look at
the London art scene _ small, male, conservative and insular _
which appalled her. Then in 1955, just after she graduated from art
school, her father was nearly killed in a car accident. Her parents
resettled in London, where it was easier for him to get around, in
the Kensington town house that Riley now occupies. Riley helped
nurse her father for a year, and the combined stress of that
commitment and trying to become a painter caused a nervous
breakdown. Briefly hospitalized, she fell into a job at the J.
Walter Thompson ad agency. She was adrift.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1958, she went to a Pollock show in London that, she
says, ``made a very powerful impact on me because it became clear
that modern art was alive and I had something to react to.'' The
next year, she began
</P>
<P>
   an intense relationship with Maurice de Sausmarez, an older
painter and innovative teacher whose deep interests in Klee,
Cezanne and Seurat stimulated her to look harder at them. But it
was the breakup with de Sausmarez that caused the real advance in
her work. As it had with her absent father, art became a way of
dealing with loss. She has cited Proust's remark to the effect that
you find what you love only by first giving it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrongly attached to this person, who knew a lot more than
me, everything that I had experienced with him, which was the
history of art in the 20th century, and childishly I figured when
I'd lost him, I'd lost that,'' she says. ``I decided to paint one
last painting, entirely black. But even then there was a small
voice still in me, which looked at the painting and said: 'This
doesn't express anything. What's wrong?' It had no contrast. So I
put in white. I decided on two black shapes, one with a curve, the
other with a straight line, opposites, nearly touching, but not
touching, the white spaces between them making almost a flash of
light. That was 'Kiss.' It seemed good. And so I told myself,
'O.K., just one more painting.' I was off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss'' led to the early black-and-white Op works, like
``Movement in Squares'' (1961), a flat checkerboard that seems to
collapse or fold into depth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Riley got a serendipitous boost. Still working part
time at the ad agency, she was dodging a downpour on the way home
from the office one day and dashed into a doorway that happened to
be the entrance to an art gallery. The director invited her in,
offered to look at her paintings and soon afterward gave her her
first solo show. It was a huge success. Riley's art was something
English art hadn't produced before: electric, bold abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   That first show was in 1961. Three years later, her fame at its
peak, came the dress fiasco in New York, and Riley retreated to
London. The Dia show is the first museum exhibition in New York
since the Modern's survey, 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Riley's six-story all-white Kensington house, four of the six
stories are studios that Riley uses for different purposes. The
place is clean, efficient, unpretentious. Riley also has houses
with studios in Cornwall and Provence. And she has a studio in Bow
in the East End, a loft, with adjacent apartments she uses for
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's life is her work. She has never married. She has no
children. A few of Riley's latest pictures are here: vividly
colored multipanel paintings of large, swooping, slanting curves
that can bring to mind Matisse's late cutouts. She has worked
constantly over the years, evolving one style out of another, each
style posing problems that the next addresses, not toward some goal
but in a back-and-forth, open-ended way.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'60s she realized that the effects she achieved in
black and white already implied colors, as black and white can do.
From simple patterned stripes in basic colors like red and blue,
she moved to more complex wavy lines in several colors, which she
found overrefined, so she reverted (we're up to the early '80s now)
to stripes. This time, she used a restricted palette influenced by
a trip she made to Egypt, where she was struck by how the ancient
Egyptians, using just a few colors, had conveyed the effect of what
she has called the ``light-mirroring desert.''
</P>
<P>
   The stripes gave way a second time to a more complicated
arrangement, this time of verticals and diagonals or stripes and
parallelograms. These yielded a few years ago to the recent works,
still based on the underlying architecture of the stripes and
diagonals but now resulting in curvaceous, shimmering but less
dizzying planes of interlocking colors.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has always hated when people say her works are hard on the
eyes or create optical illusions, because that's not her point, and
because it implies that they're just tricks _ once seen, no longer
interesting. As she has said, ``Illusion used in that sense is a
kind of cheat or deceit.'' But even so, her art can be tough to
look at at first. Then the eye adjusts. Space gradually opens up.
With a classic stripe painting like ``Apres-Midi'' (1981), the
stripes seem magically to unfold, like an accordion, into depth.
Black stripes anchor an illusory middle ground, breaking up the
image, which a viewer reads instinctively from left to right, at
irregular intervals. The effect is syncopated. No wonder Riley
relates her art to music.
</P>
<P>
   The best works have an intense formal density and logic. This is
about as good as traditional abstract painting gets these days. The
two most obvious qualities of Riley's art, like her life, are
control and self-denial.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '60s, assistants have carried out her pictures
based on her preparatory drawings or, in recent years, on the works
she has pasted together with colored papers on penciled grids. This
is an updated version of the way artists have run their studios for
centuries, notwithstanding that her secondhand approach is now
being called postmodern, something she finds equally amusing and
strange.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't quite true that Riley dropped off the map after Op went
the way of the Hula-Hoop. America, nationalistically myopic, mostly
stopped paying attention, but a steady clientele in Europe and
Japan, and a few loyal Americans, bought everything she was willing
to sell through the mid-'70s. She remained a formidable presence in
English art. In 1968, she was the first woman to win the painting
prize at the Venice Biennale, where she represented Great Britain,
a huge honor at the time. Still, it was becoming more difficult for
her as the years went by. She was never a joiner. The so-called
London School of figurative painters, men like Bacon, Freud and
R.B. Kitaj, was becoming increasingly identified internationally
with contemporary English art.
</P>
<P>
   She never wanted to be known as a female artist. She was an
abstract painter, that was it, and only reluctantly has she come to
accept that a younger generation of women, many of whom aren't
abstract painters, embrace her for being a woman who stuck to her
guns and stood toe to toe with the boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I was protected by being a woman,'' she
acknowledges. ``I was granted independence, freedom, and I didn't
have to get involved in the ambitions and problems that involved
other artists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, you could buy a classic '60s Riley drawing at
Christie's East in New York for $1,500 and a '60s painting for
$20,000. Now the comparative prices are up to $30,000 and $400,000.
The funny thing about Riley's up-and-down status is that it has
always involved some degree of misunderstanding. In the '60s, it
was that she had to do with Jean Shrimpton and Op underwear. Now,
it's postfeminism, postmodernism and '60s retro chic.
</P>
<P>
   When the new Tate Modern opened in the spring, it devoted a room
to Riley, another clear sign of changed times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion always plays a part in the art world, but when it gets
the upper hand it spells a vacuum,'' she says. ``During the periods
of neglect, I was free to work without interruptions or
distractions. I have never wanted celebrity, but I do want
recognition, fair and just, not praise. I believe the work will
communicate. We'll see. I am getting older.''

 By JOHN TIERNEY  
 c.2000 John Tierney  
 From The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Sorlien, a lean, sunburned fisherman in rubber overalls,
was loading his boat along the wharf at Point Judith, R.I., not far
from the spot where the ``Tuna Capital of the World'' sign stood
three decades ago. Back then, you could harpoon giant bluefins
right outside the harbor. Today, you would have a hard time finding
one within 20 miles. Since the early 1970s, the tuna have declined
_ along with cod, swordfish, halibut and so many other species in
the ruined fisheries of the Northeast. Sorlien, like the other
fishermen in this harbor just west of Newport, is surviving thanks
to New England's great cash crop, lobsters, but he wonders how much
longer they'll be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, my only incentive is to go out and kill as many
fish as I can,'' Sorlien said. ``I have no incentive to conserve
the fishery, because any fish I leave is just going to be picked by
the next guy.'' Like the men who wiped out the buffaloes on the
Great Plains in the 19th century, Sorlien is a hunter-gatherer who
has become too lethal for his range. He is what's known in the
business as a highliner _ a fisherman who comes back with big hauls
_ but every season the competition gets tougher.
</P>
<P>
   When he got started 16 years ago, at the age of 22, he used a
small boat and set traps within three miles of shore. These days,
he doesn't even bother looking in those waters, which fishermen now
refer to as ``on the beach.'' He has graduated to a 42-foot boat
and often goes 70 miles out to sea for lobsters, which can mean
leaving the dock at midnight and not returning until 10 the
following night. Each year, he has had to go farther and haul more
traps just to stay even.
</P>
<P>
   Solien was starting the season on this May morning by loading
hundreds of the traps onto his boat, the Cindy Diane. The
four-foot-long steel cages, each baited with a dangling skate fish,
would spend the next eight months at sea. Sorlien would be tending
800 of them in all. On a typical day, he would haul 300, sometimes
400, up from the ocean floor to remove lobsters and insert fresh
bait. As he stacked one 40-pound trap after another on deck, it was
easy to see why he and so many other lobstermen have back problems.
``My chiropractor says he can always tell when it's lobster
season,'' Sorlien said.
</P>
<P>
   The chiropractor is treating the consequence of what fishery
scientists call ``effort creep.'' Over the years, as Sorlien got a
bigger boat and gradually doubled the number of his traps in the
water, other lobstermen were doing the same. It was an arms race
with no winners and some definite losers: the lobsters. Their life
expectancy plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lobsters used to live for 50 or 75 years,'' recalled Robert
Smith, who has been lobstering at Point Judith since 1948. ``When I
started, it was not unusual to get a 30-pound lobster. It's been 20
years since I got one that was even 20 pounds.'' Last year, the
biggest one he caught was four pounds, and that was an anomaly.
Most lobsters don't even make it to two pounds. Biologists estimate
that 90 percent of lobsters are caught within a year after they
reach the legal minimum size at about age 6.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious remedy would be to restrict the amount of fishing
going on, as lobstermen have traditionally done in some
communities. They have created informal local groups _ called
harbor gangs by anthropologists _ in which they divvy up the nearby
seabed, determining who can fish where, how long the season will be
and how many traps each man can use.
</P>
<P>
   The harbor gangs are built around the management principles of
Tony Soprano. If a fishing trawler drags a net through their
waters, destroying their traps, the lobstermen may dump an old car
onto the seabed, which will rip the trawler's net the next time
it's dragged. If an outside lobsterman intrudes, he might find that
someone has removed his lobsters and left the traps conspicuously
open or maybe applied a chain saw to the steel cages. If he doesn't
take the hint, his boat might be burned or sunk.
</P>
<P>
   But the tactics generally work only in waters close to the
gang's home. The open ocean is harder to defend. Most stretches of
open ocean are governed by state and federal governments, which is
why the fish are in so much trouble. Tuna do not vote. Lobsters do
not make campaign contributions. There may be future benefits from
limiting this year's catch, but politicians don't want the fishing
industry to suffer while they're up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Even when fish populations start to decline, officials are
reluctant to impose strict limits. Instead, they have often tried
to help struggling fishermen with subsidies, which merely encourage
more overfishing. The Canadian and American governments devastated
one of the world's most productive fisheries, the Georges Banks off
the coast of New England, by helping to pay for bigger boats. Now,
even as scientists urge limits on lobstering, state and federal
governments continue to offer tax breaks and other incentives to
the lobstermen at Point Judith.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Allen, a member of the Rhode Island Lobsterman's
Association, has been lobstering for nearly 30 years and preaching
reform for a decade. He journeyed to a port in Australia and
returned with stories of a place with thriving lobsters, plenty of
fat tuna, lots of prosperous fishermen _ and no Soprano strong-arm
tactics. It sounded like the maritime version of the Happy Hunting
Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing has been very good to Port Lincoln, a little fishing
town on a remote peninsula of Australia's southern coast. The
fishermen have gleaming $600,000 boats in a pristine private marina
flanked by new white stucco town houses. Compared with the decaying
public wharfs in Point Judith, Port Lincoln feels like Palm Beach.
The town's 13,000 inhabitants are said to include the highest
number of millionaires per capita in the southern hemisphere. That,
at least, is a factoid you keep hearing there.
</P>
<P>
   Lobstering is an excellent job here thanks to a system of quotas
that was pioneered in Australia and New Zealand. It is basically a
version of the New England harbor gangs, run by the lobstermen
under government supervision. The government started it in the
1960s by setting a limit on the total number of traps used by the
fleet in Port Lincoln. Licenses for those traps were assigned to
the working fishermen, and from then on, any newcomer who wanted to
set a trap in those waters had to buy a license from someone
already in the business. It's like New York's taxicab system, which
has a fixed number of taxi licenses or ``medallions'': A newcomer
who wants to own a cab must buy a medallion from someone who is
retiring. One lobsterman, Daryl Spencer, bought his first trap
licenses in 1984 for $2,000 apiece in Australian dollars. Nowadays,
they would sell for $35,000, which means that Spencer's are worth a
total of $2.1 million, or about $1.2 million in American dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians are not any more altruistic than the Rhode
Islanders _ they too have mortgages to pay _ and in the old days
they used to howl when anyone suggested reducing their catch. But
they began taking the long view as soon as they saw the rising
price of their licenses for their lobster pots, as they call the
traps. Like any property owner, they began thinking about resale
value. ``Why hurt the fishery?'' Spencer said. ``It's my retirement
fund. No one's going to pay me $35,000 a pot if there are no
lobsters left. If I rape and pillage the fishery now, in 10 years
my licenses won't be worth anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides building up nest eggs, Port Lincoln's lobstermen have
made their own jobs easier. While Rhode Island lobstermen are
sometimes on the water 240 days per year, the Australians are not
allowed to work more than 187 days of their 211-day season. And
their days are a lot easier on the back, as a young lobsterman,
Hubert Hurrell, demonstrated one March morning in his appropriately
named boat, Fine Time.
</P>
<P>
   Hurrell and I left the dock at 7:30 a.m. and sped out to his
traps in barely an hour, cruising at 22 knots in his 60-foot boat.
The wheelhouse and staterooms had the space and amenities you
expect to find on yachts, not lobster boats. There was a television
and VCR, a video-game player and a wraparound console with six
screens showing data from computers, instruments and satellites.
Hurrell shook his head and winced when he heard about the 800 traps
tended by the typical lobsterman in Rhode Island. In Port Lincoln,
the lobstermen have limited themselves to 60 traps each. It took
Hurrell and his deckhand just an hour to raise their 60 traps and
to extract an assortment of lobsters, including some hefty
long-lived ones. After a leisurely lunch, they dropped the traps
back into the water and were back on shore by 3. It was not quite
an eight-hour day, and Hurrell was satisfied with the financial
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``No worries, mate,'' he said, which was not a bad summary of
the prevailing view among the scientists who study the lobsters.
``Fishing may be the only economic activity in which you can make
more money by doing less work,'' said Rick McGarvey, a biologist
who monitors the fishery for the South Australian government. ``By
fishing less, the fishermen leave more lobsters out there to
produce more eggs, which will make it easier for them to catch
lobsters in the future. It's a win-win for the fish and the
fishermen. The lobsters are thriving and the fishermen are spending
more time at home with their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The system also makes McGarvey's job easier because he is spared
the controversies that American scientists endure when they try to
protect a fishery. In New England, a proposed conservation measure
typically inspires a decade of battling that leads, at best, to an
ineffectual compromise. In South Australia, the lobstermen act
quickly to prevent overfishing, sometimes imposing stricter limits
than the ones suggested by scientists. ``We don't have to fight
with the lobstermen,'' McGarvey said. ``The old philosophy of
fishery scientists was, 'We're philosopher kings and the fishermen
are children who don't know what's good for themselves or the fish,
so we have to impose regulations.' Now we just tell them what our
research shows about the fishery, and they do a great job of
regulating themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have documented similar success stories around
the world, including many from traditional societies that have used
property rights to protect the environment. In the South Pacific,
where coral reefs have been destroyed by fishermen using dynamite
and cyanide, the best-preserved reefs are the ones controlled by
local villagers and closed off to outsiders. Japanese fishing
villages have long prevented overfishing in local waters by using
versions of harbor gangs. Louisiana's privately leased oyster beds
are much healthier than the public ones in Mississippi. These
results have won over most academic experts on fisheries. Last
year, Australian-style quotas were endorsed in a report to Congress
by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of
Sciences. Property rights enable fishermen to avoid what ecologists
call the tragedy of the commons: the destruction of a common
resource because it is open to all. Just as the closely tended
herds of cattle thrived on the same plains where the buffaloes
perished, fish stand a better chance of surviving if they belong to
someone instead of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But there are, of course, a few political problems in persuading
hunter-gatherers to become homesteaders. The biggest is how to
divide up the range. Do you allocate the quotas and licenses
equally among all working fishermen or according to how many fish
each has been catching ? Do you calculate each one's catch by
considering the past year or the past 10 years? Do locals get first
dibs on fishing rights?
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the U.S. government successfully introduced
Australia-style quotas in a few fisheries. But then Alaska's
politicians got worried that fishermen from Seattle would end up
with most of the quotas in their waters, so in 1996 they persuaded
Congress to declare a national moratorium on any new quotas. The
moratorium could end soon, which gives hope to Richard Allen, the
Rhode Island lobsterman who has been preaching the Port Lincoln
gospel. ``Most people start with the feeling that the ocean should
be open to anyone who wants to fish,'' Allen said. ``They complain
that it's unfair to lock anyone out of the fishery. My answer is
that with the current system, we already have fisheries that we're
all locked out of. I can't go out and fish for halibut or swordfish
_ there aren't any left. I would rather have a healthy fish stock
and the option to buy access to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen has been gradually winning converts on the wharfs in Point
Judith, but it hasn't been easy. ``We're our own worst enemy,''
Sorlien said. ``We're like the cattlemen in the range wars who shot
at each other because they were claiming the right to the same
property. Somewhere along the line, they figured out it made more
sense to divide up the land and set up a system of property rights.
That's the rational solution for us, but we can't bring ourselves
to go through the pain of allocating each person a share. We're so
far away from being South Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine that _ just 60 traps,'' Sorlien said. He had been
working for six hours, since 5:30 a.m., and the workday wasn't even
half over. ``You'd be done for the day now. You could be home
counting your money, and you wouldn't have to worry about where the
next lobster was coming from.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are various ways to meet celebrities in this media age,
many of them involving publicists looking at their watches and
saying that the Musician or the Actor has been unavoidably delayed.
So it is a little surprising to be greeted promptly at the airport
in Cleveland (Cleveland itself being a departure from standard
practice) by the slight, smiling figure of the jazz singer Jimmy
Scott. He is holding up a cardboard sign with my last name inked in
as if he is an especially cheerful limo driver charged with taking
me to see somebody really important. ``Hey, baby,'' he greets me,
``how was the trip?''
</P>
<P>
   Given that Scott's first and only bona fide hit, the ballad
``Everybody's Somebody's Fool,'' was recorded in 1950, you wouldn't
expect him to be overburdened with the trappings of success. Still,
ever since a quartet of albums in the '90s, Scott has held a
special fascination for music cognoscenti and show-business
notables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Scott is the only singer who makes me cry,'' says
Madonna, who gave him a cameo spot in one of her videos. Lou Reed
had Scott sing backup vocals on a track from his 1991 ``Magic and
Loss'' album. He may well have put the Scott genuflection
competition out of reach: ``It's like seeing Hamlet or Macbeth all
rolled up into a song.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lou Reeds and Madonnas of this world are presumably
attracted to Scott because he remains, in spite of their pro bono
publicity, perhaps the most unjustly ignored American singer of the
20th century. But the appeal of the man David Lynch featured in the
final episode of ``Twin Peaks'' is also about something else. At
worst, Scott's newer fans are drawn to a superficial freakishness,
the voice that is pitched well up in the conventionally female
range and the hairless face, for decades perpetually boyish, that
in recent years has taken on the noble, withered aspect of a
tortoise. At best, one could imagine certain show-business types,
aware of the smoke and mirrors that go into their own
celebrityhood, simply wanting to be in the presence of the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The humble limo driver guise notwithstanding, these are
thrilling make-or-break days in the career of James Victor Scott,
now 75. If in the '90s he went from presumed-dead status to musical
cult figure and celebrity pet, at the millennium he has a shot at
becoming, well, who knows, something more. The most compelling
evidence of a Scott renaissance is ``Mood Indigo,'' released in
May, a collection of ballad standards that finds the singer in his
best voice of recent vintage and in the company of worthy
supporting musicians like the alto saxophonist Hank Crawford and
the pianist Cyrus Chestnut.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, Scott, for perhaps the first time in his
long, harum-scarum career, has empathetic and competent management
behind him, as well as an enthusiastic, if modest-sized, new record
label in Milestone. Todd Barkan, a respected jazz producer, has
worked his longtime connections in the Japanese jazz world to help
create for Scott a nascent Far Eastern stardom _ steady touring
punctuated by regular standing ovations. Having just finished a
sold-out engagement at Birdland in Manhattan earlier this month,
it's clear the singer is on a roll at home as well.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Scott doesn't just play the part of a limo
driver; he also comes armed with a real limo, his boatlike 1992
Lincoln Town Car. Scott's license has lapsed, so he hands over the
keys to his younger brother, Kenny, a retired factory worker whom
the singer recently put on the payroll as his right-hand man. Kenny
and I take the front seat; Jimmy prefers the back, where he can
keep up a steady conversational patter and dandle Princess, a
2-year-old pug with bulging black eyes. ``She's the lady of the
house,'' Scott says. A veteran of four failed, turbulent marriages,
Scott these days reserves his most effusive attentions for
Princess. ``She likes the music on the radio. She gets so
comforted.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Scott speaks, unstoppably, in a high-pitched voice,
roughened and phlegmy after a lifetime of smoking and drinking,
with none of, for instance, Michael Jackson's girlish lilt. It's a
hip voice, a match for the singer's 1960-vintage street-cat rap.
Almost everyone is ``baby'' to his face, usually ``hey, baby.''
Someone not present is customarily referred to as ``a hip little
cat.'' That lingo mixes effortlessly with his core vocabulary of
show-biz abstractions: ``expressions'' (his East Coast working band
is named the Jazz Expressions), ``dramatics,'' ``stylings'' and
``flair.'' A typical Jimmy Scott pronouncement will run something
like this: ``Yeah, baby, Cleveland used to be a hip little town for
the jazz expression but then that rock 'n' roll flair came in. You
dig?''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's uniqueness goes well beyond his redoubtable verbal
flair. From birth, Scott was marked as ineluctably different,
afflicted with a hormonal disorder, Kallmann's syndrome, that
interferes with normal sexual maturation. In Scott's case, it gave
him that boy's alto voice, which is, of course, what made him Jimmy
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I learned that it was a gift,'' he says after a pause,
``that I was able to sing this way.'' Not that he always embraced
it. He was in his 30s before he gave up hope that his range would
drop, not so preposterous when you consider that Scott was then
still routinely being mistaken for a teenager. ``Many times,'' he
says with a laugh, ``I'd think, I'd love to try this in a lower
register ... but then after a while you think, Sing with what you
got.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been enough. Over the years, Scott has invented his own
deeply theatrical brand of American art song, the connection to his
own emotional pain so palpable that the lachrymose standards in his
repertory (``Why Was I Born?'' ``Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless
Child,'' ``When Did You Leave Heaven'') sound like episodes in an
autobiographical melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the male voice in the higher registers has always
exerted its own special pull. Think of the all-boy choirs, of Irish
tenors and, disconcertingly, of the castrati in the 16th through
18th centuries in Italy. Jimmy Scott is, vocally, a natural
castrato. In the 1960s, at the height of his vocal powers, Scott
possessed what was arguably the most ravishing, penetrating and
powerful vocal instrument in American popular music. In every other
respect, Kallmann's syndrome was an unqualified drag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even today,'' Scott says, ``cats in the grocery store say,
'Miss, what do you want?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For Scott, gender or sexual ambiguity is what's in other
people's minds. He's a heterosexual male; he's pretty clear about
that. But whether he likes it or not, Scott's sound and his look
strike the gender notes in between the piano keys, the discordantly
interesting ones.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Scott began his career in the early '40s as a teen-age
singing prodigy from the Cleveland ghetto. Soon enough, he was
snapped up by Estelle Young, a shake dancer and contortionist, who
led her troupe through the second-tier clubs and theaters of the
African-American Midwest, a training circuit of sorts for more
prestigious ``chitlin' circuit'' venues like the Apollo Theater.
</P>
<P>
   He moved on to the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and then won a
contract with Savoy, but was never able to break beyond his core
audience in the black community who caught his act in the little
clubs. By 1962, then in his late 30s, he had broken with Savoy and
was adrift in the business. Ray Charles, always a passionate fan,
signed him to his new Tangerine label. The record that Charles
produced and played piano on, ``Falling in Love Is Wonderful,'' is
by critical accord Scott's finest, but it stayed on the shelves
only a matter of weeks before Herman Lubinsky, the owner of Savoy,
claimed an exclusive contract with Scott, and the record was
pulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put that Tangerine record on,'' recalls the record
producer Joel Dorn, then a Philadelphia D.J., ``the phones just lit
up. Everybody was asking, 'What's her name?''' (``Falling in Love
Is Wonderful'' has never been rereleased; LPs from the original
pressing are among the most sought-after, and expensive, on the
jazz collector's market.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Dorn, by now a successful producer at Atlantic, teamed
up with Scott to make ``The Source,'' his first album since
``Falling in Love Is Wonderful,'' but Lubinsky moved in again, and
the album never went beyond a first pressing.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle proved too much for Scott, and in the early '70s he
packed in the singing career and returned to Cleveland. Over the
next 13 years, he worked as an aide at a nursing home and as a
shipping clerk at the Cleveland Sheraton. ``When the gig ain't
there, you still got to pay the rent,'' Scott says with an
unembarrassed smile. ``I learned that a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's comeback began in 1984 when a friend from his East Coast
days, Earlene Rogers, called up the jazz station WBGO in Newark,
N.J., to ask why Scott, an ex-local hero, was never on the radio.
They told her he was dead. Persuaded otherwise, the station invited
him to appear on an afternoon talk show, an experience that so
energized Scott that he moved back to Newark, wound up making
Rogers wife No. 4 and resumed his career full time. But he was, in
the main, singing in the same joints and dives that had demoralized
him the first time around. One of his closest friends, the eminent
songwriter Doc Pomus, even published an open letter in Billboard
beseeching the industry to take note of Scott before it was too
late.
</P>
<P>
   It would take Pomus's death in 1991 to turn things around. Scott
sang at the funeral, overwhelming Seymour Stein, the legendarily
tough record executive, which led to the album ``All the Way.''
Scott remembers: ``The next day, this cat from Warners comes over
with a contract. It was like Doc's hand reaching out from the
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's compact living room is dominated by a white piano
(ornamental _ he doesn't play) and a large white teddy bear. It
makes for an interesting place to talk about the death of his
mother, the original source of the seemingly bottomless well of
pain he draws on in his work. Scott was 13 when she stepped into a
Cleveland street to pull her daughter Shirley out of harm's way.
Justine Scott, mother of 10, was struck by a car and died of
internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's adolescence was marked not only by the overwhelming
thing that did happen, his mother's death, but also by the one that
didn't, puberty. When he was young, shame and secrecy were constant
companions. (He is capable of sex, incapable of reproduction.)
Today he deals with the syndrome with admirable, even surprising
candor. His attitude with women is this: ``I'm not looking for
sympathy. This is me. I come to you honestly and fairly, and if
there's anything you want to know about me, I'm here to explain it.
And if we have a relationship, then we have a relationship. If we
don't, then yes ma'am, howdy.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Jimmy Scott has the energy of youth without its
distracting, in his case even disastrous, passions. He is locked in
on the career. ``He is mentally prepared for this now,'' says
Maxine Harvard, Scott's new manager and a jazz industry veteran.
Hardly a disinterested party, Harvard is nonetheless blunt in her
assessment of Scott's moment on the verge. ``I have told him that
if I see him self-destructing with drinks or anything else, then
I'm gone,'' she says. ``There are probably five years there.'' For
his part, Scott indicates he's ready to do what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps his time has finally come. In the '60s, the
corporate labels were so leery of Scott's unusualness that they
replaced him on the album covers of ``The Source'' and ``Falling in
Love Is Wonderful'' with a pretty young woman and an amorous
couple, respectively. In the '90s, a decade infatuated with sexual
ambiguity, Scott's aging androgyny undoubtedly helped him secure
his cult status, but also threatened to keep him there. Mainstream
America has embraced some pretty odd characters (see Liberace), but
Scott has the inconvenience of being a real artist with fewer
obvious pleasures in his arsenal. With age, the voice has shed much
of its prettiness _ the tone is thinner, the vibrato can sound a
little cracked. Listening to his reprise of ``Day by Day,'' on
``Mood Indigo,'' anyone who recalls his near operatic original from
``The Source'' can be filled only with a sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the time that loss is more than compensated for by
the smoke-cured timbre of his voice, by a phrasing so idiosyncratic
as to become a private language. No one sings slower or farther
behind the beat than Jimmy Scott; his long, melismatic flights
freeze conventional time.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, his performances have been magnets for
the socially dispossessed _ pimps, prostitutes, gays. Sometimes the
scene had a farcical aspect: ``These old pimps used to tell me,
'Well, I'm coming in tonight, Jimmy Scott, with four women, and you
better sing that song.''' But Scott could relate all too well to an
underlying loneliness at the social margins. ``You can understand
that from the songs I sing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Now, perhaps, that loneliness can be appreciated by a new
generation.

 From The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a balmy night in Albuquerque, 80 homeowners shuffle into the
cafeteria at Whittier Elementary School to listen to New Mexico's
governor, Gary Johnson, a lithe, boyish figure in a checked blazer
and clashing patterned tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made you all a pledge that I was going to put the issues
that should be on the front burner on the front burner, regardless
of the consequences,'' he says. ``Half of what we spend on law
enforcement, half of what we spend on the courts and half of what
we spend on the prisons is drug-related. Our current policies on
drugs are perhaps the biggest problem that this country has.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone tells kids not to do drugs, Johnson says. Despite this
chorus, nearly 80 million Americans have tried them, including more
than half of this year's graduating high school class. No one
condones this, he adds, but do we really want our kids to be
branded ``criminals'' for having experimented with drugs? If
they're not driving or stealing while high, where is the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson looks down at his cheat sheet; he's an unpolished if
ardent speaker. Last year, he points out, 450,000 people died from
smoking cigarettes. Alcohol killed 150,000, and another 100,000
died from legal prescription drugs. How many people died last year
from the use of marijuana? Few, if any. From cocaine and heroin?
Five thousand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet we are arresting 1.5 million people a year in this country
on drug-related crime,'' Johnson says, his voice rising. ``Half of
those arrests are for marijuana, and half those arrested are
Hispanics. Tell me that half the users of marijuana in the United
States of America are Hispanic! I don't think so.'' We're locking
up nonviolent people senselessly, he tells the mostly white
audience, his blue eyes and neck veins bulging. ``We ought to
legalize marijuana. We need to stop 'getting tough' with drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe this is a Republican governor. People say
they want politicians who will give it to them straight. Well, this
is what straight must sound like. Yet people look dubious. ``If
everyone were like Gary Johnson and a triathlete, it would be
fine,'' one man tells me. They'd have the fortitude to steer clear
of legally available dope. ``But they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   That's putting it mildly. Johnson, 47, regularly finishes near
the top of his age group in Ironman competitions, which combine a
2.4 mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a marathon. He once ran 100
miles in 30 consecutive hours in the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   And these are just his physical feats. Johnson is manic about
being on time. He sets 10 or so goals each year and writes them on
the back of a business card; this year, the list includes learning
yoga (he's in a class each Wednesday after work), reading a book a
month and having one ``adventure'' each week.
</P>
<P>
   So how did a hokey role model like Johnson come to be viewed by
the drug policy establishment as a threat to the nation's youth? By
acting like the uncompromising heroes in the Ayn Rand novels he
admires. Last summer, a few months into his second and
(constitutionally mandated) final term, Johnson told state GOP
leaders that he was determined to make the most of his bully pulpit
while he had it. Days later, without having thought it all through
(he says now), Johnson told reporters that he would support
legalizing marijuana and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Into the Spotlight &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ka-boom! The White House drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, flew
in to condemn him. Ed Bradley came down to do a segment for ''60
Minutes.'' Johnson became the toast of the libertarian Cato
Institute and Rolling Stone magazine, on his way to a starring role
at the recently convened ``shadow conventions.'' Meanwhile, his
chief law-enforcement official quit in protest, a local sheriff
called him an ``idiot'' and his approval rating sank from 54
percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people surrounding him wish he would stop,'' says
Darren White, the top cop who quit Johnson's cabinet. ``But this is
vintage Gary Johnson.'' Meaning pigheaded or principled, depending
on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has vetoed a record-shattering 578 bills during his
tenure, producing the state's worst gridlock _ and lowest spending
increases _ in decades.
</P>
<P>
   All of which means that Johnson, the highest-ranking official
ever to call for partial drug legalization, may have just the
temperament to force an overdue debate. Can a fitness addict who's
an improbable mix of Howard Roarke, Tony Robbins and Stephen Covey
break America's $40-billion-a-year drug-war habit?
</P>
<P>
   It is 5 a.m. in Santa Fe the morning after his elementary school
talk. I've come along for his notorious morning workout. We're
running 11 miles up a mountain in the dark. I'm gasping for air
after 10 minutes. By the 25-minute mark, he has circled back four
times to urge me on. I finally persuade him to go on alone; he'll
catch me on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has a point system for his workouts _ one point each for
a running mile, a quarter-mile swim, three miles of biking or 10
minutes of weight lifting. Johnson racks up 77 points a week. (It's
one of his goals.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hasn't always been this driven. His father was a public
school teacher; his mother worked at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
A middling student, Johnson never thought about going anywhere but
the University of New Mexico. That's where the pot he started
smoking in high school became something of a lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The governor talks about those days with remarkable candor. He
didn't just ``experiment'' with marijuana, the invariable
confession of boomer politicians. Johnson told me he was high two
to three times a week between his senior year of high school and a
year after college, when he decided it was a ``handicap'' and
stopped. He also tried cocaine twice. ``Whoa!'' Johnson remembers
feeling. ``I understand why people do it. This is
UN-be-LIEV-able.'' And therefore too dangerous to continue, he
reckoned.
</P>
<P>
   Having put himself through school with a string of construction
jobs, Johnson began his own handyman and remodeling business. His
break came a decade later, when his company got a hefty chunk of a
huge Intel plant expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal swiftly took Johnson's revenues from $1.5 million to
$38 million, sparking a classic small-business crisis. Endless days
spent chasing receivables to meet his firm's swelling payroll drove
him to the brink. ``I felt like I understood suicide,'' he recalls.
To cope, he took a night course in time management in 1987. It made
him reassess everything.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Turning Point &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized, looking back over my life,'' he says, ``that when
I was fit everything seemed to work.'' He gave up liquor, ramped up
his fitness program and began writing down goals.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, at age 40, the now-prosperous Johnson told friends he
was ready to run for the U.S. Senate. But the incumbents looked
entrenched, so he decided he would become governor. Republican
elders were amused. They told him a likable young businessman could
have a big future if he started with the state legislature. Johnson
thanked them for their advice, plunked down half a million dollars
(serious money in New Mexico politics) to win the GOP primary and
rode Newt Gingrich's coattails into the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   I ask Johnson about his political philosophy. He says he is not
a true libertarian, because he thinks government often has a role.
But he will never qualify as a ``compassionate conservative.''
After six years of his stewardship, New Mexico remains among the
nation's poorest states, with one of the highest levels of
uninsured citizens. Shouldn't government do more on health
coverage? Johnson dismisses the problem, saying that many folks
don't want insurance and that with emergency rooms, nobody really
goes without.
</P>
<P>
   What about help for the working poor in an age when unskilled
folks are losing ground? ``I don't buy into that,'' Johnson snaps.
``Anybody that wants to be an entrepreneur in this country can make
an absolute fortune.'' Even somebody who cleans houses, he says.
</P>
<P>
   How's that? I ask, huffing behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I started a business tomorrow just cleaning houses by
myself,'' he says, ``I think I could make $100,000 a year. You
clean four houses at $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what these people do when they come in and clean. In
three hours I could do what they do. I just don't buy into the
notion that anybody can't still make it today if they are willing
to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paradoxical Approach &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's empathy gap highlights a paradox in his approach to
drugs. His fierce belief in personal responsibility is what
convinced him that the drug war is a waste of money; if you're
spending $40 billion and the drugs keep coming in, he figured, why
not just legalize the stuff and work on people so they don't get
hooked? Yet he has vetoed millions for drug treatment partly
because he seems to feel people should be able to straighten
themselves out by an act of willpower, just as he did. As a result,
he has alienated natural allies in the public health community in a
state that boasts the county with the highest death rate from
heroin overdoses in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, government at all levels spent less than $5 billion on
drug control and incarcerated about 50,000 Americans for nonviolent
drug offenses; today, it spends some $40 billion and jails more
than 450,000 (more than Europe, with a larger population, jails for
everything). Blacks make up 17 percent of cocaine users but also 88
percent of those convicted on crack cocaine charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson isn't the first official to say there's something
wrong with this picture, but a crusade by a sitting Republican
governor marks a new high point for dissent. For years,
conservative intellectuals like Milton Friedman and William F.
Buckley Jr. have made a libertarian case for legalization. But both
political parties found prison-building, ``tough'' sentencing laws
and calls to ``Just Say No'' politically irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1988, Kurt Schmoke, the black mayor of Baltimore and a
rising Democratic star, stunned the U.S. Conference of Mayors by
saying the drug war was doing more harm than good. All options,
decriminalization included, he said, should be considered.
Schmoke's stand landed him on the front page of newspapers around
the country. When he was re-elected twice afterward, it proved that
a black, big-city mayor, at least, could buck the bromides and
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The year since Johnson glibly floated the notion of providing
heroin legally by prescription has seen the taming of governor. He
now seeks legalization for marijuana only and promotes ``harm
reduction'' strategies for other drugs, a policy associated with
reformers like Ethan Nadelmann of the George Soros-backed
Lindesmith Center. These analysts view drugs as a public health
problem, not a criminal one, and back broad programs for needle
exchange and methadone maintenance. They also criticize ``mandatory
minimum'' sentences that can leave nonviolent drug offenders in
jail longer than rapists or burglars.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, who has himself fought to fix unfair sentencing laws,
nonetheless views much of the harm-reduction agenda as a ploy to
pave the way toward full legalization. Johnson's efforts, he tells
me sharply, are ``irresponsible,'' ``misguided'' and ``anathema to
America's parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but back at Whittier Elementary School, at least, a
lot of parents see it differently. A Vietnam veteran, an elderly
man in a red baseball jacket and a 40-ish professional type rise
one after another to say they don't usually agree with Johnson but
admire his courage in raising this issue. There's assent and
applause from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says that a number of governors have told him privately
they respect what he's doing; they also say their careers would be
over if they tried it. But the issue is gaining steam. A California
ballot initiative this November would divert nonviolent first-time
drug offenders to treatment; New York's chief judge recently
introduced a similar system administratively. Johnson, meanwhile,
has his first-ever bipartisan task force coming back in December
with a slate of reforms in drug policy, which he says could even
include pardons for nonviolent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is determined to get something done. He has been at it
only a year, and he has two and a half more to go before he leaves
office. After that, as everyone in the state seems to know,
Johnson's only firm plan is to climb Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing this, Raymond Sanchez, the speaker of New Mexico's
House of Representatives, hunts down his copy of ``Into Thin Air,''
Jon Krakauer's best seller about the 1996 Everest disaster, and
cites this passage to sum up what you need to know about Gary
Johnson: ``Any person who would seriously consider'' climbing
Everest, Krakauer writes, ``is almost by definition beyond the sway
of reasoned argument.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King is addicted to writing. It isn't a matter of liking
to write or even loving it. He needs it, chemically, the way years
ago he needed his cocaine and his beer, sometimes a case a day.
``Writing is just this great big conduit, this outflow pipe that
keeps the pressure nice and even,'' he says. ``It just pours all
this (expletive) out. All the insecurities come out, all the fears
_ and also, it's a great way to pass the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he hadn't been able to make a career of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd be dead. I would have drunk myself to death or drugged
myself to death or committed suicide or some goddamn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, he almost died anyway. He and his family were
staying at their lake house in western Maine. It was late afternoon
and King was finishing up his daily four-mile walk. As usual, he
was carrying a book. Although he often reads while walking _ on
dirt roads, for instance, or down Broadway while visiting New York
_ he was not reading at the moment, for this stretch took him up a
steep hill alongside a small highway.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a blue Dodge minivan crested the hill and pinballed
King off its windshield. He came down in a clump. His head was
bleeding, his lap seemed to be turned sideways and he saw that a
bone in his right leg was pointing in the wrong direction, skyward,
bulging out of his jeans. A short while later, one of his lungs
collapsed. This was all happening in a blur, literally, for King's
eyeglasses were missing. They had somehow landed on the front seat
of the minivan. They would help convince Bryan Smith, the man
driving the van, that he had hit a person and not, as he first
thought, ``a small deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, after King knew he would survive but before he
knew if he would walk again, he resumed writing. His wife, Tabitha,
who is his rock and his redeemer, set him up at a makeshift desk in
the back hallway of their Victorian sprawl in Bangor. It reminded
him of the laundry room in their old trailer, where he wrote
``Carrie,'' back when he washed motel sheets for a living and she
sold Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sat in a wheelchair, propped up by foam cushions,
brimming with pain and painkillers. Besides the fractured hip,
mangled leg, collapsed lung and lacerated scalp, he had four broken
ribs and a chipped spine, and he had lost 50 pounds. He didn't feel
like working, but a voice in his head _ yes, Stephen King, like his
characters, hears voices _ told him to.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an opposite of writer's block, King has it. As a
teen-ager, he would come home from a Roger Corman movie, write a
novelization in two days, mimeograph a few dozen copies and sell
them at school for a quarter each. By the time he was a college
sophomore, he had five finished novels in a drawer. Last month, his
hyperproductivity paid off yet again. Reaching into another drawer,
he pulled out a novel called ``The Plant'' and did something with
it that made worldwide headlines: he published it himself.
</P>
<P>
   A few months earlier, he became the prince of e-publishing by
releasing, through Scribner, an Internet-only novella. Its success
tickled him, and made him yearn for an even closer-to-home
publishing experience. Enter ``The Plant.'' Instead of a mimeograph
machine, he used his Web site to release it; instead of a quarter a
copy, he suggested a $1 payment for the first installment, with
more to come only if 75 percent of the downloaders paid up. ``My
friends,'' he wrote on his Web site, ``we have the chance to become
Big Publishing's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the novel's plot _ a writer sends a man-eating plant to
a publishing house that rejected his manuscript _ Big Publishing
did its best to appear unruffled. ``I don't feel particularly
threatened,'' said Susan Moldow, the publisher of Scribner, King's
offline publishing house. The literary agent Mort Janklow told a
reporter, ``That's a fellow sitting up in Maine having fun, but
it's not a way to run a business.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after ``The Plant'' was released, King said in an e-mail
message: ``I'm satisfied with the downloads _ about 40,000 as of 4
p.m. yesterday, and we're estimating a total pay-through of maybe
88 percent. Let Mort Janklow put that in his pipe and smoke it!''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the hubbub was the novel's provenance. King began ``The
Plant'' back in the early 1980s but shelved it because it too
closely resembled ``Little Shop of Horrors.'' It was distributed
only to the people on his Christmas-card list. ``If I gave someone
a coffee maker and they sold it at a yard sale, it wouldn't bother
me,'' he said at the time. ``If they want to sell 'The Plant,'
fine. It's theirs. They can tear out the pages and use 'em for
toilet paper, if that's what they feel like doing.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be what his friends mean when they call him a genius.
After all, who but the chairman of Stephen King Inc. would think to
turn 15-year-old toilet paper into an Internet rage?
</P>
<P>
   The book he finished in his wheelchair, meanwhile, ``On Writing:
A Memoir of the Craft,'' will be published in _ yawn _ early
October. With paper and cloth and glue. For King, 52, it was one of
the scariest books he has written. While a large part of it gives
point-blank advice to the aspiring author (``The adverb is not your
friend''), it also tells the true story of how writing saved
Stephen King from the sort of life _ or death _ that he has instead
had the luxury of turning into fiction.
</P>
<P>
   He has two offices in Bangor: one in the house for writing, the
other in a low-slung flesh-colored building near the airport. This
is where he and two assistants manage the empire that has arisen in
the wake of more than 40 books and nearly as many films based on
the writing of Stephen King and Richard Bachman, King's
pseudonymous counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Monday morning, mid-June, almost a year to the date of
his accident. King uses one red metal crutch to get from his pickup
truck to the office door. He is sick of the crutch. At a recent
reading in New York, he was determined to appear without it but was
stymied by three steep flights of stairs. Once onstage, however, he
leaned the crutch against a wall and limped to the microphone. He
got a standing ovation. King, as his longtime editor puts it, ``is
the rock star of writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after telling his assistants, Marsha and Julie, how nice
they look, King lowers himself into a jungle-print recliner. He
appears healthily haggard, if that's possible _ still underweight
but generally fit. He's wearing faded jeans, a blue sweatshirt and,
on his feet, soccer socks (maroon-and-white stripes) and karate
shoes (soft white leather). The combination invokes something like
a woodsman who breaks at lunch for ballet. At one point in the
conversation, he raises his right pant leg to illustrate the story
of visiting his beloved Red Sox at spring training: ``Nomar comes
over, Bret Saberhagen comes over, Tim Wakefield comes over, and Tim
goes, 'Come on, get it up, get it up!' They wanted to see the leg,
and they all knew what the injury was.''
</P>
<P>
   The major scar, running the length of the calf, is surrounded by
any number of puckers and pockmarks. The leg is not pretty (maybe
it never was), but it's there. Attached to the rest of him. ``I
tell Tabby this is the bonus round,'' he says. ``And I believe it,
man. I have a lot of pain, but there's so much that doesn't hurt,
that I'm capable of. To be able to walk around, to still be able to
make love to my wife _ because that could have gone as well, it's
just a physiological thing. I'm grateful for everything that I
have, and I try to stay as grateful as I can, because it doesn't
matter how much money you've made or how rich you are or whether
your book's on the Internet or anything else. If you snap your
spine, you're a quad, and mine was chipped in five or six places,
almost down to the bare wires in a couple of places, so I'm very
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   His desk is stacked with books to be autographed, the rest of
the office thick with Kingalia. It traces the arc of a long and
variegated and uniquely successful career: a ``Green Mile''
director's chair, a ``Pet Sematary'' rug, a chipper little sign
reading ``Redrum'' (if you have to ask ... ). In the bathroom,
there's a framed photo of a very large woman in a bathtub,
presumably a fan, with a thought bubble above her head: ``A Ton of
Fun?''
</P>
<P>
   King doesn't want for fans. In the summertime, tour buses idle
outside his house. On the Internet, King rumors swarm: his minivan
encounter was not an accident (false); he is suffering from
writer's block (false); someone else _ maybe his wife, also a
novelist _ actually writes some of his books.
</P>
<P>
   That rumor is also false, as far as anyone can tell. Still,
King's prolificacy borders on promiscuity. ``You almost expect when
he refers to 'the boys in the basement''' _ King's term for his
internal muses _ ``that maybe there are real people, doing at least
his typing,'' says Chuck Verrill, a literary agent who is also
King's personal editor.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since King went back to work, he has written the
second half of ``On Writing''; ``Riding the Bullet,'' the e-novella
whose success prompted a storm of the-future-is-here coverage; the
better part of a haunted-house screenplay for a six-hour ABC
miniseries; and a 900-page novel, ``Dreamcatcher,'' which opens
with a group of hunters coming upon a man who claims to have been
lost in the woods. (He finished another novel, ``From a Buick
Eight,'' just before his accident, but its release has been pushed
back, in part because it involves a nasty car crash.)
</P>
<P>
   As King says in ``On Writing,'' the first draft of a novel
shouldn't take more than three months. That, after all, is how it
works for him. He writes seven days a week, with the stereo turned
up loud (lots of Eminem, Kid Rock and Wilco these days), but he
often knocks off by lunchtime. Friends say that despite his ambling
disposition, King is fiendishly focused and gets more done per hour
_ whether writing or not _ than any other human they know. ``He's
curious about everything around him,'' says Kathi Kamen Goldmark,
who founded the Rock Bottom Remainders, the authors-only rock band
that includes Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Barry and, on
rhythm guitar, King. ``You can't mention a book he hasn't read, you
can't mention an obscure musician who he can't sing a lyric of one
of his songs.'' King's brain is known as an extraordinarily fecund
place, constantly sprouting jokes, opinions and, above all, story
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   King alone fails to marvel at his output. That would be like a
sprinter gloating over his speed. What does delight King is his
forward momentum. He is not only the richest and most famous living
author but also among the most entrepreneurial. A few years ago, he
pulled a Dickens and published ``The Green Mile'' in six serial
installments. (At one point, all six volumes sat on The Times's
best-seller list.) Earlier this year, he released a short-story
collection exclusively as an audiobook. Even his contract with
Scribner is an anomaly, sacrificing gigantic advances for a bigger
piece of the back end. (He doesn't remember the specifics, he says:
``I think the deal is a million dollars a book and split the
royalties pretty much down the middle.'')
</P>
<P>
   And now he has given e-publishing a kick-start. ``Riding the
Bullet,'' released in March, was the world's first mass e-book,
with more than 500,000 downloads. The number of actual readers was
another question because the encryption caused countless computers
to crash. Still, thanks to King, online publishing seemed a real
possibility at last. (Never mind that the Web was already swimming
with downloadable music and movies; even though plain words are far
easier to upload, it was somehow taken for granted that Big
Publishing would be the last one in.)
</P>
<P>
   King was stunned by the success of ``Riding the Bullet.'' In
Scribner's office pool, he had predicted 16,000 downloads. Now he
wanted to try again. He made up a wish list: a downloadable story
without encryption ... released in serial form ... with
honor-system payments ... published by ... ME! Thus was ``The
Plant'' brought forth from its drawer and posted on
www.stephenking.com.
</P>
<P>
   The media worked hard to turn King's insurgent act into a
writers' revolution. It is probably not. Most writers, unlike King,
can't book themselves onthe ``Today'' show and ``Good Morning
America'' on the day of their launch. Most writers, like Carlos
Detweiller of ``The Plant,'' would make more of an impact by
sending a man-eating vine to the publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   For King, though, anything is possible and, in time, probable.
``I've continued to say yes to these things rather than kind of
pulling back and saying, Well, I'm going to write a book a year,
and that's what I'm going to do,'' he says. ``I dislike writers who
behave like old cart horses, dozing their way back to the stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has written a how-to-write book laced with memoir. Some
critics, King says, ``think I can't write,'' and he knows how ``On
Writing'' will sit with them: ``Like the town whore trying to teach
women how to behave.'' He doesn't care. In the book, he even
invites his readers-writers to submit their work to him. He's
thinking about publishing the best offerings in the paperback
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Such approachability is a major upside of King's down-to-earth
reputation. Even in his native Maine, where celebrity is considered
a sort of disease, he is extraordinarily well regarded. It doesn't
hurt that he and his wife are world-class philanthropists, but
their just-folks nature is just as deeply appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one more upside to his earthiness. ``He said
to me recently,'' Verrill says, ``that one of the advantages of not
being an acclaimed literary novelist is that you get to write about
stuff like ...,'' and here Verrill names a variety of bodily
functions that are regularly featured in King's work.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, King wants to write from the gut and be an
acclaimed literary novelist. His complaints are by now familiar:
the literary establishment has long misunderstood popular fiction,
and just because he sells millions of books, serious readers won't
take him seriously. King has recently made headway. His novels have
come to be reviewed more respectfully; a Hawthorne-ish short story
he wrote, ``The Man in the Black Suit,'' won a 1996 O. Henry Award.
King was happy for the award, ``but it made me feel like an
impostor too,'' he says. ``Like someone made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the main, King is right: serious readers generally haven't
read him. When they do, they are usually impressed. Cynthia Ozick,
for instance, had never given King much thought until they did a
reading together. ``It dawned on me as I listened to him that,
never mind all the best sellers and all the stereotypes _ this man
is a genuine, true-born writer, and that was a revelation,'' she
says. ``He is not Tom Clancy. He writes sentences, and he has a
literary focus, and his writing is filled with literary history.
It's not glib, it's not just contemporary chatter and it's not
stupid _ that's a bad way to say that something's smart, but that's
what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   If King wanted to find the genesis of his bad reputation, he
might try looking in Hollywood. Except for ``Carrie'' and ``The
Shining,'' most early King films _ think ``Pet Sematary'' or
``Maximum Overdrive'' or ``Children of the Corn'' _ were dopey
gorefests. As King the author became a brand name, his movies gave
serious readers everywhere reason not to read him.
</P>
<P>
   But as his writing matured, so did the films. In 1986, Castle
Rock released ``Stand by Me,'' a sharp coming-of-age film based on
a King novella. Castle Rock has since made five more King films:
``Misery,'' ``Needful Things,'' ``The Shawshank Redemption,''
``Dolores Claiborne'' and ``The Green Mile.'' Each one was a few
thousand percent better than ``Children of the Corn.'' Too bad for
King that Castle Rock wasn't around in the 1970's. On the other
hand, he often hurts his own cause. Last year, King gave himself a
party at Tavern on the Green to celebrate the 25th anniversary of
the publication of ``Carrie.'' It was a fancy night, full of
literary VIPs, capped off by ... a highlight reel including the
goriest moments in King's film repertory.
</P>
<P>
   King never set out to be a horror writer and doesn't consider
himself one now. Horror, he implies, is a cheaper version of fear,
and it's the fear he's interested in: the frantic bleats in a
protagonist's mind more than the monster causing them. Two of his
recent works, ``Hearts in Atlantis'' and ``Bag of Bones,'' seemed
intent on minimizing the monstrous. They are driven by character,
not scenario, and are each rooted in sober realism. They are big,
serious-ish books; Scribner even classed up their dust jackets. But
by story's end the ghosts have arrived. A reader feels almost as if
the writer wanted to resist but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   A reader feels more of King at work than of most writers. His
narrative voice, extraordinarily controlling and full of wry
intrusions, is always right in your ear, just outside the
campfire's light. But what most makes King unique is that he fully
exploits the writer's great natural advantage: he is the one making
up the story. If there is a single trait common to most of King's
writing, it is the reader's feeling that the author is playing God.
He can and will make really bad things happen to his beloved
creations. He will then watch them confront this evil, occasionally
offering aid. Finally, after they've been scared witless and have
proved themselves worthy, they are welcomed back into His warm
embrace, humble and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' a novella that King published
last year, is a good example. In it, a 9-year-old girl gets lost in
the woods and ends up praying to her hero, the Red Sox pitcher Tom
Gordon, to help save her. It is a simple, beguiling, frightful
story. It begins in innocence, passes through the valley of the
shadow of death and ends with a benevolent wink of an author's
note: ``The woods themselves are real. If you should visit them on
your vacation, bring a compass, bring good maps ... and try to stay
on the path.''
</P>
<P>
   King says he might soon retire _ ``I think that my trick bag is
pretty well empty'' _ but instantly cautions that he probably won't
be able to. Those who know him well agree. He is preternaturally
driven, they say. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Silver, a Bangor friend and one of King's lawyers, says
that ``he's just a competitive guy who wants to be the best at what
he does.'' King has befriended John Grisham _ a few years ago, they
paid their own way to the National Book Awards, in sly protest of
being perennially unconsidered _ but he is bothered by the
inferiority of other best-selling authors. ``I never wanted to be
content with being, let's say, a Robin Cook or even a Michael
Crichton, who's a little bit better,'' he says. Of Danielle Steel
and Mary Higgins Clark, he complains, ``These people are selling
fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   If King's Internet orgy proves anything, it's that he likes
attention, a lot. What doesn't drive King is money. ``The truth is,
Stephen King is rich because he never set out to be rich,'' says
Susan Moldow of Scribner. ``If the money mattered to him, it
wouldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is, many times over. Responding to an e-mail query about
his finances, he wrote: ``I don't know how much I make in a good
year. Gross could be $40 million, I'd think. What finally nets out
is maybe a third.'' For the movie of ``The Green Mile'': ``I think
I got $3 million plus a piece of the back end (up to a certain
point). The movie has earned, unlike most of them, so I think I'll
see some back end. I saw some from 'Stand by Me,' too. Mostly
(people won't believe it) the movies are just sort of fun. Like
investing in some weird margin stock like United Kurmfurling or
Yermal SpringTronix. I can't break my finances down further than
that, and you are impudent to ask (I say it without rancor, but you
know it's true). The money isn't very important. The idea is to
take care of your family and have enough left over to buy books and
go to the movies once a week. As a goal in life, 'getting rich'
strikes me as fairly ludicrous. The goal is to do what God made you
for and not hurt anyone if you can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-hurting-anyone credo is important to King, and personal.
When he was 2, his father ``did a runout.'' King grew up with his
mother and older brother, on the move and poor. In ``On Writing,''
he recalls this childhood with typical candor (which can be very
moving) and typical scatalogical flair (which will probably keep
him, for now, on the wrong side of Art). His mother set high
standards, worked like a martyr, encouraged his writing; he loved
her. Shortly before his first book was published, she found out she
had uterine cancer. ``We could hear the pause after each rasping
breath she drew growing long and longer,'' he writes. ``Finally
there were no more breaths and it was all pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, King's own family is his greatest happiness. He speaks of
Tabitha with the ardor of a newlywed and the awe of a Lourdes
pilgrim. It was Tabitha who, about 15 years ago, gave him a choice:
clean up or move out. He was a mess; he says he can't really
remember writing ``Cujo'' at all. Tabitha took him before a group
of family and friends and emptied his trash can onto the rug. Out
poured, he writes, ``beer cans, cigarette butts, cocaine in gram
bottles and cocaine in plastic Baggies, coke spoons caked with snot
and blood, Valium, Xanax, bottles of Robitussin cough syrup and
NyQuil cold medicine, even bottles of mouthwash.'' He bought a
little time, as addicts will do, but soon started treatment and
stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   King seems genuinely surprised that he has lived to see his
first grandchild. He and Tabitha have had an eventful marriage;
friends say it is one of the strongest they have seen. For Tabitha,
who has published seven novels, it cannot have been easy being the
No. 2 writer in this two-writer home. Worse yet, for years they
shared a publisher. Tabitha's last manuscript got caught in limbo
when Elaine Koster, Tabitha's editor and Stephen's paperback
publisher, left Penguin Putnam in 1997. Stephen wound up signing
his lucrative deal with Scribner. Tabitha's novel wound up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now two of their three children are writers, Joe near Boston
(who writes under a pseudonym) and Owen in New York (who doesn't).
``I read Joe's stuff, and I kind of relate to it because it's like
plot-driven, it's high conflict,'' King says. ``Owen is more like
this sort of _ I don't want to dis him but _ Bret Easton Ellis. I
don't know, more like flavor-of-the-month, New York
relationships.'' The Kings' daughter, Naomi, is a Universalist
minister. ``I tell her, and I think it's true, that Unitarianism is
God for people who don't believe in God, and she just laughs.''
Naomi, who once owned a restaurant in Portland, Maine, now lives in
Chicago. ``She met a woman out there, and she's going to marry this
woman or have a commitment thing or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the whole family was up at the lake, including
Joe's wife and infant son. It was the first time in six months they
had all been together. On June 19, a Saturday, Owen was returning
to New York, so his father dropped him at the airport, drove home,
took a nap, then headed out for his daily constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Owen had just walked into his apartment when he got a phone call
from Tabitha: his father had been in an accident. He flew back.
King had been airlifted to the Central Maine Medical Center in
Lewiston. Tabitha, Joe and Naomi arrived, and later, Owen. ``What
they did to me there was apparently set something in my leg,'' King
recalls, ``and there's this horrible scream _ it came out to where
they were signing papers. Joe turned pale at that. The nurse gave
them a form, a do-not-resuscitate kind of thing. Tabby said Joe
realized it was serious and he just left, went out for a while. He
had his Red Sox cap. He put the cap over his face until he was in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   King, leaning forward in his recliner, takes a pause, and a
breath. ``Later, they all gathered around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's fully choked up. He whispers, in a model of Maine
understatement, ``They're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   King's near-death, as the facts came forth, unspooled like a
scene from his novels, full as they are of automotive menace and
rural blunderings. The driver who hit him, 42-year-old Bryan Smith
of Fryeburg, is known locally as a bit of a simpleton. King recalls
a sheriff's investigator visiting him in the hospital and saying,
``That Pepsi can has more IQ than Bryan Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith hit King, his minivan was well onto the right
shoulder. He had been distracted by his Rottweiller's trying to get
into a food cooler. Smith came back and sat with King to wait for
the ambulance. A woman and three children soon joined them.
According to her, Smith apologized and told King he had never even
gotten a parking ticket before, to which King replied, ``Well, I've
never been hit by a car before.''
</P>
<P>
   The local weekly, The Bridgton News, later reported that Smith
actually had a long history of driving violations. He had been
convicted for operating under the influence, driving to endanger
and failure to stop for a police officer. Once, after running
several cars off the road, he pulled into his driveway and promptly
passed out on his lawn, in view of the police officer who had been
chasing him. In 1998, his license was suspended three times but
each time was restored.
</P>
<P>
   At it turned out, Smith has a brother, Everett, on the Fryeburg
police force. The sheriff's deputy who responded to the King
accident, Matt Baker, used to serve on the Fryeburg force with
Everett Smith. And the only eyewitness Baker took a statement from
on the scene was his own uncle, Chip Baker. ``It's not nepotism,
it's ineptness, that's what I would credit those police departments
with,'' says Lisa Williams Ackley, who covered the story for The
News.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were enraged when it was announced that only
misdemeanor charges would be pressed against Smith. The accident,
they felt, should be treated as a seriously criminal act. ``They
should have impounded the vehicle, and they should have tested him
for drugs and alcohol at the scene, and they didn't do it,'' says
Warren Silver, the Kings' lawyer in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Silver had gone to western Maine shortly after the accident to
investigate it and meet with Smith. He came home with an idea that
he prayed Smith hadn't had: the 1985 blue Dodge Caravan, fresh with
King's dents, might fetch a frighteningly high price on eBay. The
next day, Silver called Smith, offered him $1,500 for the van and
had it shipped back to Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   King wants to use the van for a charity event: three
sledgehammer swings for $5. ``But my wife is kind of like, 'Why
don't we just get past this whole thing,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles at his own grisly perseverance. He takes off his
glasses, rubs his eyes, puts the glasses back on. They are the same
lenses he was wearing that day; only the frames had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he still wearing them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that I wanted to say that things that we ordinarily
would see as quite fragile aren't necessarily that fragile,'' he
says. ``It's true of the glasses, and it's true of me. I got bent,
I got busted around a lot, but I'm still here.''

 From The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Iovine, co-chairman of Interscope Geffen A&AMP;M, slips the
videocassette in the player and plunks down in a comfy chair. He's
screening an early episode of ``Farmclub.com,'' a weekly music show
he's producing on the USA network. ``Farmclub'' runs right after
the World Wrestling Federation's ``Raw Is War,'' a
let-them-eat-beefcake extravaganza that is cable TV's highest-rated
show. The conjunction was no accident. Iovine avidly pursued it
because he wanted to capture the young males who watch wrestling.
The star of this episode is unquestionably Fred Durst, front man
for Limp Bizkit, a group that minted rap-metal, the aggressive,
hypermacho and extremely lucrative new pop-music genre that mixes
rap with rock. ``Watch this,'' Iovine says. ``This is what
'Farmclub' is all about.'' Just then, on the tape, Durst, enraged
that the show has just run the wrong version of a Limp Bizkit
video, threatens to hide a TV camera somewhere on the person of a
staff member.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is quite possibly the future of white male youth
culture _ camera-ready anger, staged to resemble wrestling. Iovine
is an entrepreneur of rage. He linked arms with the rap label Death
Row in the early '90s and made the gangsta rappers Snoop Dogg and
Dr. Dre household names. He signed Nine Inch Nails, whose
transgressive lyrics are the target of Washington conservatives,
and he, along with Dr. Dre, brought the world Eminem, the
anti-role-model white rapper who has recently been embroiled in a
public dust-up over virulent antigay lyrics. Iovine sees a great
future ahead for artists who take hip-hop in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you understand the impact on young white America that
hip-hop is having?'' he asks. To illustrate, he searches his Los
Angeles office for the FBI tally of crime statistics he keeps close
at hand. ``Crime has gone down remarkably. And rap music has been
the biggest it's ever been. So do guys like Tupac and DMX deserve
the Nobel Peace Prize? I don't know. What do you think?'' He's
joking, but only just.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Iovine frequently ponders the connections
between outrageous music and outrageous behavior, if only because
his artists and others like them often have a foot on both sides of
the line. Take last year's Woodstock, where rap-metal had its messy
coming out. The artists Rage Against the Machine, Korn, the Insane
Clown Posse and Everlast all played there, all of them fusing heavy
guitar sounds to boastful, profane hip-hop attitude. Promoters were
hoping for a nice millennial assortment of good vibes, while
audiences and artists clearly wanted to carve out a nastier slice
of history. It was Durst who put his finger on the scale. Before
the sea of Woodstock humanity, he announced: ``They want us to ask
you to mellow out. They said too many people are getting hurt.
Don't let nobody get hurt, but I don't think you should mellow
out.'' And then the seams split open. Limp Bizkit played their
testosterone-drenched ``Break Stuff,'' and the mood changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break Stuff'' rants against ``the he says-she says'' and
builds to a vow to ``break your ... face tonight.'' That's the
quintessential rap-rock moment, when everyday pressures and the old
he says-she says ignites in an updraft of rage. At Woodstock one
woman was reportedly raped as Limp Bizkit played, and a gang rape
allegedly occurred while the band Korn performed. Crisis counselors
say there were even more attacks, and at party's end, fires broke
out all over the grounds as rock fans trashed vehicles, automatic
teller machines and vendor stalls. There were few reports of
anybody mellowing out.
</P>
<P>
   Iovine thinks those who link Limp Bizkit to the Woodstock melee
miss the point. Earlier that day, he informs me, a 6-year-old
Michigan youth shot and killed another child. Iovine's artists have
been blamed before when fans have engaged in criminal behavior, so
he is quick to say now that music is not responsible for the
Michigan killing. While he laments what happened at Woodstock, he
contends that pushing audiences to respond is what great art does.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Detroit _ rap-metal's ground zero, home to Kid
Rock, Eminem and the Insane Clown Posse _ and I knew people who
needed Kid Rock in their lives, an artist raising the self-esteem
of doormats everywhere. The last time I saw my best friend from
high school, he was standing on the hood of his car, smashing in
the windows with his dad's golf clubs. I bet today he and his
children are Kid Rock fans. Boasting that he comes ``straight out
of the trailer,'' Rock hurls the epithet of ``white trash'' back at
the world, much in the same way gangsta groups like NWA did with
Compton and ``nigga.'' At its best, the current fusion of rap and
metal lets people who feel unblessed by the economy express some
righteous anger. But more often, rap-metal aims a lot lower.
</P>
<P>
   The new rap-metal frequently seems calculated _ to offend, to
rake in a quick, lewd buck. The influence of pornography on this
culture is worth noting. The band Korn, for example, garnered early
credibility among fans by posting interviews with porn stars on its
Web site. The Insane Clown Posse goes on cable-access porn shows.
Fred Durst appeared in ``Backstage Sluts 2.'' Porn gives bands cool
points and boosts their fan base.
</P>
<P>
   There is something creepy about the ongoing compulsion to wed
rap and metal and from there to fuse it with wrestling and porn and
seemingly every other precinct in popular culture. And it hasn't
peaked yet. Recently, Eminem's new album broke records for
first-week sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the music itself can sometimes be profound. Eminem, in
his brilliant ``Guilty Conscience,'' ponders robbing a liquor
store, taking advantage of a 15-year-old and killing a cheating
wife. He gleefully forces you to consider whatever differences
exist between thoughts and deeds while making you extremely
uncomfortable to discover that maybe the two aren't far enough
apart. (And judging from recent reports of his offstage behavior,
words and deeds might not be so distant for Eminem, either.) It is
about the meaninglessness of good intentions and maybe even the
death of them.
</P>
<P>
   Call them knuckleheads or young white guys; Spin magazine
lambasted them with the term ``mooks,'' a label that has since been
picked up as a badge of honor. And suddenly there are enough
members of the mook club to fill up many Woodstocks. We've all seen
them at the mall: kids who ostentatiously say ``whuzzup'' to one
another; the frat brothers who wear stop-and-frisk fashions; the
countless fans who recognize the porn star on the cover of
Blink-182's last album.
</P>
<P>
   White music fans have long been curious about black culture, but
the wholesale interest in miming the black underclass is new. As
far back as ``On the Road,'' Jack Kerouac fantasized raptly, ``At
lilac evening I walked with every muscle aching ... wishing I were
a Negro, feeling that the best the white world offered was not
enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness,
music, not enough night.''
</P>
<P>
   James Brown fascinated white kids in the '60s with a peephole
glimpse of a world of grace and grit. But the black rapper DMX, and
before him Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., now offers a
wide-screen movie of ghetto life, relishing the details, relating
the intricacy of topics like drug dealing, brawling, pimping and
black-on-black crime. Rap makes these things seem sexy, and it
makes life on the streets seem as thrilling as a Playstation game.
</P>
<P>
   Today black youth culture is no secret, nor is it about joy and
kicks. Today a thousand arena spotlights shine on such race
fantasies, and they are billboarded and exploited by media outlets
and entertainment conglomerates. The fantasy lands of rap,
wrestling and porn have aligned to shape a real audience, one that
looks awfully hardened. Woodstockers have been called spoiled
brats, pacified suburbanites, testosterone junkies with no real
reason to be angry. Their crime, to their critics, is one of
insincerity. It's a powerful argument. But once the windows start
breaking, rage isn't really earned or counterfeit. It just is. And
at that point, rage is no longer the problem of a group of problem
kids. At that moment, it's everybody's problem.
</P>
<P>
   The literature of mookography is full of family turmoil, of
parents and children turning on one another. Take the weekly saga
(run between matches) involving the WWF overlord McMahon and his
kids, who wrestle, turn very, very bad, ``marry'' wrestlers Dad
doesn't approve of, get ``gang raped'' and so on. Even professional
wrestling is about family excess.
</P>
<P>
   Making parents mad and recounting family tensions have always
been a part of rock 'n' roll since Daddy took the T-Bird away, but
today's full-out family trauma is different, and part of what makes
rap-metal stand out in comparison with the other top-ranking pop
music, teen bubble gum. Eminem raps about discovering that his
mother was a drug addict. In real life, she's suing him for $10
million for defamation of character. Kid Rock once told an
interviewer that he found career motivation in being kicked out of
his parents' house for refusing to go to family therapy. The band
Korn once put out a news release stating that some of its members
were child-abuse survivors. Fans know the lyrics and the back
stories and are drawn in because in these stories, they see
something of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Fred Durst, the man who has taken lumps for
``triggering'' Woodstock, hedges his bets, sounding simultaneously
apologetic and defiant. ``I literally don't do anything to hurt
anyone,'' Durst says. ``I believe in karma more than you
understand. And I believe in God. And when I'm at Woodstock and a
riot breaks out _ I didn't know. Everybody's jumping and I can't
see and all of a sudden there's these riots and someone got raped.
Dude, if I'd known that, I would have stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``Break Stuff,'' the song he played when the mood
palpably changed at Woodstock, ``a mistake,'' which he won't repeat
on the next Bizkit album. But he's not ready to shoulder all the
blame: ``They burned the place down, but it's not my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst, 29, grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small town where one of
his best friends was a black kid whose father, a D.J., played Fred
rap records that he had bought in New York. ``All of a sudden I was
obsessed with this beat and this way of storytelling,'' Durst
explains. ``And I thought, Man, I tell you what, this has got to be
the best thing that's ever happened in my life.'' He became a
figure common everywhere today: the white kid with the boom box,
the stylized walk, the pants flashing boxers. Before this kid was
an archetype, though, he was more likely to be called weird, or
worse. In a place like Gastonia, and then Jacksonville, Fla., where
his family moved, Durst was called ``nigger lover.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined a break-dance crew _ four black kids and him _ and won
the seventh-grade talent show. But after that, things were
different at school. Suddenly all the jocks wanted to beat him up,
he says, ``and anybody that was, like, 'normal' said, 'Hey this
guy's a freak.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after school, Durst fathered a child, spent a year
in the Navy, worked as a tattoo artist and then formed a band. The
mid-90's was a savvy moment to create a new sound. Jordan Schur,
who founded Limp Bizkit's label, Flip, explains: ``Rock had kind of
fizzled, and a lot of these young kids in the suburbs, the
skatekids, they wanted a rock-star element. They were getting more
of that from rap. But a lot of those kids still liked the big riffs
and the big sound of rock. It was natural to go toward a fusion of
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the Los Angeles rehearsal studio, standing among
mannequins of monsters, the members of Limp Bizkit don't look like
teen-age icons. Durst sits on a couch, repairing a skateboard as
the rest of the group sets up. The band plays four songs that this
fall, on their next album, ``Chocolate Starfish and Hotdog Flavored
Water,'' will continue posing the argument that hip-hop is white
culture too.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with where the music is going. The
African-American rapper Mos Def pointedly attacks Limp Bizkit
(along with Elvis and Kenny G) on his recent album ``Black on Both
Sides,'' recasting a familiar charge that hip-hop and rock 'n' roll
are both black music that whites have appropriated. He is in some
ways right.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Limp Bizkit continues to pursue total world
domination. Durst has become a senior vice president at Interscope
Records; as a high-ranking talent scout, he envisions huge
battles-of-the-bands traveling across the country, with the best
getting signed to his label. And Durst says he has raised
``hundreds of thousands of dollars'' for a cable channel featuring
round-the-clock extreme sports and music programming.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even his most ambitious project. He hopes to erase the
blot of Woodstock with a huge festival of hard-core hip-hop and
rap-metal, the edgiest stuff he can get. He would like to line up
Korn, the Ruff Ryders, Wu-Tang Clan, Dr. Dre and Eminem and more.
The show will be free, and he's toying with the idea of making the
food and drinks free, too, a rebuke to Woodstock's $12 pizzas. And
he vows to make it violence-free.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility weighs heavily on Durst's sloping shoulders.
``Pretty much everybody says our generation has this problem,'' he
says. ``We were the problem at Woodstock. But you know what? I'll
put together the heaviest rock and hip-hop bands, and it will be
the most peaceful, fun, killer event you'll ever see.'' It's a long
way from happening, though. Should it work, a generation will have
a whole new set of defining symbols. And one of them will be
wearing a red baseball cap backward.

 By STEVE ERICKSON  
 c.2000 Steve Erickson  
 From The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Follow the crack of the Liberty Bell as far as the eye can see
and there he is, alone on a park bench in the middle of
Philadelphia, as obscure as he wants to be. ``Getting a little
vitamin D,'' he says when I reach him, and lifts his face to the
first sun either of us has seen after 15 hours on a bus, riding the
interstate through the night and into this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He's as obscure as he wants to be _ except for all those tour
buses parked on the other side of the square, his in particular,
with the tops of two '49 Buick Roadmasters erupting through the
roof and a license plate that reads POCAHONTAS. For a while we talk
about the allure of the road (``I like it,'' he says, ``I mean, I
miss my family, but. ...'' and then shrugs, a concession not an
apology), the music he listens to (``I don't play that much pop
these days, mostly Beethoven, Wagner''), about his recent CD,
``Silver and Gold'' (his first studio recording in four years). We
talk about the eight-disc archival box set he's preparing for
release this fall, covering his ascent from obscurity in the
mid-'60s to 1972, when he had Billboard's No. 1 album of the year;
and the two tours he's staging, one on his own and one with three
old friends, who, 30 years ago, were the biggest band in America.
</P>
<P>
   Time has finally cornered him long enough to monumentalize him,
it seems; but we'll see. Once he wrote songs with titles like
``Journey Through the Past'' _ barely conscious efforts to conquer
the present and cheat the future _ and he has always given a very
good impression of a man running from his place in musical history
as if it were a tomb. When we make our way to the hotel where the
bus is parked, a fan works up the nerve to ask for an autograph,
but Neil Young says, ``No, I don't do that,'' and walks right on
by, breaking his stride not even a little.
</P>
<P>
   Until I actually step on board, everyone assures me the
Pocahontas is a sanctuary never breached. Back beyond the special
well designed for Ben, his 21-year-old son with cerebral palsy who
watches the highway from his wheelchair, Young sprawls on his huge
bed. ``I was playing in a club in Fort William,'' he begins, ``and
we're doing a song called 'Farmer John,' and toward the end of it
we started jamming. ...''
</P>
<P>
   This is way back. This is back in the autumn of 1964 with a band
called the Squires, in Canada, where Young was reared in the little
town of Omemee with its ``blue, blue windows behind the stars'' and
where at the age of 3 he slipped into a nearby lake and nearly
drowned. This is back before his early days as part of a Motown
band with Rick James, back before his long exodus to L.A. in a
hearse looking for Stephen Stills, whom he would find only at the
last minute in a Sunset Strip traffic jam, before they formed
Buffalo Springfield. This is before ``After the Gold Rush'' and
``Harvest'' put him on the map in the early 1970s, and before the
subsequent 28 albums that have kept him on and off the map ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   This is way back, before a crumbling spinal disc in 1971 and
before the epilepsy, which still haunts him onstage. This is before
the afternoon he fired his lead guitarist for an uncontrolled
heroin problem that took the guitarist's life that very night, and
before the subsequent music that Young recorded in a
tequila-flooded exorcism of grief and guilt. This is before the
Thermidor of late-'70s punk, when one rock icon after another fell
before its guillotine of cultural relevancy, and Young was the one
'60s artist not only spared by the revolution but also embraced as
a kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This is back before the nitwitted lawsuit filed against him in
the '80s by the head of his record label, David Geffen, for not
making true ``Neil Young'' records, before the '90s, when Kurt
Cobain quoted him in his suicide note, before he became the only
artist in the year 2000 that one could possibly imagine sharing a
concert bill with, say, Merle Haggard on the one hand and Nine Inch
Nails on the other. This is back before he became rock's Man That
Time Forgot, making music at once primordial and futuristic,
homegrown and surreal, traditional and insurrectionist, beguiling
and cataclysmic _ before he became, with his distinctive voice and
racked Mojave-storm guitar, a one-man vortex for folk, country,
blues, psychedelia, grunge, electronica, symphonic sweep, metallic
squall.
</P>
<P>
   Way back, playing ``Farmer John'' when he wasn't yet 20, Young
remembers, the music got really wild. ``I had never played like
that before. We were just slamming it. We played the song without
the song, we played what the song was about,'' and in that moment
his musical identity was born. If rock has always been driven by
two impulses, the utopian and the anarchic, many of its most
enduring figures have straddled the two: Chuck Berry, Elvis
Presley, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young. It's the
utopian Neil whose records people buy in droves. But with songs
like 1995's sonic Imax ``I'm the Ocean,'' or the brilliant
``Powderfinger,'' about a young frontier boy killed in an explosion
of survivalist pride and madness (``Then I saw black, and my face
splashed in the sky''), it's the anarchic Neil who howls into the
zeitgeist and alters it.
</P>
<P>
   He likes it when the zeitgeist howls back. With Crazy Horse, a
band just cacophonous and primal enough to capture ``Farmer John''
on record with Young a quarter-century after Fort William, he makes
a point of recording around a full moon, when ``a lot of mechanical
things go wrong, technical difficulties, things that usually work
don't work.'' And in the congenitally enlightened company of
Crosby, Stills and Nash, unabashed utopians who have always sounded
a little funny singing ``Down by the river I shot my baby,'' Neil
Young is Baader-Meinhof: when he performs ``Rockin' in the Free
World'' in Philadelphia, it seems he simply won't let go of the
song, until it becomes clear the song won't let go of him.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the conflict between utopia and anarchy has emerged
moral ambiguity and complexity. In 1970, when he wrote ``Ohio''
following the murder of four students by National Guardsmen at Kent
State University, his rage was more instinctive than political:
``My lyrics get personal about it,'' he acknowledges. ``I'm
singing: 'What if you knew her and saw her dead on the ground? How
could you run when you know?''' But that anger was also answered a
few years later by ``Campaigner,'' when alone among major spokesmen
for the counterculture he expressed compassion for a disgraced
president who lost everything (``Even Richard Nixon has got
soul''); and conspicuously over the years he has refused to adopt
any ideological line. At one time or another he has supported
Ronald Reagan and Jesse Jackson. His ideal ticket in 2000 is
Gore-McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The utopia of his early music succumbed to anarchy most
spectacularly during an unhinged 1973 tour that was his rude answer
to superstardom. The shows would routinely climax with Young
screaming, ``Wake up!'' at his audiences as the '60s crashed down
around him in a rain of dead junkies; now, at the back of the
Pocahontas, all he can manage to say of the period is, ``I'm glad I
made it through it,'' before a pall settles over the interview.
Whenever Young ``tried to get away from success,'' his manager,
Elliot Roberts, remarks of the period, ``it just turned into a
bigger success,'' which wasn't just confusing but mortifying, since
success wasn't particularly subtle about its human toll. Young went
on to chronicle the deaths of the people around him in a series of
anti-drug songs _ ``The Needle and the Damage Done,'' ``Tired
Eyes,'' ``Tonight's the Night'' _ that were all the more
authoritative for the way they were reportorial rather than
judgmental, never denying for a moment the attraction of excess and
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like people telling me what to do,'' he explains
almost offhandedly. ``I didn't like people telling me if I made
more records like 'Harvest,' I would be successful. That's when I
came up with the concept of destroying what I created in order to
move on. I wanted to do what I called audio verite.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and looks out the window. ``At a certain point,
trained, accomplished musicians'' _ which is to say, not him _
``hit the wall. They don't go there very often, they don't have the
tools to go through the wall, because it's the end of notes. It's
the other side, where there's only tone, sound, ambience,
landscape, earthquakes, pictures, fireworks, the sky opening,
buildings falling, subways collapsing. ... I don't know too many
musicians who try to go through the wall.'' He stops for a moment.
``I love to go through the wall,'' as if you ever doubted it for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the collective memory of his longtime audience, he may
forever be the brooding figure reclining alone in the shadowy
gatefold of ``After the Gold Rush.'' But in fact virtually everyone
who has ever known him attests to his humor _ sometimes zany,
sometimes wry, mischievous. Over six feet tall, he has an easy yet
determined stride that encompasses all his contradictions: zen yet
a little obsessive, open yet a little unapproachable, lurching
toward his ambitions yet held back by his wariness of having to
explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   During a disgruntled taping with Crosby, Stills and Nash of
``Storytellers,'' the VH-1 series in which songwriters relate the
stories behind their songs, he paces the small stage like a caged
animal and cracks, ``I thought the song was supposed to tell the
story.'' And when I bump into him in a hotel lobby one afternoon
after failing to pin him down for an interview, and he assures me,
``I'm really not avoiding you, I'm just waiting until I feel more
alert,'' personally I feel quite certain he's avoiding me. But I'm
in the curious position of respecting him all the more for it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Elliot Roberts was just a 22-year-old from the Bronx
managing Buffalo Springfield when Young abruptly stopped a
rehearsal one afternoon to demand Roberts be fired on the spot. ``I
was shocked,'' Roberts recalls. ``It blew my mind.'' For days he
wandered L.A. stunned, trying to figure out what hit him, only for
Young to appear suddenly one night at 2 a.m. to explain he was
leaving the band and wanted Roberts to manage him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he had plotted it all out,'' Roberts now laughs. ``I
thought, Wow, cool _ this guy is as devious as I am.'' To those who
have watched him over the years, Young comes off as a mastermind of
unpredictability. But sometimes he can appear less integrated and
more genuinely divided against himself than people think. The
utopian-anarchic ``schizophrenia'' (Young's word) of his music
reveals both a Spontaneous Neil and a Control-Freak Neil, each real
and each peering over the other's shoulder, each trying to correct
the other's misjudgments, each averting the other from perceived
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of this than the recent misadventures
of Young's authorized biographer. After signing a contract with
both Young and Random House, Jimmy McDonough, a journalist, spent
eight years writing, researching and interviewing more than 300
people, all with Young's cooperation. But when McDonough delivered
a manuscript at the end of 1998, Young suddenly _ according to the
publisher _ ``sabotaged'' the book by withholding his approval of
it, and Random House dropped the biography. In the Young camp,
nobody will comment for the record about why he killed the project.
But the unofficially stated reason _ that McDonough submitted the
book to Random House before submitting it to Young and thereby
breached the contract, betraying Young's trust _ sounds flimsy.
McDonough is now suing him for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The melodrama of Neil Young's early life reached critical mass
in November 1978 with the birth of his second son _ by his wife,
Pegi _ and the subsequent realization that, like Young's first son,
Zeke, by the actress Carrie Snodgrass, Ben had cerebral palsy.
Zeke's case is mild (he is 27 and works as a sound engineer on a
number of his father's projects), but Ben is a quadriplegic. Young
would later recount walking out of the hospital and ``looking at
the sky, looking for a sign, wondering: What did I do? There must
be something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But cerebral palsy is a twist of fate, not of genetics _ Young's
daughter, Amber, doesn't have the disease. If all this weren't
overwhelming enough, not long after Ben's birth, Pegi was found to
have a brain tumor, from which, at the time, she had only a 50-50
chance of recovering. So in the early '80s, the man whose obsession
with his music was supposedly all-consuming set the music aside to
devote himself to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of thoughts in my mind at that time,'' he
says now, ``that I wasn't ready to share with the world,'' and the
matter of Ben's health was so personal that in 1982, when Young
released a strange album called ``Trans'' with electronically
distorted vocals, few knew it grew out of an effort to communicate
with his speechless son by computer. During the rest of the decade,
Young's music seemed at loose ends on a series of recordings that
in hindsight appear redeemed as stylistic explorations of an
artistic identity in turmoil _ out of which ultimately emerged one
of his best albums, ``Freedom,'' in 1989. He then spent the '90s
making one important record after another.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in Philadelphia, when we had once again scheduled
an interview and he had once again vanished, I found out he had
gone to a school for children with cerebral palsy. Along with Pegi,
Young is a major supporter of such a school in California, and
during tours he often arranges for young people with the disease to
see the shows. I was annoyed that I hadn't been with him to get the
scene at the school for the story; in true Neil Young fashion, it
even happened during a full moon, when an elevator at the school
suddenly malfunctioned and the singer hovered for several
precarious minutes between floors. But then it occurred to me that
99 out of 100 rock stars would have jumped at the chance to drag me
along and put their humanitarianism on display, and that like so
much else with Young, maybe this was private, too.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, you know, he just wings it. Sometimes it's not a
matter of a personal code (which he obviously has), or a
Machiavellian ploy (of which he's clearly capable); it's a matter
of impulse. Standing in the middle of a shopping-center parking lot
on the highway to Cleveland, waiting for the bus to refuel, Young
is talking about spending some time with his family after the tour
on the volcanic Big Island of Hawaii, when a young woman pulls up
in a pickup truck. She leans over and rolls down the window on the
passenger side, and on her face is the disbelief of her own eyes.
``Are you who I think you are?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think I am?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Neil Young?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he finally answers.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended between astonishment and opportunity, she sputters,
``Would you sign your name for me?''
</P>
<P>
   She scrambles to find something for him to write on. I'm
remembering the autograph hound outside the hotel in Philadelphia.
Now this woman in a pickup truck on her way to get her kid from
school maybe, or coming home from a job waiting on tables, in the
middle of a Wal-Mart parking lot that everybody knows is nowhere,
happens to peer through her windshield to see, standing over on a
small square of grass waiting for his dog to relieve himself, the
full-moon genius of rock 'n' roll. And then she makes two
decisions: the first, to have faith in what her eyes tell her; and
the second, to confront it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says. He steps up to the truck, leans in and
scrawls his name on whatever she has offered him, a gut reaction to
the purity of her wonder; and then as she drives away, with a story
she'll tell for the next 50 years, he goes back to contemplating
volcanoes and the sea, and the tropical winds where utopia and
anarchy converge.
</P>
<P>
   As he now seems eternally young, in earlier days Young was old
before his time. ``I'm getting old,'' he sang in his most famous
song, ``Heart of Gold,'' written when he was 24. In Phoenix, after
another show, as the others in the band celebrate with friends
backstage, Young sits alone in a dark, hushed room with a few
candles burning low nearby, nursing his back with an ice pack; he
seems every one of his 54 years. Earlier onstage he lost himself in
a deranged ``Down by the River'' as he had with ``Rockin' in the
Free World'' in Philadelphia, the Man That Time Forgot shredding
time to ribbons. But back here in the dark he's the Man That Time
Remembers, and it's remembering him in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   So for a while we make small talk that he probably finds more
awkward than his graciousness allows him to admit. And then I
finally leave, after he has just ``slammed '' one more time through
the wall of age, the wall of fear, the wall of passion, to the end
of the night. As if you ever doubted it for a moment, he loves to
go through the wall, beyond the end of notes.

 &HT;    PBS documents Gingrich's plunge from king to exile
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was it only yesterday that Newt Gingrich was king of the world?
</P>
<P>
   Seems like it. PBS' ``The Fall of Newt Gingrich'' opens on a
Labor Day weekend just two years ago, with the former House Speaker
and Republican Revolution war lord vacationing out West, sporting a
funny hat and indulging his passion for dinosaur remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' the narrator pronounces of that time in 1998, ``Newt
Gingrich may be the most powerful man in America.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that moment seems like yesterday, it also now seems like
ages ago that Gingrich resigned his rule, so thoroughly has he been
``disappeared'' by Republicans trying to recapture the presidency.
His fall, in the midst of Bill Clinton's impeachment, was
blink-and-miss-it stuff: Only months after digging in that western
dirt, Gingrich was out, a pariah to the same upstarts he'd led into
Washington four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think the House representatives made a mistake,'' says
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott in this more-frank-than-revealing
90 minutes. ``This is a guy that was more than the Moses of the
Republican Party _ he was the Joshua. He not only led us to the
promised land but into the promised land. I consider them
ingrates.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich isn't so Old Testament. Saying House Republicans needed
someone more ``nurturing'' and ``placating'' after losing seats in
'98, Gingrich allows, ``That wasn't a job I was capable of doing. I
have real limitations as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Produced, directed and written by documentarian Michael Pack
(``Inside the Republican Revolution,'' ``Campus Culture Wars: Five
Stories About Political Correctness''), ``Fall'' does a dandy job
of giving the illusion that it's operating deep behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras follow Gingrich into meetings with lobbyists; into a
limo that takes him from the airport to a fund-raiser for a
Nebraska Republican hopeful; into the Marietta, Ga., ``war room''
on election night 1998, during the unexpected Republican collapse
for which Gingrich would be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   The constant movement and hallway strategizing gives ``Fall''
the feel of a real-life, congressional ``West Wing;'' even
Gingrich's press secretary, as in that NBC political drama, becomes
a kind of character in an on-going series, explaining what she'll
have to do moments after Gingrich opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of ``Fall,'' one feels less enlightened than
diverted. The scenes we peek at rarely have much consequence, while
the real action takes place somewhere else. (One's head virtually
spins after learning of a longtime affair ending the speaker's
marriage to Marianne, who's featured cheerfully throughout.)
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's fall, in fact, is disturbingly short-changed; this
project clearly began as a chronicle of what would be -- after
expected Republican triumphs and Clinton's expected demise -- a
kind of coronation.
</P>
<P>
   So the end seems just as sudden and inexplicable as it did in
'98. Only now it seems like ages ago.

</P>
<P>
   Grade: B.

   Verdict: A ``West Wing''-like rehash of events leading up to
Gingrich's 1998 demise.

&HT;     PAT NIXON, REMEMBERED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Because most of those in a position to know are
dead, no one can ever be certain whether President Richard Nixon
beat his wife Patricia, as a new biography charges.
</P>
<P>
   But there is plenty of evidence on the record to demonstrate
that during the White House years the Nixons had a chilly
relationship. He behaved toward her in public as though they were
strangers who never had a romantic thought and barely knew each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Covering the White House in those days, I sometimes witnessed
the president's shabby treatment of his wife, whom he never
touched, studiously ignored and kept in the distant background.
</P>
<P>
   How different is this antiseptic marriage from that of the
presidential families who followed the Nixons in the White House
after he resigned in 1974. As far as we can tell, these later
partnerships have been strong and reasonably happy.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, first ladies are playing increasingly prominent
roles, and public displays of affection are now not only standard
conduct but practically required. Al Gore's passionate kiss of
Tipper before his acceptance speech will be remembered far longer
than the words he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Once politicians fixated on ``family values'' it became
obligatory for presidential contenders to set a good public example
of loyal affection for their mates. President Clinton has taken a
severe drubbing in public opinion for cheating on his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Nixon may have the dubious distinction of being the last
president's wife to be considered an irrelevant appendage to her
husband's presidency. There was no sign of intimate communication
between them, let alone any influence she might have exercised over
his thoughts and policies. He refused to let her take most official
trips with him. He took vacations alone, controlled her staff,
rejected her pleas not to seek the presidency in 1968 and
apparently never discussed Watergate with her.
</P>
<P>
   We reporters constantly looked for evidence of physical or
verbal tenderness as befitting a long marriage _ and found none. In
one memorable episode, the first couple met on stage at a rally in
Nashville after several days spent apart in March of 1974, during
the closing saga of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   After the audience sang ``Happy Birthday'' to the first lady,
she rose with a smile and walked toward her husband, arms extended
to embrace him. He deliberately turned away from her. Reporters who
were present still recall the snub with horror. The Nixons said not
one word of greeting to each other all that night.
</P>
<P>
   The new examination of Nixon's life, titled ``The Arrogance of
Power: The Secret World of Richard Nixon'' by Irish journalist
Anthony Summers, paints a harsh picture. The book describes Nixon
as secretly using drugs to combat depression. And it calls his
marriage to Pat full of ``prolonged marital difficulty, of physical
abuse, of threatened divorce.'' Based on second-hand accounts and
the observations of acquaintances now dead, the book also claims
that he beat her in times of political crisis, starting in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Tricia Nixon Cox denies the accusation, insisting that her
father never struck her mother. She is a loyal daughter and has
always publicly defended her disgraced dad, who was forced to
resign to avoid impeachment for the Watergate crimes. But it is
entirely possible that she might not have known what went on when
her parents were alone and Nixon could indulge his legendary temper
out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hillings, a longtime Nixon adviser and one of the book's
deceased sources, once told me that although Pat Nixon was a fully
participating political partner in 1960, she was a changed woman by
the time of Nixon's unsuccessful 1962 California gubernatorial
campaign. She opposed the race and no longer cared to contribute to
the plotting and the planning even though she campaigned stoically
in public with him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 when he unsuccessfully tried a stealth presidential
candidacy, and 1968 when he eventually won the prize, Pat Nixon
dropped out. When his inner circle came to his New York apartment
to plan the campaign, she was never there, Hillings said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillings, who did not suggest that Nixon abused her physically,
said he felt sorry for her. For whatever reason, she was no longer
an integral part of Richard Nixon's career. When he fell from
power, it was his daughter Julie who undertook a campaign to defend
him, not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was asked in an interview after he left the White House
why he had never said publicly that he loved Pat. ``We just don't
go in for those public declarations of _ of love,'' he said,
stumbling over the key word. ``We never held hands in public. She
isn't a public kisser; I am not either.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a sad story of mental and emotional anguish, regardless
of the physical consequences. For all the sloppy sentimentality of
the new rush to flaunt family dedication, it does humanize the most
powerful political office in the world and helps us identify with
the occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon lived alone in his skull and liked it that way.
Poor Pat. Poor us. How did we ever happen to elect such a cold
fish?

NO EASY ANSWERS TO INTERPRETING SAT SCORES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The College Board released new SAT scores Tuesday. Math is up
three points to 514, with verbal scores unchanged at 505.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have often used this annual report to lament the state
of American schools, but interpreting the SAT is more complex than
it seems. SAT trends would reflect school quality changes only if
every 18-year old took the test. Not all do.
</P>
<P>
   Average scores are affected by who takes the SAT. If only the
brightest seniors take it, averages are higher. If more
lower-ranked seniors aspire to college and get SAT scores, this
could indicate better schools, but still depress the average.
</P>
<P>
   While, by themselves, overall SAT averages are faulty indicators
of school quality, more careful analysis suggests rarely noticed
improvements in public education.
</P>
<P>
   Even average scores are more positive than most people believe.
Math gains have been steady since 1980. While verbal scores fell in
the 1970s and '80s, they grew from 1990 to 1995 and have since been
stable. But by itself this tells little about school quality
because SAT test takers are not representative of all students.
</P>
<P>
   Disadvantaged minority students usually score lower than whites
(who are mostly middle class), even when scores of both are rising.
So when black students with lower (but rising) scores become a
larger share of test takers, the overall average can grow slowly,
although black and white scores each go up faster.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board reports how many seniors take the SAT, but
this too can be misleading. If dropouts increase, the share of
seniors taking the SAT could rise, even if fewer 18 year-olds
prepare for college. It would be better to look at test takers as a
percent of the entire age group, whether in school or out.
</P>
<P>
   There is another complication. Only about half of those applying
to selective colleges take the SAT. Others, mostly in the Midwest
and South, take a similar test, the ACT (once called American
College Testing).
</P>
<P>
   Accurate analyses need data from both. For example, Iowa's
average SAT score is higher than New York's, but this says nothing
about school quality in the two states. Iowa SAT-takers are
typically only those who can afford Eastern college tuition. Most
Iowans take the ACT, required by local colleges, so the state's
average ACT scores are relatively lower.
</P>
<P>
   This year's ACT results were also just released. An analysis of
both tests suggests, but does not prove, progress in minority
education, with whites also showing gains.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 (when scores were first reported by race), the number of
black SAT and ACT test takers, combined, was equal to 20 percent of
all black 18 year-olds. By this year, it nearly doubled, to 38
percent. This big growth in black students aiming for college
should cause lower average scores, because test taking is no longer
restricted only to the brightest black students.
</P>
<P>
   Yet average black scores have grown while the share of the age
group taking tests has also grown. (In 1995, the College Board
changed its scoring scale; the ACT changed in 1989. Scores reported
here have been converted to the new scales.)
</P>
<P>
   Average black SAT scores, math and verbal combined, have gone
from 790 in 1976 to 860 today. Black students' ACT scores have gone
from 15.1 to 17.0. (An ACT score of 17.0 is similar to 830 on the
SAT.) Gains were in both math and verbal scores.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is also positive for whites. White SAT and ACT test
takers have climbed from 32 to 57 percent of all 18-year olds. So
even if schools improved, average score declines should be
expected. Yet white scores have gone from 1043 to 1058 on the SAT,
and from 21.1 to 21.8 on the ACT. (An ACT score of 21.8 is similar
to 1022 on the SAT.) Again, both verbal and math scores have gone
up.
</P>
<P>
   Growing shares of 18 year-olds taking these tests is not
sufficient proof that more lower-ranked seniors do so. Perhaps,
many good students did not take the tests in 1976 because they
could not afford college, and now they can.
</P>
<P>
   But this is an implausible explanation for what seems to be a
democratizing trend, with rising achievement. Black and white
scores have both grown over the last 24 years, and the gap between
them has narrowed, even while test takers have probably become less
elite.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Department of Education reported that the gap
started to grow again in the 1990s on representative national
tests. On the SAT, the gap also recently widened, but only because
scores grew faster for whites than blacks, with both rising.
</P>
<P>
   No single indicator, whether the SAT, ACT or other exam, should
be used by itself to evaluate American education. But policymakers
have been content for too long with glib analyses of the SAT. Along
with the ACT, it possibly reveals an unrecognized trend of school
improvement.

<P>
   Joe Eszterhas is nervous. You know Joe _ he wrote Sharon Stone's
flasher pic, ``Basic Instinct.'' This is the guy who gave the world
the movie ``Showgirls'' _ and even though the world gave it right
back to him, holding it with tongs, he continues to be a Famous
Screenwriter. He's worried about Gore-Lieberman; he thinks they'll
start a new reign of virtue, so he took out a full-page ad in
Variety to warn his fellow sybarites. ``No more Hollywood money for
Al Gore,'' Eszterhas demanded. ``I'm a writer who likes pushing the
envelope, and Joe Lieberman frightens me.''
</P>
<P>
   Could the Democrats ask for anything more? It fits perfectly
with their new role as Safely Devout. Gore, according to The New
York Times, has said he asks himself ``What would Jesus do?'' when
confronted with a thorny moral dilemma. (Perhaps Jesus would tell
Pilate there is No Controlling Roman Authority.) Lieberman has been
making speeches so ridden with references to the Creator that even
the Anti-Defamation League is getting annoyed. If the Father of
``Showgirls'' is worried about these guys, they must be for real.
</P>
<P>
   The secular left wonders when someone will stand up to these
moralizing spiritualists. The religious right barks: How come these
guys can mention God without getting in trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Into this fray rides Eszterhas, warning the land that the very
future of envelope-pushing is in danger. And of course we must push
it, and push it again, even though it's been pushed and stretched
so much that it sags like the skin of a sick elephant. If Eszterhas
had directed ``Saving Private Ryan,'' he would have staged the
invasion of Normandy with an army of lesbian strippers. That's
pushing the envelope. ``Apollo 13''? Simple: three strippers
marooned in space. Which one is a bisexual murderess? Houston, we
have a problem _ and it's not wearing underwear!
</P>
<P>
   Take that, envelope!
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas is not the mainstream. But people like him are always
redefining the mainstream, pumping the tributaries full of brackish
water until the mainstream overflows its banks. Politicians like
Lieberman, earnest and clueless, are bailing with a pop-bottle cap.
George Bush pere, for example, once made the famous remark that the
nation needed to emulate the Waltons, not the Simpsons. This struck
the Gen X demographic as a classic clueless grandpa quote; he
probably cost the GOP 20 million votes for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing with Lieberman's pronouncements. In an interview with
Variety, Lieberman suggested that ``Friends'' was not fit for prime
time, but should be shown in movie theaters. Yes, raincoated
debauchers would have to skulk off to the triple XXX pornhouse to
see ``Friends'' and wait in moist, panting anticipation for the
next naughty single-entendre. If Lieberman is offended by
``Friends,'' someone show him the ``Tom Green Show'' and watch him
dissolve into a smoking puddle of embarrassed goo.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman has been talking about using the power of
government to affect your entertainment choices, and that's what
steams Eszterhas and others. Lieberman's made earnest, nerdy noises
about making TV stations' licenses contingent on a review of their
programming, and making it illegal for minors to be the targets of
ad campaigns for R-rated movies. Of course, no one wants minors to
be the targets, but how would you prove such a thing?
</P>
<P>
   It's the New Democrat approach. Small, precise, targeted laws
that make great sound bites and accomplish nothing. That's why
Eszterhas' campaign will be ignored by his fellow
envelope-piercers. Let Gore and Lieberman make their pious peeps.
Nothing will change.
</P>
<P>
   As for Eszterhas, well, Hollywood knows the score there, too.
Joe has a book to sell _ ``American Rhapsody,'' a funny and
coruscating account of impeachment. This is good publicity. And he
needs it: Once upon a time, the words ``From the Writer of `Basic
Instinct''' sold a few tickets, but people have come to realize
that's now a warning label.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps people will head to Amazon.com to buy his book. If they
do, they'll see a thumbnail biography with this precious line: ``He
has also won awards for attending every one of his son's Little
League games and for writing `Showgirls.'''
</P>
<P>
   What makes him prouder _ mainstreaming the crotch shot or
cheering from the sidelines of his son's games? The latter,
probably. But woe to the God-bothering moralist who thinks he
should be prouder of his son than his movies. Lunatics like that
are downright dangerous.

SOUTH AFRICAN PANEL TO OPENLY ADDRESS RACISM ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROODEPOORT, South Africa _ On a recent Saturday afternoon miners
from Durban Roodepoort Deep, a gold operation outside Johannesburg,
headed to the racetrack, their pockets jangling with spare coins.
</P>
<P>
   While their bosses enjoyed a round of golf, the miners laughed
nervously about playing the ponies.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little mirth. The horses are a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   As South Africans gather Wednesday for the first national
conference on racism since the end of apartheid, the plight of
Durban Deep's miners illustrates the thorny issues at stake and how
they are seen differently through the prism of race.
</P>
<P>
   The mine closed in March. The miners, nearly all of them black,
were given one day's notice and a small payout. This month another
notice came, giving the miners two days to pay hefty rent hikes or
clear out of the company hostels.
</P>
<P>
   The mining concern cited economics, saying gold prices are too
low for it to dig. The miners saw racism. The company, they say,
ignores new laws designed to protect workers from the abuses that
long marked the mining industry, and did nothing to help them find
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apartheid is alive and well in the mines,'' said Hezekiel
Manana, who has worked at the Deep since 1979. ``We get no job
training. We have no black shift bosses. . . . When we complain,
they call us `kaffirs' and tell us to go and talk to (President
Thabo) Mbeki about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Racism, never a simple issue in South Africa, at least was well
defined under apartheid, the segregrated system from 1948 to 1994.
Whites governed; Indians, Coloureds (people of mixed race), and
blacks were discriminated against in increasing severity according
to skin tone.
</P>
<P>
   Since the advent of democracy in 1994, accusations of racism
have come from every direction. The minister of safety and security
recently lambasted white women for using a national holiday to go
shopping rather than participating in public commemorations. Mbeki
cried racism after the white opposition leader criticized his
policies on AIDS and regional crises.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that blacks can't be racist, given South Africa's
history. Others say new laws meant to ensure equality amount to
racism against whites. In nearly every dispute, someone plays the
race card.
</P>
<P>
   However, race was rarely debated head-on. The Truth and
Reconciliation Commission explored the damages of apartheid. The
National Union of Mineworkers developed programs to ease racial
tensions in the mines. The Human Rights Commission held an inquiry
into racism in the media. New laws have gone some way toward
redressing inequalities.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, South Africa hasn't talked openly as a nation
about how racism is changing under democracy and what to do about
it. That discussion has finally arrived. Prompted by Mbeki's call
in February, the Human Rights Commission will convene a four-day
meeting Wednesday to explore the sources and forms of ethnic
division in modern South Africa and how to solve them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as South Africans have spoken about everything else
relating to race without calling it that. We've called it
reconciliation and nation building. But unless we force this
discussion and call it by its name, we won't achieve nation
building,'' said Pansy Tlakula, a member of the Human Rights
Commission. ``This conference sends a clear message about South
Africa's commitment to dealing with this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The preamble to the new constitution states that ``South Africa
belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   That ideal, however, remains unrealized. The commission held
nationwide hearings in July to listen to personal accounts of
racism from ordinary people. The report based on those hearings,
obtained by the Globe before its scheduled release today, shows
that ethnic tensions pervade every segment of South African society
and still manifest themselves in brutal ways.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes accounts of institutional and structural
racism; deep xenophobia against immigrants from other African
countries; and complex overlapping of racism with other forms of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings, the study stated that ``in the private
sector, only 7 percent of companies expressed a preference for
hiring black women, who are more likely to occupy unskilled
positions.'' The South African Graduates Development Association
told the commission that ``for every 100 black graduates, only 10
or 20 secure jobs despite affirmative action policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The report offers recommendations for government and private
initiatives to ease ethnic discrimination, including education
campaigns, independent investigations into workplace conditions,
and legal reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthea Jeffrey, of the South African Institute on Race
Relations in Johannesburg, warns that the state must be careful in
trying to legislate racism's end. She says South Africa must
respond to two definitions of racism: intentional disparate
treatment based on race, such as apartheid's laws depriving blacks
of the vote and land ownership; and racism that uses criteria _ job
experience, credit history _ that are supposedly race-neutral but
in practice favor whites.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first, Jeffrey argued, is the colorblind
ideal, ``where all individuals enjoy equal rights under the law.''
South Africa's new constitution already embodies that. The remedy
for the second ``is to classify individuals by race, so that those
identified as black can be exempted from normal criteria and
accorded preferential treatment until `equality of outcomes'
between white and black groups has been reached.''

GORE, BUSH SPAR OVER HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ As Al Gore kept up his criticism of George W.
Bush over health care Tuesday, the Texas governor offered a fresh
response, saying many of the vice president's proposals this year
are the same ones he and President Clinton talked about in 1992 yet
failed to enact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only on the issue of prescription drugs, it's on the
issue of middle-class tax cuts, as well,'' Bush said as he flew
from the parched dirt and 100-degree heat of Texas to the brilliant
sunshine, but considerably cooler climes, of the Down East coast.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, returning to the state of his most stinging defeat
during the primaries, Bush plans to appear at Winnacunnet High
School in Hampton, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember in 1992, the campaign was, `Vote for us, we're going
to provide middle-class tax cuts.' And guess what happened? There
was no middle-income tax cuts; there was a tax increase,'' Bush
said. ``The rhetoric in '92 was, `We're going to do something about
prescription drugs,' and nothing has happened. So, my point is,
it's time to give somebody else the opportunity to get something
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign responded with its own recollection of
politcal rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you ask the average American the question that
Republicans asked, `Are you better off now than you were eight
years ago,' the average American is going to answer, `Yes,' '' said
Gore spokesman Kym Spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, the Clinton-Gore administration has
made tremendous progress in reducing crime, reforming welfare,
reducing class sizes and bringing down the deficit and working on
shoring up Social Security and Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   In his New England swing, Bush continued his two-week focus on
education.
</P>
<P>
   With US Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine
looking on, Bush participated in an education roundtable discussion
at the Moore Middle School. Former Governor John McKernan was
moderator, and three of the participants were educators Bush
brought with him from Texas, while the other three were current or
former Maine education officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his pitch for giving local schools control of federal
education money in exchange for accountability standards, citing
one of the parents accompanying him, Norma Garza, from Brownsville,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``One size does not fit all,'' the Texas governor said. ``I
assure you the school in the district where Norma is from is really
different from the schools in Caribou, Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also responded to Gore's criticism late Monday that he
``put up or shut up'' when it comes to detailing a
prescription-drug plan for senior citizens. Next week, the governor
plans to expand upon his idea of forcing insurers participating in
Medicare to offer drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like his comments underlined the point I make that if
we want to get something done in Washington, we have to change the
tone of the discourse. It's not very presidential to me,'' Bush
told reporters aboard his campaign plane.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane replied: ``This is from a
campaign that has put up an ad touting a prescription drug benefit
they do not have. . . . The bottom line is, they cannot defend the
indefensible...nor can they explain the inexplicable: Why don't
they have an agenda to help America's families?''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Gore continued his week-long health care push,
promoting a plan to bring health insurance to all children by 2005
during a visit to Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are 11 million uninsured children nationwide;
Gore said his plan would ensure parents are ``never left powerless
and broke in the face of rising health care costs.'' His plan would
also cover 7 million parents who qualify for the existing
Children's Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP, which was enacted in 1997, is aimed at middle-income
children _ ones whose parents are too affluent for Medicaid but too
poor to buy their own health care. Gore's proposal would, through a
series of incentives to states, expand CHIP to include families
earning up to 250 percent of the poverty level _ a family of four
earning about $41,000 a year, Gore aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would also encourage states to let families earning
more than that to buy into the CHIP or Medicaid program. And it
would provide incentives to make sure all children who qualify for
CHIP are, in fact, enrolled. One element of the Gore plan is to
allow states to link their children's health insurance program to
the school lunch program, since most children in the lunch program
also need health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used the occasion to draw a contrast between his plan
and the campaign of Bush, which is has not moved beyond the general
concept of pushing private insurance to provide prescription drug
plans for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope my opponent will also present to you specifics.
...Presently, he has not presented any plan to adress this
problem'' of children's health care, Gore told a group gathered on
a school lawn. ``But again, it's all about you. You deserve a full
discussion of all the issues that need to be addressed. You deserve
to give a mandate in this election for what you would like to see
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign also mocked the Bush trip to Maine, saying
children in the state would miss out on needed school repairs under
the Bush education plan, which does not focus on ``bricks and
mortar'' programs such as school renovation.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lehane, the Gore spokesman, 85 percent of the 721
public schools in Maine _ a total of 612 schools _ are crumbling.
Gore has proposed a $115 billion national education plan, which
includes school repairs.
</P>
<P>
   After his stop in Portland, Bush flew to Portsmouth, N.H., and
attended a fund-raiser in Rye, N.H., at the home of Cabletron
co-founder Craig Benson. After another education event Wednesday at
Winnacunnet High, he was flying to Pennsylvania and Ohio, two key
electoral states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore flew to Eugene, Ore., where he and his running mate,
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, planned to return to
the issue of prescription drug coverage for the 39 million senior
citizens on Medicare. Wednesday the two were headed to Seattle for
more joint apperances highlighting health care.

FBI SPIED ON WRITERS, BOOK STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the 1930s and '40s hundreds of German writers _ Jews and
non-Jews _ fled Hitler and sought refuge in the United States. But
though they were given asylum, in the 1940s the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and other government agencies spied on them,
intercepting their mail and sometimes keeping tabs on their sex
lives, reports a book to be published in October by Yale University
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The book, by Alexander Stephan, a professor of German at Ohio
State University, is called ``Communazis.'' The title comes from
the word that the government, and even some exiles, occasionally
used to disparage those writers, who, driven out of Germany by the
Nazis, were supposedly totalitarians themselves, embracing
left-wing causes.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts, Stephan
obtained government files on the writers. That the government kept
files on Thomas Mann and Bertolt Brecht is already known, but
Stephan provides new details about them, and documents many other
cases, involving the writers Erich Maria Remarque, Lion
Feuchtwanger, Hermann Broch and many others.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the book, published in a longer version in Germany
in 1995, is that the surveillance was wider and deeper than
previously known. It was born of concerns over Nazi infiltration
and a fear that Germany might eventually establish a pro-Soviet
government.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan said he obtained more than 10,000 pages of documents
that show that the exiles were watched not only by the FBI, but
also by the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the
CIA; the Immigration and Naturalization Service; military
intelligence groups; the State Department; and other government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The surveillance demonstrates ``an absolute waste of manpower in
time of war,'' Stephan said in a telephone interview. ``These were
20th-century bureaucracies that outgrew themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Most writers had no idea that they were under surveillance,
Stephan said. And it did not matter what their politics were. ``In
the background of FBI surveillance lay a widespread public fear of
foreigners, especially German spies and saboteurs, combined with
deep distrust of liberal or socialist ideas,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carter, an FBI spokesman, said Tuesday, ``Since I have not
read the gentleman's book and have not had an opportunity to review
the files it would not be appropriate to make any response about
the accuracy of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the exiles settled in New York. Others went to Los
Angeles, which became their cultural center and which they called
Weimar on the Pacific. Franz Werfel, the author of ``The Song of
Bernadette,'' Feuchtwanger, author of ``Proud Destiny,'' and Mann
prospered, living in stately homes.
</P>
<P>
   Movie studios offered some ``lifesaver contracts,'' one-year
contracts to tide them over. But alienated from their language and
their culture, many of the writers were unhappy in Hollywood.
Brecht, for instance, wrote about Los Angeles in a poem called
``Reflections on Hell.'' Though openly a Marxist, Brecht was not a
member of the Communist Party. After appearing before the House
Un-American Activities Committee in 1947, he left the United States
and ended up in East Berlin, where he died in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Some files, like that on Remarque, the author of ``All Quiet on
the Western Front,'' are sparse. But others show, for instance,
that the agents took an intense interest in the exiles' sex lives.
The immigration agency called Klaus Mann, Thomas Mann's son, ``a
well-known sexual pervert'' with ``communistic sympathies.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI kept watch on Klaus, author of the novel ``Mephisto,''
at the Bedford Hotel in New York. One informant, ``T3,'' said that
a soldier stayed overnight with him regularly. ``Informant ...
advised ... that the only suitable sleeping place in Mann's room is
a single bed.'' Nonetheless Klaus was accepted into the military
intelligence unit of the Army and later served in the Army in Italy
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI even speculated that Klaus had sex with his sister,
Erika. ``Confidential informants,'' stated one file, told agents
that ``Klaus and Erica Mann were having affairs together.'' Her
first name was misspelled.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI noted that Erika wore her hair in ``a short mannish bob
with a part on the right side,'' and was affiliated with the
Peppermill political revue, made up of ``members of the Hebrew
race.'' Stephan wrote that eventually Erika got in touch with the
FBI and volunteered information. Her sister, Elisabeth Mann
Borgese, in a letter printed in The New York Times in 1993, said
that Erika Mann was never paid by the FBI and that she provided
information on fellow exiles only to clear them of suspicion.

<P>
   (Optional Trim)
</P>
<P>
   In another case of sexual prying, the book reports, the FBI
planted wiretaps in the Chalet Motor Hotel in Santa Monica, Calif.,
to record the pillow talk of Brecht, who was married, with his
mistress, Ruth Berlau. Berlau never showed up. The FBI also
intercepted the couple's love letters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more famous writers, Thomas Mann, who won a Nobel
Prize in Literature, was perhaps the most pro-American, said
Stephan. Yet ``they collected about 130 pages on Mann.'' Stephan
said that Walt Disney was one of those who gave Mann's name to the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, Elmer Linberg, an FBI agent, interviewed Mann. Linberg
recalled recently in a telephone conversation that he ``was
cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us about several people in close touch with the
Russians,'' among them Brecht,'' Linberg, who is now retired, said
in a recent telephone interview. ``Every time Soviet intelligence
agents came to Los Angeles, they would go and be with Brecht for
several sessions. Mann told us that. We already knew from
surveillance of Brecht.'' Linberg said he did not take part in
surveillance of Mann.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mann was cooperative, reported the documents, agents
read his correspondence, and derogatory information was placed in
his file.
</P>
<P>
   The emigres wanted to form a committee that would prefigure a
German government in exile, with Mann as its leader. But the
Americans opposed it because, the Office of Strategic Services said
in a memo, ``we do not like some of the personalities involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 Mann moved back to Europe. But by 1955 the charge that
he had engaged in ``Communist-front associations and activities
consistently since 1920s'' had resurfaced in his immigration and
naturalization file. Mann feared that his American citizenship
would be revoked, but that did not occur because he was elderly and
already living abroad, writes Stephen.
</P>
<P>
   He writes that the agents' interviews with the emigres sometimes
took on a bullying tone. The Office of Strategic Services described
Feuchtwanger as ``the archtype of intellectual who believes in a
patent solution for all problems ... vain and not always reliable
... has no physical or moral courage ... should not be considered
as an `homme politique.''' His dossier ran 1,000 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Feuchtwanger applied for citizenship, and immigration agents
interviewed him. Although he was dying of cancer, the agents
``tried to rattle Feuchtwanger by persistent questioning,'' and
``brusque interruptions,'' Stephan writes. Feuchtwanger's
application for citizenship was denied.
</P>
<P>
   (End Optional Trim)
</P>
<P>
   The American government's reach also extended into Mexico,
Stephan writes. There, personnel from the FBI, CIA, State
Department, Immigration and Naturalization Service and other
government agencies focused on Anna Seghers, author of the
best-selling anti-Nazi novel ``The Seventh Cross.'' Seghers, who
was a Communist Party member, had been denied entry into the United
States. American agents in Mexico burglarized homes, tapped phones
and intercepted letters to Seghers, which had coded messages
written in invisible ink, the book says.
</P>
<P>
   The files are filled with anonymous denunciations. Agents jotted
down the names of those who parked near Communist Party
headquarters in Los Angeles. There are also frequent misspellings.
In one mistake, agents confused the Free Germany Movement in Mexico
with one founded in exile by the right-wing German Otto Strasser.
</P>
<P>
   The government continued its investigations of some writers even
after they had died. Five years after the death of Thomas Mann's
brother Heinrich, author of ``Professor Unrat,'' on which the
Marlene Dietrich film ``The Blue Angel'' was based, FBI agents were
discussing the identity of one informant on Heinrich Mann and his
credibility. Franz Werfel's file continued for nine years after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   One FBI agent sympathized with the spied-upon exiles. ``Most
members of the committee have never lost their fear of the
police,'' he wrote in the files, referring to the exiles' Free
Germany committee. ``They feel that their activities are
continually observed and under surveillance, which especially
hampers the activities of those members who are not American
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lamphere, a retired FBI agent, said in a telephone
interview, ``It is important you understand, we were engaged in a
very serious time in the Soviet Union.'' Lamphere, the author, with
Tom Shachtman, of ``The FBI-KGB War: A Special Agent's Story''
(Random House, 1986), interviewed Gerhart Eisler, a Communist Party
functionary and journalist who later became the chief propaganda
spokesman and a member of the Central Committee in East Germany.
``We had many investigations that went nowhere. That's the nature
of counter-intelligence. People like Eisler came in as refugees and
immediately began working against this country and for the Soviet
Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the spying, no one except Eisler was deported, Stephan
said. ``This is not the Gestapo, not the KGB,'' he said. ``Nobody
was harassed in his writing. In many other political systems people
were not permitted to write and publish.''

   Cruise ships: I like them, I really, really like them
</P>
<P>
   By Whenever the subject of a cruise came up, I had a one-word
answer: never.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships, to me, were floating prisons, places from which
travelers had no escape if something went wrong. I prefer knowing I
can pack up and leave if the hotel plumbing backs up, the kitchen
begins serving salmonella as the nightly special or the fireworks
display starts coming from the next room.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the problem. The family had decided that we would
visit Alaska this summer. To really see Alaska, you can't just stay
on land. You can visit Mount McKinley, fish for salmon in the Kenai
River and try to determine whether there actually is darkness in
Anchorage during the summer solstice (there isn't, though my son
reports that there is a period of dusk).
</P>
<P>
   To really see Alaska, however, you have to be on the water. You
have to get into Prince William Sound. You have to get into College
Fjord and Glacier Bay. Which means you have to get on a ... cruise
ship. You can rent much smaller, customized ships for the trip, but
you need six months' revenue from the Prudhoe Bay oil reserves to
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   So you talk to your travel agent. You book passage on Princess
Cruises because your travel agent tells you that the company has
this deal where you stay in Princess lodges, then get on the
Princess ship for your trip from Seward southeast through the
Inland Passage to Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   And the land part works out fine. You fly into Anchorage
(four-hour time difference) and arrive at 9 p.m. Sunday when the
sun is so high and so bright that you think you're just waking up.
The Princess bus takes you to the hotel. The next day, the Princess
train takes you to the Princess Lodge in Mount McKinley on a clear
day when the summit is visible for miles, and the tour guides are
saying, almost apologetically, that ``only one person'' has died so
far during the summer trying to climb North America's highest peak.
</P>
<P>
   The Princess train and bus take you south to the Kenai peninsula
and the Princess lodge. Then it's on to Seward and the Princess ...
cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you realize is that you're not part of the club.
All around you, cruise veterans are comparing their six other
Alaska cruises. They're talking knowledgeably about the Lido Deck
and when to do your laundry. They are ready, like Spaniards waiting
in Pamplona for the running of the bulls.
</P>
<P>
   And what do you know? This boat, the Sea Princess, is barely 4
years old and very nice. Our stateroom, starboard side, has a great
balcony for viewing. Our steward drops by and tells us to call if
we need anything. My wife, our two children and the other family
we're traveling with grab lunch at the 24-hour buffet _ which we
label ``the trough'' _ and a few hours later we slide out of the
harbor precisely at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the astonishing part. Everything about the
seven-day trip went on time, almost flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   We left port on time. We arrived on time. We had no mechanical
problems. The luck carried over to the weather. We had virtually no
rain, even in Ketchikan where it rains about 180 inches a year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the food on board, it was good, sometimes very good.
Really liked the Baked Alaska presentation the last night. But the
food paled in comparison to the service.
</P>
<P>
   When you're cruising, I learned, your dinner waiter becomes more
important than your stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   Our ship carried about 2,000 people, which is capacity. With two
dining rooms and two sittings (5:45 and 8), that means 500 diners
each time. Our waiter and assistant waiter were from Romania, and
the hardest thing at the end of the trip was reminding my
16-year-old daughter that, no, she could not expect the same level
of service back home.
</P>
<P>
   A special order? No problem. A little extra helping of the
appetizer or the entree? No problem. Bring out several kinds of
wine until we decided? No problem? A smile for a tired 5-year-old
girl? No problem. Pose for a picture? No problem. Tour of the
kitchen for anyone interested? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoyable as the dining was, the scenery was better.
</P>
<P>
   On the way into Glacier Bay, the ship basically idled for nearly
an hour as we stood on our balcony watching whales roll and eagles
dive for pieces of chopped-up fish. The bright, polar morning was
nearly still, and the whoosh of air coming through blowholes
drifted across the water.
</P>
<P>
   Later, we saw seals sprawled on ice floes near Johns Hopkins
Glacier. I'd be lying, however, if I didn't worry about the
possible environmental consequences of ships going in and out of
the bay each so often. You get the feeling that restrictions will
have to be imposed at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trip, I thought I'd be stir crazy after two days at
sea. Instead, the week went by with astonishing quickness. It
helped that we went on excursions each of the three middle days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what I had imagined as a floating prison became a
floating small town. When it works right, a cruise ship is a fairly
remarkable place. It hit me one day as I was running on a treadmill
in the workout area. Large windows faced the stern, and I watched
as we pulled out of Glacier Bay. Here I was, watching ESPN via
satellite in a climate-controlled environment while, in the
background, a chunk of ice that is who knows how ancient fell into
the water. One content inmate in his floating prison.

   Restaurateurs fight back against the food police
</P>
<P>
   ByEAT AND DIE:
</P>
<P>
   Eat and die: The Center for Science in the Public Interest has
been almost that blunt in its denouncement of the American diet,
taking to task such favorites as burgers, fettuccine alfredo, kung
pao chicken, ice cream, movie popcorn and more. And it has
certainly made some diners change their eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   But CSPI has also laid a guilt trip on the pleasures of eating.
And for that, the Guest Choice Network, a group of more than 30,000
restaurant and tavern operators, has decided to fight back on a new
Web site called CSPINOT.com. (That's CSPI NOT, get it?) Admittedly
biased, the site wants to arrest the food police and present the
other side of the plate. Says Ronni Chernoff, past president of the
American Dietetic Association, ``We have a totally different view
on food and nutrition than (Center for Science in the Public
Interest director Michael Jacobson) does. He takes all the pleasure
out of eating by scaring people and using terror tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Honey, I've shrunk the Oreos: The timing _ right as school
starts _ makes you think Nabisco did this for the kids. But plenty
of adults are excited about the new mini Oreos. The bite-size
cookies weigh 1/10 ounce and are 1/5 the size of their parents, or
small enough to bring no guilt but big enough to cover a quarter.
Nine is considered a serving. Look for the minis in 8-ounce bags
and 1.5-ounce snack packs.
</P>
<P>
   Some like it hot: But most don't, says Taco Bell, which reports
that it goes through 5.2 billion packets of hot sauce a year. About
2.6 billion of those are ``Mild,'' 1.8 billion are medium spicy
``Hot'' and 800 million are five-alarm, according to USA Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't prove it by Central Texans, who always thrill to the
burn of back-to-back weekend August fire shows in Austin. Recently,
the Texas Fiery Foods Show, in its fourth year, saw record
attendance and several vendors sold out of their products. And the
Austin Chronicle Hot Sauce Festival, in its 10th year, attracted
approximately 10,000 salsa lovers.
</P>
<P>
   What a whopper: Maida Heatter has always believed in the power
of cookies, and now the restaurant world is catching on, notes the
September issue of Food &AMP; Wine. The magazine salutes Heatter and
her recipe for Chocolate Whoppers, which begat similar bakery
wonders all over the country, including Austin, by such names as
Black Gold (Upper Crust), Triple Chocolate Cookies (Schlotzsky's)
and Whopper (Sweetish Hill). The best chocolate cookie recipe in
the world, it is pure decadence and contains only 1/4 cup flour.
The rest is chocolate and nuts.

 &HT;    Dispute over reasons behind increase in Florida's minority
students
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ A record number of minorities have enrolled
as freshmen this fall at Florida's 10 public universities.
</P>
<P>
   But while that increase _ 1,234 more students, or 12 percent
more minorities than last year _ is undisputed, there is
disagreement about the factors behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush credits his One Florida program, which relies on
factors such as ZIP codes and family income instead of affirmative
action programs to enroll more minority students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown that we can promote both opportunity and
diversity in higher education without using unfair and legally
suspect racial preferences,'' Bush, flanked by university
officials, said Tuesday as he celebrated the preliminary enrollment
figures. ``Thanks to the efforts of our outstanding universities,
the One Florida Initiative has succeeded in producing the most
diverse freshman class in the history of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase in minority students is accompanied by
unanticipated high enrollment at almost every Florida university.
Because of that overall growth, the percentage of minorities
starting college statewide has barely changed. Last year minorities
made up 36.6 percent of the freshman class; this year they account
for 36.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush critics, including some educators, say the credit for the
increase belongs largely to the universities. Under pressure from
the governor, the universities stepped up efforts to attract
minorities, from more high school visits to mass mailings to hiring
special coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   The critics point out that One Florida, in its first year, was
stalled until July by a court challenge and consequently, came too
late to have a direct effect on admissions this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of extra recruitment,'' said Florida Atlantic
University Admissions Director Dick Griffin. ``That certainly
played a part.'' The number of black freshman enrolled at FAU
increased from 223 last year to 358 this fall. Hispanic students
attending the school increased from 184 to 230.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most vocal One Florida opponents, Sen. Kendrick Meek,
D-Miami, said, ``It's really an understatement and misleading for
the governor to say this is a result of his ... program.'' More
reliable results won't come for another two to three years after a
study of retention and then graduation rates, said Meek, who in
January staged a sit-in with Rep. Tony Hill at Lt. Gov. Frank
Brogan's office protesting One Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And even if those results are positive, he worries that under
One Florida, minority growth would be too dependent on the
subjective goals of a governor and education officials, instead of
a matter of objective policy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite thoughts otherwise, Bush said Florida is better off with
One Florida now in place. Elsewhere courts have ruled affirmative
action programs unconstitutional, and ballot initiatives have
forced states to abandon their racial quota and preference
programs. States that continue to do nothing, he said, ``do so at
their own jeopardy.''

   Arthritis a crippling disease with more than 100 variations
</P>
<P>
   By Carolyn Susman
</P>
<P>
   c. 20000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - ``People like you shouldn't have
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Even 25 years later, those hurtful words from a doctor she
trusted bring tears to Leona Malone's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   She was 31 and already eight years into a battle with a vicious,
debilitating disease: rheumatoid arthritis. She had suffered so
much with painful and swollen joints that made it hard to walk,
hard to chew, hard to use her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted a baby,'' Malone recalls, the supercharged
memory momentarily taking her breath away and causing her eyes to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   But she had stumbled into the office of a doctor who didn't
think a woman who might someday be wheelchair-bound should take on
that responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   While friends her age were pursuing their dreams full speed,
Malone found herself fighting just to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to excel,'' she recalls of her plans to get a
doctorate that were cut short by her illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I just wanted to be normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis. Typically, it conjures images of old, bent people
suffering with a disease that is an inevitable part of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Few know that there are 100 forms of arthritis, and that one out
of six Americans is affected, nearly 300,000 of them children with
juvenile arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   There is no established cause or cure.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoarthritis is the most common form, but rheumatoid is the
most common form in children and one of the most virulent. It
primarily affects girls and women. Scientists don't know why.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Aida Turturro, who plays Janice Soprano on the popular
HBO series ``The Sopranos,'' was diagnosed at 12 with rheumatoid
arthritis. Actress Kathleen Turner, famed for her roles in ``Body
Heat'' and ``Romancing the Stone,'' was diagnosed at 38.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chronic, inflammatory disease that can affect the
heart, nerves, the lungs, any organ system,'' says Dr. Michael
Schweitz, a West Palm Beach rheumatologist who treats Leona Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible disease, a nasty disease. Rheumatoid carries
with it a certain mortality from the body being ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Projections are that all forms of arthritis will increase as
baby boomers age, with 60 million people suffering from it by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Centers for Disease Control has called it the next
epidemic,'' Schweitz says.
</P>
<P>
   For Leona Malone, the life-altering illness hit at 23. She was a
graduate student at the University of Miami when she experienced
what she thought was an attack of bursitis in her shoulder. Later,
her feet started to swell and hurt. Eventually, her feet would
swell from a size 7 to a size 10 because of the chronic
inflammation that is characteristic of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have these flare-ups that were so horrible. Your whole
system was hurting and burning. It was hurtful to even have a sheet
touch your body.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers how, when she was first diagnosed and
hospitalized, friends brought her ``old people's'' gifts, driving
home the perception that arthritis is only a disease of the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd bring dusting powder or note paper; they'd bring bed
jackets and forget I liked jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   That got her down, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never thought of giving up. I thought, the doctors will
fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   They never could, of course. She's undergone 23 surgeries on her
hips, shoulders, elbows and feet, and a drug regimen that at one
time included so much aspirin _ 16-20 tablets a day _ that her ears
would ring.
</P>
<P>
   She's even tried alternative concoctions, like large doses of
cod liver oil, gin-soaked raisins and copper bracelets. She never
stopped taking her prescription drugs, she said, and has added
glucosamine _ an herbal remedy that Arthritis Today, the magazine
of the Arthritis Foundation (www.arthritis.org), says shows
evidence of easing pain and preserving joint cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her willingness to take on any available treatment,
she's been left with hands that are deformed from the disease. This
is largely, she believes, because drugs that are available today
that have the capability to modify the course of the illness
weren't available when she was first diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Those drugs, which include a class introduced in 1998 known as
biologic response modifiers, have had a tremendous impact on the
disease for some. They work by blocking chemicals in the body that
cause inflammation and tissue damage.
</P>
<P>
   And they have proved the savior of at least one local child with
rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Toi Leon is a cherubic little girl with a smile that has won her
beauty pageants. At 7, she has lived with juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis five years.
</P>
<P>
   Toi might have suffered similarly to Leona Malone. She was
deteriorating quickly, and her parents, Linda and Larry, had
already ordered a specially equipped wheelchair for her. But she
began taking one of the new biologic drugs, Enbrel, more than a
year ago, and her improvement has been dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   She hops around her home, looking little like a child who had
been dependent on braces, walkers and wheelchairs only a short time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely put her disease into almost a total
remission,'' says Linda Leon, who _ until her daughter was
diagnosed _ was one of the people who ``had no idea children could
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug, however, is very expensive. Toi's medication costs
$1,200 a month, her mother said, and Linda had to battle to prove
nothing else worked before her insurance would cover it.
</P>
<P>
   But Toi had been through the mill before then.
</P>
<P>
   She woke up one morning and couldn't walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was screaming, and dragging her leg across the floor,''
Linda remembers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrifying time. Surgeries, medications, physical
therapy and doctor visits. The diagnosis puzzled the Leons, but
Linda was later diagnosed, herself, with lupus, another form of
arthritis, and thinks she may have passed on a genetic tendency to
Toi.
</P>
<P>
   The disease took its toll on the youngster. She had trouble with
potty training, and wasn't toilet-trained until she was almost 4.
She had little mobility but hated the walker she was supposed to
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she couldn't walk, she would find ways to get around,''
Linda said. ``She would hop, she would crawl, she would roll. She
was very determined. Emotionally, she's more aware (than other
children.) She's been there; she's lived it.''
</P>
<P>
   She had a battle with anorexia, too, a brutal side-effect of
another medication that made her lose her sense of taste and endure
bouts of vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Toi fell behind in schoolwork and ended up in a Head Start
program that gives youngsters an extra edge in school. But when she
started second grade this year, to her mother's delight, she was
put in a gifted program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she startles visitors by reading aloud from a book about
the body's blood supply, and by announcing, ``I came from the
uterus. Everyone came from the uterus!''
</P>
<P>
   She wants to be a doctor, not a strange choice, perhaps, for a
child who has spent almost her whole life at doctor's offices.
She's already had five operations.
</P>
<P>
   A natural beauty, Toi loves to participate in beauty pageants
and to model. Linda encourages whatever she enjoys, including tap
and jazz lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Toi's modeled for the Arthritis Foundation and for department
store advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd just do it. She's very confident on stage. She had to
smile and project herself. There's a stance you're supposed to
have, she can't do that. So she'll smile and wave to compensate for
what she can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Linda, angry at first that her child was struck down, finds
her own compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder why it has to be your child and why God did it to
your child. Now, I look at the whole picture, and I figure God did
it for a reason. Because it's a disease a lot of people don't know
about, I have to speak out so people are aware.''
</P>
<P>
   And today, Leona Malone has a life her early doctors might never
have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Carrah, is 24 and studying to be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   And she is a bereavement counselor at Hospice of Palm Beach
County and an honored volunteer for the Arthritis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disease happens in a vacuum,'' she says. ``Life goes on.''

 &HT;    HAMMERING ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore, turning his focus to children's health, says it is
``put up or shut up time'' for George W. Bush to begin dealing with
the specifics of campaign issues. ``The time for generalities
without specifics I think is just about over,'' Gore told
reporters. He said he was largely at a loss to evaluate Bush's
proposals since they lack details. ``I don't really know how they
make it all add up,'' he said. The Bush campaign said that kind of
talk is ``not very presidential.'' Gore plugged away again Tuesday,
in Albuquerque, N.M., for his proposed $100 billion expansion of
child health insurance. Political strategists say that issue can be
used to target Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING EDUCATION ATTACK TO SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   Just as he did after his 18-point defeat by John McCain in New
Hampshire in February, George W. Bush responded to his recent sag
in the polls with a sharp attack on Al Gore, unleashing sharp
criticism on education. Bush accused Gore of offering a plan ``with
an illusion of accountability,'' presiding over a ``national
tragedy'' in reading, and of being ``locked in old ways.'' Bush was
holding an education discussion Tuesday at a middle school in
Portland, Maine. Today he is scheduled to hold another education
discussion at a high school in Hampton, N.H. In between, he was to
attend a $5,000-a-couple fund-raiser for the state Republican Party
in Rye, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   CHARACTER AND RELIGIOUS VALUES
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney is promoting popular conservative themes _
character-building and a strong defense _ on a three-day tour
through Missouri, Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida.
He told a gathering of Christian athletes in Kansas City, Mo.,
today that teaching children about character is as important as
showing them how to read and write. Cheney shared the podium with
members of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, a national group
that encourages students and coaches to practice Christian values
and influence others to get involved with churches. One student
participant, Erica Garris, quoted scripture and told the gathering,
``I stand here today professing God as my savior.''
</P>
<P>
   A SCOLDING ON RELIGIOUS OVEREMPHASIS
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about his recent statements on the campaign trail, the
Anti-Defamation League called on Joe Lieberman to refrain from
overt expressions of religious values and beliefs, stating that
``appealing to voters along religious lines is contrary to the
American ideal.'' Said a statement from Howard Berkowitz and
Abraham Foxman of the ADL: ``Candidates should feel comfortable
explaining their religious convictions to voters. At the same time,
however, we believe there is a point at which an emphasis on
religion in a political campaign becomes inappropriate and even
unsettling in a religiously diverse society such as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   APPLYING PRESSURE FOR DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign chairman tried today to increase pressure on
George W. Bush to accept three nationally televised, prime-time
debates in October, saying they would ``give the greatest number of
voters the chance to hear the candidates directly.'' Bush has
agreed to three presidential debates without specifying which ones.
Bush responded, ``I would welcome all three being in prime time,''
but his campaign said that didn't necessarily mean he would accept
any of the debate commission's proposed dates or formats. Bush has
said he prefers relatively informal debates, such as a session
during the primaries when the participants were seated around a
table with CNN's Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   TWO NEW POLLS SHOW A TIE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Al Gore are locked in a dead heat in two new
presidential polls, evidence that Gore is holding his
post-convention poll bounce. The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of
likely voters showed Bush at 46 percent, Gore at 45 percent, Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader at 3 percent and Reform Party candidate
Pat Buchanan at 1 percent. A poll by ICR of Media, Pa. showed Gore
at 44 percent and Bush at 41 percent among registered voters. Both
polls had error margins of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   TAX ISSUE JUST NOT CUTTING IT
</P>
<P>
   Even as George W. Bush pursues his call for a broad federal tax
cut, a new ABCNEWS.com poll shows that three-quarters of Americans
express other priorities for the budget surplus. Twenty-five
percent give top priority to cutting income taxes, up 7 points
since July. But many more _ 42 percent _ prefer to use the surplus
to strengthen Social Security, 16 percent favor debt reduction, and
14 percent give priority to ``other domestic programs.'' When those
``other programs'' are specified as education and health care,
according to the poll (3 percentage point margin of error), support
for that spending rises and support for a tax cut shrinks to 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   NAMING NAMES IN DRUG COMPANY ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore escalated his attacks against the pharmaceutical
industry, criticizing two drug companies by name and calling for
greater competition in the industry. Gore singled out
Schering-Plough, which makes Claritin, and American Home Products,
the parent company of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which makes
Lodine. In the case of Claritin, Gore said the manufacturer spent
more money on advertising than on research. And in the case of
Lodine, an arthritis medicine prescribed for both people and pets,
he said American Home Products charged pharmacies more than
veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA NOW ONE OF THOSE BATTLEGROUND STATES
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's tough talk against Cuba _ publicly
accusing the communist regime of denying exit permits to Cubans
holding U.S. visas _ came as Al Gore stepped up his efforts to win
Florida, an electoral powerhouse that is home to thousands of
Cuban-American voters. Florida is considered crucial to George W.
Bush's hopes of winning the White House, but Gore appears to be
running a surprisingly strong campaign in the state where Bush's
brother, Jeb, is governor. ``Florida is in play. We're all
surprised,'' said Jim Kane of Florida Voter, a nonpartisan polling
organization.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY TRAIL FOLLOWED TO 9 STATES
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials pumped $6.1 million into nine states
last month, providing an early road map of where they plan to
compete this fall. The list includes Pennsylvania, Illinois,
Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, California, Oregon and Washington.
Topping the list was Florida, where the national GOP sent more than
$1 million to the state party last month. ``None of the states are
any surprise,'' said Republican political consultant Eddie Mahe.
``Those are the same states (both candidates) have been visiting
since Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN CHARGED WITH PLAGIARISM
</P>
<P>
   A Southern Methodist University economics professor has sued Pat
Buchanan and his publisher, Little Brown &AMP; Co., for copyright
infringement. A lawsuit filed in federal court by Ravendra Batra
alleges that Buchanan's 1998 book, ``The Great Betrayal,''
plagiarized parts of Batra's books, including charts and graphs.
Buchanan's book argues against globalization of economies, and he
blasts the major political parties for seeking trade treaties that
he believes hurt American workers and undermine the nation's
sovereignty. Batra appeared on the CNN news program ``Crossfire''
in the early 1990s when Buchanan was co-host.
</P>
<P>
   WEIGHING REFORM IN THREE STATES
</P>
<P>
   California, Oregon and Missouri will offer voters the chance in
November to overhaul their campaign finance laws. California's
Proposition 34 would limit political donations from most sources at
$20,000 for gubernatorial candidates, $5,000 for other statewide
candidates and $3,000 for legislative candidates. Initiatives in
Missouri and Oregon would finance campaigns with taxpayer money,
putting those states in the forefront of the campaign-finance
reform movement. California, on the other hand, is considering the
kinds of donation caps that 44 states already have. In California
now, individuals, corporations and other special interests can
donate as much as they want.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA CLUB SPENDING IN 12 RACES
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club is returning to the airwaves with $8 million in
TV and radio ads praising a few Republicans and many more
Democrats. Positive ads will air about Democratic Reps. Lane Evans
of Illinois; Mark Udall of Colorado; Joseph Hoeffel of
Pennsylvania; Rush Holt of New Jersey; and Brian Baird, Jay Inslee
and Adam Smith of Washington state; Republican Rep. Jim Leach of
Iowa; and Republican Sens. Jim Jeffords of Vermont and William Roth
of Delaware. Critical ads are airing against two Republicans: Sen.
Slade Gorton of Washington state and former Virginia Gov. George
Allen, a Senate hopeful running against Democratic Sen. Charles
Robb.
</P>
<P>
   THE CASE OF THE STOLEN SIGNATURES
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader barely met the deadline for filing to get on
Wyoming's general election ballot, but the theft of nearly 650
petition signatures on his behalf is casting doubt on whether his
name will appear at all. Someone walked off with a clipboard full
of signatures at restaurant in Laramie last week, according to
Nader volunteer Roberta Harper-McIntosh. Supporters turned in about
4,000 signatures to state election officials just one minute before
Monday night's filing deadline, but they had hoped to deliver
between 5,000 and 6,000 _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   UNION MOBILIZATION IN KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, although not as heavily organized as some other
states, is fertile ground for labor this year. One of the most
competitive races in the nation has Democrat Scotty Baesler trying
to win back his House seat from Republican Rep. Ernie Fletcher.
Baesler lost the seat in 1998 when he ran unsuccessfully for the
Senate. GOP Reps. Anne Northup and Edward Whitfield, whose
districts have sizable union populations, also face spirited
challenges. Bill Londrigan, head of the Kentucky AFL-CIO, is well
aware that the three races could help decide who controls the House
next year.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN SENATE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   In Florida's Senate contest, state Insurance Commissioner Bill
Nelson, a Democrat, and Rep. Bill McCollum, a Republican, are
locked in a race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Connie Mack
that is critical to Democrats' uphill fight to win control of the
Senate. But the race is more than that. Coupled with the Democrats'
likely recovery of a Senate seat in Georgia _ although they might
lose one in Virginia _ the Florida race could be an important
marker in the evolution of two-party politics in the South.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNING ON WITH A MORE VIABLE CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Tim Goeglein, who described his two-year stint as spokesman for
conservative activist and unsuccessful presidential candidate Gary
Bauer as ``two really terrific years,'' is joining George W. Bush's
campaign Friday. Goeglein, in an e-mail to correspondents covering
the Republican campaign, said that he will be working as part of
the Bush-Cheney communications team.
</P>
<P>
   `BASIC POLITICS'
</P>
<P>
   Joe Eszterhas, the high-priced screenwriter behind such sexually
charged films as ``Showgirls'' and ``Basic Instinct,'' wants
Hollywood to withhold support from Al Gore because of the
anti-media rhetoric of his running mate, Joe Lieberman. Eszterhas,
whose own work has often been critically panned for its lurid
nature, came out swinging against Gore and Lieberman in a full-page
open letter in the entertainment trade paper Daily Variety. ``No
more Hollywood money for Al Gore,'' Eszterhas admonishes, in the
ad. ``I'm a writer who likes pushing the envelope, and Joe
Lieberman frightens me.''

<P>
   Even as George W. Bush pursues his call for a broad federal tax
cut, a new ABCNEWS.com poll shows that three-quarters of Americans
express other priorities for the budget surplus. Twenty-five
percent give top priority to cutting income taxes, up 7 points
since July. But many more _ 42 percent _ prefer to use the surplus
to strengthen Social Security, 16 percent favor debt reduction, and
14 percent give priority to ``other domestic programs.'' When those
``other programs'' are specified as education and health care,
according to the poll (3 percentage point margin of error), support
for that spending rises and support for a tax cut shrinks to 16
percent.

   NAMING NAMES IN DRUG COMPANY ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore escalated his attacks against the pharmaceutical
industry, criticizing two drug companies by name and calling for
greater competition in the industry. Gore singled out
Schering-Plough, which makes Claritin, and American Home Products,
the parent company of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, which makes
Lodine. In the case of Claritin, Gore said the manufacturer spent
more money on advertising than on research. And in the case of
Lodine, an arthritis medicine prescribed for both people and pets,
he said American Home Products charged pharmacies more than
veterinarians.

<P>
   FLORIDA NOW ONE OF THOSE BATTLEGROUND STATES
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's tough talk against Cuba _ publicly
accusing the communist regime of denying exit permits to Cubans
holding U.S. visas _ came as Al Gore stepped up his efforts to win
Florida, an electoral powerhouse that is home to thousands of
Cuban-American voters. Florida is considered crucial to George W.
Bush's hopes of winning the White House, but Gore appears to be
running a surprisingly strong campaign in the state where Bush's
brother, Jeb, is governor. ``Florida is in play. We're all
surprised,'' said Jim Kane of Florida Voter, a nonpartisan polling
organization.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY TRAIL FOLLOWED TO 9 STATES
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials pumped $6.1 million into nine states
last month, providing an early road map of where they plan to
compete this fall. The list includes Pennsylvania, Illinois,
Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, California, Oregon and Washington.
Topping the list was Florida, where the national GOP sent more than
$1 million to the state party last month. ``None of the states are
any surprise,'' said Republican political consultant Eddie Mahe.
``Those are the same states (both candidates) have been visiting
since Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN CHARGED WITH PLAGIARISM
</P>
<P>
   A Southern Methodist University economics professor has sued Pat
Buchanan and his publisher, Little Brown &AMP; Co., for copyright
infringement. A lawsuit filed in federal court by Ravendra Batra
alleges that Buchanan's 1998 book, ``The Great Betrayal,''
plagiarized parts of Batra's books, including charts and graphs.
Buchanan's book argues against globalization of economies, and he
blasts the major political parties for seeking trade treaties that
he believes hurt American workers and undermine the nation's
sovereignty. Batra appeared on the CNN news program ``Crossfire''
in the early 1990s when Buchanan was co-host.
</P>
<P>
   WEIGHING REFORM IN THREE STATES
</P>
<P>
   California, Oregon and Missouri will offer voters the chance in
November to overhaul their campaign finance laws. California's
Proposition 34 would limit political donations from most sources at
$20,000 for gubernatorial candidates, $5,000 for other statewide
candidates and $3,000 for legislative candidates. Initiatives in
Missouri and Oregon would finance campaigns with taxpayer money,
putting those states in the forefront of the campaign-finance
reform movement. California, on the other hand, is considering the
kinds of donation caps that 44 states already have. In California
now, individuals, corporations and other special interests can
donate as much as they want.

   SIERRA CLUB SPENDING IN 12 RACES
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club is returning to the airwaves with $8 million in
TV and radio ads praising a few Republicans and many more
Democrats. Positive ads will air about Democratic Reps. Lane Evans
of Illinois; Mark Udall of Colorado; Joseph Hoeffel of
Pennsylvania; Rush Holt of New Jersey; and Brian Baird, Jay Inslee
and Adam Smith of Washington state; Republican Rep. Jim Leach of
Iowa; and Republican Sens. Jim Jeffords of Vermont and William Roth
of Delaware. Critical ads are airing against two Republicans: Sen.
Slade Gorton of Washington state and former Virginia Gov. George
Allen, a Senate hopeful running against Democratic Sen. Charles
Robb.
</P>
<P>
   THE CASE OF THE STOLEN SIGNATURES
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader barely met the deadline for filing to get on
Wyoming's general election ballot, but the theft of nearly 650
petition signatures on his behalf is casting doubt on whether his
name will appear at all. Someone walked off with a clipboard full
of signatures at restaurant in Laramie last week, according to
Nader volunteer Roberta Harper-McIntosh. Supporters turned in about
4,000 signatures to state election officials just one minute before
Monday night's filing deadline, but they had hoped to deliver
between 5,000 and 6,000 _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   UNION MOBILIZATION IN KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, although not as heavily organized as some other
states, is fertile ground for labor this year. One of the most
competitive races in the nation has Democrat Scotty Baesler trying
to win back his House seat from Republican Rep. Ernie Fletcher.
Baesler lost the seat in 1998 when he ran unsuccessfully for the
Senate. GOP Reps. Anne Northup and Edward Whitfield, whose
districts have sizable union populations, also face spirited
challenges. Bill Londrigan, head of the Kentucky AFL-CIO, is well
aware that the three races could help decide who controls the House
next year.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN SENATE STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   In Florida's Senate contest, state Insurance Commissioner Bill
Nelson, a Democrat, and Rep. Bill McCollum, a Republican, are
locked in a race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Connie Mack
that is critical to Democrats' uphill fight to win control of the
Senate. But the race is more than that. Coupled with the Democrats'
likely recovery of a Senate seat in Georgia _ although they might
lose one in Virginia _ the Florida race could be an important
marker in the evolution of two-party politics in the South.
</P>
<P>
   SIGNING ON WITH A MORE VIABLE CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Tim Goeglein, who described his two-year stint as spokesman for
conservative activist and unsuccessful presidential candidate Gary
Bauer as ``two really terrific years,'' is joining George W. Bush's
campaign Friday. Goeglein, in an e-mail to correspondents covering
the Republican campaign, said that he will be working as part of
the Bush-Cheney communications team.
</P>
<P>
   `BASIC POLITICS'
</P>
<P>
   Joe Eszterhas, the high-priced screenwriter behind such sexually
charged films as ``Showgirls'' and ``Basic Instinct,'' wants
Hollywood to withhold support from Al Gore because of the
anti-media rhetoric of his running mate, Joe Lieberman. Eszterhas,
whose own work has often been critically panned for its lurid
nature, came out swinging against Gore and Lieberman in a full-page
open letter in the entertainment trade paper Daily Variety. ``No
more Hollywood money for Al Gore,'' Eszterhas admonishes, in the
ad. ``I'm a writer who likes pushing the envelope, and Joe
Lieberman frightens me.''

MATRITECH SAYS IT HAS IDENTIFIED COLON CANCER PROTEINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matritech Inc. says its scientists have identified proteins
specific to colon cancer in the blood of patients with the disease,
paving the way to develop a test that detects the cancer even at
its earliest stages.
</P>
<P>
   Although the research is at an early stage, Stephen D. Chubb,
founder and chief operating officer of the Newton biotechnology
company, said Tuesday he believes the findings could translate into
a useable diagnostic tool as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   If proven accurate, a blood test could represent a significant
savings over the colonoscopy, today's preferred screening test for
colon cancer. Chubb said a test would sell for between $11 and $150
depending on whether it is marketed as a stand-alone kit or a lab
service. A colonoscopy costs between $800 and $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an opportunity to make a significant
contribution to the welfare of people who are at risk for this
disease,'' Chubb said. ``That's what this is all about. Early
detection to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   About 130,000 people will be diagnosed this year with colon
cancer, the third most common cancer in the United States,
according to the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Matritech scientists studied the blood of 20 colon-cancer
patients and 20 healthy people. In all 20 people with cancer, they
found elevated levels of specific proteins. But in the healthy
people, they found no evidence of those proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Matritech's stock price rose 11 percent on the news, closing at
$8.59 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Thilly, director of the Center for Environmental Health
Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however,
cautioned that data is preliminary and that any screening test must
be extremely accurate to be useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of people with colon cancer is small, but the
number to be screened is large,'' Thilly said. ``If the test had a
1 percent false positive rate and you screened three million
50-year-olds, you would have 30,000 false positives when you were
looking for only about 1,200 cases of colon cancer. You'd still be
looking for a needle in a haystack.''
</P>
<P>
   Chubb said he plans to have hundreds more people tested by next
year. He said he is optimistic because of the company's past
successes. Matritech has an FDA-approved urine test to detect
bladder cancer and is developing a blood test to screen for breast
cancer.

<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-FIENNES-THEATER (London) _ It is almost a rite of
passage for promising Shakespearean actors to play ``Hamlet.'' More
than most, though, Ralph Fiennes seemed made for the part. To
Jonathan Kent, the slim, ascetic-looking Englishman was born to
play the ill-fated monarch in Shakespeare's ``Richard II.'' To this
fairly obvious choice, however, Kent, an artistic director at
London's Almeida Theater Company, added a more innovative idea. Why
not twin ``Richard II'' with ``Coriolanus,'' another Shakespearean
political tragedy. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   CORIOLANUS-THEATER (New York) _ Among Shakespeare's tragic
heroes, Coriolanus stands apart. The others seduce us. This one _
Rome's greatest warrior turned Rome's fiercest scourge _ scorns
even to try. Perhaps the Almeida Theater Company's production of
``Coriolanus,'' directed by Jonathan Kent, which comes to the
Brooklyn Academy of Music for a limited run beginning September 9,
will challenge entrenched opinion. The title role is entrusted to
Ralph Fiennes, the protagonist also of the Almeida's ``Richard
II,'' that will alternate with ``Coriolanus.'' By Matthew
Gurewitsch.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   SONGWRITERS-THEATER (New York) _ There are many ways a
songwriter today can be unfashionable. Choosing to write for the
American musical theater is merely one of the surer routes. Though,
even here, different songwriters go about being unfashionable in
entirely different ways. Take Michael John LaChiusa and John
Bucchino. Both write songs in the classic Broadway manner as
descended from the American popular songbook. Beyond this
commonality, however, their work is strikingly dissimilar. Where
LaChiusa's music flouts tradition with incendiary rebelliousness _
both lyrically and melodically, Bucchino's teases it with
reassuring gentleness. By Barry Singer.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   BESTMAN-THEATER (New York) _ Gore Vidal wrote ``The Best Man''
in 1959, a time when Joseph McCarthy's legacy endured, when Adlai
Stevenson and Richard Nixon were among the nation's leading
politicians, and when Vidal counted as his friend a young senator
from Massachusetts named John Kennedy. The play drew on these
influences to become a tale of politics that may seem improbable
today: a stark struggle of two men of obvious complexity, set
during a national political convention where decisions of
consequence were actually made. Now ``The Best Man'' is returning
to Broadway. By Adam Nagourney.

<P>
   &UR; MOVIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DIE-FILM (Undated) _ One of the great things about having pay
cable is the opportunity it provides for discovering little films
that were denied theatrical release. Films like the awkwardly
titled ``And Then You Die,'' a hard-as-pig iron 1987 gangster drama
that used to pop up on HBO well past the shank of the evening. For
its first five minutes, ``Die,'' which charts the treacherous
skirmishes between warring Quebec mobs, works solely in somber and
gripping imagery, neatly sketching out the conflicts; it was
superbly directed by Francis Mankiewicz. It's an instance where you
can literally see the filmmaker running out of money and the
picture eventually compromised by budgetary shortfalls, though the
director's control is evident throughout. By Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   MCQUARRIE-FILM (Undated) _ To hear Chris McQuarrie tell it, the
origins of the new film he wrote and directed, ``The Way of the
Gun,'' lay in disgruntlement, frustration and anger. McQuarrie,
author of a screenplay that was nonpareil in its genre, was finding
no one who would let him direct a movie about a 20-year-old who had
conquered the world. This is his tale. By Jamie Malanowski.`

   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DELAY-VIOLIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Rare as great performers are,
even rarer are great teachers of performance. Today, in the field
of violin playing at a supreme virtuoso level, there are only two
categories of teachers: Dorothy DeLay and the rest. By Paul
Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUNICH-OLYMPICS-TV (Unated) _ If the 1972 Summer Olympics in
Munich had ended on its 10th day, it would have been remembered for
Olga Korbut's pixieish dance along the balance beam or Mark Spitz's
record run of seven gold medals in swimming. But before dawn on the
11th day, eight Palestinian guerrillas scaled an unguarded fence in
the Olympic village and invaded the apartment building housing the
Israeli team. They took 11 athletes and officials hostage and, over
the course of a slow-motion 20-hour siege that riveted the world,
killed them all. If any innocence remained at the Olympics, it
ended that day. Of the eight Black September terrorists, only one,
Jamal al-Gashey, a teen-ager at the time, survives. He is the
subject of ``One Day in September,'' a documentary to be seen on
Sept. 11 on HBO in which he describes his life as a Palestinian
refugee and his pride in what the Black September terrorists did to
the Israelis inside the Olympic village at 31 Connollystrasse. By
Richard Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PUPPET-DANCE (Undated) _ There are two bloodlines in modern
puppetry: the ``low'' subversive tradition of Punch and Judy, which
is sometimes called ``marketplace puppetry''; and the ``high''
tradition of Asian religious ritual and court ceremony, including
Indonesian shadow puppets and Japanese Bunraku. High puppetry is
gestural and exploits the same kind of control that is meaningful
in ballet: it is a language for the superhuman, for gods and
heroes, for stories told time out of mind to audiences that
frequently know the motion by heart. By Andrew Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   IONIDES-ART (New York) _ Back in the 1920s, the designer Basil
Ionides was one of Britain's brightest aesthetic lights. His books
_ ``Color and Interior Decoration'' and ``The Modern English
Interior'' _ were best sellers, the former chockablock with
watercolor illustrations of his homes, prime examples of a
scientific approach to the play of light on bold but carefully
graded color schemes. Ionides' professional piece de resistance was
the 1929 mirror-and-glass decoration of the Savoy Theater in
London, whose icy glitter still staggers the eye. Ionides was also
an outstanding collector. By the time of his death, in 1950, at 66,
he had helped amass an impressive haul of early Chinese porcelain.
A dish from this cache will be a centerpiece of an exhibition at
the Chinese Porcelain Co., which opens Oct. 12 and closes Oct. 28.
By Mitchell Owens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OPERA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LAMOS-OPERA (New York) _ Mark Lamos belongs to two worlds, in
more ways than one. First, he seemed headed for a career as a
classical violinist. Then he discovered the theater, where his
acting career lifted off in felicitous fashion, with an early
Broadway appearance as the heartthrob Christian de Neuvillette
opposite the Cyrano de Bergerac of Christopher Plummer and a
subsequent Hamlet at the Old Globe in San Diego. Next, Lamos
settled down as a director, first of straight plays, then also of
opera. Right now, his mind is on Donizetti's ``Roberto Devereux,''
which opens the New York City Opera season at the New York State
Theater on Sept. 12. By Matthew Gurewitsch.

<P>
   Generally a dish of Chinese Pork Tenderloin would be served with
an appropriate Chinese side dish like rice.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the wonderful things about American cooking is that
it can put dishes from any cuisine together if they taste good.
What appeals to me about this combination is the play of the salty,
spicy tenderloin against the creaminess of the Italian dish, pasta
with ricotta, garlic and basil.
</P>
<P>
   These dishes are opposites and they complement each other in
ways Chinese dishes cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The ricotta mellows the Chinese ingredients; the Chinese
ingredients enliven the Italian.
</P>
<P>
   The combination has one drawback: it provides a brown plate. So
I suggest a dish of cherry tomatoes on the side. They will provide
some acidity and lots of color.
</P>

   LEE-TRIAL (Albuquerque, N.M.) _ A federal judge on Tuesday
refused to block the release of the former nuclear scientist Wen Ho
Lee on bail and was expected to order prosecutors to give him
thousands of pages of classified internal documents so he can look
for evidence that Lee was singled out because of he is
Chinese-American. Judge James A. Parker's ruling means that Lee,
who was indicted last December on charges that he illegally
downloaded a virtual library of nuclear weapons secrets, could be
released to a form of home detention as early as Friday afternoon.
By James Sterngold.

   MISSILE-DEFENSE (Washington) _ Looking at the possible legal
conflicts between action on a limited national missile defense and
the requirements of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. By
Steven Lee Myers.

<P>
   CLINTON-COLOMBIA (Cartagena, Colombia) _ President Andres
Pastrana said Tuesday that Colombia cannot put a dent in
international drug trafficking until the United States and other
countries do much more to control their citizens' appetite for
drugs. ``What we are talking about is the most lucrative business
in the world,'' he said in an interview, ``unless the recent spike
in oil prices has made it the second-most-lucrative business in the
world.'' Pastrana's wary words seemed to strike a dissonant note,
coming on the eve of President Clinton's arrival here Wednesday,
when the leaders are to open a $7.5 billion plan to address the
spreading trafficking problem in Colombia. By Clifford Krauss.

a variety of neighborhoods here about their attitudes toward the
presidential candidates, and how and why they may have recently

<P>
   CAMPAIGN-EDUCATION (Washington) _ A look at education issues in
the presidential campaign: Five years after the Republican Congress
shut down the government in part because of the money President
Clinton wanted to spend on education, four years after Bob Dole
embraced a Republican platform that advocated abolishing the
Department of Education, George W. Bush has made an expanded
federal role in education a central issue of his campaign. Vice
President Al Gore has responded in kind on an issue that has been
an especially strong one for Democrats ever since President Lyndon
B. Johnson got the first federal aid to public schools enacted 35
years ago over the opposition of most Republicans. By David E.
Rosenbaum. (1400 words) The first in a series on the issues of the
campaign.

   L.A.-POLICE-SUIT (Los Angeles) _ A federal judge has ruled that
the Los Angeles Police Department can be sued as a racketeering
enterprise by people who claim their civil rights were violated
LAPD officers. The ruling creates the possibility that the
department could be the first in the nation to face trial under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. It also could
dramatically increase the city's liability. By Don Terry.

<P>
   INDIA-QUIZ-SHOW (Bombay) _ In a country where hundreds of
millions live in grinding poverty, the Indian version of ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' has suddenly become the most popular TV
show. Some poor people are using up what little money they have on
phone calls to try to get on the show. We watch it with viewers in
a Bombay slum. By Barry Bearak.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Showers and clouds will continue to be directed inland along the
Middle Atlantic Coast as a weak area of low pressure spins just
offshore. Farther north, much of New England will have a partly
sunny day with light breezes from the east. Temperatures will
remain a bit below seasonal levels along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   A strengthening area of low pressure in the northern Plains will
produce periods of showers and thunder from the Missouri Valley to
the southern Canadian Prairie Wednesday. Brisk breezes from the
northeast will combine with the showers to produce afternoon
readings only in the 50s in northern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant moisture and a jet stream disturbance in the Southwest
will promote cloudy skies and scattered showers from New Mexico to
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: REMEMBERING NAMES
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, residents of Hawaii noted a familiar name when a
tropical storm 1,000 miles to the southeast was christened John. In
August 1994, Hurricane John, the most powerful ever recorded in the
central Pacific, spared Hawaii when it passed a few hundred miles
south. When a hurricane does great harm to life or property, its
name can be retired. A retired name cannot be used again for at
least 10 years to avoid confusion in legal actions and insurance
claims. Hurricane Mitch, which devastated parts of central America
in 1998, was the most recent storm to have its name retired.

<P>
   BOSTON _ The public could get its first glimpse Wednesday of
``John F. Kennedy: PT 109 Boat Commander,'' a collector's item that
toymaker Hasbro Inc. has created for its GI Joe line of action
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Hasbro displayed a prototype of the action
figure at the American International Toy Fair but would not allow
it to be photographed, saying essentially that ``PT 109 Commander''
was still a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product is set to be unveiled at the John F.
Kennedy Library and Museum. At a brief ceremony, Hasbro plans to
present the library's foundation with a mint edition of an action
figure that should hit store shelves shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get something like this 100 percent right,'' said
Hasbro chairman and chief executive Alan G. Hassenfeld. ``Not 99
percent right, but 100 percent right.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Hasbro often consulted with the library to
ensure that the action figure was historically correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleased with the way they approached this and with the
amount of research they did in our photo archives,'' museum curator
Frank Rigg said of Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans for the library to include the action figure
in any of its public displays, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In return for permission to use Kennedy's image, Hasbro made a
donation of unspecified size to the library's foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed largely at adult collectors, the JFK action figure is
being issued in a ``limited edition'' and should sell for between
$30 and $35, Hassenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   A standard issue GI Joe can sell for about $14.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something you sell millions of,'' said Hassenfeld,
declining to be more specific about sales projections.
</P>
<P>
   If the PT 109 edition sells out, Hasbro will not make more, he
said; that would ``offend collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, though, that Hasbro might issue a different JFK
action figure, perhaps one outfitted in dress whites.
</P>
<P>
   Given its limited-edition status, the PT 109 action figure is
unlikely to be a holiday hit or a big moneymaker for Hasbro, a
Pawtucket, R.I. company with $4.23 billion in 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad for Hasbro. It could use a lift to match last
year's successes with Pokemon, Furby, and ``Star Wars.'' With sales
for those toy lines cooling off, Hasbro recently warned investors
that it could be facing a tough holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   As for the JFK action figure, it seeks to reenact Kennedy's
experience during World War II. In 1943, the young naval officert
commanded a PT boat that was attempting to prevent the resupply of
a Japanese military base in the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   During a night patrol, Kennedy's boat was rammed and sunk by an
enemy destroyer. Surviving crew members swam to a nearby island.
Ultimately, an SOS carved on a coconut was entrusted to friendly
natives who went for help.
</P>
<P>
   To commemorate the rescue, the JFK action figure is accessorized
with a replica of the now famous coconut.
</P>
<P>
   GI Joe has some history of his own. When he made his debut in
the mid 1960s, GI Joe was an action-figure pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Some girls and women have long collected dolls. But it wasn't
until the 1970s that action figures became avidly prized by
collectors, said Gareb S. Shamus, chief executive of
Wizardworld.com, a Web site for such hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was partly inspired by the first ``Star Wars''
movie and such hit TV shows as ``Star Trek,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to pro wrestlers and last summer's new ``Star Wars''
movie, 1999 was a banner year for action figures, generating about
$1 billion in US wholesale revenues, Shamus said.
</P>
<P>
   As collectors became more numerous, Hasbro launched a special GI
Joe heroes line. The line has saluted such famous generals as
Dwight D. Eisenhower and Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Library was initially cool to the idea for a JFK
action figure. But the library reconsidered, won over by Hasbro's
careful treatment of Powell and Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kennedy Museum curator Rigg, ``That lent credibility to the
project.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN GOVERNOR VETOES LAW AGAINST ABORTIONS FOR RAPE VICTIMS
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Citing majority disapproval in an opinion survey,
the governor of Mexico's Guanajuato state Tuesday vetoed a new
state reform mandating jail time for women who seek abortions after
being raped.
</P>
<P>
   Most abortion is illegal in Mexico, but Guanajuato would have
been the first state to punish with six to three years in jail rape
victims who abort pregnancies. Members of the conservative National
Action Party, or the PAN, pushed through the controversial reform
in that state's legislature on Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Ramon Martin, also of the PAN, based his decision on the
results of a recent survey conducted by the Center for Public
Opinion of the University of Guadalajara. In a statement Tuesday,
the governor's office also said he was influenced by opinions he
received via the Internet, letters and other channels.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he is ``pro-life'' and that by vetoing the law he is
not closing off more discussion about resuscitating it later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great majority of citizens asked that the reform be
returned to the state Congress for broader public consultation,''
the statement from the governor's office said. A survey the
governor had commissioned found that 68 percent of 1,200 people
interviewed in Guanajuato in their homes agreed with that
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are satisfied with the attitude of the governor of
Guanajuato,'' said Martha Juarez of the Group for Reproductive
Information and Choice in Mexico City. ``Although we know that
there is a risk that the law will be discussed again, we hope that
it will be discussed with more care and professionalism and in
accordance with the reality of women in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, a member of the PAN and Mexico's president-elect,
immediately distanced himself from the Aug. 3 legislative action,
calling it a ``local issue'' he does not plan to propose
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Guanajuato reform, Mexico City's woman mayor,
Rosario Robles, proposed decriminalizing abortion in the city in
cases of rape and life-threatening deformities. The proposal was
approved by the city's legislature on Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Guanajuato will have a newly elected state legislature on Sept.
25, and a new governor on Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of those polled on the anti-abortion reform said
they thought that legislators should take into account the opinion
of women who became pregnant after being raped. Eighty-eight
percent said they would be willing to participate in a statewide
referendum vote on the issue.

</P>
<P>
   GI Joe has some history of his own. When he made his debut in
the mid 1960s, GI Joe was an action-figure pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Some girls and women have long collected dolls. But it wasn't
until the 1970s that action figures became avidly prized by
collectors, said Gareb S. Shamus, chief executive of
Wizardworld.com, a Web site for such hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was partly inspired by the first ``Star Wars''
movie and such hit TV shows as ``Star Trek,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to pro wrestlers and last summer's new ``Star Wars''
movie, 1999 was a banner year for action figures, generating about
$1 billion in US wholesale revenues, Shamus said.
</P>
<P>
   As collectors became more numerous, Hasbro launched a special GI
Joe heroes line. The line has saluted such famous generals as
Dwight D. Eisenhower and Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Library was initially cool to the idea for a JFK
action figure. But the library reconsidered, won over by Hasbro's
careful treatment of Powell and Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kennedy Museum curator Rigg, ``That lent credibility to the
project.''

JUDGE ORDERS GOVERNMENT TO TURN OVER DOCUMENTS IN LOS ALAMOS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ A federal judge Tuesday ordered the
government to turn over thousands of pages of classified internal
documents to help him determine whether there is evidence that the
former nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee was unfairly singled out for
prosecution because he is Chinese American.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, James A. Parker, also rejected government efforts to
delay Lee's release on bail, which could come as early as Friday
afternoon. Lee was arrested and indicted last December on charges
that he illegally downloaded a virtual library of nuclear weapons
secrets, and he has spent the more than eight months since in close
to solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's decision on the documents indicates that he at least
believes there are some grounds for the defense's assertions that
Lee was a suspect because of his ethnicity, not because of the
facts, and that others who may have violated or were suspected of
violating security laws were not prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee was not charged with espionage, he was investigated
for years on suspicions that he had given highly sensitive nuclear
weapons secrets to China. Lee was born on Taiwan and is a
naturalized American citizen. Although government officials have
said they have no evidence that Lee spied for anyone, they have
claimed in court that Chinese spies routinely seek out
Chinese-Americans in their clandestine recruitment activities.
</P>
<P>
   Selective prosecution motions, like the one heard Tuesday,
rarely lead to a case being dismissed and the judge's decision
represents only a small victory for the defense. Once the documents
are handed over, by Sept. 15, the judge will inspect them privately
and decide whether they should be given to the defense. The defense
could then use them to argue that the case should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In its motions, the defense provided statements from two former
senior counterintelligence officials, Robert Vrooman of Los Alamos
National Laboratory and Charles Washington of the Department of
Energy, asserting that Lee had been pursued at least partly because
of his Chinese ancestry. Such concerns have led a number of civil
rights groups, from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Asian
Law Caucus, to take up Lee's cause and file briefs on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered that the government provide several categories
of documents that the defense has been seeking. He ordered the
release of some secret testimony provided to Congress about the
investigation, classified material that the Department of Energy
collected last year for a report on whether the agency engaged in
racial profiling, State Department records on security breaches by
employees that were not prosecuted and a counterintelligence
training tape that the defense says encourages racial profiling. He
also sought statements by the former Energy Department
counterintelligence official Notra Trulock that the investigation
should focus on ethnic Chinese and Trulock's full list of suspects.
Lastly, he sought FBI reports on the number of people who had
access to information about the sophisticated warhead that the
government believes may have been leaked to China and all reports
on administrative inquiries by the Energy Department or the Los
Alamos National Laboratory on the improper handling of classified
data from 1987 to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of bail, which Parker granted last Thursday after two
earlier denials, was crucial in the minds of many of Lee's
supporters Tuesday, as well as to the government, which continued
to argue that Lee presented a grave threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is charged with downloading weapons test and design data
onto 10 portable computer tapes, seven of which are missing. Lee
has indicated through his lawyers that he destroyed the tapes, but
the government maintains that the tapes could alter the balance of
global power if Lee spirits them away to a hostile power after his
release.
</P>
<P>
   The judge appears to have accepted the defense's claims that
those assertions are exaggerated. And while the judge also rejected
the government's request to delay by one week Lee's release on $1
million bail, he did ultimately grant a three-day stay to give
prosecutors time to prepare an appeal and to receive permission to
file it from the U.S. Solicitor General.
</P>
<P>
   The judge reversed a previous order denying Lee bail after
receiving new information at a dramatic hearing two weeks ago,
including an FBI agent's admission that on several critical
occasions he had provided incorrect testimony that had made Lee
appear deceitful when he had not been.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must note that had Judge Parker been provided the complete
record in December, Dr. Lee would not have spent eight months in
solitary confinement in shackles,'' said Mark Holscher, one of
Lee's attorneys, after Monday morning's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Parker agreed to slight modifications in the
conditions of Lee's release. These include changes such as an
explicit order that Lee can garden in his back yard, that he can
use an ambulance if he requires emergency medical treatment, and
that staff members of the Albuquerque law firm representing him can
pick Lee up and transport him to and from the courthouse here to
meet with lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The judge tersely rejected arguments by the lead prosecutor,
George Stamboulidis, that tight restraints needed to be imposed on
Lee's communications with his wife, Sylvia, and on his wife's
communications with third parties outside their home near Los
Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll reject that out of hand,'' Parker said when Stamboulidis
began discussing limits on Lee's conversations with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   When Stamboulidis argued that Lee might use his wife to
unwittingly pass along a coded message that would result in the
transfer of weapons secrets, an act of espionage, Parker expressed
pointed skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scenario you described suggests Dr. Lee would consciously
subject his wife to an offense that cold subject her to the death
penalty,'' he said in rejecting any restraints on Mrs. Lee's
communications outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad he's getting out,'' said Alberta Lee, Lee's
daughter. ``Any conditions are fine.''

EFFORTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Kursk disaster provides insight into Russian
society at as time when the nation is still in transition.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian delay in seeking outside help was a throwback to a
time when such a disaster would not have been known beyond Soviet
military/government circles. Ending this tradition of secrecy
within 48 hours after the accident shows progress toward a more
open society, a requirement for democracy to function there. This
is a plus for Russia and should be celebrated in the West for what
it is: A historic reversal of the centuries-old policy of hushing
up official embarrassments.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, inexperienced in the ways of
leading a democracy, may be the greatest benefactor of the Kursk
disaster because it taught him a valuable lesson: A top government
leader cannot continue a well-deserved vacation where there is a
free press functioning at a time of national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian media kept the pressure on Putin to break off his
vacation and demonstrate concern about the fate of the Kursk. He
was criticized for his slow response, though it is possible that he
was relying on official _ and misleading _ advice from his military
advisers that the boat would be rescued. At any rate, if he had it
to do all over again, I bet Putin would have hustled to Murmansk to
oversee the rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of the belated request by Russian
military leaders for outside help.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally got around to asking for foreign assistance,
they turned to Norway and Great Britain, despite the fact that
top-of-the-line rescue equipment was available in the United States
and was easily transportable worldwide within 24 hours by a U.S.
Air Force C-5 cargo aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian reluctance to call on the United States reflects a
kind of Cold War distrust that if Russia sought help from the
United States, U.S. rescue personnel might find out a submarine
secret about the Kursk. Both the Russian and the U.S. navies are
always eager to learn more about the other nation's submarine
technology. But one would think that such concerns would evaporate
at a time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is now urging that the United Nations undertake
responsibility for ocean rescues of stricken military vessels. This
proposal serves him well at home by showing his concern about the
loss of life and portrays himself as a man of action. It also
avoids any partnership with the former Soviet Union's foe, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a fast-acting United Nations rescue team seems to me
to be a contradiction in terms. Nothing fast ever happens at the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of potential East-West rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Russia and the United States are working on a
jointly operated center in Moscow that would protect each nation
against a missile launch based on erroneous information.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Russian cooperation on the space station is another example
that points to a brighter day ahead for U.S.-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   We can hope that the naval leadership of both nations may
someday form a rescue partnership to act in future emergencies.
Submarine escape hatches could be standardized, techniques for
handling torpedo malfunctions could be addressed, and the 24-hour
delivery of U.S. rescue equipment could be extended to serve the
Russian fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Where human lives are at stake, I'm certain that citizens in
both countries would support such a submarine rescue partnership.
If the Kursk episode opens the door to such an arrangement, the
deaths of Kursk crewmen will not have been in vain.

PROXIMITY OF JFK LIBRARY FUELS DEBATE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The sponsors of the first proposed presidential debate
adamantly rejected suggestions Tuesday that the University of
Massachusetts in Boston doesn't constitute ``neutral territory''
for the event because it adjoins the John F. Kennedy Library.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the two institutions reacted cautiously to the
shots reportedly aimed their way by aides to Gov. George W. Bush.
The officials said they did not want to be drawn into a political
contretempts or be viewed as taking sides.
</P>
<P>
   UMass-Boston was chosen by the nonpartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates as the venue for the first of three debates
between Bush and Vice President Al Gore. Gore has accepted the
offer, while Bush says he it is one of many he is considering.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Library is co-sponsoring the Oct. 3 event and
putting together educational programs leading up to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally ... absolutely neutral territory,'' said Tom
McNaught, the Kennedy Library spokesman. He pointed out that Bush's
father had recently been honored at the library as a Distinguished
American, receiving an inscribed bronze bust of the slain president
from Kennedy's daughter, Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   The UMass spokeswoman, Annmarie Lewis-Kerwin, also underscored
her institution's nonpartisanship. She added that preparations
hadn't been slowed by the brouhaha over debates because the
commission had assured university officials that the event will
take place on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has repeatedly said he would participate in all three
nationally televised, prime-time events _ and in just about any
other head-to-head confrontation anyone wants to hold. The
Democrat's campaign chairman, William M. Daley, sent a letter to
the commission Tuesday formally accepting its debate schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his advisers, on the other hand, have expressed
reservations from the start about both the planned format and
venues. The commission, which has been setting up presidential
debates since 1988, is headed by Paul Kirk Jr. and Frank
Fahrenkopf, the former chairmen, respectively, of the Democratic
and Republican National Committees.
</P>
<P>
   Media accounts about Bush's apparent problems with the
commission's debate proposals have appeared since mid-August, even
as growing numbers of Americans have been turning their attention
to the presidential campaign since the two parties' nominating
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was revisited Tuesday in an article in the New York
Times that said Bush was balking at the commission's plans because
the three debates would be aired in prime time by the major
networks.
</P>
<P>
   The article said Bush officials had complained about holding a
debate on the UMass campus because it is so near the library of a
Democratic president. ``At face value,'' the Times quoted one
official as saying, ``it seems difficult to argue that it's neutral
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush Tuesday derided as ``ridiculous'' the notion that he wanted
to avoid prime-time debates. ``I want as many people to watch our
debates as possible,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP candidate did not directly address the issue of UMass's
location. But a spokesman, Ray Sullivan, later dismissed as
``patently false'' any suggestion that the Bush camp might consider
the university to be an unfair site.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said in a telephone interview that Bush is ``seriously
considering'' offers to debate at more than 40 locations, with a
variety of formats. Asked specifically about the UMass issue,
Sullivan replied: ``We do not have a problem with any of the
venues'' proposed by the commission on debates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Boston site, the commission has scheduled
presidential debates for Oct. 11 at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C., and for Oct. 17 at Washington University in
St. Louis. It has also planned a vice presidential debate for Oct.
5 at Centre College in Danville, Ky. Among the private contributors
to the Boston event are Fidelity Investments, Fleet Financial, the
Boston Globe, and the Boston Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, the commission's executive director, expressed
confidence Tuesday that all of those events would take place as
scheduled. She recalled that candidates in both parties in the past
have raised questions about format, timing, or other aspects of the
debates, but have always ultimately participated.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign seized on the Times account about Bush Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their problem is that when people learn about both candidates
and their plans for the future, they invariably agree more with
Gore than with Bush,'' said a Gore spokesman, Doug Hattaway. ``So
they're gasping for excuses to avoid prime-time debates.''
</P>
<P>

Globe staff reporters Glen Johnson and Anne E. Kornblut contributed
to this report from Portland, Maine, and Albuquerque, respectively.

FED UP WITH THE WHEEL WORLD
</HEADLINE>

 By LIZ STEVENS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hate you.
</P>
<P>
   I know that sounds petty and small-minded, but I just can't help
it.
</P>
<P>
   There I am, proceeding cautiously through my green light, and
there you go, barreling in front of me through your red one. There
I am, patiently inching toward my freeway exit, and there you go
zipping by on the right shoulder, taking cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There I am, coasting down the interstate doing 68, hanging out
in the center lane, checking my rearview mirror frequently, like
the ``conscientious driver I am.'' And here you come, out of
nowhere, blasting toward my rear bumper like a nuclear warhead,
doubling in size every half-second that I glance back, and then _
just about the time your grill is threatening to eat my bumper for
lunch _ swerving into the next lane and high-tailing it out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Grrr. I despise you.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I have unrealistic standards. Maybe I'm just grouchy. But
it seems to me that there are an inordinate number of morons behind
the wheel these days and that they simply couldn't care less about
the rest of us good, kind folks.
</P>
<P>
   They tailgate. They weave precariously. They speed. They run
stop signs. They yell and make scary faces and offer up their
middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   It can make a girl, well, ``upset.''
</P>
<P>
   This bad behavior is not road rage, which, strictly speaking,
involves physical violence inflicted on one driver by another.
(Road rage incidents, for all their hype, aren't commonplace.) The
egregious conduct I'm talking about is stuff we encounter on the
road every day.
</P>
<P>
   The rude stuff. The dumb stuff. The stuff you're sure to witness
this Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The experts call it aggressive driving, and it's a bit of a
conundrum for those who study it. Here's why: The roads are
actually safer than they've ever been. In 1999, the traffic
accident death rate was 73 percent ``lower'' than it was in 1966 _
thanks to seat belts, safer vehicles and safer roads.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that thousands of people still aren't dying
unnecessarily _ 41,345 last year, to be exact. But it also doesn't
jibe with the studies indicating that Americans are increasingly
concerned that their fellow commuters are driving like kamikazes.
</P>
<P>
   According to annual surveys by AAA Mid-Atlantic, the number of
Washington, D.C.-area drivers who name aggressive driving as the
top threat on the road has risen each of the past five years. In
February, it peaked at 53 percent, up 7 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a reasonable argument to be made that
(driving behavior) may be deteriorating'' even though the death
rate hasn't climbed, says Lon Anderson, AAA Mid-Atlantic's director
of public affairs. Considering the improvements in road and car
safety, casualties on American roads should be much lower, he
believes. It's bad behavior that's killing us. Speeding alone
contributes to a third of all fatalities; alcohol is still a factor
in more than a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``People act like it's a competitive sport,'' Anderson adds.
``They'll risk life and limb just to arrive at the next traffic
light two cars ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem has not gone unnoticed by police and elected
officials. Numerous state legislatures have passed or considered
laws cracking down on aggressive driving. Two years ago, Dallas
Police responded with the Strategic Targeting Against Road Rage
patrol. On Thursday, San Antonio officially kicks off an elaborate
public-awareness program, complete with billboards and television
spots.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, the book ``Road Rage and Aggressive Driving,'' by
Leon James (aka ``Dr. Driving'') and wife, Diane Nahl, arrives on
store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The two University of Hawaii professors have studied driving
behavior since 1981 and teach a class in traffic psychology. Their
expansive Web site, www.aloha.net-dyc, includes James' 1997
Congressional testimony on aggressive driving and results from
their Web-based surveys.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of reasons people might be more impatient
and impulsive on the byways. For one, congestion is epidemic in the
cities and suburbs, and commutes are longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are frustrated at how much they have to
drive,'' says Stephanie Faul, communications director for the AAA
Foundation for Traffic Safety. ``They're spending two hours a day
in their car, and they feel like they're wasting that time.
Commuting is boring, especially when you contrast it with the fast
pace of a lot of popular entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also dehumanizing,'' Faul adds. ``You don't see the other
people in cars as being human, you see them as other cars.''
</P>
<P>
   The menacing Dodge Ram. The snooty Mercedes. The bratty Ford
Focus. (Or, in my case, the minding-her-own-business Honda Civic,
which has just a slight problem gaining speed when entering the
freeway, so excuuuuse me!)

<P>
   Conversely, Americans have a tendency to view their cars as an
extension of themselves, as a tool to assert freedom, machismo or
authority, contends James. ``When we enter a car,'' he writes, ``we
use it as an outlet for regaining a sense of control.''
</P>
<P>
   But James and Nahl take it a step further: Aggressive driving
behaviors, they say, are learned years before we merit that first
driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic premise is that aggressive driving is a cultural
norm,'' Nahl explains, ``that we grew up (sitting) in the back
seats of our parents' cars and watching television in which drivers
are very aggressive and get away with it all the time. We simply
absorbed it as children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is we keep track in our heads how well
we're doing out there,'' she adds. ``So if cars are passing us we
lose points. In our own mind, we're losing the game. If we pass
others, we win points; we're winning the game.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges with aggressive driving is that it begets
more aggressive driving. Drunken drivers don't make us drunk,
sleepy drivers don't make us sleepy, but obnoxious drivers turn us
from Jekyll into Hyde. We want to punish the driver who was rude to
us, teach her a lesson, vent our disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   This is my problem. I'm a tad righteous behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Nahl and James dedicate several chapters of their
book to dealing with aggressive drivers (in a word: don't), as well
as a three-step program aimed at changing our driving
personalities. Part of the San Antonio program includes handing out
Traffic Enforcement Education (TEE) cards developed by the
professors that includes a self-assessment test.
</P>
<P>
   Nahl and James advocate an aggressive-driving component in
driver's education courses and a pseudo-group-therapy model they
call Quality Driving Circles, where concerned drivers get together
to vent and exchange ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Nahl believes, aggressive driving ``will become an
unacceptable behavior'' on par with drunken driving, ``partly
because the laws are changing'' and partly because, well, who needs
the stress?
</P>
<P>
   Not me. I have decided to give my fellow drivers the benefit of
the doubt. Who knows? Maybe the Maxima that cut me off had a bad
day at work. Maybe the Suburban that whizzed by has a loved one in
the hospital. Maybe the ...
</P>
<P>
   Hey, buddy! Ever heard of a turn signal?

   BOYD, Texas _ Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman tours Samie
Erwin's drought-ravaged farm near Boyd, Texas, giving Glickman a

estimated $595 million. Glickman has declared 153 Texas counties
either primary or contiguous agricultural disaster areas. By MAX

   GRAPEVINE, Texas _ The scorched, yellow grass along area
highways is a depressing sight for many as the Dallas-Fort Worth
eclipses its 50-year-old record for consecutive days without rain.
For 59 days, the area has gone without rain, breaking a record set
in 1934 and repeated in 1950. Perhaps nobody feels the effects more
than farmers and ranchers. State agricultural officials estimate
$595 million in losses this year because of the parched conditions.
But not all farmers are hurting. The relentless dryness, which
conjures images of the 1930s Dust Bowl, is helping Texas grape
growers produce sweeter fruit. By GORDON DICKSON. Story has moved

EVEN THE POOREST IN INDIA FALL UNDER THE `MILLIONAIRE' SPELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ Maqbool Ahmed has dreams of instant wealth,
which ordinarily would require a mighty burst of imagination from a
man living in the Bombay slum of Geeta Nagar, a hideous warren of
hovels where the air reeks of kerosene and fish, and there are only
24 toilets for 6,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But come 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, Ahmed, like
virtually everyone else in this monsoon-swamped ghetto, ignores the
leaky roof, turns on a cheap black-and-white television and watches
the Indian version of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I know Josip Broz Tito was not the leader of Egypt,''
Ahmed said confidently last night, harrumphing at a confused
contestant named Ravi who must have slept through the Cold War and
was now using a valuable ``lifeline'' to phone his friend Murli for
help. ``The correct answer is Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Since early July, India _ a nation where the average person
would need 2,325 years of income to become a millionaire _ has been
obsessed with ``Kaun Banega Crorepati,'' or literally ``Who Will
Become a 10-Millionaire,'' the Indian version of the game show that
was created in Britain and is now exported to 31 countries
including the United States, Japan, Israel, Finland and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   East is East and West is West, and this is where the twain have
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands the language of money,'' said Ahmed, 41,
who peddles envelopes from a pushcart for a living. ``The show is
simple to follow. I am not so smart, and I know many of the
answers. Maybe I will be a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is unusual here because of its extravagant production
quality and the large jackpot. A crore equals 10 million. A
crorepati, then, is someone with 10 million rupees, which at
current exchange rates is about $222,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings are as yet an inexact science in India, but by some
counts ``Crorepati'' is being watched nightly by more than 100
million people. In a single leap it took Star TV, owned by Rupert
Murdoch, from the No. 3 to the No. 1 spot among the nation's cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 85 percent of the viewers in Bombay and 93 percent in
Kanpur,'' said Sameer Nair, who is in charge of the network's
programming. ``Of course, the joke is: what are those other 7
percent up to?''
</P>
<P>
   This can be a tough country for television. In 1965, when in
America Ozzie and Harriet were starting their last season, there
were still fewer than 1,000 television sets in all of India. Even
today, only about one-third of the households have televisions _
and less than half of those are set up for cable or satellite
reception.
</P>
<P>
   India's population has topped 1 billion, but the nation is a
polyglot of 17 major languages. Most people in Calcutta do not know
what the people in Madras are saying. ``The Wheel of Fortune'' was
tried here without much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``India has no national language and has a low level of
literacy; this is not a place for a game like that, based on word
play,'' said Amit Khanna, a veteran television executive. ``Oral
works. Games with reading or writing don't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crorepati'' is in Hindi, with English thrown in here and
there. Its popularity is highest in the nation's so-called Hindi
Belt in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The show is hosted by Amitabh Bachchan, a legendary leading man
in Indian films and now a suave graybeard at age 58. His movie
career had hit the skids, and ``Crorepati'' has become his
resurrection. Contestants occasionally kiss his feet. Worshipful
fan letters sometimes come written in blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was apprehensive about whether I could deliver the goods,''
Bachchan said in an interview, relaxing in an apartment built for
him near the stage set. It is modeled after a Swiss chalet. ``In
films, people always put words in my mouth. Here, it is a very ad
hoc, ad lib kind of atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Regis Philbin, he has become famous for this litany: ``Are
you sure? Confident? Is that your final answer?'' It is presumed
here that this is a Bachchan touch, part of his pose as a
philosopher-guide for the contestant.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Millionaire'' format, as created by the British
production company Celador, is highly scripted. It is the fast food
chain of quiz shows.
</P>
<P>
   The patter is precisely pat. The look of each set is identical.
A computer program synchronizes the music and lighting. British
technicians train the local crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``They send us a production bible, about 300 pages,'' said
Ravinath Menon, Crorepati's executive producer. ``It's all a
formula. Our idea was not to re-invent the show, but to duplicate
the show.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Indian masses are wild about the program, some of the
intelligentsia have been sniffy. P.C. Joshi, a retired academic,
said he has an ``instinctive revulsion'' to the show and has
refused to watch it. He expressed disappointment in Bachchan's
career choice _ and then bemoaned a decline in public devotion to
the inspiring poetry of Rabindranath Tagore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Joshi headed a national commission that warned that
careful controls must be maintained on television programming or
Indian culture will be befouled.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, such taint came to seem inevitable in the early
'90s when Western tastes began to invade the airwaves via
satellite. Shows such as ``The Bold and the Beautiful'' were
decried for licentious plots dependent on bed-hopping. In time,
however, local producers have developed their own various soap
operas rich with sexual escapades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crorepati,'' despite its Western roots, is not seen as an
invasion. ``Money is money, finally, and I think Indians just adore
it and always have,'' said cultural critic Shanta Gokhale. ``We're
inveterate gamblers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival networks have game shows in the works that will offer
similar amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Reality-based programs like ``Survivor'' are also being
considered, though Nair, Star TV's programming chief, believes that
poverty has made survival enough of an issue for too many Indians
for that show to provide much novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we'd do `Survivor' is put 10 executives on a crowded
local train and see who could make it to the next stop,'' he said
wryly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Geeta Nagar, the Bombay slum, might also make a good venue. As
Ahmed's &UR;  &LR; family devotedly watched ``Crorepati,'' a mouse scampered
across exposed electrical wires and, as if curious about all the
ado, paused on top of the small TV. The set occasionally went dim
and the lights flickered. Most people buy their electricity from
slumlords, and the power is unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   The floor was wet. Shafi, Ahemd's niece, was lying on a mat,
occasionally trying to rub the moistness out of her clothes with
her hands. She said her father, a welder who was off at work, was
the family's best hope to win big on the quiz program. ``He'd get
the crore,'' she said buoyantly.
</P>
<P>
   But getting on the show would seem to require far more luck than
is common in Geeta Nagar. People from there do call the show,
trying to register their names. For them, it is like buying a
lottery ticket: an expensive fantasy. Use of the public phone costs
about 50 cents, for many almost an entire day's pay.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, few Muslims or Hindus from the lower castes have made
it on to the show. Those chosen are mostly professionals from big
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the bureaucrats seem to get to compete,'' Ahmed said
haplessly.
</P>
<P>
   The hour went quickly. At 10, ``Crorepati'' was over. It was
time for the children to go to bed _ and time for the men to wander
through the narrow brick lanes of the slum. Televisions were still
lit up, but people had stopped watching and started talking.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed saw a friend. And there was something he wanted this man
to know, something important, how close he had come that night to
great wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That question about the man Tito,'' he said. ``I knew the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   He nodded proudly. He said, ``I knew he was from Yugoslavia.''

APPLE COMPUTER SET TO UNVEIL TEST VERISON OF OS X 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The first publicly available version of Apple
Computer Corp.'s long-awaited next-generation operating system will
roll out in two weeks, chief executive Steve Jobs announced Tuesday
at a conference for digital publishers and designers.
</P>
<P>
   Called Macintosh OS X (the ``X'' representing the number 10),
the operating system for Apple's Macintosh computers is expected to
be significantly faster and more reliable than the current Mac OS
9. It also is widely regarded as the key to Apple's future ability
to hang on to, perhaps even gain, ground in the market for desktop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mac OS X is the future of the Mac,'' Jobs told a packed
audience attending the Seybold Seminars conference. ``This is
really important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Most consumers, however, will have to wait until early 2001 to
buy the new operating system. What will be released on Sept. 13 is
a test version of Mac OS X, to be used by hardcore Apple fans who
will help the company ``debug'' the software of potential flaws.
The Cupertino, Calif., company has not said how it will distribute
the test version, but most Apple-watchers anticipate they will be
able to download Mac OS X off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has made test versions of Mac OS X available to select
software developers since February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slick,'' said Eric Wood, a developer for R.R. Donnelly &AMP;
Sons in Chicago, who got to test drive the new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Bundled with its new line of desktop computers, including the
PowerMac G4 Cube, unveiled six weeks ago, Apple is hoping the new
operating system will help it sustain the momentum it gained from
its popular iMac line of candy-colored computers introduced two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Apple last year captured 5 percent of the market for operating
systems, software that controls the basic functions of a computer,
such as storing files and routing commands to printers. That is up
``dramatically'' from 4.1 percent in 1998, according to Dan
Kusnetzky, vice president of system software research at
International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Apple, however, continues to face formidable competition against
Microsoft Corp., whose Windows operating system enjoyed a 90
percent market share last year, according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Apple has faced a new worry _ Linux, an
operating system that is free to download from the Internet and is
compatible with most personal computers, including the Macintosh.
Last year, Linux claimed 3.9 percent of the market for desktop
computer operating systems and is poised to steal the No. 2 spot
from Apple within two years, said Kusnetzky.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Linux is handicapped by the fact that it remains
awkward for non-geeks to use, said Chris LeTocq, research director
at the Gartner Group in Los Altos, Calif. The Macintosh, by
contrast, is known for its friendly, intuitive interface.

in the center lane, checking my rearview mirror frequently, like
the ``conscientious driver I am.'' And here you come, out of
nowhere, blasting toward my rear bumper like a nuclear warhead,
doubling in size every half-second that I glance back, and then _
just about the time your grill is threatening to eat my bumper for
lunch _ swerving into the next lane and high-tailing it out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Grrr. I despise you.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I have unrealistic standards. Maybe I'm just grouchy. But
it seems to me that there are an inordinate number of morons behind
the wheel these days and that they simply couldn't care less about
the rest of us good, kind folks.
</P>
<P>
   They tailgate. They weave precariously. They speed. They run
stop signs. They yell and make scary faces and offer up their
middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   It can make a girl, well, ``upset.''
</P>
<P>
   This bad behavior is not road rage, which, strictly speaking,
involves physical violence inflicted on one driver by another.
(Road rage incidents, for all their hype, aren't commonplace.) The
egregious conduct I'm talking about is stuff we encounter on the
road every day.
</P>
<P>
   The rude stuff. The dumb stuff. The stuff you're sure to witness
this Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The experts call it aggressive driving, and it's a bit of a
conundrum for those who study it. Here's why: The roads are
actually safer than they've ever been. In 1999, the traffic
accident death rate was 73 percent ``lower'' than it was in 1966 _
thanks to seat belts, safer vehicles and safer roads.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that thousands of people still aren't dying
unnecessarily _ 41,345 last year, to be exact. But it also doesn't
jibe with the studies indicating that Americans are increasingly
concerned that their fellow commuters are driving like kamikazes.
</P>
<P>
   According to annual surveys by AAA Mid-Atlantic, the number of
Washington, D.C.-area drivers who name aggressive driving as the
top threat on the road has risen each of the past five years. In
February, it peaked at 53 percent, up 7 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a reasonable argument to be made that
(driving behavior) may be deteriorating'' even though the death
rate hasn't climbed, says Lon Anderson, AAA Mid-Atlantic's director
of public affairs. Considering the improvements in road and car
safety, casualties on American roads should be much lower, he
believes. It's bad behavior that's killing us. Speeding alone
contributes to a third of all fatalities; alcohol is still a factor
in more than a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``People act like it's a competitive sport,'' Anderson adds.
``They'll risk life and limb just to arrive at the next traffic
light two cars ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem has not gone unnoticed by police and elected
officials. Numerous state legislatures have passed or considered
laws cracking down on aggressive driving. Two years ago, Dallas
Police responded with the Strategic Targeting Against Road Rage
patrol. On Thursday, San Antonio officially kicks off an elaborate
public-awareness program, complete with billboards and television
spots.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, the book ``Road Rage and Aggressive Driving,'' by
Leon James (aka ``Dr. Driving'') and wife, Diane Nahl, arrives on
store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The two University of Hawaii professors have studied driving
behavior since 1981 and teach a class in traffic psychology. Their
expansive Web site, www.aloha.net-dyc, includes James' 1997
Congressional testimony on aggressive driving and results from
their Web-based surveys.
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of reasons people might be more impatient
and impulsive on the byways. For one, congestion is epidemic in the
cities and suburbs, and commutes are longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are frustrated at how much they have to
drive,'' says Stephanie Faul, communications director for the AAA
Foundation for Traffic Safety. ``They're spending two hours a day
in their car, and they feel like they're wasting that time.
Commuting is boring, especially when you contrast it with the fast
pace of a lot of popular entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also dehumanizing,'' Faul adds. ``You don't see the other
people in cars as being human, you see them as other cars.''
</P>
<P>
   The menacing Dodge Ram. The snooty Mercedes. The bratty Ford
Focus. (Or, in my case, the minding-her-own-business Honda Civic,
which has just a slight problem gaining speed when entering the
freeway, so excuuuuse me!)
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Americans have a tendency to view their cars as an
extension of themselves, as a tool to assert freedom, machismo or
authority, contends James. ``When we enter a car,'' he writes, ``we
use it as an outlet for regaining a sense of control.''
</P>
<P>
   But James and Nahl take it a step further: Aggressive driving
behaviors, they say, are learned years before we merit that first
driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic premise is that aggressive driving is a cultural
norm,'' Nahl explains, ``that we grew up (sitting) in the back
seats of our parents' cars and watching television in which drivers
are very aggressive and get away with it all the time. We simply
absorbed it as children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is we keep track in our heads how well
we're doing out there,'' she adds. ``So if cars are passing us we
lose points. In our own mind, we're losing the game. If we pass
others, we win points; we're winning the game.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges with aggressive driving is that it begets
more aggressive driving. Drunken drivers don't make us drunk,
sleepy drivers don't make us sleepy, but obnoxious drivers turn us
from Jekyll into Hyde. We want to punish the driver who was rude to
us, teach her a lesson, vent our disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   This is my problem. I'm a tad righteous behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Nahl and James dedicate several chapters of their
book to dealing with aggressive drivers (in a word: don't), as well
as a three-step program aimed at changing our driving
personalities. Part of the San Antonio program includes handing out
Traffic Enforcement Education (TEE) cards developed by the
professors that includes a self-assessment test.
</P>
<P>
   Nahl and James advocate an aggressive-driving component in
driver's education courses and a pseudo-group-therapy model they
call Quality Driving Circles, where concerned drivers get together
to vent and exchange ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Nahl believes, aggressive driving ``will become an
unacceptable behavior'' on par with drunken driving, ``partly
because the laws are changing'' and partly because, well, who needs
the stress?
</P>
<P>
   Not me. I have decided to give my fellow drivers the benefit of
the doubt. Who knows? Maybe the Maxima that cut me off had a bad
day at work. Maybe the Suburban that whizzed by has a loved one in
the hospital. Maybe the ...
</P>
<P>
   Hey, buddy! Ever heard of a turn signal?

COLOMBIAN LEADER SAYS U.S. MUST CURB DEMAND FOR DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   by CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ President Andres Pastrana said Tuesday
that Colombia cannot put a dent in international drug trafficking
until the United States and other countries do much more to control
their people's appetite for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia can put a stop to drugs here at some point, but if
the demand continues, somebody else somewhere else in the world is
going to produce them,'' Pastrana said in an interview at a
restored monastery that overlooks the cannon-studded colonial walls
that once protected this port from English and French pirates. ``We
are already getting intelligence reports of possible plantings in
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are talking about is the most lucrative business in
the world,'' he added, ``unless the recent spike in oil prices has
made it the second-most-lucrative business in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, reducing the South American drug trade has proven a
difficult and complex matter, and drug-producing nations have long
made the same contentions. But Pastrana's wary words seemed to
strike a dissonant note, coming on the eve of President Clinton's
arrival here Wednesday, when the leaders are to open a $7.5 billion
plan to address the spreading trafficking problem in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The joint plan aims to cut coca plantings here by 50 percent in
five years through a combination of military pressure, plant
eradication and social reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit will be the first by a U.S. president in 11
years, and it had been seen here as a triumph for Pastrana's
presidency, now at the midpoint of his four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes $1.3 billion in aid to train and outfit a
Colombian anti-drug brigade to support police efforts in
eradicating coca and in halting the processing and shipment of coca
and cocaine in two southern provinces that are largely controlled
by Colombia's largest guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders have expressed fears that the plan will widen
the guerrilla war and spill refugees and coca plants across the
Brazilian, Ecuadorean and Peruvian borders. Clinton and Pastrana
will attempt to counter those concerns with clear public
commitments for more alternative agricultural development and with
relief for coca growers who lose their illegal livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried Tuesday to ease local concerns about U.S.
intervention in a videotaped message to Colombians. ``Please do not
misunderstand our purpose,'' he said. ``We have no military
objective. Let me be clear about the role of the United States.
First, it is not for us to propose a plan. We are supporting the
Colombian plan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a former television journalist and the son of a former
president, Pastrana has a casual charisma. But rising unemployment
and stalled peace talks with Marxist rebel groups that control
large chunks of the nation where the drug industry is spreading
have made him an unpopular president. It is not easy to be
optimistic in a country where the government has lost control of
half of its territory, 2 million people have been displaced and
parents of means buy bullet-proof vests for their children.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was confident that the guerrillas could be persuaded
to negotiate a peace and even to encourage volunteer eradication of
coca crops by peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the United States should play a more active role in
the peace efforts, to encourage the guerrillas to join the fight
against drugs. State Department officials met with leaders of the
country's largest guerrilla group two years ago in Costa Rica, but
all contacts were broken after rebels killed three Americans last
year and refused to turn over any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said the United States could go a long way toward
helping him revive a lagging economy by granting Colombia trade
preferences. He suggested that Colombia could join the United
States, Mexico and Canada in the North American Free Trade
Agreement or that his country and the United States could enter
into the special trade relationship.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said that the possibility of such steps will
be up to the next president and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana was also sanguine that his armed forces are working to
sever their relations with marauding right-wing paramilitary bands,
which have frequently massacred peasants, adding, ``I am not only
committed to human rights because President Clinton is committed to
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana was dressed casually in a short-sleeve shirt and khaki
pants, as if he were just another tourist trying to keep cool under
the sweltering Caribbean sun. But in an interview that was
otherwise characterized by hearty laughs and easy conversation, it
was on the subject of the international drug trade that Pastrana
expressed the most caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are short-term, medium-term and long-term things we can
do, but I think we need more of a commitment from the world
community,'' he said. ``Maybe if we had more money, we could make
more progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50 percent reduction in coca cultivation that Pastrana hopes
to achieve would return Colombia to the levels of 1997. Coca
production has exploded here, despite a large increase in U.S. aid,
as Peruvian and Bolivian eradication efforts made great strides.
When Colombian traffickers could no longer rely on Peruvian and
Bolivian sources, they began large plantings here, and the crop
strains have become more potent.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in Colombian plantings, in turn, has added hundreds
of millions of dollars of protection money to guerrilla coffers,
U.S. and Colombian officials say, expanding rebel ranks and
refueling the 40-year-old guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months guerrillas have attacked small police
detachments around the country, forcing the police to abandon
scores of towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said the United States had come a long way from viewing
the drug traffic as merely ``a police problem'' and to
understanding it as a social disease that requires a multipronged
effort to resolve. He saved his toughest words for Europe (without
naming any countries).
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception I have of Europe,'' he said, ``is that the
Europeans like to think this problem doesn't touch them. But every
day the new trafficking routes are targeting Europe. A big market
is developing there.''

SCIENTIST IS DEDICATED TO SAVING MOST ENDANGERED LIZARD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By WAYNE LEE GAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Hudson is standing in a cage in the Fort Worth Zoo, staring
a Jamaican iguana right in the eye. The iguana stares back with
reptilian calm and affection, almost as if aware that this is the
man who has brought his species back from the edge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of myself as a catalyst,'' says Hudson, 46, taking a
break from his hands-on work with reptiles and amphibians. ``I
rally support, champion causes and catalyze action.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson's affinity for reptiles began in his youth, when he spent
his idle time in the hills near his home in Virginia collecting
salamanders, turtles, frogs and snakes _ and testing the patience
of his snake-fearing mother.
</P>
<P>
   A boyhood hobby became his profession and passion. Hudson is a
nationally recognized herpetologist (one who studies reptiles and
amphibians) based at the Fort Worth Zoo, who has been working to
save the Jamaican iguana, which has the dubious distinction of
being designated the most endangered lizard on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hudson is engaged in preserving life forms that humans
have helped drive to near-extinction, there is still a boyish
enthusiasm in his manner and a sparkle in his eyes when he talks
about animal conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you take a component out of the ecosystem, you don't
know what the consequences will be,'' he says, adding that Jamaican
iguanas were dispersers of seed, and rapidly disappearing Asian
turtles _ another of his projects _ are already missed for their
role as scavengers in areas where they have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, it's more than just a practical issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moral issue,'' he says. ``We're in a rapid extinction
process. These species are here for a reason, and man doesn't have
the right to cause the extinction of another species. And we have
the resources to stop these extinctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson's obsession for the reptile is well-known to his
co-workers in Fort Worth and in the national zoological community.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help catching his passion for the project,'' says
Fort Worth Zoo Executive Director Gregg Hudson, who is not related
to Rick. ``He's always preaching for the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Another colleague at the Fort Worth Zoo, conservation science
manager Tarren Wagener, says:
</P>
<P>
   ``His work is undoubtedly one of the most significant programs
of the AZA (American Zoo and Aquarium Association). He was there at
the beginning of the project. We have the resources here in Fort
Worth to be able to make a difference. There's a committee of us
here who examine and question very closely where we spend our
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson _ a graduate of Blue Ridge Community College and the
University of Richmond _ achieved his boyhood dream of working in a
zoo when he came to Fort Worth as assistant reptile curator in
1980. He had previously had an internship at the Baltimore Zoo.
With zoo support, he became involved in efforts to preserve certain
crocodilians by breeding them in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until 1993 that Hudson developed his interest in
iguanas, first working with an endangered species in the British
Virgin Islands. He soon focused on the Jamaican iguana and the
special problems of preserving a species on a large island with a
vulnerable environment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some endangered animals, iguanas, which measure about 4
feet from tip of tail to tip of nose, respond well to efforts at
revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go in and save these iguanas with minimal resources,''
Hudson says.
</P>
<P>
   The near-extinction of the Jamaican iguana, one of 16 species
and subspecies of iguanas in the West Indies, came about through
the introduction of the Asian mongoose, a small carnivorous mammal
brought to Jamaica to control cane rats in the 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   This proved to be a huge mistake: The rats are nocturnal, the
mongooses diurnal (active in the daytime), and they hardly ever met
up with each other. And, as is often the case, the introduction of
a foreign species gravely undermined the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The mongoose turned out to be a severe problem for native
wildlife in Jamaica, particularly for iguanas which, during the
first five years or so of their 35- to 40-year lifespan, are
regarded by the mongoose as easy prey and a tasty meal. In the
1940s, the Jamaican iguana was declared extinct, and was not
identified by a human being for several decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, however, a dog belonging to pig hunter Edwin Duffus
chased an iguana into a hollow log. Duffus fortunately recognized
the value of the animal, and reported his find to zoologists in
Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   According to Hudson, Duffus became ``a pig hunter turned
conservationist.'' Duffus now works to persuade the local charcoal
burners, who destroy iguana habitat by burning timber to produce
charcoal for sale as fuel, to stay out of an area set aside as an
iguana preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``A successful conservation effort has to have a local
population that cares,'' Hudson says. ``We have motivated, caring
people in Jamaica.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson travels to Jamaica frequently for hands-on work in the
program, often camping in the wooded Hellshire Hills south and west
of Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   Because young iguanas are most vulnerable to the mongoose,
Hunter and his colleagues use what he calls a ``head-start''
program, nurturing iguanas that are taken from nests as hatchlings,
then turned loose around the age of 5. They are monitored with
smartly designed radio transmitters on their backs, carried in
specially made backpacks courtesy of Nike Corp. The wild iguanas
that don't have backpacks apparently don't have any aversion to
interacting with the fashionably outfitted, previously captive
iguanas.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hunter, iguanas raised in early captivity are
``hardwired'' _ that is, they take to life in the wild without
special training, and mix readily with wild iguanas. In 1998, the
program reached a watershed when a ``head-start'' female produced
offspring in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   In a more controlled environment, such as a smaller island,
there might be a reasonable attempt to eradicate the predatory
mongoose. On a larger island such as Jamaica, Hudson can't
completely eliminate the mongoose, but can encourage control of
mongooses, as well as the charcoal burners, within the designated
wild area where the iguana is being re-established. And, on Great
Goat Island off the southeast coast of Jamaica, Hudson and his
colleagues have established an area free of the mongoose, thus
enhancing the Jamaican iguana's chance for survival.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Zoo pays Hudson's salary and the salary of some
support staff while he works on the project, even when he is in
Jamaica. But it is not a costly project, which makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a nonprofit organization, we have to be aware of the
results of spending our dollars,'' Gregg Hudson says. ``With this
project, we see tangible results.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hutchins, director of conservation and science at the
American Zoo and Aquarium Association headquarters in Silver
Spring, Md., says Hudson has ``been tenacious in saving the
Jamaican iguana. Rick led the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchins adds that Hudson's work is something that Fort Worth
can be proud of _ and has an obligation to support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fort Worth Zoo displays wild animals, and has a moral
obligation to contribute to the conservation of these species,'' he
says. ``Zoos have an incredibly important role in conservation
today, including actively preserving endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jamaican iguana is Hudson's primary focus right
now, he's also involved in trying to save the Asian turtle,
although the outlook is less promising. Prized for food and
medicinal purposes, the many varieties and subspecies of that
animal are being threatened by market demands in China. The Fort
Worth Zoo will host an Asian Turtle Workshop in January to
propagate the turtle and exchange ideas for preserving it in
captivity _ at zoos, abandoned hatcheries and, in this case, with
private individuals who can provide an appropriate environment for
the turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson will be at the forefront of that movement as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Fort Worth can be very proud,'' Hutchins says.
``Your program at the Fort Worth Zoo has global significance.''

CLINTON MAKES PEACE PITCH TO EGYPT, AS DIPLOMACY SWEEP CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ President Clinton tried to build Arab support for
a Middle East peace in an hour-long meeting Tuesday with President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Clinton plans to continue the effort in separate
meetings with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and Prime
Minister Enud Barak of Israel; Arafat and Barak will be in New York
for a U.N. meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In an early-morning refueling stop Tuesday on his return from a
three-day trip to Africa, Clinton met with Mubarak and a retinue of
aides at the Cairo International Airport. Clinton is eager to
resolve the decades-long standoff in the five months left of his
presidency, but officials say that in reality the end of September,
just before Israeli elections, is the last opportunity to reconvene
a gathering of Middle East leaders. Another deadline looming is the
Sept. 13 date that the Palestinians have spoken of for declaring a
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is short for resolving this,'' Clinton said as he stood
at Mubarak's side at the airport. ``And I think all the parties
understand that without the involvement and leadership and support
of Egypt, they won't be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Camp David talks collapsed last month without a deal,
administration officials complained that Palestinians had been
unwilling to compromise on key issues and that Arab leaders,
including Mubarak, had not been active enough in building support
for a pact.

   During those talks, Arafat insisted that East Jerusalem be the
capital of a Palestinian state and rejected proposals for shared
sovereignty over the sacred site known by Muslims as Haram al
Sharif and by Jews as the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a State Department spokesman who was asked about
the prospects for a three-way meeting in New York next week said he
had no specific information. But the spokesman, Philip Reeker,
insisted that the Camp David meeting ``produced significant
progress on all of the core issues'' and reiterated that the United
States was ready to support the peace process ``in any way
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the parties are ready to make the tough decisions, we're
ready to bring them together,'' Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   News agencies on Tuesday quoted a senior Palestinian negotiator,
Nabil Shaath, as saying that Arafat and Barak would meet next week
in New York, their first meeting since Camp David. But Barak's
office later denied that a meeting had been set, and Shaath also
later distanced himself from such a session.

   Clinton, who leaves for South America on Wednesday morning after
a brief return to Washington, is engaged in a barrage of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   During a day trip to Colombia, he will meet in Cartagena with
President Andres Pastrana to show U.S. support for the government's
counter-narcotics effort.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he was in Tanzania to witness the signing of an
agreement by some of the parties involved in the vicious armed
conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you let this moment slip away,'' Clinton told the parties
in the Burundi dispute, reflecting on his involvement in numerous
international disputes, ``it will dig the well of bitterness deeper
and pile the mountain of grievances higher, so that someday, when
somebody else has to come here and sit at a table like this, they
will have an even harder job than you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he spoke from experience, having involved himself
in the entrenched disagreements in Northern Ireland, the Balkans
and the Middle East. Dennis Ross, the U.S. senior Middle East
negotiator, told reporters in Cairo that the latest round of
diplomacy was aimed at preventing progress made during the Camp
David talks from slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a window here,'' Ross said. ``There is a possibility,
and everything needs to be done to capitalize on that possibility.
We're determined to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said Mubarak had made clear that the Egyptians were
prepared to do all they could to further the process. At the same
time, he said it would be the parties themselves who would have to
decide on peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the Palestinians will make their own
decisions,'' Ross said. ``No one is going to make decisions for
them, any more than someone is going to make the decisions for the
Israelis.''

IRS LIMITS DEDUCTIONS FOR KIDNAPPED CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The taxpayer's question started out poignant, then turned
pragmatic: My child has been kidnapped. Can I still take a
deduction on my income tax return? The answer this week from an IRS
lawyer was matter of fact: Only for the year in which the child was
abducted.
</P>
<P>
   According to the IRS _ which would not identify the questioner,
because Congress has made tax matters private _ a taxpayer last
April asked one of its customer service representatives whether an
exemption could be claimed for a child who was kidnapped last year.
And, the taxpayer wondered, could the exemption be claimed in
future years if the child's room was being maintained and money was
spent on a search?
</P>
<P>
   In a reply that the agency released Monday, George Baker, an IRS
lawyer, said that in the year of the kidnapping, Congress allows
the tax break. But in subsequent years no exemption can be claimed,
he wrote, because the tax law generally requires a parent to
provide more than half the support for a child to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's advisory opinion acknowledged that ``the issue is not
free from doubt''; the lawyer said he could not find a case that
addressed these issues directly. But he relied heavily on a 1980
Tax Court case in which Ebrahim Otmishi sought an exemption for a
child, Jeiran, who had been abducted by his wife, Mina _ or,
alternatively, to deduct the costs of hunting for his child as a
theft loss. The court ruled against him.
</P>
<P>
   Several tax experts said Tuesday that they agreed with the
lawyer's advisory opinion _ though not all were confident how long
it would stand. ``Now I expect we will see Republicans and
Democrats racing each other to show how much they care about
kidnapped children by fixing the law before the elections,'' said
Lee Sheppard, a tax lawyer known for her acerbic critiques of tax
policy in the journal Tax Notes.
</P>
<P>
   Many missing children, experts say, have been taken by a parent
denied custody in a divorce. One study by the National Center for
Juvenile Justice, a private research group in Pittsburgh, found
that 24 percent of abductions are by strangers and the rest by
relatives or friends.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a parent holding a child in such circumstances probably
would not qualify for a tax deduction _ and a kidnapper who was a
stranger certainly would not _ under a 1958 law in which Congress
denied dependent exemptions when ``the relationship between such
individual and the taxpayer is in violation of local law.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Barry Forman, a University of Oklahoma law professor
who specializes in family tax matters, said he was surprised at the
IRS position.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to an IRS regulation that lets parents of newborns
who remain hospitalized list the children as dependents on the
theory that, but for their medical condition, they would be part of
the household. By applying the same reasoning, the IRS could let
parents of abducted children claim the deduction, Forman said.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers claiming an exemption for a child must list the
child's Social Security number on their tax return. In 1999,
taxpayers could deduct $2,750 from their adjusted gross income for
each dependent.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Keith, the senior IRS spokesman, said as best he could
determine Tuesday, the agency does not run the Social Security
numbers of missing children against tax returns to help locate the
children.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom paid to recover an abducted child is deductible, the IRS
ruled in 1972. It said such payments are treated as theft losses
due to extortion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Innovation is hot these days _ what company doesn't want to be
considered innovative?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many unit heads and managers often assume that
coming up with creative ideas is somebody else's responsibility.
After all, the innovations that get the most attention are
technologies or services that find huge markets (Post-it notes,
online trading) or that somehow change the rules of the business
game (a new e-purchasing system).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what might be called ground-level innovation _ new
products or processes developed on the shop or office floor _ can
be a powerful competitive weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following example: Managers and employees of
Gardner Merchant, a U.K.-based industrial food-service and catering
company, came up with a number of ideas to boost revenue. They
began profiling the customers at each location and tailoring the
food accordingly. They developed a frequent-flyer-style ``food
miles'' scheme to encourage more patronage of the cafeterias. They
even sponsored cooking demonstrations, which increased cafeteria
patronage 12.5 percent, according to Bob Nelson, author of the book
''1001 Ways to Take Initiative at Work'' (Workman Publishing,
2000).
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips to create a culture of everyday innovation:
</P>
<P>
   TALK TO CUSTOMERS
</P>
<P>
   That's a Marketing 101 lesson, and most business units with
external customers make a point of asking those customers what else
they might need.
</P>
<P>
   But even units such as human resources or maintenance have
customers; they're just inside the organization. How many such
departments ever ask the managers and employees they serve how they
could improve?
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems' famous real-time accounting system got its start
five years ago with one such step. According to Fortune's Thomas A.
Stewart, the company's salespeople were ``fuming'' because expense
reporting was cumbersome and reimbursement slow. The finance
department figured out how to move the process to the Web, thereby
speeding it up and delighting the salespeople. That move led to an
automated commission system, one big step toward real-time
financial reporting.
</P>
<P>
   LISTEN TO EMPLOYEES
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion systems, brainstorming sessions, ``innovation
challenge'' meetings _ there's no shortage of techniques to solicit
innovative ideas from employees.
</P>
<P>
   Set a goal of coming up with ideas for five product
improvements, 10 workable cost-cutting suggestions or three ways to
boost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In many companies the main challenge isn't coming up with ideas.
It's figuring out whether and how to implement them. Experts
recommend these approaches:
</P>
<P>
   1. Guilty until proven innocent. In a brainstorming session,
every idea is worth writing down. When it comes to selecting,
evaluating and implementing innovative ideas, however, start by
assuming they're all worthless. This avoids wasting time on bad
ones.
</P>
<P>
   2. Not just the usual suspects. It's always tempting to populate
the research-and-evaluation team with people who are the most
knowledgeable in any given area. Trouble is, that's likely to
produce answers based on what these people already know.
</P>
<P>
   David Snowden, director of IBM Corp.'s Institute of Knowledge
Management, suggests mixing in some people who are good at
networking _ people who will ask around outside the group and get
ideas no one has thought of.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH FOR DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION
</P>
<P>
   The ground-level innovator faces the same potential pitfall as
the official new-product developer: Listening to customers and even
employees is likely to generate ideas for more of the same, only
better. Meanwhile, new technology or business practices may be
creating radical alternatives that you hardly notice until they
take away your reason for being.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate print shops and travel departments, for example, may
be great at what they do, yet still fall victim to sophisticated
and less expensive external service providers. But sometimes new
technology can be co-opted and implemented at home, as when a print
shop switches over to the latest desktop-publishing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ground-level innovation is like a stealth weapon, hardly visible
to competitors. But it may be one armament that distinguishes
victors from vanquished in today's business battles.

avoid. Here are five of the most common.
</P>
<P>
   NOT REHEARSING
</P>
<P>
   Lack of rehearsal is the most common mistake business presenters
make.
</P>
<P>
   Professional performers find this lapse in good sense
inexplicable. Musicians practice for hours daily. Actors rehearse
for up to six weeks before a show. And yet, business presenters
say, ``I'll just wing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the four saddest words in the business lexicon. Nine
times out of 10, they lead to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Why not rehearse? Afraid of looking silly? You'll feel much
worse bombing in front of the real crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Are you so nervous that the idea of rehearsing is almost as bad
as the speaking itself? Then you need rehearsal more than most.
Remember, the alternative is worse.
</P>
<P>
   NOT TELLING YOUR AUDIENCE WHY YOU'RE THERE
</P>
<P>
   Audiences come to hear a presentation with one question in their
minds: why are we here?
</P>
<P>
   Don't begin by giving them the information that you've carefully
prepared. Instead, tell them why your material is important. Only
then will they settle in to listen to all the brilliant material
you have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   How long should you spend framing the issue? It depends on how
familiar the audience is with the topic. If you're discussing a
well-known problem, you can dispense with the orientation in a few
minutes. If you're delving into material that's new to them, you
may want to take longer.
</P>
<P>
   INTRODUCING THE TOPIC, EXPLAINING IT, THEN SUMMARIZING WHAT WAS
SAID.
</P>
<P>
   This bit of advice has been a staple of public speaking courses.
The problem is that audiences today are quicker to pick up the
context than they used to be _ and they have shorter attention
spans.
</P>
<P>
   If you begin by giving them a quick summary of what you're going
to say, audiences will spend the time getting settled, scanning
their appointment books or deciding whether to attend another
presentation. Then, when you get to the end and offer a summary,
they'll start to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Endings are crucial for successful public speaking because they
are what people are most likely to remember. Skip the summary and
end with a bang _ something useful and new for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   USING TOO MANY SLIDES
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, probably because PowerPoint has made slide
creation far too easy, listeners everywhere are inundated with
massive numbers of slides.
</P>
<P>
   Slides should be used sparingly to show a powerful visual image
that reinforces a key point.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of slides misuses the medium. Why? When your audience
is looking at the slide, it's not looking at you. You have lost the
attention of your listeners, even if for only a brief time. You
then must put out a great deal of extra energy to get that
attention back.
</P>
<P>
   Rule of thumb: Limit yourself to one slide every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   USING SLIDES AS A SPEECH OUTLINE
</P>
<P>
   Far too many speakers today create a slide ``deck'' by dumping
all the information they have into slides and, as a result,
presenting an endless show of data.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Word-heavy slides that essentially represent an
outline for the speaker to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But, you say, it's comforting for the presenter. So what's wrong
with presenting the audience with an outline of the speech through
slides?
</P>
<P>
   First, it kills the mystery out of the speech. The audience can
see where the speaker is going and get bored. Also, reading all
those words, and reconciling them with what the speaker actually
says, is tiring.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, the speaker will appear unprepared, and that
is both discourteous to the audience and a signal of disaster to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Don't join the throngs of boring business speakers and dull
presentations. Refuse to follow these surefire rules for failure.
</P>
<P>
   But be warned if you do: You may find your audiences actually
listening to what you have to say.

MASTERING THE ART OF BUSINESS IN THE COMPANY OF WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  By   JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They were pioneers, those first women to set foot in a
business school. They struggled to be taken seriously in classes
and rarely read a positive word about businesswomen in their
studies. Then two Harvard Business School professors, fed up with a
male culture they thought antagonized female students, as well as
women academics like themselves, had a radical idea: a business
school just for women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, with $37,000 in grants and two typing rooms borrowed
from a women's college, they created a school with a feminist bent,
where women were guaranteed to dominate every class discussion.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century later, the Graduate School of Management at
Simmons College is still the only all-woman MBA program in the
world _ but how the world has changed. Other business schools have
thrown open their doors to women, even actively recruited them.
Women now make up 30 percent of business school classes, according
to the Education Department, up from 6 percent then, and hold about
half the middle-management positions, up from 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished, in a way that would seem to make Simmons
obsolete. Yet this small, unaccredited school in Boston's Back Bay
has increased its class size 25 percent since 1995 while more
prominent business schools are struggling for applicants. Why do
they come? For the same things they seek in a workplace: supportive
colleagues, flexible scheduling and, they say, a chance to be
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Take the babies. ``I wanted mine to coincide with graduation,''
said April Steele, 32, one of seven pregnant women in her strategy
and leadership class this year. Their fellow students gave them no
second looks as they eased themselves into the auditorium chairs,
unless they were looks of sympathy. At one class, a discussion on
financial structuring even sidetracked to obstetricians and massage
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Would a classroom of men tolerate such talk? Not likely, Steele
believes. ``A guy would say, `Let's just move on,'' she said. When
her son was born earlier than expected, she brought him with her to
her final class.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Simmons prides itself on coddling students. Classes
follow the rigorous case-study method pioneered by the Harvard
Business School. But more of the cases feature women
decision-makers, and most are taught by women professors.
</P>
<P>
   More than gender separates her students from the majority of MBA
candidates. Their average age is 32, three years older than the
typical business school graduate. They have an average of eight
years work experience. The majority attend part time, and many are
jumping from jobs as teachers or nurses into business. Classes are
so flexible that a student can flip between day and night classes
and take up to five years to complete a degree.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them would not have gone to business school at all were
it not for Simmons, they say. ``Nontraditional'' students, like
women who did not finish college because of family obligations, are
welcome. (That, in part, is why the school remains unaccredited.)
Half of the applicants over 34 applied only to Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Steele was all but dragged into Simmons by one of her bosses, a
Simmons graduate. ``She gave me the kick I needed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fiercely loyal network of alumnae is arguably one of
the most active among business schools. Graduates encourage others,
from 20-somethings to established career women, to give it a try,
providing the school with a steady stream of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   While about 20 percent of the students are from abroad, the
majority are locals who wind up in Boston-area companies. Last
year, BankBoston, which has since merged with Fleet, had more than
50 Simmons graduates as executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke around town is, `Oh, here comes another Simmons
grad,''' said Gail Deegan, class of 1978, and currently the chief
financial officer at Houghton Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
   When Anne Jardim and Margaret Hennig founded the school, their
focus was simple enough: to teach women how to get along in a man's
business world and how to cope with the so-called glass ceiling
that held them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, the sense was teaching women the rules of
the game,'' said Joyce K. Fletcher, a Simmons professor. ``Women
hadn't been socialized to really understand how businesses were
run.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Jardim and Hennig ran the school with the
devotion and verve of entrepreneurs. The two scholars, who wrote
the influential 1976 book, ``The Managerial Woman,'' saw Simmons as
a way to promote their thesis that men and women have distinct
management styles, with women more attuned to collaborative work.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable accomplishment of Simmons is its
ability to survive as its original purpose loses relevance. Laura
D' Andrea Tyson, dean of the Walter A. Haas School of Business of
the University of California at Berkeley and the first woman to
lead a major business school, said classroom equality has not even
been an issue in the two years of her tenure. ``It's certainly true
that the social conditions of the 1970s are not the social
conditions of today,'' Tyson said. ``The opportunities for women
have gotten better, and that's great.''

EXPLORING THE CULTURE OF WINE IN ANCIENT TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Beaucaire, near Nimes in the south of France, the Durand
family operates two wineries. One is a typical modern winery
producing red, white and rose wines under the Chateau des Tourelles
label. The other is a re-creation of a Roman winery that thrived on
the site 2,000 years ago and whose remains were unearthed only 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can get to Beaucaire to visit Herve Durand's Roman
winery and taste his recreated Roman wines, known as mulsum and
turriculae. But the next best thing might be a visit to the
fascinating exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York called
``Drink and Be Merry: Wine and Beer in Ancient Times,'' which runs
through Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Through workaday farm tools, gloriously illustrated ceremonial
vessels, paintings, sculpture and mosaics, the show traces the
development of wine and beer _ mostly wine _ since the dawn of
history to the rise of Islam in the seventh century.
</P>
<P>
   While the exhibition emphasizes the consumption of wine and beer
and their place in ancient culture, there are exceptional
depictions of how grapes were grown and how wine and beer were
made. Most of the material is from Israel, where the exhibition was
created and shown last year, supplemented by items from around the
Middle East and from Greece and Rome.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of intense research, no one has been able to determine
what grapes were grown in the ancient world or what kind of wines
were made. From ancient texts it is known that there were many
varieties of wine. As the handsome catalog accompanying the show
notes, ``the Talmud refers to 60 types of wine, discussing them in
terms of their quality, value and use.''
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that some, if not most, ancient wines were made
from fermented raisins. This would mean wines with higher alcohol
levels and increased sugar, which may be one reason the ancient
records speak so often of mixing wine with water. (Such mixing is
still commonplace where hot climates produce high-alcohol wines.)
</P>
<P>
   Pliny the Elder listed 80 wine types and grape varieties,
two-thirds produced in Italy, while the historian and geographer
Strabo, who lived in the first century B.C., concluded that there
were perhaps 130 kinds of wine.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that grapes were cultivated as fruit _ not
necessarily for wine _ in the Neolithic period. Agricultural
archaeologists know, too, that the vines that produced the best
ancient wines were Vitis vinifera, the most important species for
modern wine production. There are now _ and presumably were then _
thousands of varieties of Vitis vinifera.
</P>
<P>
   There were apparently many grades of wine. Excavations at
Masada, the site of King Herod's fortress, turned up the Roman wine
jugs called amphoras bearing the inscription ``For Herod of
Judea.'' Evidently, Herod was partial to Italian wine. Some
amphoras were inscribed, ``From the vineyards of Lucius Laenis,''
who may well have been the Robert Mondavi of his time.
</P>
<P>
   There must have been considerable spoiled wine, because the
fermentation jugs on display show no efficient way of keeping air
out during fermentation. That may explain why so much wine was
flavored. Spices like myrrh were used; so were honey, balsam,
pepper and wormwood.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, new wine was actually a base from which various drinks
could be made. As Durand put it: ``They added plaster to temper the
wine's bitterness, clay to combat its softness, lime to deacidify
it, saffron to color it and mushroom ashes to bleach red wine
white. Among other things, they added roasted date pits, egg white
and pork blood to wine _ even saltwater, to satisfy the Roman
craving for salt.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden barrels or casks were unknown until the third or second
century B.C. In the ancient world, wine was fermented, stored and
shipped in the amphora, an earthenware jug with a narrow neck, two
vertical handles, wide shoulders and a pointed bottom that was
inserted into a wooden base.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging from little more than a liter to well over 1,000 liters,
amphoras were ubiquitous in the ancient world. Thousands have been
found, mostly in shards but many intact. It is thought that
thousands lie on the sea bottom, particularly the Mediterranean, in
the holds of wine- and oil-carrying ships lost thousands of years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Probably because of the large number of exquisite objects it
displays, the exhibition may seem to emphasize the ceremonial side
of wine culture over the commercial. But it does devote
considerable space to the ancient wine trade.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first vessels for shipping wine was the earthenware
Canaanite jar. The exhibition includes one from the 14th or 13th
century BC, when the jars were common in the eastern Mediterranean,
often carrying wine from Canaan to Egypt. When what is now Israel
was under Ptolemaic rule, Canaan was Egypt's primary source of
wine.
</P>
<P>
   The amounts of wine consumed in the ancient world can only be
interpolated from other records, but they were not inconsequential.
A Roman winery whose ruins were discovered in northern Spain is
estimated to have produced some 75,000 liters of wine a year.
Attached to the reconstructed Roman winery at Beaucaire was a
pottery that is estimated to have produced 3,000 to 4,000 amphoras
a day. They would have had a capacity of almost Gallolike
proportions.

NEWBORN WHITES IN MINORITY IN BOSTON FOR FIRST TIME: CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Balloons and teddy bears filled the nursery at Boston
Medical Center last weekend. Twelve infants lay in their cribs,
eyes shut, looking snuggly in their prams.
</P>
<P>
   Though they don't know it, they represent the changing face of
Boston. Six black babies. Two Latinos. One Asian. Three whites,
according to a hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Whites once made up the majority of births in Boston. Now,
they're the minority. In fact, for the first time black children in
nearly every age category outnumber white children in Suffolk
County, according to US Census statistics released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 the Census estimates that 13,790 white children under
age 4 were living in Suffolk County, which incorporates Boston and
the adjacent communities of Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop, compared
to 20,630 black children. Ten years ago, the Census counted 19,165
white children and 16,447 black children under age 4.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues, the new generations of babies will not
only dramatically alter the racial balance of the city but touch
off major shifts in social policy, school curriculums, media
programming and _ as evidenced in heavily minority cities like Los
Angeles _ ethnic strife, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``As minority children increasingly become the majority, class
and ethnic and racial issues will crystallize around deficits in US
policy relating to education and health care,'' said Charles
Derber, professor of sociology at Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Though the birthrate of whites continues to drop on a percentage
basis, whites still far outnumber black statewide _ 5.5 million to
405,000. But in urban areas the growing change in racial balance is
more apparent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Boston Health Commission's study of 1998
births, Latinos had the highest birthrate, followed by
African-Americans, then Asians, then whites.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the nation, fewer white children are being born than
in years past. The birth rate of white women is 1.9 children,
compared to 2.9 children for Latinas _ the highest rate of any
ethnic group, according to the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Black births are expected to increase steadily by 60 percent
between now and 2050, Asian births are expected to triple, and
Native American births will increase by half.
</P>
<P>
   There are a myriad of reasons for the declining birth rate among
white women: They tend to have more demanding careers, and for that
reason put off having children. Also, in Latino, Asian and
African-American cultures women are expected to put children first,
careers second.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just happening in the United States. You have to
look at white women in an international context,'' said Sheila B.
Kamerman, professor at the Columbia University School of Social
Work and director of the university's Institute for Child and
Family Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The birth rate of white women in industrial countries throughout
Europe has been declining steadily to its current rate of about 1.6
children per woman, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, whites watching the rising births of
minority children may use their political strength to focus on
issues relating to non-minority issues, and steer money away from
issues like public education, specialists say. But eventually as
minorities vote in larger numbers, the balance of political power
will shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to recognize that other people's children will be
the ones who will be contributing to society,'' Kamerman said.
``They are the ones who are going to be paying the social security
benefits of the elderly in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   She cites California as an example of what happens as minority
populations grow and begin to flex their political muscle. In the
mid-'90s, amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment, California voters
passed anti-affirmative action initiatives that affected minorities
in education, government jobs and schools. Those initiatives have
been struck down in the courts, and politicians these days steer
clear from the issue. Along the way, a large percentage of people
of color _ most notably Latinos and Asian-Americans _ registered to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perspective has switched. People recognize the fact that
minorities will be the majority in California not so far from
now,'' Kamerman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the change in complexion won't come easily in some areas,
says BC's Derber, who fears that as the minority populations swell,
whites will wall themselves off _ exacerbating the class economic
differences between the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles has become infamous in the '90s for essentially
producing an architecture and social culture in which a form of
apartheid is raised,'' Derber said. ``You almost have a two-caste
city in which you need pass keys to get into parks, where whites
live in gated communities.''

EVEN SWEETS ARE SWEETER WITH SALT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Also see SALT-VARIETIES) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It takes a certain kind of person to season sweet
roasted pineapple with salt, place it atop a salty nut brittle and
serve it as a kind of tart. Or to shower a molten chocolate cake
with coarse salt when it comes out of the oven. Or to saute
cantaloupe, sprinkle it with fleur de sel and serve it with a
spoonful of sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   There is such a person. In fact, there are several. That tart
was thought up by Claudia Fleming, the pastry chef at Gramercy
Tavern; the chocolate cake by Philippe Conticini, the chef at
Petrossian Boutique and Cafe; and the cantaloupe dessert by Alex
Asteinza, the pastry chef at Patria.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of a small group in New York who are taking a new
look at how salt is used in desserts, treating it as a tool to
heighten some flavors and contrast others; to assert its own
flavor; and sometimes, as with the chocolate cake, to give a dish
that surprising, delicate crunch. By doing so, they are entirely
changing the way dessert is conceived, approaching it more like a
main course, with a complex structure that balances sweet, salty,
sour and bitter components.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Fleming's pineapple dessert. It is a sublime
collaboration of distinct parts, not a marriage of flavors. A
circle of tiny triangles of roasted pineapple are pointed upward
like jagged peaks. Above them is a cap of black-pepper ice cream,
melting in the crevices. Below is a pebbly foundation of macadamia
nut brittle _ minute bits that shatter like ice in your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Each has a flavor that feels somehow magnified: the pineapple is
exceedingly rich and succulent, the brittle buttery, the ice cream
minerally and smoky. But there is something else, too, and it is
not apparent on the first taste. Each component is heavily salted.
Taste it again and it will be unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   Salt in the brittle keeps the nuts from seeming flabby. Sea salt
on the pineapple tempers its sweetness, and a healthy dose of
kosher salt in the ice cream underscores the black pepper, making
it it a firm counterpoint to the sweet fruit. But mostly, the salt
adds dimension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salt does the same thing in pastry that it does in cooking,''
Fleming said. ``It enhances flavor. It rounds out flavor, and it
makes everything seem to come together.'' It also makes you thirst
for more.
</P>
<P>
   Salt's traditional role in desserts was to elevate flavor. But
it was never used to this extent. A typical traditional recipe
calls for no more than a teaspoon. Cooks always assume that the
salt is table salt and that a hint is sufficient. It makes sense to
use more flavorful, mellower salts like sea salt, kosher salt and
delicate fleur de sel _ just as you would in cooking _ and to add
enough until you can taste the difference, until you've actually
seasoned the dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming was enlightened by Conticini, a man for whom both salt
and carrots belong in desserts. For years, he has been stretching
dessert's definitions, using salt where it was never seen, spices
where they were never imagined, and including vegetables and foods
generally accepted as savory under the umbrella of sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   When he gives cooking demonstrations, one of his tricks is to
sprinkle fleur de sel on chocolate and give it to everyone within
reach. Fleming got it once, and it changed her. ``I was like
`Wow,''' she said, ``It made me salivate. It intensified the flavor
of the chocolate and it wasn't really salty. Using salt as a
garnish seemed suddenly natural.''
</P>
<P>
   At Petrossian, Conticini allows salt to get into all sorts of
unusual scenarios. Fleur de sel is sprinkled on hazelnut and
chocolate cakes. The crystals sparkle, like diamonds embedded in
soil. The salt does not emerge in every bite; just now and then a
faint crunch will appear. At these moments the flavor changes _ it
comes alive more, then retreats, and the cake becomes sweet again.
</P>
<P>
   A yablock at Petrossian (listed under the heading ``Teasers,''
which are defined as ``something truly new, unusual combinations of
flavor and texture that are guaranteed to delight the senses'')
contains green apple preserves, marinated carrot sticks,
caramelized popcorn and fleur de sel.
</P>
<P>
   The counters are lined with small stainless steel bins filled
with jellies, nuts, spices, compotes and fleur de sel for topping
ice cream; they are like the vials of powders in a laboratory. The
fleur de sel is sprinkled on the blinchick teaser, a cup filled
with caramel foam, molasses jelly, pears, coconut juice and vanilla
ice cream. It is Conticini's idea of a sundae and it is very good.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the innovators use salt with such abandon. In the
chocolate tart at Le Bernardin, the salt would only be perceptible
if taken away. The chocolate filling is dark, bitter and acidic,
and is mixed with enough butter to be as deadly as it tastes. It is
dammed up by a thin pastry crust, a component that could easily
seem inconsequential except that the salt in it contrasts with the
chocolate, providing some relief and at the same time making you
salivate for more.
</P>
<P>
   The difference the salt makes is very subtle, but to Florian
Bellanger, the pastry chef, it's just the kind of nuance that
distinguishes his work from others'.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is not to taste salt,'' Bellanger said, ``It's to
push the flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Herme, who, like Conticini, is known in France for his
willingness to experiment, began stretching the traditional role of
salt in desserts a decade ago when he discovered fleur de sel.
``It's one of the major ingredients,'' Herme said. ``If you want to
see what it can do, you get a slice of baguette, you put ordinary
chocolate on top, and you put it in the oven. After five minutes,
when it comes out, you sprinkle some olive oil and put maybe four
or five grains of fleur de sel on it, and you will see how fleur de
sel can push the flavor of the chocolate. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt also has a chemical role. In doughs and pastry it enhances
texture as well. A brioche made without salt will be tough and
dense with a hard crust. Puff pastry will taste flat, greasy and
will not color.
</P>
<P>
   Salt has an unusual effect on fat, as well. ``When you eat sweet
butter on bread,'' Bellanger said, ``in your mouth you feel some
kind of fat, some kind of oiliness on the palate. If you do that
with salted butter you don't get that same sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   His Brittany butter cookies, made with salted butter, have a
clean finish. Though the cookies are loaded with butter, you are
left with a salty creamy flavor. This idea recently prompted
Fleming to experiment with her beignets, which she serves in lieu
of petit fours.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, she rolls them in sugar and cinnamon. But this time,
she rolled a few in a mixture of sugar, salt and cinnamon. Those
done her usual way tasted of oil; I was sated after one. Those with
salt maintained a sweet, clean taste, and they kept disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Salt is most effective with rich, strong flavors. Most caramels,
for instance, are salted to counter the sweetness. In nut brittles,
cookies and ice creams, extra salt gives definition to the flavor
of the nuts and cuts down on their fattiness, if only deceivingly.
If you've ever tasted Ciao Bella's Heath Bar Crunch against any of
its other ice creams, the salt practically screams at you.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   At Eleven Madison Park, Nicole Kaplan, the pastry chef, decided
to use a pistachio paste made with salted roasted pistachios to
fill a pithivier. Even when folded into pastry cream, it had a
cloudlike lightness, and the flavor of the nuts came through
purely, without the interference of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Acidic fruits like pineapple and passion fruit need salt to
soften their sharpness and to highlight flavors other than
sweetness. For her pineapple creme brulee, Kaplan first salts the
pineapple for about an hour, to draw off some of the liquid and
concentrate its juices, before roasting it.
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurant desserts are actually turning savory. Asteinza's
sauteed cantaloupe is a play on melon and prosciutto. The cooked
melon is sprinkled with both salt and pepper, served with thin
ribbons of fresh cantaloupe and a quenelle of gazpacho sorbet. (It
is as delicious as it is odd.)
</P>
<P>
   The point, however, is not that salt should be used so radically
or pervasively. Sprinkling a little fleur de sel over a warm rich
cake is an easy flourish. So is roasting nuts in sugar and salt
before adding them to cookies or ice cream. You can add more salt
to a cake batter when using a rich frosting or to cookie batter if
you're also adding chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when Fleming first made that black-pepper ice
cream at Gramercy Tavern, she asked Tom Colicchio, the chef, to
taste it. ``He said it needed salt,'' she said, ``and I thought,
`Salt?' Then almost granule by granule he added it, and we could
see the flavor come up. That was the beginning of salt and ice
cream for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt is not used superfluously in her desserts _ in fact, it
isn't perceptible in many of them. In the fall, she makes a concord
grape focaccia seasoned with raw sugar, sea salt and pepper. It's
clever, perhaps brilliant, and yet restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Her chocolate caramel tart with caramel ice cream is
unforgettable. Salt crystals on the surface of the tart look like
specks of dust on polished wood. Each bite of the tart is
relentless in its richness and changes as the salt crystals melt;
they are like flickers of light on your palate. From this intensity
you cross the plate, where a scoop of caramel ice cream sits. It is
bitter, almost malty, and also noticeably salty. You end up
bouncing back and forth between indulgence and relief, just as you
would with foie gras terrine and a Sauternes gelee. &QL;

   SAUTEED CANTALOUPE WITH FLEUR DE SEL  &QL; 
Adapted from Patria &QL; 
Time: 25 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 medium cantaloupes
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon fleur de sel, or coarse sea salt finely ground
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Using a serrated knife, remove peel of both cantaloupes. Cut
them in half lengthwise. With a spoon, gently remove seeds, being
careful not to bruise the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   2. Set aside one cantaloupe half. Place remaining three halves
cut side down on a cutting board. Slice each half lengthwise into
six spears, for a total of 18 spears. Using a vegetable peeler,
shave remaining cantaloupe half into paper-thin slices, and
refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a large saute pan over low heat, melt 4 tablespoons sugar
until it liquefies and turns a light caramel color, about 1{
minutes. Add half the cantaloupe spears, and saute for about 30
seconds on each side. Add \ cup water, and simmer until water is
almost gone, about 5 minutes. Transfer cantaloupe to a plate, and
repeat with remaining cantaloupe spears, the remaining 4
tablespoons sugar, and an additional \ cup water.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, sprinkle spears evenly with fleur de sel. Place
three spears on each of six serving plates, and garnish with the
chilled paper-thin cantaloupe slices and two turns of freshly
ground pepper.

WHEN THE SALT OF THE EARTH ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Also see SALT-DESSERTS)  
 By By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All of a sudden, the city's chefs have gone salt
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a matter of too much or too little _ but what kind?
Preferably something so exotic the diner has never eaten it or
heard of it, and probably couldn't buy it anywhere within a
thousand miles. They're using a wild variety of salts for flavoring
and color, actually as garnishes like chopped herbs. The city is
becoming one big salt lick.
</P>
<P>
   At Esca, you might get pearly slivers of raw black bass
sprinkled with black lava salt from Hawaii. The sea scallop ceviche
at Aquavit glitters with sandy grains of delicate African salt. At
Red Cat, the foie gras wears a sparkle of $32-a-pound Hawaiian red
clay salt, a salt that had been used primarily in island rituals
before chefs there picked up on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clay adds a real earthiness to the foie gras that the
other salts don't contribute,'' said Jimmy Bradley, the chef.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year or so, chefs have begun using salts with the
discernment and, some might say, the fanaticism, that was long
reserved for the rarest olive oils. Today it's not uncommon to find
seven or more precious salts in a top kitchen. A chef who collects
them with a fervor that borders on obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Samuelsson, at Aquavit, is constantly on the lookout: his
most recent find was the African clay salt he picked up on a trip
there. But he is also creating his own ``salts'' by drying and
grinding salty ingredients like serrano ham and duck confit. Michel
Nischan, the chef at Heartbeat, discovered his pink Peruvian sea
salt while watching a documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from the Andes,'' he said. ``And they have a land-locked
ocean there, the salt lake that had dried out, and once a year they
harvest the salt. They go out with a saw and cut the salt into
large bricks and they mound them on their llamas. They travel with
them about 200 miles to the nearest city, and they trade them for a
year's worth of provisions. I saw it on the Discovery Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   The salt, he said, has a minerally quality: ``It's unbelievable
on sliced ripe tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   These salts are expensive _ they begin at $32 a pound, and cost
as much as $84 a pound for a smoked Danish salt that Nischan finds
essential for a salmon dish. It's a significant investment _
especially if you consider that plain table salt is about 25 cents
a pound. Some chefs have given that up completely.
</P>
<P>
   At Union Pacific, Rocco DiSpirito uses only sea salt; he even
salts the water for blanching vegetables and boiling pasta with
French sea salt. ``Sea salt tastes a lot better than mined salt,''
he said. ``It's got a real saline, ocean character that comes
across in the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular table salt and kosher salt are mined from the earth;
they are cheap and characterless because they must be highly
refined. Sea salt is produced from evaporating seawater. It can be
quickly evaporated and superrefined, and it sells for just a few
dollars, or it can be left with a lot of the minerals in it, like
the good, grayish or off-white sea salts, and the rarer kinds chefs
now covet.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular sea salts among chefs are sel gris, a moist
gray, large-grained salt usually from Brittany or Normandy, and
fleur de sel, an expensive, gently flavored, off-white salt with
small lacy flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Herme, the French pastry chef, is so completely enamored
of fleur de sel that he never leaves home without it: for the last
10 years he has carried a small, specially made wooden box filled
with it in his briefcase at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often have to use it in restaurants,'' he said. ``It can
even turn a bad meal into something not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite of Bradley at Red Cat and other chefs is farmed
in Essex, England. Maldon sea salt has characteristic
pyramid-shaped crystals that shimmer in the light like diamond
chips. This salt, like the red clay and most of the more exotic
salts on the scene, is best raw. Bradley compares the salts to the
best quality extra virgin olive oils.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cook with them,'' he said, ``their flavors diminish.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the raw fish dishes at Esca called crudos. What makes more
sense than using raw sea salt with raw seafood? David Pasternack,
the chef there, uses a different sea salt with each kind of
seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the salts possesses a different flavor,'' he said,
``and you have to learn how to use them to their best advantage.
The black salt tastes like you're taking a bite of the earth, so I
use that with a stronger fish. The red salt is milder, so it goes
with a blander fish.''
</P>
<P>
   For cooking, Pasternack sticks with relatively neutral salts,
like a fine-grained Sicilian. He then adds a more potent salt as a
garnish. In an appetizer of seared Maine shrimp, he seasons the
shrimp with the Sicilian salt, then cooks them in extra virgin
olive oil. To finish the dish, instead of a sauce the shrimp get a
drizzle of estate bottled extra virgin olive oil and a shower of
the black lava salt _ two kinds of olive oil and two kinds of salt
for five shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that all of these unusual sea salts have their
own distinctive flavors, there is undeniably something to be said
for the aesthetics of their large crystalline grains and vivid
colors.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Colicchio, the chef of Gramercy Tavern, occasionally uses
Hawaiian red clay salt to finish a dish of white-fleshed turbot.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he likes that particular salt with that
particular fish he replied, ``It shows up.'' &QL;

RICO STATUTE CAN BE USED AGAINST LAPD, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON TERRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge has ruled that the government's
anti-racketeering statute, created to deal with drug bosses and
organized crime figures, can be used in lawsuits against the
troubled Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Besides allowing one of the largest police departments in the
United States to be dealt with like a criminal enterprise, the
decision on Monday by Judge William J. Rea of federal District
Court drastically increases the city's potential liability in its
worst police scandal in decades, since the law permits a longer
statute of limitations and could triple the damages the city could
otherwise face.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves claims by one of the many people who say they
were victims of violent and corrupt officers at the department's
Rampart Division, whose actions are at the heart of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said Tuesday that it appeared the department would
be the first police agency in the country to face trial under the
statute, which over the years has come to be used in a wide variety
of litigation. Edwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University
of Southern California, said he spent Monday evening researching
the matter and could find no other case in which a police
department had been brought to trial using the statute, known as
RICO _ the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.
</P>
<P>
   Rea did not deal with the credibility of the plaintiff's claim
that the department condoned and authorized the actions by corrupt
officers, but said that if those accusation are true, they would
constitute racketeering activity and so would come under the RICO
law.
</P>
<P>
   Under RICO, the statue of limitations is 10 years, rather than
one year like in other civil rights litigation, so the ruling could
open the courtroom to many more cases.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the lead plaintiff in the case, Louie Guerrero,
says that police beat and falsely arrested him on drug charges in
November 1997 and that he was released from prison before details
of the Rampart scandal become known last year. Under other civil
rights laws, his lawsuit against the department would have to be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 criminal cases have been overturned as a result of
the scandal, in which officers are said to have planted evidence
and beaten people in a struggling Latino neighborhood for sport and
profit.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have previously estimated the city's liability at
between $125 million to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the plaintiffs prevail,'' Chemerinsky said Tuesday, ``there
is staggering potential liability for the city, just staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chemerinsky cautioned that the judge had simply ruled that
the case could go forward. ``Whether the plaintiffs can ultimately
prove it,'' he said, ``we'll just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Yagman, a lawyer for Guerrero, said, ``We have in effect
converted a civil rights lawsuit into a racketeering lawsuit and
it's about time.'' Yagman said he had no doubt that ``a reasonable
jury will look at the evidence and agree with what I've been
claiming for years: that the LAPD is essentially a criminal
enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Yagman said his four-lawyer firm has 19 Rampart-related cases
and another 50 on file. He said they were analyzing 100 more
potential cases and have brought in a firm with 26 lawyers to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're thinking about hiring even more lawyers,'' he said.
``This is just the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the police department and the mayor's office declined to
comment and referred all calls to the Los Angeles city attorney's
office. Mike Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney, said,
``Obviously, we're disappointed in the ruling and we're reviewing
our options.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rampart scandal has embarrassed the Los Angeles Police
Department for months as story after story about corrupt and brutal
officers have chipped away at a reputation already tarnished by the
O.J. Simpson case, the Rodney King beating and the riots of 1992.
The image long polished by Hollywood and sent across the world by
reruns of ``Dragnet'' seem long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the city and the U.S. Justice Department are negotiating an
alternative to having the federal government sue the police
department for a pattern of civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Rea also refused the city's request to throw out the plaintiff's
request for an injunction that would forbid police officers from
engaging in the planting of evidence or committing perjury, two
pillars of the Rampart charges of official abuse.

LIFE AND DEATH ON `24/7'
</HEADLINE>
  Documentary looks at daily routine of Baltimore's eminent hospital 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Wed., Aug. 30) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By David Kronke &QL; 
``Hopkins 24/7'' is yet another example of how reality television
is infinitely more riveting when it actually has some basis in
reality and eschews the goofy contrivances. This compelling,
emotionally wrenching documentary series from ABC News explores
life and death at prestigious Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore,
from its emergency room (with scenes as gripping as any on ``ER'')
to its operating theaters (featuring medical procedures as arcane
as any seen on ``Chicago Hope'') and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the doctors depicted here seem valiant, as we're
used to seeing TV actors portray them, more appear to be pushed to
the outer edges of their psyches as they watch the death and mayhem
envelope them (the hospital borders a violent, drug-embattled
Baltimore neighborhood). In fact, future episodes will see doctors
despair over losing patients, a young doctor fear for her own life
when she comes in contact with HIV-tainted blood, and one doctor
walk away from the profession when the stress and long hours become
too overwhelming. ``Hopkins 24/7'' depicts the practice of medicine
as a calling more melancholy and reflective than glamorous or
heroic.
</P>
<P>
   This six-episode series premieres tonight with a grim irony
prompting yet another impassioned railing against HMOs _ it's
easier for the hospital to OK an MRI for a sea turtle than for a
teen-age girl with rapidly spreading uterine cancer. There's also a
profile of a dedicated ER doctor who practices preventative
medicine _ he brings potential gang members into the hospital to
witness the grisly work done by guns on others. On Thursday, we'll
see an Indiana couple hold their own against what husband and wife
perceive as bureaucratic indifference at the hospital as they see
their 3 1/2-year-old daughter through a ``hemispherectomy'' _ the
removal of half her brain _ to stave off a frightening series of
seizures, as well as a portrait of a beleaguered first-year intern
who has better luck maintaining his sense of humor than sorting
through the avalanche of information and protocol heaped upon him.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming episodes will present memorable characters _ a
17-year-old boy in dire need of a lung transplant (which is
organized with the precision of a military operation as doctors fly
to Pennsylvania for donor organs); a colorful oncology doctor who
must perform his most solemn task _ informing a patient that she's
dying; an 8-month-old baby in dire need of a heart transplant; and
a woman whose family braces itself for the possibility that a donor
liver will not be available in time to save her husband's life.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News teams were allowed to explore the hospital day and
night for three months, venturing into areas TV cameras don't often
go (such as tonight's ``Mortality and Morbidity'' conference, where
doctors sometimes testily comb through patient deaths to see if any
mistakes were made). Largely, the doctors and patients are allowed
to tell their stories with little editorial comment from ABC
reporters (outside of, naturally, editing of the pieces; there's
also some infrequent but occasionally condescending narration from
Sylvia Chase). This approach gives the series an edgy immediacy
that pulls viewers into the human dramas as they unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Haunting and uplifting in equal measures, ``Hopkins 24/7'' is,
like Fox's grievously short-lived ``American High'' before it _
smart, demanding, nonfiction television that moves and entertains
as well as, if not better than, the slicker, pre-packaged product
we've become accustomed to sitting through. &QL;

<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing political force in the '90s was Newt
Gingrich, Bill Clinton's arch-enemy. From the outside, he just
seems like a cranky guy nostalgic for the America of the '50s,
filled with fear, loathing and the last glimpse of ``decency'' this
nation has seen.
</P>
<P>
   But what motivated him? How did he engineer the Republican
comeback in 1994, was he an engineer of the ``vast right-wing
conspiracy'' and what led to his own collapse in 1998? A new PBS
documentary, ``The Fall of Newt Gingrich,'' takes something of a
behind-the-scenes look at the former Speaker of the House's final
days of power in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Michael Pack had some decent access to Gingrich at the
height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal; he follows the Speaker's
political maneuverings in the '98 election season, dodging press
questions on impeachment and traversing the country, campaigning
dutifully for fellow Republicans (his own race being already
handily sewn up). Obviously, Gingrich believed he had Clinton
twisting in the wind, so the Speaker had every reason to believe
the resulting film would be something of a coronation.
</P>
<P>
   But something went very wrong for the Republicans, as voters,
sickened by their political posturing over a sex scandal, gave the
Grand Old Party somewhere between 15 and 45 House fewer seats than
it expected. Watching the Gingrich camp's furious spinning on
election night is quite a spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Pack had access to Gingrich's ``official''
duties, but he wasn't privy to the backroom politicking that was
obviously going on at the time. And the later revelation of
Gingrich's own failings as a husband (for a second time) are
dismissed in a brief coda that allows that ``some'' people saw
``hypocrisy'' in the former Speaker's behavior. That betrayal of
his wife (who appears in the documentary) _ as much a pattern of
Gingrich's behavior as Clinton's _ certainly deserves deeper
exploration than a simple, glib throwaway line, but by the time
that information came out, Pack's relationship to Gingrich had
clearly come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, you still don't get much of a sense of the man.
``The Fall of Newt Gingrich'' is an interesting portrait as far as
it goes, but it doesn't go nearly far enough. &QL;

   (Undated) - Maybe I'm not a discerning enough viewer, but any
show in which someone on-camera can describe what happens as
``They're going to beat the crap out of each other for the
entertainment pleasure of all of us'' is OK by me.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Makes it sound like I'm talking about professional
wrestling. No way - that's (beginitalic)so (enditalic)20th century.
I'm talking about (beginitalic)BattleBots(enditalic), a new Comedy
Central series in which people don't fight. Remote-controlled
robots do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a blood sport,'' Mack Anderson, an executive
producer of the show, told critics last month. ``It's an oil
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also, let's face it, a geek sport, if you want to call it a
sport at all.
</P>
<P>
   The show centers on fights - to the ``death'' - between robots,
which take place inside a big cage, the floor of which is equipped
with ``kill saws'' and the like to help increase the mayhem. And
there is mayhem aplenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a little rule of thumb,'' says ``battlecaster'' Bill
Dwyer. ``When sparks fly, robots die.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more entertaining than the battles are the nut cases who
build the robots in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually got a chance to do really in-depth coverage of
these people,'' Jason Sklar, one of the
(beginitalic)BattleBots(enditalic) reporters, said. ``We talked to
the men and women behind the men behind the robots.''
</P>
<P>
   And treated them with all the gravity that implies. This is
Comedy Central, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The builders of ``Mauler,'' for instance, are as wacked-out as
they get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mauler's goal is total robotic domination worldwide,'' its
builder says. One of his sons makes the plan for that clear: ``You
have to make the other robot your {hellip}''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. The show's on cable; the newspaper is not.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)BattleBots (enditalic)has guilty pleasure written
all over it. But it's more than that. The mini-features on the
competitors offer a nice little window on a different world. We all
remember the geek in high school - probably sat by himself at lunch
- who was so completely devoted to some sort of obscure, bizarre
activity that he might as well have lived on another planet. No one
truly understood him but those of his kind.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what became of him? He grew up and built remote-control
robots and fights with them on TV. And TV is better for it.

STUDENTS BOOST MATH SCORES ON COLLEGE ACHIEVEMENT TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT S. GREENBERGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Culminating a decade of steady improvement, U.S. high
school students who took the SAT this year posted the highest math
scores since 1969, according to scores released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts students, meanwhile, posted rosy results of their
own, also improving on math while holding steady on the verbal
portion of the test.
</P>
<P>
   Bay State students scored an average of 513 on the math section
of the Scholastic Aptitude Test, up from 511 last year. Their
average verbal score remained at 511. The nationwide averages this
year were 514 and 505, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Commonwealth also peformed well on Advanced Placement exams,
which cover subjects other than English and math and can be used
for college credit: Seventy-four percent of Massachusetts students
scored at least a 3 on a 5-point scale _ more than in any other
state.
</P>
<P>
   Buffeted by high failure rates on the MCAS, the statewide exam
that will count as a graduation requirement beginning this school
year, Massachusetts officials heralded the SAT and AP results
released Tuesday as proof that student peformance in the state is
improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a pleasure to have some good education news to talk
about,'' said James A. Peyser, who chairs the State Board of
Education. ``Our schools are getting better. Student achievement is
improving. These SAT and AP results are early indicators that
progress is a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the College Board rolled out the state-by-state scores
Tuesday, some critics discounted the SAT gains as virtually
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Chester Finn of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, which
advocates standards-based education reforms like the ones under way
in Massachusetts, pointed to recent results on the National
Assessement of Educational Progress. Scores on that test, which is
considered a more accurate barometer of student performance than
the SAT, have remained fairly constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``These should not be taken as some kind of sign of a
renaissance in American education, or a sign that recent reforms
have had a big impact,'' said Finn, who believes it's too early for
such reforms to have taken hold. ``NAEP shows that we're holding
steady on an unacceptably low level.''
</P>
<P>
   Some colleges and universities are moving away from use of the
SAT in admitting students. Mount Holyoke College has stopped
considering it and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst
announced last year that it would give far less weight to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Even Peyser and Education Commissioner David P. Driscoll both
cautioned against reading too much into the SAT gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, our students are doing better than average, but is that
good enough in our increasingly demanding economy?'' Peyser said.
``Yes, college-bound students in Massachusetts seem to have
brighter prospects, but what about those who do not plan to attend
college?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to reconcile the Bay State's relatively high SAT scores
with the high failure rates on the Massachusetts Comprehensive
Assessment System _ in 1999, 53 percent of 10th-graders failed the
math MCAS and 32 percent failed English _ Driscoll pointed to
several significant differences between the two tests.
</P>
<P>
   The SAT measures students relative to their peers, whereas the
MCAS is designed to measure them against specific academic
standards, Driscoll said. He noted that nearly every student takes
the MCAS, not just college-bound ones. And those who take the SAT
tend to be highly motivated _ and many are armed with strategies
they've learned in SAT preparatory classes.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan Learning Services, the nation's largest test-prep
company, has seen a 50 percent gain in enrollment in the past
decade, according to a company spokesowman.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where 78 percent of high school students took
the SAT, the scores were close to the national averages. But the
state was above average when compared to other states with high
participation rates. Of the 23 other states with a participation
rate of 40 percent or higher, only four _ Alaska, New Hampshire,
Oregon and Washington _ had higher overall scores. And
Massachusetts officials noted that those four states have far less
diverse populations than the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the SAT scores released Tuesday continue a roughly
10-year trend. Scores declined throughout the 1970s and early
1980s, but they stabilized in the mid-1980s and have risen steadily
since then. Many attribute the initial drop to the fact that a far
larger and more diverse group began to take the test.
</P>
<P>
   SAT averages rose for most ethnic groups between 1990 and 2000,
but white students posted larger gains, so the gaps between them
have grown.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board, the century-old association of colleges and
universities that sponsors the SAT, links the rising scores to the
increasing rigor of classes. The College Board adjusted the SAT
scoring system in the mid-1990s, but reconfigured the scores so
they would match before releasing Tuesday's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significant increase in this year's math score, and the
overall upward trend of the last 10 years, must be due, at least in
part, to changes in the courses students take in high school,''
said College Board President Gaston Caperton.
</P>
<P>
   Even some critics of high-stakes tests such as MCAS and the SAT
believe the numbers reflect well on American schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the longer term trend data does have meaning,
within the limited context that the SAT measures,'' said Bob
Schaeffer of FairTest, a Cambridge-based group opposed to the use
of the SAT in college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that math scores have been regularly increasing, and
that verbal scores have remained constant despite the
ever-broadening population taking the test, suggests that those who
claim that schools are in crisis in the United States are not
telling the truth,'' Schaeffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, the CEO of The Princeton Review, an
test-prep company, had yet another view.
</P>
<P>
   ``SAT scores are up nationwide and The Princeton Review believes
it's a reflection of increased coaching for these tests,'' John
Katzman said. ``As a nation, we're becoming increasingly good at
test-taking.''

POWER OF CONTRARY THINKING 
</HEADLINE>

cosmetics and lingerie company; this was written with Becky

<TEXT>
<P>
   My biggest passion is flea markets, trash and treasure, vintage
stores and bric-a-brac.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a collector of antiques, as such. That's the next level
up. One of my most treasured items is a handbag I got in the
markets in Marrakesh, Morocco. It's made out of silver. It's more
like a sculpture, really. I was terrified that when I went to, say,
India, I would see four million of these things and think, ``Oh my
God, here I am thinking it was so special.'' But I've never seen
anything like it again.
</P>
<P>
   I collect three wise monkeys. You know: see no evil, hear no
evil, speak no evil. I just love the concept. I've got lots of old
mirrors, lipstick cases and powder compacts. I got the bug for it
through my mum, a mad collector of things, who dragged me around to
the flea markets of Paris when I was little.
</P>
<P>
   As a little girl, I was obsessed with the idea of what it was
like to be a glamorous lady, playing dress-ups and clunking around
the place in Mum's high heels. I was also a terrible little wimp.
I'd never get up on the monkey bars or play with frogs. Today, I
won't do anything where I might break a bone. You don't find me on
the ski slopes zooming down mountains.
</P>
<P>
   I just bought two little puppy dogs, little girls, Sugar and
Spice. They are little fox terriers crossed with Chihuahuas.
They're absolutely gorgeous. Spice is so brave. She'll just leap
into things. It's amazing because you really can see how everyone,
dogs included, have this innate nature.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 18, I concentrated on very important things, like
lipsticks. I'd watch old movies, and the movie stars used to have
lipstick that wasn't glossy, that was deep-colored and matte. I was
asking around department store counters about matte lipsticks. One
sales girl said to me, ``Look, if I had a dollar for every time
someone asked me for a matte lipstick, I'd be rich.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how it crystallized. I just sat down with the yellow
pages and started ringing manufacturers. I had in my mind's eye the
idea of what I wanted. A lipstick that was almost like a crayon. I
spent a year working with the manufacturer. I went through 30
different formulas. There was a lot of puckering up. I remember
thinking, ``Well, if the whole thing doesn't work, at least I'll
have a lifetime supply of lipstick I like.''
</P>
<P>
   I had no hope of going to a bank. I was 18. I had no security to
offer. Starting a lipstick business? I wouldn't have even got
through the door.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't happen very often someone comes to you and says,
``Hey, I've got some money.'' A lot of people get afraid to show
they don't know something. I was willing to talk about it, to
search, to look, to think differently. It helped me get my start.
To muscle into the cosmetics market with $24,000 in your war chest
_ not exactly big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I didn't even have a drivers license. So, my mum
would drive me to the manufacturer and sit in the car and do her
knitting while I was inside trying on lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   My mother brought my up brother and me pretty much
single-handed. My father died when I was really young. I was always
encouraged to think differently. Ultimately, that's been a
blessing, but also a liability.
</P>
<P>
   I got expelled from school when I was 12. It was a regimented
private girls school. I'd been there since kindergarten. My mother
was supportive because she knew I hadn't been awful, stealing or
taking drugs. I had been a bit precocious. But they told me I was
too different, that I didn't think like everyone else.

TWO COMIC MINDS THAT APPEAR TO HAVE WORKED ALIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  By   MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the recently published ``Most of the Most of S.J. Perelman,''
a portmanteau of Perelmania in the Modern Library Humor and Wit
Series, Woody Allen is quoted as saying: ``What happens to you when
you read Perelman and you're a young writer is fatal because his
style seeps into you. He's got such a pronounced, overwhelming
comic style that it's very hard not to be influenced by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the following a matter of influence? Or a homage? Or is it
simply a coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   Inept crooks take over a failing store with the idea of digging
a tunnel from the basement to the vault of a nearby bank. Almost
immediately everything goes awry. The thieves know less about
tunneling than they do about safecracking, and customers keep
coming into the store, which is an unwelcome intrusion. But before
the caper is complete, a legitimate business deal brings in a
windfall.
</P>
<P>
   This is the basic plot of Allen's movie, ``Small Time Crooks,''
and also of ``The Night Before Christmas,'' a play by Perelman and
his wife, Laura (the sister of Nathanael West and Perelman's
frequent screenwriting partner). The Perelman family comedy had a
brief Broadway run in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity of the shenanigans in the two comedies over a
period of almost 60 years was pointed out by the artist Al
Hirschfeld, who saw both the play and the movie. He was a close
friend and collaborator of Perelman and is also a friend of Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Each work has its own twists and turns. In the movie, Tracey
Ullman, playing the wife of the gang leader ( Allen), opens a
cookie shop that becomes phenomenally successful. After about a
half-hour Allen, as director and screenwriter, abandons the caper
and switches to a travesty of social climbing and of the idle rich.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which takes place in a lackluster luggage shop on
Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, is less concerned with the bank robbery
than with the eccentric characters in the neighborhood, busybodies
and fussbudgets who keep wandering into the store and interrupting
the action. Accidentally the thieves dynamite their way into a
delicatessen, which leads to jokes about cole slaw and hot
pastrami. Eventually the store is sold for a high price to the
bank, and everyone _ or almost everyone _ ends happily.
</P>
<P>
   When Allen speaks about his great regard for Perelman, he is
referring to him as an essayist and not as a screenwriter for the
Marx Brothers, or in his lesser role as a playwright. Only two of
his shows could be marked as successes, the Kurt Weill musical
``One Touch of Venus'' and ``The Beauty Part.''
</P>
<P>
   The essays omitted from ``Most of the Most of S.J. Perelman''
(for copyright reasons) are those from the book ``Westward Ha!''
That collection began with the story of ``Sweet Bye and Bye,'' a
musical that Perelman wrote with Ogden Nash and Hirschfeld. In
Perelman's words, the show ``closed in Philadelphia like a 10-cent
mousetrap,'' sending him and Hirschfeld on a round-the-world
journey. He continued to be discouraged about his theatrical
career. As he wrote in a self-portrait: ``Retired today to peaceful
Erwinna, Pa., Perelman raises turkeys, which he occasionally
displays on Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen was 5 when ``The Night Before Christmas'' opened, and
closed after 22 performances. So far as is known the play has had
no major revival. It is long out of print, although Samuel French,
the theatrical publisher, found an archival copy from which a
duplicate was made.
</P>
<P>
   There is an antic and occasionally a frantic quality to the
humor. The thieves could have been sketches for characters to be
played by the Marx Brothers. The pretentious leader of the gang,
Otis J. Faunce, could have been made to measure for Groucho. The
gangster dialogue, which Perelman drew from a con man of his
acquaintance, is quaintly colorful. ``Yeah, I was sneezed in Saint
Joe,'' says one ex-con. ``I was the wire for a cannon mob and I run
into a wrong shamus.'' There is also, unfortunately, a sentimental
love story between a drugstore clerk and a gun moll. Still there
are slyly amusing moments in this screwball farce, and because of
the authorship it is worth a second look.
</P>
<P>
   According to Perelman's biographer, Dorothy Herrmann, before the
play opened on Broadway, it had been turned down by George S.
Kaufman, and after its failure, Perelman's agent hawked it in
Hollywood, where it was rejected by Abbott and Costello, W.C.
Fields and the Marx Brothers themselves. Then Edward G. Robinson,
looking to diversify his tough-guy career, decided to make the
comedy and play for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Retitled ``Larceny Inc.,'' with Robinson's character now named
Pressure Maxwell, the movie opened in 1942. The cast included
Broderick Crawford, Jackie Gleason, Jack Carson, Anthony Quinn and
Jane Wyman (as the moll).
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there is no patent on the idea of bumbling bank
robbers. Think of ``Big Deal on Madonna Street'' or Allen's ``Take
the Money and Run,'' in which, as Virgil Starkwell, he passes a
holdup note to a bank teller saying that he has a gun, and the
teller corrects his penmanship, insisting that the word as written
is gub and is therefore invalid. Gub or not, the subject is open
for recycling.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had ever heard of Perelman's play, ``The Night
Before Christmas,'' Allen said, ``Now I have heard of it.'' He
added that in reference to Perelman's Broadway career, he had only
been aware of ``One Touch of Venus'' and ``The Beauty Part.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in preparation for ``Small Time Crooks,'' he
thought about Ernst Lubitsch's classic, ``Trouble in Paradise,''
``and all those other heist movies I had seen, `Rififi,'
`Topkapi''' _ and of course ``Take the Money and Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Most likely two wits, mutual admirers, simply thought along
related lines. There is, however, another possibility. The Modern
Library series is edited by Steve Martin, who as a humorist owes
his own debt to Perelman and perhaps to Allen. In the introduction
to the series he says that before he started writing he had ``heard
of S.J. Perelman, James Thurber and their like, but I was also
aware that they were heavily influenced by me, even lifting some of
my ideas, backdating them, and carefully inserting them in
magazines from the 30s with the clever use of a razor blade and
glue.''
</P>
<P>
   Following this line of reasoning, it could be said that it was
S.J. Perelman who borrowed from Woody Allen.

the Connecticut senator's faith _ and his repeated references to it
_ have created new, surprising firing lines in the ongoing battle
between religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence yet arrived Monday, when the Anti-Defamation
League, a high-profile Jewish group that has spent years
criticizing Republicans for invoking God, blasted Lieberman for
asking Americans to ``renew the dedication of our nation and
ourselves to God'' in a speech at a Detroit church.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and
American Atheists Inc., two groups that have rarely looked left
when entering the political fray, joined the criticism of
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more intriguing _ and encouraging for the Gore
campaign _ is the rousing defense of Lieberman offered by
conservative and clerical organizations who praised the candidate
for going where most Democrats rarely tread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Lieberman is to be commended, not criticized, for
discussing the public role of religion,'' William Donohue,
president of the Catholic League, wrote in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are people whose institutions presume the existence of a
supreme being,'' said Richard Lessner, vice president of American
Renewal, a lobbying affiliate of the conservative Family Research
Council. ``The notion that there are all these village atheists out
there who will fly into high dudgeon every time a word of faith is
spoken is ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Abraham Foxman, the ADL's national director, underscored the
growing unease over Lieberman's overt religiosity when he pointedly
chastized the vice presidential candidate's pronouncements from the
pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``To even suggest that one cannot be a moral person without
being a religious person is an affront to many highly ethical
citizens,'' Foxman wrote to Lieberman in a letter later faxed to
several media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very strongly,'' he continued, ``that appealing along
religious lines...is contrary to the American ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiki McLean, a spokesperson for Lieberman, said Tuesday that the
candidate is earnest in his faith in God, but just as much so in
his respect for the separation of church and state. The attacks by
the ADL and Americans United for Separation of Church and State,
she said, failed to to appreciate where Lieberman was speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reflection, to some extent, of the folks he was
talking to,'' McLean said of the congregants at Detroit's
Fellowship Chapel. ``He was speaking in a church on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the ADL has frequently locked horns with the Family
Research Council, Lieberman's public expressions of faith appear to
be creating some unique new relationships.
</P>
<P>
   For example, leaders of B'nai B'rith, the parent organization of
the ADL, roundly rejected the ADL's criticism of Lieberman Tuesday
_ as the candidate's wife, Hadassah, spoke to the group's annual
meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But it's yet to be seen if Lieberman's piety will translate into
support from swing voters who place faith and character at the top
of their Washington wish lists. The same goes for secular liberals,
who have the option of voting for Ralph Nader, but who will
doubtfully exercise that option en masse.
</P>
<P>
   John Green, director of the Bliss Institute for Applied Politics
at the University of Akron, said Tuesday that the criticism of
Lieberman may be an attempt by the ADL and other groups to appear
objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the groups that criticize conservative Christian
groups about tying politics and God have been noticably silent''
about Lieberman's speeches, Green said. The attack on the
candidate, then, is possibly ``a way to resolve that perception.
They are trying to be consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessner made the same point, but said he doubted the ADL and
others were aiming at Lieberman out of expediency: ``I give Abe
Foxman credit credit for being consistent . . . . I don't think
it's a cynical attempot to establish credibility. I think it's a
reflection of where the ADL and their supporters really are. They
are uncomfortable with politicians who speak flagrantly about their
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel G. Freedman, author of ``Jew vs. Jew: The Struggle for
the Soul of American Jewry,'' said the rift may speak more to the
growing divide among the nation's Orthodox and secular Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, he said, ``is not someone who's hid his religious
Jewishness under a bushel basket. He's been open about it and risen
anyway. The fact that he's being sniped at by other Jews is
emblematic of the tension we're seeing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States has attempted to separate church and
state throughout its 224-year history, and although politicians
have regularly ushered their faith to the dais at election time,
overt blending of religious belief and policy has often divided
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to Lieberman's statements appears unremarkable in
that sense, just as it was predictable that Republican candidate
George W. Bush was praised and criticized by the usual suspects for
naming Jesus Christ as his favorite political philospher.
</P>
<P>
   But if a supreme being makes scheduled appearances in every
national election, this year's seems to have moved beyond the norm
_ in part because of the sheer novelty of a Jewish candidate, some
observers said. Witness the ``God-o-meter,'' a new feature on
Beliefnet.com, a religion and spirituality website, that measures
how many references to God each candidate makes every thirty
seconds. (Right now, the Gore/Lieberman ticket is in the lead, 7.1
to 6.7.)
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bob Edgar, general secretary for the National Council
of Churches, said he doesn't believe any of the candidates have
stepped ``over the line yet.'' But the mere fact that the ADL made
their letter public, he said, shows that religion has become a sore
point in this year's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we want a balance and genuine faith statements, and
I think Joe Lieberman has been as careful as he can to be
authentic,'' said Edgar, a former Democratic congressman from
suburban Philadelhia. ``I don't think it's helpful to make overt
public gestures to try to stifle him.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of Lieberman's motivations, many observers see the
senator's adherence to the Bible as an attempt to woo voters
reluctant to support the party of Bill Clinton, whose affair with
intern Monica Lewinsky cast a moral pall over the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's helping the Gore camp, there's no question,''
Green said. ``There are many people out there who think the country
has a values crisis that needs to be addressed, whether it's Monica
Lewinsky, corporate greed, or school shootings. Lieberman's
religious bearing has got to attract people looking for a
faith-based solution.''

 &HT;    Home Depot opens first Web store, in Las Vegas
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Home Depot has opened the doors of its first Internet
store to customers in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta shoppers will have to wait until at least next
year to click into the retailer's online warehouse. Atlanta-based
Home Depot has been testing e-commerce on a group of professional
remodelers in Las Vegas and plans to roll out Internet sales to
other customers slowly, market by market.
</P>
<P>
   Next online will be San Antonio and Austin, Texas, said Jeff
Cohen, group president of direct marketing businesses. He would not
say when Home Depot's online store would go live in all of the
retailer's markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in the process, that's difficult to pin down...
the exact schedule will have to do with the results that we see (in
Las Vegas),'' Cohen told analysts and reporters during a conference
call. ``We're committed to be out in several markets this year,
then we're going to take a pause, reflect on that experience and
move forward...as soon as prudently possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, consumers everywhere can access hundreds of
pages of how-to information for household projects at
homedepot.com, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said it is too early to forecast Internet sales. Home
Depot's direct retail rival, Lowe's Cos., has projected that its
upcoming Internet venture will boost annual sales by at least $1
billion a year initially.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's long-simmering strategy has taken several turns in
the past year or so. Both Home Depot and Lowe's pushed back their
starting dates as they dealt with the challenges of hanging their
shingles in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot originally set a target date of last fall for its
Internet sales launch, but the project was delayed by a series of
changes late last summer. In August 1999, the retailer said it
would put off the launch by several months because of a major shift
in strategy. Instead of testing sales of a few product categories,
Home Depot decided to load its inventory on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Then in May, Home Depot said it would offer online sales to
contractors, electricians, plumbers and other business customers
first, and then roll out sales to the homeowner market.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas was picked for the launch because Home Depot wanted to
take advantage of a test it's conducting with professional
customers there. Home Depots in Las Vegas and several other test
markets have been offering special services to the professionals.
Employees take orders for large quantities of building materials
and other supplies, then pick and pack the orders and have them
ready for pick-up at ``will call'' centers.
</P>
<P>
   The staff that's assigned to the professional test will handle
the Internet-based orders, which can either be picked up or
delivered to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Like Home Depot, Lowe's plans to launch commercial sales market
by market, on lowes.com. North Wilkesboro, N.C.-based Lowe's
started selling certain tools, ceiling fans and steel doors through
affiliated manufacturer sites in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowe's site for do-it-yourself customers will go live in all
Lowe's markets but with a limited number of product categories.
Appliances and tools will be the first categories loaded on the
site. Internet sales of those products should be ready by the end
of October, according to the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   While some Internet pundits have criticized Home Depot for
moving slowly on Internet sales, many analysts have defended the
retailer's cautious approach. Home Depot is known for thoroughly
testing new products and services in limited markets before putting
them in all stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only so many growth initiatives that a store can
undertake at one time,'' said analyst Wayne Hood of Prudential
Securities. ``The market-by-market strategy makes the most sense
because you can resolve problems on a small scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot said one of the most time-consuming aspects of the
Internet launch was loading the retailer's massive inventory of
products online. Each Home Depot store carries 40,000 to 50,000
products, but the product mix varies widely in different parts of
the country. In all, the retailer has a master list of about
400,000 products, said Ron Griffin, chief information officer.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin noted that the company invested heavily upfront to build
a Web site that can easily be updated for new or outdated products,
or different languages as the retailer expands internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time an item is added or deleted in our store, it's
instantaneously changed on the Web site,'' Griffin said. ``It's
like putting our store systems on steroids.''

 &HT;    Dell aiming new products at data storage business
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Dell Computer Corp. plans to roll out two new
products aimed at giving the personal-computer maker a bigger share
of the burgeoning storage business.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Dell will announce two entry-level devices aimed at
small businesses or workgroups within larger businesses that need
to share and store files for day-to-day use and as backups in case
of disaster. It's a market that has been good to Dell before.
</P>
<P>
   With more computers performing more functions _ not to mention
the tremendous growth of the Internet as a business tool _ has come
a massive explosion in the amount of computer-generated data that
must be stored.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for storage was estimated at $30 billion in 1999 and will
grow to $46 billion by 2003, according to research firm IDC.
</P>
<P>
   Dell formed a storage business in 1998 and has just a tiny slice
of the market _ 4 percent compared to No. 1 Compaq Computer Corp.'s
21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Storage is classified two ways _ internal or external. Storage
capacity on disk drives within servers _ the large computers that
contain software programs and files at the heart of PC networks _
is internal storage. And it fills up fast.
</P>
<P>
   But the servers themselves are still adequate, which has created
a strong market for external storage _ other servers or devices
with additional storage capacity that plug into the networks or
individual servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people swapping out servers not because the servers
are at the end of their life cycle, but because they need more
storage,'' said John McArthur, vice president for storage research
at IDC. ``This allows people to keep servers around longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Like its competitors, Dell is under pressure to find new markets
with higher-margin products as profits and growth both continue to
slow down in the desktop-computer business.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has done that both in workstations _ the high-powered
desktop computers used for intensive computing work _ and in
servers.
</P>
<P>
   Within just a few years of entering both businesses, Dell became
a leader. It hopes to do the same in storage, but it has a long way
to go: Dell's storage revenue last year was $1.2 billion, according
to IDC estimates, compared to industry-leading Compaq's $5.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has encountered some stiff resistance from competitors and
customers.
</P>
<P>
   As it has found in some parts of the server business, big
corporations are reluctant to turn over critical functions from
existing mainframe, mid-range and Unix computers to cheaper
Intel-powered systems running Microsoft's Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   ``NT is big and getting bigger, and will surpass Unix,''
McArthur said.
</P>
<P>
   But until then, Dell is focusing on smaller companies that favor
cheaper, off-the-shelf products over proprietary ones.
</P>
<P>
   The devices Dell will announce are inexpensive and easy to use,
key requirements for small companies with limited capital and
technical resources.
</P>
<P>
   A network-attached storage device carries a price tag of about
$3,000. The other, a storage-area network device, costs between
$38,000 and $43,000. Network-attached storage provides storage to
any device on a network, from desktops to servers, while
storage-area network devices generally are connected to other
servers.
</P>
<P>
   The most complex, proprietary storage devices can cost $500,000
to $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's targeted at the sweet spot of market,'' said Bruce
Kornfeld, marketing director for Dell's storage group.
</P>
<P>
   Selling high volumes of a near-commodity product more profitably
than its competitors is the recipe Dell followed to become the No.
1 PC seller in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the new focus,'' McArthur said. ``I think it's the
right direction for them to move. It plays to their strength. I
think they'll do well in that space as they've done in servers.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, the announcement signals a shift for Dell, which
started out with higher-end storage products in an effort to chase
the large customers that are the most profitable.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Dell purchased ConvergeNet, a small San Jose company
that developed proprietary storage technology. But that move has
yet to bear fruit, and some question whether it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back a year, they were thumping their chests, saying
they'd build up the technology to go after EMC and Sun,'' said
Ashok Kumar, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray who recently
downgraded Dell and called into question its storage strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is, I'm getting the sense (Dell is) getting shut
out of the big enterprise accounts,'' added Amir Ahari, Kumar's
colleague. ``They don't have the robust products they need to get
into the data centers. Frankly, they're not getting a lot of help
from Microsoft and Intel in terms of getting quality of stuff
customers are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flip side is the small business market is pretty big and
pretty untapped.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dell's competitors are adapting, too, and learning from the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly Dell's peer group is becoming more competitive on
price,'' Kumar said. ``Compaq, H-P and companies like IBM use
(low-end storage) as a loss leader to sell high-end products and
services.''

TWO POWER PLAYS BY SHAKESPEARE, ONE RALPH FIENNES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LONDON _ It is almost a rite of passage for promising
Shakespearean actors to play ``Hamlet.'' More than most, though,
Ralph Fiennes seemed made for the part. Onstage with the Royal
Shakespeare Company in a variety of other roles and on screen as
the Nazi camp commander in ``Schindler's List,'' he had displayed
an intense introspection, a sort of irritable melancholy, that well
suited the role of the gloomy Dane. When the time came, his
``Hamlet'' was duly acclaimed in London and in New York, where he
won a Tony Award for best actor in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Jonathan Kent, who directed Fiennes in both ``Hamlet''
and a 1997 production of Chekhov's ``Ivanov,'' the slim,
ascetic-looking Englishman was no less born to play the ill-fated
monarch in Shakespeare's ``Richard II.'' It was also a role that
Fiennes had admired but never performed, since he first saw the
play as a teen-ager in 1980. When looking for a new chance to work
together, actor and director had no trouble agreeing.
</P>
<P>
   To this fairly obvious choice, however, Kent, an artistic
director at London's Almeida Theater Company, added a more
innovative idea. Why not twin ``Richard II'' with ``Coriolanus,''
another Shakespearean political tragedy, albeit one that is
infrequently performed, indeed one that Fiennes barely knew? The
result is the program that begins on September 6 at the Harvey
Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music: 14 performances of
``Richard II'' and 12 of ``Coriolanus'' through Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier 14-week run this spring and summer, Fiennes and an
impressive ensemble of British actors presented both plays to
packed houses in the unlikely setting of a long-abandoned movie
studio in East London. After their New York stop, the performers
will travel to Tokyo for a limited run at the Akasaka Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of presenting two or more plays in repertory is hardly
a novelty. Last year, Kent's productions of Racine's ``Phedre'' and
``Britannicus,'' with Diana Rigg and Toby Stephens in both plays,
also went to the Academy after successful runs in London. More
daring perhaps is the idea of scheduling two plays on some days, as
Kent did with the Racines and is again doing now, as a way of
highlighting their differences and similarities. (The double bills
in Brooklyn are scheduled for Sept. 16, 23 and 30.)
</P>
<P>
   To Kent, the plays not only show constrasting aspects of
Shakespeare's genius; they also offer interesting end-of-millennium
reflections on the nature of power. ``The plays themselves could
not be more different in form,'' the director said in an interview
before the run ended at the former Gainsborough Film Studio in the
London borough of Shoreditch. `` `Richard II,' with its highly
wrought verse, is an exquisite artifact, while `Coriolanus,'
Shakespeare's last tragedy, is almost like free-form jazz. But both
are about men and their shadows, about men clad in their roles _
one of a king, the other of a warrior _ who have not developed
within that cladding. And as it is stripped away, they must
confront themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the burden is on Fiennes to make the pairing work,
although he evidently enjoyed testing his stamina. ``Actually, it's
not as exhausting as doing `Coriolanus' twice in a day, which we
did in the previews,'' he said softly, sipping a mug of tea at the
studio-turned-theater here. ``But, yes, it is exhausting. It's nice
to have the challenge and, at the end of the day, to think, `Wow, I
did `Richard' and `Coriolanus.'''
</P>
<P>
   One quiet and self-pitying, the other loud and insensitive, both
characters nonetheless bring on their own tragedies: Richard II,
the narcissistic English monarch who almost frivolously banishes
his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, and seizes his land, only to find he
has provoked a rebellion that leads to his overthrow and death; and
Coriolanus, who, banished from Rome for scorning its citizens,
joins forces with his sworn enemy, Tulius Aufidius, only to be
dissuaded from sacking Rome by his all-powerful mother and, in the
process, to invite his own murder by Aufidius.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first thought about it,'' Fiennes recalled, ``it seemed
a very unusual pairing of plays. But Richard and Coriolanus are
both men in power who cannot handle their power. They're both
alone, as it were, isolated by the nature of who they are. They're
not good at opening up or arguing or debating. Richard has been
conditioned to be king and is unable to see anyone apart from
himself in his relationship to God as the divinely appointed ruler.
Coriolanus is completely trapped in how he should behave. It's a
situation created partly by his mother and partly by him with his
impossible arrogance and pride.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In their political messages, both plays are also quietly
subversive. ``Richard II'' tells of the successful challenge to the
divine right of kings that paved the way for constitutional
monarchy in 1399. But two centuries later, Shakespeare still risked
royal displeasure in writing this play. After the Duke of Essex's
abortive rebellion against Elizabeth I, the angry queen had
proclaimed, ``I am Richard the Second, know ye not that?''
Shakespeare softened the blow by having the Bishop of Carlisle warn
of the ``disorder, horror, fear and mutiny'' that would follow
Richard's ouster, but today the play speaks more loudly of the
perils of absolute power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coriolanus,'' on the other hand, has been exploited in modern
times by both the right and the left because, in Kent's words, ``it
poses questions and offers no answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the Roman citizens have bowed to Coriolanus' authority,
or were they right to impose the people's will? In Nazi Germany,
the play was presented as a paean to Hitler's strong leadership,
which prompted American occupation forces to ban it for eight years
after 1945. In East Germany, though, Brecht was soon portraying the
Roman masses as Marxist-inspired revolutionaries. A half-century
later, Kent's commoners are clearly defending democracy.
</P>
<P>
   To the political logic of twinning these plays was added the
practical consideration that they are easy to cross-cast. Thus, the
rising English actor Linus Roache plays both Bolingbroke and
Aufidius; Barbara Jefford is immensely convincing as the Duchess of
York in ``Richard II'' and as Coriolanus' viciously ambitious
mother, Volumnia; the veteran actor Oliver Ford Davies is the voice
of reason as both the Duke of York in ``Richard II'' and Menenius
Agrippa, the conciliatory Roman senator, in ``Coriolanus,'' and
Emilia Fox plays two long-suffering wives, Richard's Queen Isabel
and Coriolanus' Virgilia.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kent and Fiennes say they make a point of never reading
theater reviews. Had they done so, they would have learned that
London critics much preferred ``Richard II'' to ``Coriolanus.''
``Fiennes comes to the role of Richard as if by genetic destiny,''
wrote Paul Taylor in The Independent. ``The air of petulant
self-preoccupation, the arrogantly sensitive beauty, the mannered,
disdainful lyricism. In these qualities, character and performer
would seem to be soul mates.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Coriolanus,'' however, instead of presenting a more
orthodox figure of ``authoritarian remoteness,'' as Fiennes put it,
the character is blatantly psychotic, turned into a killing-machine
by his mother, reveling in being drenched in blood as he emerges
victorious in battle. Most London critics were not won over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This role is a raging warrior, this actor is a melancholy
courtier,'' Alastair Macauley wrote in The Financial Times. ``You
can see his intelligence and his good intentions, but none of them
ever turn hard work into communicative acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Unanimous plaudits, though, went to the site used for
``Shakespeare in Shoreditch,'' as the program was known here.
Successively a power plant, the movie studios where Alfred
Hitchcock began his career, and a warehouse, the building was
marked for demolition when Kent won it a one-year respite. The
industrial rawness of the setting underlined the emotional and
physical violence of ``Richard II'' and ``Coriolanus.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Fiennes' decision to return to the stage after a
run of movies, most recently ``Sunshine'' and ``The End of the
Affair,'' fell into the ``you can't please everyone'' category.
There were those who sniped at the Almeida for playing the star
game, using Fiennes _ as it had Juliette Binoche and Kevin Spacey _
to pull in crowds. But others thought that high-profile stage
performances are good for theater for the same reason: They
encourage young people to view theater as special. Certainly,
Fiennes' fans would hear that view from him backstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my film career started to take off,'' the actor said, ``I
was happy to leave theater behind for a while because I had done
lots of seasons at the National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare
Company. I was very happy to work in a different way. But after a
while I missed theater, not just doing Shakespeare but also the
routine. Going onstage, playing the play right through, no one says
cut, no one says stop, no one says there's a plane overhead, no one
says you've got a sound problem. There's something very pure and
freeing about that, the act of just being on the stage. In the end,
if I had to toss between the two, I would go for theater.''
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, he will be back. No doubt it will be Shakespeare again.
At 37, he believes he is too old for ``Henry V'' and too young for
``King Lear'' or ``The Tempest,'' though he has his eye on
``Macbeth,'' ``Henry IV'' and Iago in ``Othello,'' while Kent has
mentioned ``Pericles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But going back to Shakespeare never seems like going
backward,'' Fiennes said. ``It's quite simply the most challenging
material for any actor to get to grips with. My mother used to put
on recordings of Olivier doing Shakespeare. I have always loved
language in a dramatic context, particularly Shakespeare. It
excites me the way some people get excited by jazz or opera or rock
music. It's just thrilling.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Bush wants three prime-time debates but won't commit to schedule
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CLAY ROBISON 
and JULIE MASON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ George W. Bush said Tuesday that he wants
three prime-time debates this fall with his Democratic presidential
opponent Al Gore, but he refused to commit to a debate schedule
proposed by an independent commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, who is trying to make education reform the
focus of the campaign this week, spent much of Tuesday responding
to reporters' questions about his intentions for debating Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denied the suggestion in a New York Times story that he
wanted to avoid prime-time debates against the vice president. The
story also reported opposition in the Bush camp to holding one of
the debates on property owned by the John F. Kennedy Library in
Boston, because that area was viewed as unfriendly, Democratic
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is inaccurate. I welcome prime-time debates,'' Bush
said aboard his campaign plane on the way to Portland from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would welcome all three being in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has committed to a debate schedule outlined by the
Commission on Presidential Debates, which calls for three
prime-time meetings between Bush and Gore in October and one debate
between the Republican and Democratic vice-presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is a nonpartisan, nonprofit corporation that has
sponsored the general election presidential debates since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hasn't agreed to the commission's proposal, but says he
wants three debates with Gore and two between his running mate,
Dick Cheney, and Gore's, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp also prefers two vice-presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that it was ``ridiculous'' for anyone to suggest that
he doesn't want to debate Gore in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want as many people to watch our debates as possible,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee said that he wants a debate forum that
would allow a ``serious discussion'' of issues, rather than one
where the candidates ``can walk around the stage and act
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll be able to come to an accord about the three
debates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that of the Republican primary debates, he preferred
the ones that were ``more free-flowing _ that you could exchange
ideas without real rigid structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore claims to have accepted 40 debate invitations. Bush
spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the governor has received 53
invitations.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Bush campaign is considering several factors before
accepting any, including whether a debate could be broadcast on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is a candidate who thinks outside the box,
whether it comes to education policy or whether it comes to
debates. Vice President Gore is a candidate who is wedded to the
status quo. We're just exploring all the options,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane scoffed at the conditions and limits
he said are under discussion within the Bush campaign, such as
staging informal round tables on the Sunday morning talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's idea for the perfect debate would be on an Austin
public access channel during the Women's Olympic gymnastic
finals,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign on Tuesday released a letter to Frank
Fahrenkoph and Paul Kirk, Jr., co-chairs of the Commission on
Presidential Debates, supporting three, 90-minute presidential
debates in prime time available for all major networks and
including all the candidates certified for inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's rules allow only candidates with at least 15
percent support in five national polls. This would exclude
third-party candidates such as Ralph Nader of the Green Party and
Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is proposing presidential debates on Oct. 3, Oct.
11 and Oct. 17 and a vice-presidential debate Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also eager to work with the commission and the Bush
campaign on the other issues of format and logistics that would be
needed to implement this proposal,'' said the letter, signed by
Gore campaign chief Bill Daley.

 PERSONALS: Miss California Puts on Her Game Face 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle news
file.) &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By LEAH GARCHIK &QC;  &LR; 
 &UR; c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle &LR;  &QC; 
Miss California  &UR; Rita Ng &LR; , who was at Mr. Lee's salon in San
Francisco on Monday, said that although the Miss America Pageant is
a beauty contest, ``it's not beauty in the traditional sense of
being beautiful.'' She was there to consult with evening-wear
designer  &UR; Colleen Quen &LR;  and get advice from  &UR; Lee Bledsoe &LR;  on her
hair and appearance.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is a ``very strong feminist,'' a Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of Stanford University and model for such companies as
Cover Girl and Oil of Olay. Pageant organizers have provided her
with a personal trainer for the past six months, which is about
health rather than looks, said the 22-year-old. ``I never felt
pressure from Day 1 to lose weight or anything like that. People
ask me, `Don't you feel pressure?' I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ng, who as Miss Los Altos beat out such contenders as Miss
Garden Grove, Miss Greater Stanislaus and Miss San Luis Obispo
County (formerly Miss Pismo Beach), has been accepted at the
University of California at San Francisco. She will begin medical
school next fall, deferring enrollment even if she doesn't become
Miss America so as to fulfill the obligations of being Miss
California.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, for example, she's going to the Riviera this fall
for Wente Wineries, one of the pageant sponsors, although she's not
sure what duties that trip will entail. She's also looking forward
to meeting  &UR; Mikhail Gorbachev &LR;  at an International Academy of
Achievement Summit.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing she would change about herself before the
pageant, she said, it would be psychological. ``My weakest spot is
that I'm not used to the tension. I've traveled all around the
world, and there's a lot of tension in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Her platform issue is ``promoting the health and welfare of
America's children,'' and she played Beethoven's ``Appassionata''
on the piano in the talent competition.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -- Submarines may be sinkable, but Russian sailors sure know
know how to polish their brass buttons: A Vogue magazine ad for St.
John clothing features a blond model aboard the Russian battleship
Aurora, with nine snappily suited sailors saluting her.  &UR; Tiffany
Anastasakis &LR;  of St. John said the shoot had been set up with a
production company in Russia, but refused to say whether the
sailors or the navy had accepted a contribution in exchange for
their posing. ``They were very happy to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   -- &UR; Maya Angelou &LR; , who will take part in a benefit for the
National Poetry Association next weekend -- the group is chaired by
her son,  &UR; Guy Johnson &LR;  -- will travel cross-country from North
Carolina in a bus she has leased for the past year. The vehicle has
two drivers, which allows for nonstop travel, and Angelou finds it
so much more efficient than delay-ridden air travel that she's
thinking of buying it.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; AFFLECK GIVEAWAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Brash is back and gauche is good,'' says the party column in
the new Harper's Bazaar. And charity begins in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   After  &UR; Ben Affleck &LR;  won $140,000 playing blackjack at the Hard
Rock Hotel and Casino there last weekend, he gave it all away, a
spy told the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tipped out all of his chips to waitresses, dealers,
concierges, bell guys _ it was amazing. Some people were getting
$5,000, some people were getting more.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; QUEENS IN AUSTRALIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Allen White &LR;  forwards a report in the Advocate on closing
ceremonies for the Olympics in Sydney, which an Australian
newspaper reported last week will include a tribute to Australian
cinema featuring drag queens from the movie ``The Adventures of
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev.  &UR; Fred Niles &LR; , an Australian lawmaker, went on the
record to protest, saying that ``homosexual and lesbian behavior is
not a true representation of Australian culture and lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Director  &UR; Ric Birch &LR;  said the drag queens were supposed to be a
surprise and acknowledged that it was supposed to make reference to
the sizable gay and lesbian community in Sydney, as well as the
movies. ``For the right-wing reactionaries or whatever part of a
community that is outraged about it,'' he told the Advocate,
``well, they're always going to be outraged.''

 &HT;    Author of self-published book finds Internet delivers the buzz
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - This is the story of a David making his own way in a
world of Goliaths.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bowerman is an Atlanta writer who released a
self-published book, ``The Well-Fed Writer: Financial
Self-Sufficiency as a Freelance Writer in Six Months or Less,''
this month. That alone isn't a particularly impressive Information
Age story. There's nothing new or high tech about self-publishing.
</P>
<P>
   However, through his ``guerrilla'' promotion, marketing and
publicity techniques, Bowerman is knocking down doors that normally
open only to the publishing Goliaths.
</P>
<P>
   His weapon of choice? The Information Age version of a slingshot
_ you guessed it _ the Internet. Bowerman says the Net gave him
``laser-like precision ... (that) gave me an ability to very
quickly get to my market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way that I could accomplish the amount that I
accomplished in the period of time I accomplished it,'' Bowerman
raves. ``Absolutely, categorically no way I could accomplish it
without the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the book was printed, to drum up buzz for his
efforts, Bowerman launched his Web site, www.WellFedWriter.com. The
site grew to include sample chapters, a downloadable version of the
cover art, a sample radio interview, and, of course, the toll-free
number to order the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``By having a Web site, it has made things move so much faster
and made my book and information about my book so much more
accessible,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Internet took center stage upon the book's completion.
With galleys in hand _ freshly printed by a Tennessee firm whose
Web site he found through the Net _ Bowerman logged on in search
for critical feedback on his tome.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things you do is get someone who will review
your book,'' he says. ``Once I had my galleys, I got online and did
searches for writing groups, state-based writing organizations, and
you find these sites with all these (links to) organizations. I
also targeted at-home mothers, and there's a whole bunch of Web
sites for at-home mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Using links that linked to more links that linked to more links,
Bowerman found hundreds of contacts from which to solicit, via
e-mail, writeups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally in about a week or less, I had 25 people lined up to
give me reviews for my book and a blurb'' to publish in the book,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, someone would write letters _ you may not have
phone numbers for these folks _ so you write letters and you wait
and you wait,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   One editor e-mailed Bowerman minutes after he hit the ``send''
button for review request. ``Fifteen minutes later, I got a
response: Absolutely. I'm excited. I would love to give a review of
your book.''
</P>
<P>
   The reviews were valuable beyond their kind comments. When it
came to submitting an application to have the industry heavyweight
Ingram serve as wholesaler for his book, Bowerman applied for the
program specifically designed for ``the little guys,'' he says.
Attached to his application was a one-page, single-spaced sampling
of contacts he made via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He received a surprising e-mail in return. Because printing the
book is only half the battle, Bowerman had won important kudos for
drumming up interest in and awareness of his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of all the marketing you have done, we want to offer
you a full publisher contract,'' says Bowerman, proudly reading the
Ingram response. ``They are treating me like I'm a big publisher
even though I am working out of my own house. Because of the
Internet, I look a lot bigger than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Three major book clubs have similarly been impressed with
Bowerman's efforts. ``The Well-Fed Writer'' was a July selection of
the Writer's Digest book club, and both the Book-of-the-Month Club
and its sister organization, the Quality Paperback Book Club, will
promote Bowerman's book to their members.
</P>
<P>
   Writer's Digest has sold most of its 1,000 copies. Bowerman is
expecting another order soon from the group, which has more than
45,000 members, because ``Well-Fed Writer'' is ``our
second-highest-selling featured alternate selection in more than
two years,'' his contact there wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The epilogue to this story? If Bowerman were to pen one, it
would probably go something like this: ``If you're willing to put
in the sweat equity, the Internet is a wonderful tool to leverage a
small amount into a big impact.''

WHEN INNOCENCE DIED AT THE OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 3) 
By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich had ended on its 10th day,
it would have been remembered for Olga Korbut's pixieish dance
along the balance beam or Mark Spitz's record run of seven gold
medals in swimming. These were to be the Games of peace and
camaraderie _ a democratic West Germany's rebuke to Nazism and to
Adolf Hitler's fraudulent quest to use the 1936 Berlin Summer Games
as a showcase for Aryan physical superiority.
</P>
<P>
   But before dawn on the 11th day, Sept. 5, eight Palestinian
guerrillas scaled an unguarded fence in the Olympic village and
invaded the apartment building housing the Israeli team. They took
11 athletes and officials hostage and, over the course of a
slow-motion 20-hour siege that riveted the world, killed them all.
</P>
<P>
   If any innocence remained at the Olympics, it ended that day,
with the fedayeen, whose hooded faces came to symbolize terrorism,
and the preternaturally calm leader, Issa, with his blue suit and
white hat, his face blackened by shoe polish, negotiating with a
grenade in his hand while untold millions watched on television.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Germans had chosen pacifism over security,
policing the Olympic village with 2,000 unarmed guards. ``Their
whole mind-set was on being non-militaristic,'' said Jim McKay, who
anchored the ABC Sports coverage, which earned him a news Emmy
Award. ``They were supposed to be the serene Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight Black September terrorists, only one, Jamal
al-Gashey, a teen-ager at the time, survives. Five were killed
during the bungled firefight with untrained German snipers at a
military airport that ended the siege. Three others, including
al-Gashey, were jailed, but they were released in late October 1972
in exchange for the freedom of a Lufthansa jet that had been
hijacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
another guerrilla group. The Mossad, Israel's secret service,
eventually killed two of the three.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Summer Games from Sydney approach, we see al-Gashey,
who has eluded his Israeli hunters, in middle age, his face
obscured in shadows and distorted by grainy video, wearing a ball
cap, denim shirt, eyeglasses and a mustache and smoking a
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight years older, he is onscreen in ``One Day in
September,'' a documentary in which he describes his life as a
Palestinian refugee and his pride in what the Black September
terrorists did to the Israelis inside the Olympic village at 31
Connollystrasse.
</P>
<P>
   The first image of this long-wanted man is of his clasped hands.
Then comes his voice, calm and measured, which offers no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a member of a Palestinian family which fled our village
in Galilee from Zionist gangs in 1948,'' he says through a
translator. In the liberation movement he was given a gun, he says,
and ``for the first time in my life, I felt inspired, I felt truly
Palestinian, that I wasn't a wretched refugee.'' Later in the film
he adds: ``Before Munich, the world had no idea about our struggle,
but on that day, the name of `Palestine' was repeated all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   For the makers of ``One Day in September,'' which won the
Academy Award for best documentary last March and will be seen on
Sept. 11 at 8 p.m. on HBO, finding al-Gashey was crucial: The film
would have been made without him, but no one else could describe
the terrorists' training in Libya, their arriving in Munich with no
idea of the plan, their watching volleyball at the Olympic Park on
the day before they broke into the Israelis' dormitory. ``I felt
very proud,'' al-Gashey says, ``that for the first time I was
finally able to confront the Israelis.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Cohn, the co-producer of the $2.5 million film and a
winner of five previous Oscars, said: ``He was our guarantor of
even-handedness in the film. I don't think I would have made the
film with as big a budget if I didn't have Jamal.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohn and the director, Kevin Macdonald, would not disclose where
al-Gashey lives other than to say that he was interviewed in Africa
and moves frequently to protect himself, his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a series of coincidences and fortuitous circumstances
that led us to find someone who knew him and would act as a
go-between,'' Macdonald said. ``It was a kind of six degrees of
separation situation, where somebody knew somebody who knew
somebody. I had heard that one of the Palestinians was still alive
and that a Palestinian reporter had tried to interview him a couple
of years before, but it didn't work out. That started me to
thinking. So after eight months, we got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Gashey hovers over the documentary, a haunting yet oddly
congenial presence. The film is structured like a suspense story:
Jump-cut editing gives the illusion of accelerated action, and
recreations show how the terrorists entered the Israeli residence
and how one Israeli, Gad Zabari, escaped. The background music is
by Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Philip Glass _ not the classical
selections that might be expected for such a dour story.
</P>
<P>
   The film was completed last October, in time to meet the
deadline to be seen by the documentary panel of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but before Cohn had made a
distribution deal. Once it became a finalist, the documentary was
screened by the academy, the American Film Institute and the Simon
Wiesenthal Center. The four other finalists, including ``The Buena
Vista Social Club,'' had all been released theatrically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have had 100 conversations with Arthur,'' said Sheila
Nevins, the executive vice president of original programming for
HBO, who acquired the documentary for $1 million before it won the
Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept asking, `What about `Buena Vista,' what do you hear?'
I'd say, `Nothing.' I think Arthur was a little insecure until
after he won. I saw him at intermission of the Oscars, racing
around thrilled. He pushed hard to win, he politicked, he
screamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the events in Munich, Nevins added: ``I was awake and
alive at the time, but I didn't really recognize the magnitude of
the event. Somehow I glossed over it as a precursor to what
terrorism would become. I was so astounded by my ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   The film does not detail a half-century of Palestinian-Israeli
conflicts, as the Palestinian-born writer Edward Said insisted it
should have in The Guardian of London; it focuses its narrative on
a day when the West Germans, confounding anyone who expected
efficiency and military precision from them, proved incompetent in
their negotiations with the terrorists and their attempts to rescue
the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were, I think, a little bit naive, you know,'' Brig. Gen.
Ulrich Wegener, then an aide to Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West
Germany's interior minister, says in the film. Genscher offered
himself in exchange for the Israelis. Manfred Schreiber, Munich's
police chief, offered money.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Gashey is the only Palestinian voice, albeit a powerful one,
in the film. Macdonald uses him as counterpoint to the Israeli
side, especially to the love story of Andre Spitzer, the affable
Israeli fencing coach who was killed by the terrorists, and his
Dutch wife, Ankie. Their brief life together is the film's
emotional anchor. There is 8-millimeter footage of their modest
wedding; there are moments in which Ankie expresses fear for
Andre's safety and frustration with conflicting news reports about
his fate, and there is a visit by their grown daughter, Anouk, to
her father's grave in Israel, which ends the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only a year and three months that I was married to
Andre Spitzer,'' says Ankie Spitzer. ``But I remember that year as
the most beautiful and wonderful year of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After the film's theatrical release in Israel, several of the
slain Israelis' families objected publicly to the use of the most
graphic police photographs of the bloodied and tortured bodies of
Joseph Romano, a weight lifter, and Moshe Weinberg, a wrestling
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn and Macdonald blurred the images. ``But I did it
reluctantly,'' Cohn said. ``You can't do a film about terrorism
without showing terror.''
</P>
<P>
   As cooperative as al-Gashey and some of the Israelis were, Cohn
encountered considerable resistance from German officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had so much trouble getting Genscher and Schreiber to
talk,'' Cohn said. ``I went to Genscher, who is very decent, noble
and intelligent, and said, `Dr. Genscher, you must appear, so it
doesn't look like you're hiding.''' Eventually, Genscher, Schreiber
and the remaining Germans consented, but their memories serve only
to underscore their failures, from not having a trained
anti-terrorist squad to not equipping the untrained group of five
police snipers at the airport with walkie-talkies. Had the snipers
been carrying them, they would have learned that they would be
facing eight terrorists, not five, as the German authorities
initially believed.
</P>
<P>
   With unconcealed contempt, Zvi Zamir, who then headed the
Mossad, disdains the Germans' handling of the crisis and their not
letting him bring a trained rescue team from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't capable,'' he says. At least one of the airport
snipers was too far away to spot the terrorists in his gun sight.
``Unbelievable,'' Zamir says with simmering anger.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald said that one reason to make the film was to create a
``public outcry'' that would force German and Bavarian state
authorities to release all the files about the handling of the
massacre, a goal that has eluded the Israeli families in years of
court challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've shoved rotten fish under the carpet for 28 years, and
as the years go by, it stinks even more,'' he said. ``They've
exacerbated it so it looks like some kind of conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   One conspiracy theory the film advances, but fails to prove, is
that German officials helped plan the Lufthansa hijacking to rid
themselves of the three Olympic terrorists and keep further attacks
off German turf. ``The entire affair,'' the narrator Michael
Douglas says, without offering any evidence, ``was a set-up,
organized by the German government in collusion with the
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Why else, the film suggests, did the plane have only 12
passengers, and no women and children? Why else, it asks, would the
Germans make the deal with such ``indecent haste'' and without
consultation with Israel? That the government of Chancellor Willy
Brandt capitulated to the hijackers' demands is undeniable. Wegener
says as much in the film, as does the former mayor of Munich. But
no one offers proof that Brandt's government helped plan the
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald said that in an off-camera interview, Abu Daoud, the
longtime Palestinian leader who admits in his memoir to helping
plan the Olympic massacre, described a German-Palestinian
conspiracy. So did another Palestinian source.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Daoud is not altogether reliable,'' said Macdonald, who
added that he nonetheless felt bound to suggest that something
wrong had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm saying is, this is as much as I know,' he said. ``I
think there's a fair likelihood that it happened.'' &QL;

BRAZIL ASSUMING BIGGER ROLE IN LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ When Henry A. Kissinger visited here as
secretary of state in the mid-1970s, his Brazilian counterpart,
Antonio Azeredo da Silveira, made a point of escorting him on a
tour of Itamaraty Palace, the ultramodern glass and marble
headquarters of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Silveira asked his American guest for his
impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Grinning with amusement, Silveira later recalled in an interview
Kissinger's reply: ``It's a magnificent building, Antonio. Now all
you need is a foreign policy to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century later, the joke may finally be on the
United States. Today an increasingly confident and assertive Brazil
is emerging as both a U.S. partner and rival in Latin America,
steering its own course on political and economic matters and, in
the words of Anthony S. Harrington, the U.S. ambassador here,
``stepping out onto the world stage in a way that it never has
before.''
</P>
<P>
   At the World Trade Organization talks in Seattle last fall, for
instance, it was Brazil that led the bloc of developing nations in
criticizing Washington's position. And on Aug. 31 and Sept. 1,
Brazil is sponsoring a first summit meeting of South American
presidents here that is being seen as both a coming-out party and
an effort to forge a unified regional front in negotiations with
the United States about a hemispheric free-trade zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clearly the judgment that the continent is now ready for
Brazil to assume a broader, more dynamic leadership role in
regional affairs,'' Riordan Roett, director of the Western
Hemisphere Program at Johns Hopkins University, said in referring
to Brazilian leaders in an essay published this month by the Web
site InfoBrazil.com. ``And it is now understood in South America
that the regional card to play is one that is led from Brasilia.''
</P>
<P>
   As the largest country in Latin America but separated from its
Spanish-speaking neighbors by its Portuguese language, Brazil has
traditionally conducted a foreign policy that is pragmatic but that
only recently began to emphasize relations within the region. By
habit, said Helio Jaguaribe of the Institute for Political and
Social Studies in Rio de Janeiro, ``Brazil seeks cooperation,''
recognizing that ``whether or not you like the United States, you
have to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason the United States has welcomed the summit
meeting, even though one of its goals is to blunt Washington's
strategy in trade talks of favoring bilateral agreements in which
it has the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A South America assembled into a single bloc would add up to
more than the sum of its parts and therefore be in a position to
insist on more balanced negotiations with the North American
trading bloc,'' said Gilberto Dupas of the Institute of Advanced
Studies at the University of Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   If regional integration is to take place, the State Department
would clearly prefer to see it led by Brazil rather than
Venezuela's firebrand president, Hugo Chavez, whose calls for South
American unity contain authoritarian and markedly anti-American
elements. Indeed, given its sheer size and the relative maturity
and health of its democracy compared with some of its more troubled
neighbors, Brazil may be best positioned to lead such a effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is looked upon as
somewhat of an uncle by some of the other leaders in South
America,'' Harrington said in an interview. ``His orientation and
goal is to steer onto the path of democracy a few countries that
may be a little more challenged there.''

<P>
   The United States has recognized the benefits of Brazil's
playing such a role since the early 1980s, when Brazilian diplomacy
guided a leftist government in Suriname away from a flirtation with
Cuba. More recently, Brazil helped negotiate the end to a
potentially explosive border dispute between Ecuador and Peru, and
has also used its influence to head off potential military coups in
neighboring Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton praised Brazil and Argentina during a visit to
nuclear-armed India and Pakistan this spring as examples of nations
that have successfully negotiated an end to dangerous nuclear
programs and even become allies. Bitter military rivals for most of
their history, Brazil and Argentina have in the last decade become
partners in the Mercosul trade bloc and are now talking about
adopting a common currency.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Brazil have disagreed recently, however,
over the suspect presidential election in Peru that resulted in a
third term in office for Alberto K. Fujimori. The United States was
pushing behind the scenes for sanctions, and U.S. officials have
complained privately that Brazil was undermining their efforts to
nudge the Organization of American States into a tough collective
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington should have seen that one coming,'' said David
Fleischer, a professor of political science at the National
University of Brasilia. ``If you want to bring the Andean nations
into Mercosul, as Brazil apparently does, you are not going to want
to slap them in the face.''

</P>
<P>
   But it is the crisis in Colombia, with which Brazil shares a
1,000-mile border, that seems to have the most potential to become
a source of disagreement with Washington. The Clinton
administration's plan to supply $1.3 billion in military and
economic aid to President Andres Pastrana of Colombia has been
widely criticized in the Brazilian press and Congress, and official
support for the U.S.-backed effort appears lukewarm, at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil certainly has concerns there could be a spillover onto
our side, whether of coca cultivation and trafficking or of combat
between the Colombian army and guerrillas,'' said Brazil's foreign
minister, Luiz Felipe Lampreia, in an interview here. The U.S. aid
plan to Colombia, he added, represents ``a stepping up of the level
of conflict'' that ``could generate this effect.''
</P>
<P>
   At a joint news conference with Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright during her South American tour this month, Lampreia's
remarks were even stronger. ``We do not have the same degree of
commitment,'' he said of the plan in Colombia, with Albright by his
side. ``We have no intention of participating in any common or
concerted international action.''
</P>
<P>
   Another point of potential tension is the hemispheric free-trade
talks, which are supposed to reach an agreement by 2005. Brazil and
the United States are the co-chairmen, but after six years of
negotiations, it is clear that the two nations have very different
views, with some officials in Washington describing Brazil's
position as ``obstructionist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the prospect of seeing a free trade area by 2005 is
pretty unrealistic right now,'' said William M. Daley, who was then
secretary of commerce, at a conference in Madrid in June. ``If
Brazil doesn't become aggressive at some point, I don't think it's
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, in turn, complains of protectionist barriers and
subsidies in the United States that discriminate against Brazilian
products ranging from steel and textiles to sugar and orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is essential for us is a free-trade agreement completely
devoid of tariff and nontariff barriers so that we can have
unobstructed access,'' Lampreia said of access to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Minister Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes said in a
recent interview: ``There is no way we can negotiate with the
Americans or open any further. If we do, we will go bankrupt. We
have to open at the same pace that other countries open to us.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Gore outlines steps for expanding health coverage
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By JULIE MASON 
and CLAY ROBISON &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Asking voters to give him a mandate to seek
universal health care, Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday outlined
steps he would take for expanding coverage to children and parents
in low and moderate income families.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican presidential opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
meanwhile, rebuked Gore for a comment Monday that Bush should ``put
up or shut up'' on a health care plan of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that Gore's comments to reporters aboard Air Force Two
``underlined the point I make that if we want to get something done
in Washington, we have to do something to change the tone of the
discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound very presidential to me,'' said Bush, who
campaigned Tuesday in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has promised to unveil details next week of a health care
plan that would include prescription drug benefits for older
Americans. He has said he favors giving Medicare beneficiaries the
option of selecting from a range of private health plans that would
include drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed providing a prescription drug benefit for the
elderly under Medicare at a cost estimated at $250 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's put up or shut up time,'' Gore said Monday night about
Bush and health care. ``The time for generalities without specifics
is kind of over.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush said on Tuesday that he has been talking about health care
since the primaries last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Gore) may not like what he hears, but I'm talking about
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning Tuesday in a park with dozens of supporters
seated on lawn chairs and blankets on the grass, said he is
offering specifics in hopes of generating a national mandate on
health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You deserve to give a mandate during this election for what
you would like to see in the future,'' Gore said at the midday
rally. ``And my motive in presenting you all of these specifics is
partly to ask for your judgment on the program that I am offering
and partly to ask for your support for my candidacy.``
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan Gore is proposing, the Children's Health
Insurance Program (CHIP) would be expanded to cover children living
at 2.5 times the poverty level, or about $41,000 a year for a
family of four. Current CHIP guidelines cover children whose
families earn up to 200 percent of the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   The federal program is administered on a state-by-state basis,
allowing federal funds to match state dollars for covered families.
Gore officials estimate his proposed expansion would capture nearly
one million additional children nationwide whose family incomes
fall between 200 and 250 percent of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his proposals for widening children's coverage,
Gore wants to expand CHIP to 7 million uninsured parents of
Medicaid or CHIP-eligible children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's CHIP package would be funded through the projected
federal budget surplus at an estimated cost of $95 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to other stops where Gore's campaign has offered a
harsh assessment of Bush's handling of children's health care
coverage in Texas, Gore told New Mexicans only that his own plan
was a good one and that Bush should move quickly to release one
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed the bill authorizing CHIP in Texas last year,
although he supported capping eligibility at 150 percent of poverty
level. He has called for allowing states greater flexibility to
expand CHIP coverage, in addition to tax credits for families
lacking employer health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign day Tuesday included a stop at Moore Middle
School in Portland, Maine, where Houston Independent School
District Superintendent Rod Paige and former HISD reading manager
Phyllis Hunter praised the governor as an education reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was to attend a fund-raiser Tuesday night in Portsmouth,
N.H., and campaign Wednesday morning in Hampton, N.H., before
heading for the battleground state of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire voters handed a victory to Bush's primary
opponent, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., but the state is considered a
likely win for Bush over Gore, and Bush said he harbors ``no hard
feelings'' about the primary defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In other campaign developments Tuesday, Gore picked up the
endorsement of Native American leaders in New Mexico, a group that
comprises an estimated 12 percent of the state's electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Gore traveled to Eugene, Ore., where he was to
meet up with his vice presidential running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn. The two scheduled a joint campaign appearance
Wednesday in Seattle. &QL;

FORD SAYS CEO WON'T TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS ON TIRE FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, La., Fla.)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday that its chief executive
and president, Jacques Nasser, had declined invitations to testify
next week before congressional committees investigating tire
failures, mainly on Ford Explorers. This prompted criticism from
one lawmaker who is leading inquiries into the recall of 6.5
million Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bridgestone/Firestone, the U.S. unit of Japan's
Bridgestone, agreed to send its chief executive, Masatoshi Ono, to
testify even though he speaks limited English, congressional
officials said. Bridgestone has been criticized until now for not
being as open about the recall as Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Vines, a Ford spokesman, said Nasser was most needed at
the company's headquarters to oversee the recall and work with tire
makers and other Ford suppliers. A senior Ford safety official and
a senior engineer, both of whom have been involved with every
detail of the problem, will be sent to testify instead, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., who heads a House Commerce
subcommittee that will be holding a hearing next Wednesday, said
through a spokesman that it was ``curious'' that Nasser could find
the time to make television advertisements about the recall but not
to explain to Congress what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin ``is very miffed,'' said Ken Johnson, the congressman's
communications director. ``We want Ford's unscripted version of
what went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Ono had agreed to come to Washington because ``he's
anxious to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   The tussle between lawmakers and Ford came as the automaker
blamed Bridgestone for tire problems in Venezuela and Thailand,
while Bridgestone said it did not believe there was a problem with
the tires.
</P>
<P>
   Vines said that Ford asked Bridgestone three times to check its
tires in Venezuela, but that Bridgestone's scientists in Venezuela
and Akron, Ohio, had insisted that they could never find any
problem with them. Ford ended up recalling the Explorers equipped
with Firestone tires in Venezuela in May and replacing them with
Goodyear tires at Ford's own expense following a series of crashes,
Vines said. Ford engineers have cut up some of the recalled tires
and found that the rate of tread separation on them is 500 times as
high as on the worst recalled tires in the United States, he said
in a telephone conference call Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone maintained Tuesday that the tires met Ford's
specifications and did not have quality problems. Bridgestone said
it did not need to recall any tires in Venezuela, although the tire
maker has asked its dealers to return unsold tires that may have
been mislabeled. Toyota, which equipped some Land Cruisers with the
same tires in Venezuela, said it had not heard reports of problems
and did not see a need for a recall.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Dominguez, chief investigator for Venezuela's consumer
protection agency, the Institute for Consumer Protection and
Education, Tuesday repeated the accusation he made on Monday _ that
Ford shared responsibility for the crashes because the Ford
Explorer was too prone to roll over. ``There are problems with the
tire and there are problems with the vehicle _ let's be clear about
this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vines said that statistics in the United States showed that the
Explorer was less likely to roll over than other sport utilities.
Venezuela does not keep comparably detailed figures on traffic
deaths. Ford on Tuesday urged the Venezuelan consumer agency to set
up an independent commission to review the tire issue, instead of
proceeding with its plans to bring formal complaints against Ford
and Bridgestone on Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said this evening that Ford's
Venezuelan subsidiary had asked Bridgestone's Venezuelan subsidiary
in October 1998 to study why Ford was receiving reports of tire
failures on Explorers. That is the earliest that Ford has
acknowledged that any of its operations were aware of problems with
the Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone assured Ford in November 1998 that the tires in
Venezuela did not pose a problem, and provided further reassurances
in January, March and August of 1999 in response to further Ford
inquiries, Harmon said. Bridgestone officials said they would check
their records.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, where Ford replaced Firestone tires on 160
Explorers in March and April, Ford officials said Tuesday that they
had thought the problem was because of unique climate conditions
there and did not indicate a possible problem in the United States
too.
</P>
<P>
   The first people to point out problems with the Firestone tires
on those Explorers were not the buyers, but the drivers of the
company's own fleet of 40 Explorers, said Mike Pease, executive
director of Ford Sales &AMP; Service Thailand, in Bangkok. Early this
year, Ford's Thai drivers discovered two or three Firestone tires
with cracks near the treads, Pease said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford sent the tires to Bridgestone's Thai subsidiary, which told
Ford its tests were inconclusive. ``They couldn't tell from the
tires whether it was from any one factor,'' Pease said. All of the
160 Explorers sold in Thailand happened to have tires from
Bridgestone's factory in Decatur, Ill., and the recall in the
United States has focused on tires from that factory.
</P>
<P>
   Ichiro Fukumori, managing director of Bridgestone's Thai
operations, said he had no knowledge of Ford sending it defective
tires. Pease declined to identify exactly whom at Bridgestone Ford
had communicated with.
</P>
<P>
   Pease said that because other equipment problems had also
occurred in Thailand, Ford had assumed that the tire problems there
were caused by a unique combination of heat, pollution and
potholes. When Ford imported a car from Europe to Thailand, for
example, the car's air conditioner could not handle the local
humidity without producing water leaks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the attorney general of Florida filed a
civil racketeering suit against Ford and Bridgestone, and requested
extensive documents from both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone's stock fell 6 percent Tuesday in Tokyo. For the
month of August, it is' down from 2515 yen to Tuesday's close of
1526 yen, a loss of 39 percent. Ford's stock fell 94 cents, to
$25.56.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Garrity, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, an
investment bank, on Tuesday lowered his rating on Ford stock to
``add'' from ``buy,'' saying that Ford's image had been hurt and
that the odds of an expected stock buyback soon had fallen sharply
because that would look callous during a recall.

 &HT;    Five nooses displayed, company says
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Georgia Power Co. said Tuesday that five hangman's
nooses have been displayed at company facilities, but that an
intent of racial discrimination or harassment had been determined
in only one case six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to allegations in a racial discrimination lawsuit,
David Ratcliffe, the utility's chief executive, said a white
manager ``apparently displayed a noose in the presence of an
African-American employee'' in 1994 at Plant McDonough near Smyrna.
But that manager apologized to the employee and has retired from
the company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe said four other nooses were discovered at company
facilities since a group of African-American employees filed the
lawsuit against Georgia Power and parent Southern Co. on July 27.
One of them was at Plant McDonough, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While no intent of racial harassment had been determined in
those four cases, Ratcliffe said, the ropes ``were found in areas
where they could have been seen and therefore may have been
offensive to our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe spoke at a news conference to detail the company's
actions in response to employees' allegations that the utility and
Southern Co. foster a ``pattern of discriminating against
African-Americans'' who work there and show ``reckless
indifference'' to a racially hostile workplace. Also Tuesday,
attorneys for the seven employees who are suing filed a motion
alleging that Ratcliffe improperly contacted employees who are
prospective plaintiffs as members of a class. The lawsuit seeks
class-action status to represent all 2,100 African-American
employees of Southern and its subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys asked that the company be ordered to not make
``further improper communication'' with prospective plaintiffs. At
the same time, the lawyers sought authorization to contact such
employees themselves. Court rules generally prohibit such
communication by either side without court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe said he has contacted employees since the lawsuit was
filed, including calling two at home. But he denied he tried to
encourage them to settle their prospective case or discourage them
from seeking legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says the hangman's noose ``has long been one of the
most chilling representations of racial harassment.'' But two
Georgia Power vice presidents and several managers were aware of a
noose displayed at the company's operating headquarters in
Cornelia, in North Georgia, and took no action to remove it, the
lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe said the company's internal investigation had been
unable to determine that executives knew about noose displays and
failed to take action.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he had spoken to an employee responsible for
displaying a noose at the Cornelia facility ``and do not believe he
intended to intimidate or harass his fellow employees.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is satisfied the employee intended no malice. ``In
fact, he is a Scout leader,'' he said. ``However, he did show an
unacceptable level of insensitivity and poor judgment,'' Ratcliffe
said and has been asked to make an apology to ``anyone who might
have been offended by his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe told a news conference it is ``not unusual for line
crews to use ropes'' in their daily activities or tie knots during
downtime on a rainy day. ``This individual simply tied a noose and
left it lying around for an extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Terrell, a company spokesman, added later that linemen
sometimes use knots that resemble hangman's nooses in storm
restoration and building and rebuilding power lines.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Davis, recently named the company's vice president for
diversity action, said in an interview last week that his heartbeat
quickened when he saw a photograph of the noose found in Cornelia
that was included as an exhibit with the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an intimidating thing for a black man,'' said Davis,
who is African-American. He added that such a display is
reminiscent of cross burning. ``A noose is something that any black
person considers offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed with Tuesday's procedural motion a Plant
McDonough electrician said a white foreman had displayed a ``poorly
tied hangman's knot'' in his presence in the plant's control room
six years ago. The foreman ``said to me in essence that 'the reason
I was kicked out of the Ku Klux Klan was because I would not tie a
noose,''' the employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe said the foreman's actions ``were offensive to me and
to the company'' and that he _ Ratcliffe _ had offered a personal
apology to the African-American employee involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take no comfort in the fact that the employee who was
responsible is no longer with the company and it occurred six years
ago,'' he said. ``This type of unacceptable behavior will not be
tolerated.'' But he said the manager's actions ``should not be seen
as a reflection on the rest of our company.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe also answered an allegation in the employee lawsuit
that African-American employees were forced at a 1999 Southern Co.
marketing meeting to ``watch their Caucasian supervisors sing and
dance to Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe said a band hired for the event did play Dixie but
were not asked to do so by management. ``The band was told to leave
the stage. It did so and did not return,'' Ratcliffe said.

JAPAN COMPLAINS TO CHINA ABOUT ITS ACTIONS AT SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ During a visit by Japan's foreign minister, Japan and
China have affirmed their friendship, resolved to remain peaceful
partners and scheduled a visit to Japan in October by Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there have been unavoidable reminders of the tensions that
always lurk in relations between these two Asian powers that are
struggling to contain a strategic rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, President Jiang Zemin's trip to Japan was
shadowed by China's continued bitterness over Japanese atrocities
in World War II and Japanese resentment over demands for historical
apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two days into the four-day visit by Foreign Minister Yohei
Kono, the Chinese have not pressed the historical point and,
according to Japanese officials, have not even made their usual
complaint about Japanese-U.S. plans for regional missile defenses,
which could be used against China in a battle for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese arrived with unusually blunt and public
complaints, about what they see as ominous Chinese maritime
incursions. They also warned that Japan's large-scale foreign aid
to China _ $2.2 billion in 1998 _ could no longer be taken for
granted, given China's growing wealth and what Japan considers its
aggressive behavior at sea.
</P>
<P>
   In late May and in July of this year, Chinese naval vessels
cruised just outside Japan's 12-mile territorial limit apparently
gathering intelligence, said the Japanese foreign ministry
spokesman, Yasuhisa Kawamura. The ship movements, while not a
violation of maritime law, were inconsistent with friendly
relations, Kawamura said, noting that in the first incident the
vessels completely circled Japan's main islands.
</P>
<P>
   Of equal concern, 30 times last year and 17 times through Aug. 7
of this year, Chinese research vessels conducted operations,
without the required permission, inside Japan's 200-mile exclusive
economic zone. Some Japanese experts speculate that the ships are
mapping the offshore sea bottom, data of great value to the
military.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Kono raised these concerns in a lengthy meeting with
his Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, telling him that Japanese
``feelings of distrust'' toward China are rising, the Japanese
spokesman later reported.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the naval vessels, Tang said the situation ``no longer
exists,'' Kawamura told reporters. The Japanese interpret that as a
promise that such cruises would be called off for now.
</P>
<P>
   As for the incursions by research vessels, both sides agreed to
develop procedures to notify each other in advance of expeditions
and to begin negotiations on disputes about maritime borders, which
the Japanese called ``a step forward.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Japanese have freely shared their concerns with foreign
reporters here. In his meeting Tuesday, Kono told Jiang that
``relations are in a good state but they are not problem-free,''
according to the Japanese spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese appear determined to prevent any open rift with
Japan, stressing the advantages of cooperation. Kono has been
greeted by a raft of top officials here including, diplomats noted,
Zeng Qinghong, chief of the Communist Party's organization
department, who has no formal position in foreign policy but is
considered a powerful adviser to Jiang and a rising political star.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, China's government-controlled media quoted Jiang
as saying, ``I'm optimistic on the future of Chinese-Japanese
relations.''

CHENEY VISITS KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The venue for Dick Cheney on Tuesday was the
Fellowship of Christian Athletes national headquarters in Kansas
City. The topic was character.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching character, Cheney told an audience of about 70, is as
important as learning how to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to know right from wrong,'' Cheney said in a
quiet voice, referring to George W. Bush's goal of teaching
children to be ``good and kind and decent'' in public schools.
``Nothing is more important than teaching character.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Wyoming congressman and defense secretary under
President George Bush described character as ``the very essence of
our country.'' America's creed, Cheney said, is ``leadership based
on character.''
</P>
<P>
   So it came as no surprise that Texas Gov. George W. Bush's
running mate had a very definite opinion on whether President
Clinton should have been removed from office last year as a result
of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have voted to impeach him,'' Cheney said in an
interview with The Kansas City Star. ``Because I thought he was
guilty. I thought he lied under oath. And I thought the House made
a strong case to that effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, Cheney told an interviewer later, a ``man of few words''
who prefers low-key campaign events that are in sharp contrast to
the more lively events that Democrats Al Gore and Joe Lieberman
regularly stage.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's event certainly fit Cheney's preferences. The FCA
crowd was in business attire and remained quiet for most of
Cheney's brief remarks. In fact, attendees waited to politely
applaud until well after Cheney and his wife entered the hall.
</P>
<P>
   His toughest remarks directed at the Democratic team also were
brief and were presented with no change in Cheney's somber tone.
The running mate criticized Gore for opposing any type of school
voucher plan that would provide federal grants to parents with
children in failing schools. The parents could then use the money
to pay for private schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore does not support the idea of giving low-income parents
a wide range of choices,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   As he often is on the campaign trail, Cheney was joined by his
wife, Lynne. Others featured at the gathering were Royals' first
baseman and FCA member Mike Sweeney and Erika Garris, a junior at
Knob Noster High School and FCA member who has signed a pledge to
remain drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Cheney stopped at the Carriage Club near State Line
Road and Shawnee Mission Parkway for a private fund-raiser that
brought in an estimated $50,000 for the Missouri Republican Party.
He then left Kansas City for Jackson, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made character education a part of his school platform.
He's proposed increasing to $25 million from $8 million the amount
spent on ``character education grants'' so that teachers can learn
how to incorporate character-building lessons in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has proposed increases in the amount spent on
abstinence education from $62 million a year to at least $135
million a year, which, he notes, is the amount the federal
government spends on teen contraception programs.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1954, the FCA is a faith-based organization aimed at
student and professional athletes. The group's motto is that
building better persons translates into molding better athletes.
</P>
<P>
   On other topics, Cheney deflected pressure from Gore's campaign
to accept three nationally televised, prime-time debates as
proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he ``would welcome'' three prime-time debates. But
his campaign said that did not mean that Bush would accept the
commission's proposed dates or formats.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with The Star, Cheney pointed out his campaign
has received 41 debate invitations from different groups. The
invitation from the commission is ``one proposal out of several,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of different ways to go,'' Cheney said. ``And
I don't think there's necessarily any one particular approach. My
guess is we'll end up with a mix, and that's probably as it should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the B-2 stealth bomber fleet based at Whiteman Air
Force Base in Knob Noster, Mo., Cheney said he opposed moving the
fleet closer to the world's hot spots in Europe and the Mideast.
The bomber was not used in the Persian Gulf War, when Cheney was
defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of great features of the B-2 is the fact that you can base
it here in Missouri and can, with air-to-air refueling, literally
hit virtually any target any place in the world without having to
land on foreign soil,'' he said. ``That's a great asset.''
</P>
<P>
   On another topic, Cheney said Bush is just as prepared as his
father to assume the presidency, although he said the Texas
governor's background is based more on domestic policy while his
father had more foreign policy experience when he became president.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one president ever arrives in the Oval Office with total
experience,'' Cheney said. ``It's not a one-man operation. You have
to build a team. The governor has demonstrated that he's very much
committed to that course of action, and he's started to assemble a
good team.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave Clinton some credit for overseeing the nation's robust
economy. But Cheney said that the causes of America's economic boom
predated the Clinton administration by more than a decade. One of
those causes was the major tax cut Ronald Reagan passed early in
his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to attribute to him sole responsibility for
our current prosperity,'' Cheney said of Clinton. ``I don't think
that's accurate.''

CLASHES CONTINUE BETWEEN CENSUS BUREAU AND ITS GOP OVERSEERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Calif., N.Y., N.J., Pa., Ga., Ill.)   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as it seeks to complete the official
population count for the year 2000, the Census Bureau finds itself
engaged in a low-level war with House Republicans over how the
bureau is conducting its head count.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the summer, members of the House Subcommittee on the
Census and their staffs have demanded explanations from the Census
Bureau about its counting methods. House Republicans have also been
quick to call for investigations when they believe the bureau is
withholding information or failing to make an attempt to count
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say their activities are routine efforts at
congressional oversight, while Democrats suspect the Republicans
are laying the groundwork for later legal attacks on the accuracy
of the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bureau has $6.5 billion that it is spending on this
census,'' Chip Walker, the subcommittee's assistant staff director
said in explaining the panel's intense scrutiny of the Census
Bureau's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken a different approach than the Democrats on the
subcommittee. The Democrats have taken a hands-off approach. They
are willing to let the bureau spend the $6.5 billion as it sees
fit. We don't believe that we approach fulfills our oversight
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the Republicans seek to portray the Census Bureau
as incapable of carrying out routine tasks, let alone a complex
operation like statistical sampling, which would supplement the
actual count and which the Republicans oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the subcommittee staff does not turn up systemic
wrongdoing on the Census Bureau's part, its constant questioning
may raise doubts about the bureau's methods.
</P>
<P>
   Such doubts may be useful in what is expected to be a protracted
legal battle over whether population data compiled using sampling
can be used in redistricting, the drawing of of lines for
congressional and state legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lays the groundwork for the legal action that will probably
take up the first half of the next decade,'' said one Republican
strategist who spoke only on a promise of anonymity. ``Both parties
view the stakes of redistricting very high. So on the Republican
side the strategy has shifted from fighting the theory of sampling
to fighting the mechanics of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under its current plans, the Census Bureau is gathering
demographic data from a sample of 314,000 households and will use
that to adjust population counts in areas as small as city blocks.
The bureau is using this method, which is nearly completed, to
adjust for the millions of people it expects to miss using
traditional counting methods.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have opposed the sampling method and Democrats have
supported it in large part because many of those who are missed
tend to be minorities living in traditionally Democratic areas.
Political strategists believe such an adjustment would give
Democrats an advantage when legislative boundaries are drawn.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the House census subcommittee staff charged that
the Census Bureau completed its work too quickly in 15 local census
offices in cities including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, Newark,
Philadelphia and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans based their suspicions about wider problems to
the discovery in June by federal auditors of wrongdoing by census
takers in Hialeah, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors found that the census takers had had stopped
visiting households that had failed to send back their
questionnaires after only one unsuccessful attempt, rather than
after the mandatory six tries, and that in some cases they had
simply made up the answers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the problem, the Census Bureau sent census takers
to reinterview the residents of all households that had not mailed
back their forms. After an internal investigation, Kenneth Prewitt,
the Census Bureau director, announced last month that he had not
found any problems in the 15 local census offices named by the
subcommittee staff.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republicans demanded that the bureau save more than
30 million forms that had been completed by census takers across
the country who conducted interviews in households that did not
mail back questionnaires. Normally these forms are destroyed after
the data they contain are scanned into Census Bureau computers. But
the Republicans say they want them saved to make sure the
information being inserted into the computers is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials said Tuesday that merely holding on to
the forms will cost $3.5 million to $5 million in storage costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States Congress wants to pay $5 million to store
these things in a warehouse for 10 years, we'll cooperate,''
Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., who chairs the
subcommittee, called for a Justice Department investigation into
the bureau's participation in a political and cultural symposium
held in Los Angeles by Tavis Smiley, a popular black radio and
television personality two days before the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that because the symposium was listed by the
Democratic National Committee as an event that was taking place in
Los Angeles around the time of the convention, it was a partisan
Democratic event and the bureau should not have taken part. In a
press release, Miller said the event cast a ``dark cloud'' over the
census.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley who has worked closely with the Census Bureau for more
than a year trying to boost the number of blacks who mail back
their census forms has hotly denied any link between his symposium
and the Democratic convention. He said that three Census Bureau
workers merely set up a table at the event and handed out
information on the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in no way connected to the DNC,'' Smiley said. ``The
DNC gave me no money, there was no speaker from the DNC. The Census
Bureau gve me no money.'' &QL;

THE LITTLE THINGS, AS WELL AS THE BIG, AFFECT VOTERS' THINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Here is how it happened for Joyce Doty: She started
the summer already sold on George W. Bush. Then, the conventions
rolled around. Suddenly, Vice President Al Gore was looking
handsome, sounding smart and intriguing her with the idea that
``maybe he wasn't too corrupted by Clinton after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's convention performance, and subsequent stump speeches,
have given her pause. ``I started deciding that he doesn't have the
charisma,'' said Doty, who is in her 50s. ``He didn't do a good job
of bringing the issues to the front. I would say he is in danger of
losing my vote, if not overwhelmingly so.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people interviewed in six neighborhoods here _ ranging
from the exclusive suburb of Fox Chapel to the quiet working-class
corner of Carnegie to the largely Jewish Squirrel Hill _ said they
too had been experiencing epiphanic moments about their
presidential candidates in recent days, often in ways that had
caused them to rethink the way they intend to vote.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, the shifts have sprung from large single events
_ a convention speech, a tax proposal, or the candidates' choices
of running mates. But for many others, their change in thinking has
emerged from the smallest but most resonant of details, like a
well-place bottle of wine in a televised home video of Gore with
his family that made Josh Kamody suddenly decide that Gore was
``fun, someone I felt I would like as my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gregg Rosen, it was the discovery that Bush's running mate
did not favor the Head Start program that sent his vote packing.
Rebecca Hepka, 23, was more or less indifferent to the race until
she heard one of Gore's people use the term ``living wage,'' which
sent her into paroxysms of rage and made her decide to vote for
Bush. ``I don't like that term, no way,'' said Hepka, who sells
medical insurance. ``I don't want to give away all my taxes to have
other people set up for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the campaign appears to have heated up here
considerably since the political conventions, and knowledge of the
issues as well as opinions about the candidates are suddenly in
abundance. Many people interviewed agreed that the candidates had
revealed far more about themselves in recent days. In most cases,
these shifts have favored Gore, whose legendary stiffness has been
softened in many voters' eyes by a sheen of sincerity. Recent
national polls place the candidates in a dead heat, the result in
part of a postconvention bounce that pulled Gore closer, and in
some cases beyond, his rival.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, Gore was gaining some favor with people who said
they had not planned to vote at all, like Linda Kelso, a store
clerk who said that a recent visit to downtown Pittsburgh by Gore's
daughter softened her. ``It seemed sincere, like they were really
for the people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, both men have benefited from exposure. ``I was
negative on both earlier this summer,'' said Ann Hazlett, 71, a
retired social worker who lives in Fox Chapel. ``I was negative on
Bush the person and Gore the party. But I liked Bush better later
in the summer when he began to be more substantial and not such a
smarty. And while I didn't think Gore's speech was outstanding, I
felt there was sincerity there and I thought he did a good job of
distancing himself from Clinton, who I no longer think will be
telling him what to do. Really, I've warmed on them both.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, 50 people do not represent America; they do not even
represent Pittsburgh. But what was striking was that the vast
majority insisted that they rarely vote strictly along party lines,
and that they claimed to have been swayed so strongly in recent
days. Many of them said they were early supporters of Sen. John
McCain or Bill Bradley, and have started to weigh the relative
merits of what they were left with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am party-indifferent,'' said Rosen, 47, a lawyer. ``My
feelings started to evolve when Bush called the Greek people
Grecians, and my opinion of Gore had been neutral. I would say now
it is neutral to positive, largely because Bush doesn't have any
policy positions. He speaks in conceptual terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Although fewer in number, some people interviewed said that
recent days had brought them to Bush. ``I was for Bush and now I am
more so,'' said Heather Hurley, who works with Hepka selling
insurance downtown. ``I thought Gore looked better than ever but I
don't care, because Bush's tax plan is more fair. And I like what
he said last week about a strong military.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh has voted largely Democratic in recent decades,
though its suburbs are sprinkled with Republican strongholds. The
city and its suburbs are split between the 14th and 18th
Congressional Districts, where Clinton took well over 50 percent of
the vote in both 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since the decline of the steel industry, the city has struggled,
with some notable success, to establish a more varied economic
base. The city's downtown _ heavy on old-fashioned stores like
Candy Rama, where clerks wear pink smocks and much of the
merchandise is under a dollar _ has gone through a number of
revitalization plans, the latest of which calls for gutting most of
the historic storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   The city has doggedly pursued economic improvement and has tried
hard to retain its population, especially young people, who have
tended to flee in recent decades. A recent building spree includes
ballparks and a new convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Kelley, 41, and her husband, Carl Brotsker, 50,
represent emerging prosperity. The two leaned toward Bradley during
the primaries, and have spent the summer looking for cues on how to
proceed from speeches, the stock market and those who watch it, and
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Their paths have diverged at points. ``I was going to announce
to Melissa that by pain of death I would be voting for Bush,'' said
Brotsker, who lives on the city's North Side. His reason was fairly
simple. ``As my economic situation has improved, I've been more
intrigued by the Republican economic platform.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he started hearing whispers among those who handle his
investments and market prognosticators that swayed him. With some
embarrassment, he confessed that a comment of support for Gore
voiced by a money manager in an online chat swayed him greatly.
``The markets have seemed to indicate that the Bush tax cut might
be inflationary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley has had her own series of epiphanies. ``What I knew of
Gore did not impress me initially,'' said Kelley, a lawyer. ``But
he has been better at articulating his policies. It has been a long
time since I have heard a candidate say women will retain choice
regarding abortion, and that was impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Joseph I. Lieberman. ``Making a choice can be
a defining thing, an active thing,'' Kelley said. ``Gore's choice
of Lieberman gave me an indication of other types of actions he
might take. So I remain cynical, but I am happier than I had
been.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several people indicated that the candidates' choice of
a running mate was hugely influential. ``I didn't like either of
them until Gore chose Lieberman,'' said Carmen Hatcher, a systems
technician. ``I don't believe Gore is a strong leader, but
Lieberman will guide him.'' Hazlett said: ``I don't like Dick
Cheney, which I hate to think would influence me so much. And I
can't say that Lieberman would make me vote for Gore, but I have to
tell you I am surprised by how many of my friends talk about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some voters have stuck hard to one issue. ``I believe that Gore
has a better understanding about education and has shown that in
recent speeches,'' said John Bornyas, an education administrator.
``And I have gotten negative on Bush in the week since he could not
get his numbers straight. But I need to see them both in the
debates. And the truth is, there is always the Green Party.''

BUSH AND GORE STAKE VARYING BUT PLUMP CLAIMS TO FEDERAL ROLE IN
EDUCATION

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His campaign has kept careful count. When Gov.
George W. Bush goes to Springfield High School in Holland, Ohio,
outside Toledo on Thursday, he will be making his 100th visit to a
school since he began running for president 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is predictable what he will say, because he says it at almost
every stop almost every day, rain or shine, no matter the audience,
even when he has only 5 or 10 minutes to speak.
</P>
<P>
   It goes like this: ``This nation of ours must challenge what I
like to call the soft bigotry of low expectations. Every child can
learn. It starts with raising people's sights and raising
expectations and refusing to yield, refusing to accept a curriculum
that won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the Republican Congress shut down the
government in part because of the money President Clinton wanted to
spend on education, four years after Bob Dole embraced a Republican
platform that advocated abolishing the Department of Education,
Bush has made an expanded federal role in education a central
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, for his part, has responded to the
challenge on an issue that has been especially strong for Democrats
ever since President Lyndon B. Johnson got the first law on federal
aid to public schools enacted 35 years ago over the opposition of
most Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time to make revolutionary improvements in our
public schools the No. 1 priority in the nation,'' Gore declared in
a speech last week in Chicago to the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners.
</P>
<P>
   While both candidates are emphasizing education, their
approaches are quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Bush focuses on making schools more accountable for their
students' performance, and talks about the importance of local
control. The modest additional spending he proposes would go
primarily toward a program to help disadvantaged children learn to
read.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, would increase federal spending on education
by 50 percent, $115 billion over the next decade. He would have the
federal government contribute money to raise teachers' salaries _
an area Washington has always shunned _ and large amounts would be
spent on preschool programs and school construction.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate has abandoned party dogma to move to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Republican convention last month, Bush intervened
with the party's platform committee to knock out language that
called for closing the Department of Education. Instead, Bush would
expand the department's authority by giving it jurisdiction over
Head Start, the preschool program for poor children that is now in
the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also expressed a more limited advocacy of vouchers than
the conservatives of his party have. Many Republicans in Congress
would like to give all parents vouchers to help pay their
children's tuition at private schools. Bush would allow vouchers
only if a school failed for three years to make the improvements
needed to meet state standards, after repeated warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Bush, education has come of age for Republicans,'' said
Denis Doyle, a political scientist and a founder of Schoolnet.com,
a company that provides Internet services for school districts.
``On education, Mr. Bush looks more like Mr. Gore than he looks
like Mr. Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore emphasizes stiffer standards for teachers, a position not
likely to be met enthusiastically by the teachers' unions, which
are important Democratic constituents. More than 300 delegates at
the Democratic convention were members of the National Education
Association or the American Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would require all new teachers to pass qualification tests.
He would ensure that all secondary school teachers have college
majors or minors in the subjects they teach and that all primary
school teachers are trained in teaching reading. Teachers would
have to pass rigorous evaluations to keep their licenses. And
communities would be encouraged to develop procedures for
discharging poor teachers and assigning teachers to particular
schools based on expertise rather than just seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth Teasley, director of government relations for the
National Education Association, said her union was ``in perfect
alignment with the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   But her union's members might not feel that way. For example,
when Gore spoke last spring to the Michigan Education Association,
he was vigorously applauded when he described his plans for
recruiting teachers and increasing salaries. But his remarks about
making teachers more accountable were met with icy silence.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Bush's strategy has helped close a gap between
Republicans and Democrats on education. In 1988, when Bush's father
was running for president, 55 percent of those questioned in a New
York Times/CBS News poll said Democrats were more likely to improve
education; 23 percent said Republicans were. In answer to the same
question last month, the Democrats' lead narrowed, with 45 percent
of respondents favoring Democrats' chances of improving education
and 33 percent the Republicans'.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates offer a ream of specific policy proposals. Bush
would spend $1 billion a year for five years to train teachers to
diagnose and correct reading problems. Just last week, he offered
modest proposals to build and repair schools on and near military
bases and to give grants to historically black and Hispanic
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   He would penalize states with a loss of 5 percent of their
federal aid if they did not give standardized reading and math
tests to students in the third- through the eighth-grade and
publish the results.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would spend $50 billion over 10 years to provide public
preschools for all 4-year-olds and many 3-year-olds. He would offer
interest-free bonds for school construction and modernization,
provide money for raising teacher pay, award signing bonuses to
recruits and give tax credits to offset the cost of college for
students from families with incomes below about $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, given Gore's assertions in recent weeks about the
specificity of his policy proposals, his campaign was unable this
week to provide a breakdown of exactly how the $115 billion extra
he intends to spend on education over the next 10 years would be
allocated.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the precise policy proposals of the candidates are
less important than the principles they espouse. That is because
Congress develops education programs and is likely to devote
approximately the same amount of resources to education regardless
of who is president.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington's influence on public education could depend on
who is elected. Gore would have the government much more involved
in local education matters. Bush would mostly keep his hands off
except for holding schools responsible for the progress of their
students.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on education in this year's campaign, far greater
than in any recent presidential race, is odd for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, the federal government is a relatively minor player in
education compared with the state and local governments. The $23.5
billion Washington is spending this year on public schools is only
7 percent of the schools' $340 billion in total spending.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is no evidence that the public is paying
significantly more attention to education this year than in the
past. Polls have shown all year that 5 percent to 10 percent of the
voters say education is the most important problem facing the
government. About the same percentage of voters rank health care,
Social Security, Medicare or taxes first.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians often think of education as a women's issue, and
both candidates are making special appeals to women. But Frank
Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, said surveys showed
that women were no more concerned in a political sense about
education than men were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is one of those issues that fills a vacuum,''
Newport said, something for the voters and the candidates to talk
about in a year when no overriding issue like the economy or
international tensions is dominating the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also appealing to the candidates because unlike,
say, health care or taxes or trade policy, a politician's position
on education is unlikely to generate strong opposition from
commercial interests with deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly what seems to have happened this year is that Bush felt
comfortable with education as an issue, having dealt extensively
and, by most accounts, successfully with the matter as governor of
Texas, and he began promoting his positions early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has long talked about improving education. But members of
his staff acknowledged that the unusual emphasis Bush placed on the
issue was probably what led the vice president to proclaim that it
was now the nation's top priority.

CRITIC`S NOTEBOOK: SCALPEL! REAL-LIFE DRAMA! STAT!
</HEADLINE>
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 14, Tiffany should be worrying about pimples and braces. But
she is also facing a stark choice between possible infertility and
possible death. When her father presses her to explain the pain
caused by her uterine cancer, she responds in a tone conveying
daughterly indulgence and annoyance. ``It's like someone stabbing
me from inside,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her reaction and her father's restrained grief were recorded on
small digital video cameras held by television producers. So was
the moment when the surgeon called Tiffany's parents to deliver his
not very optimistic diagnosis, and so was the surgery that removed
Tiffany's uterus.
</P>
<P>
   It might once have seemed shocking to be privy to such
intimacies, but we are growing accustomed to the idea that no life
should go unexamined _ in front of a national audience. On
Wednesday night at 10 ABC News presents Tiffany's story and others
in the first episode of ``Hopkins 24/7,'' a six-part documentary
series that has captured three months of life and death at Johns
Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. The hospital gave the
producers unprecedented access to its inner workings, though not,
of course, unrestricted access. There are no segments on really
unpleasant topics like medical malpractice, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The program continues Thursday night at 10 and Wednesday nights
through Sept. 27 at 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopkins 24/7'' makes for fascinating television while
rewriting our notion of the patient-doctor privilege. Before
filming, but after obtaining permission from the Hopkins
administration, the program's producers printed up notepad-size
release forms that they could hand out like parking tickets to
patients who seemed like promising subjects. One of the producers,
Terence Wrong, told me that he was surprised at how many people
(about 85 percent, he estimates) signed away their privacy. If the
immediate celebrity conferred on ``Survivor'' contestants has a
ripple effect, we may soon see agents clamoring to represent
patients as they head for the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   Our major medical centers have increasingly doubled as stage
sets for documentary television crews. It started on cable with the
Learning Channel's ``Trauma: Life in the ER,'' the channel's
top-rated program (which New York Times Television produces for
TLC), now beginning its fifth season. A few ``Trauma'' alumni
worked on ABC's new program.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 25 TLC is adding ``Code Blue,'' filmed in Charity
Hospital in New Orleans, to its schedule, which also includes a
program called ``Paramedics,'' about emergency medical teams. On
Sept. 28 the Discovery Channel begins its ``Hospital,'' filmed at
the Duke University Medical Center, opening with the story of a man
who crashed his motorcycle while riding without his helmet and then
suffers paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s the filmmaker Frederick Wiseman pioneered the use
of cameras to examine our major institutions (including
Metropolitan Hospital in Manhattan, in the original ``Hospital'').
``Hopkins 24/7'' pays homage to Wiseman's subtle, observational
approach, but it is part of a more recent trend that combines
cinema verite with the conventions of dramatic narrative. These
real stories are carefully edited to give them a structure
especially recognizable to devotees of prime-time dramas like
``NYPD Blue'' or of course ``ER,'' with major and minor characters
and intercutting story lines. To achieve this, the ``Hopkins''
producers spent three months filming _ amassing 900 hours of
videotape _ and six months editing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the narration for ``24/7'' comes from doctors, patients
and family members. Occasionally Sylvia Chase, a correspondent for
ABC News, tersely relays scene-setting information, but off camera.
This is a welcome deviation from network newsmagazine convention,
which requires information to be filtered through on-air
correspondents whose celebrity becomes a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   The program covers an extraordinary range of medical problems
(including cancer, anorexia, brain disorders, organ transplants)
and personalities whose diversity at times seems too good to be
true (but is). In one segment we meet Dr. Michael Ain, a surgeon
and a dwarf, who candidly discusses the discrimination against him
because of his size. He specializes in operating on children and
other little people who can look at him eye to eye. In another we
meet Dr. Rick Montz, a leading oncologist (the kind your mother
might call a ``top man''). He's also a middle-aged ponytail wearer
who revels a bit too smugly in his own iconoclasm (describing
ovarian cancer as ``bad juju'').
</P>
<P>
   The first episode introduces Eddie Cornwell, a handsome surgeon
with a messianic streak. He is determined to stop the flow of
bleeding young men who stream into the Hopkins emergency room from
the streets of East Baltimore, which delivered 362 shooting victims
in one year. So he takes boys on hospital tours, giving them (and
us) a close look at what a buff fellow looks like after he has been
shot and had a colostomy. One youth, looking horrified at the man's
pulpy stomach region, mumbles, ``I'm going to stick to
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The cameras capture the adrenalin charge of the emergency room,
but also the quiet tension of patients making decisions using
information they can't possibly comprehend. In one episode, just as
a woman's 3-year-old daughter is about to undergo surgery, the
mother learns that more than half her child's brain has to be
removed, more than previously expected. The mother insists on
talking to the surgeon, and asks asks, ``What does the basal
ganglia do?'' Later the child's father gives his reason for
deciding to trust the doctor: ``I know he prays before every
surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the producers of ``24/7'' have tried to err on
the side of humanism, not exploitation. While the prime-time
newsmagazines endlessly chase the latest outrage _ no matter how
slight _ this crew has followed another journalistic tradition of
reportage that doesn't expose, but reveals.

INDIAN PREMIER'S HEALTH PROBLEMS RAISE POLITICAL CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, the
grandfatherly face of Hindu nationalism, is having health problems,
and they are creating unease here in India's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee, 75, known abroad as the man who raised fears by
ordering tests of nuclear devices two years ago, is revered at home
as a consensus builder. On Sunday, he cut short his appearance at
the national convention of his political party, the Bharatiya
Janata, and returned to New Delhi from central India. After resting
at home on Monday, he returned to work Tuesday and presided over a
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The government said in a statement on Monday that the prime
minister's doctors had advised him to stay off his feet because of
a flare-up of osteoarthritis that was causing severe pain in his
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's spokesman, H.K. Dua, said that the prime minister
would still depart on Sept. 5 for a week and a half in the United
States that will include a New York visit and an address to
Congress, as well as separate meetings with President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore and a trip to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to keep up the momentum of improved Indo-U.S.
relations,'' Dua said.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee has seemed more frail and slow-moving recently. After
he finished his Independence Day speech earlier this month, his
security men had to lift him up and carry him down from the Red
Fort ramparts. Three months ago, he canceled engagements because of
what his doctors described as a sore throat.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee may be suffering from nothing more serious than the
discomforts of old age, but rumors that he has a life-threatening
illness persist.
</P>
<P>
   His health is central to the stability of the coalition
government his party leads. He has attracted an eclectic group of
secular political allies by setting aside his party's hard-line
Hindu nationalist positions on issues like the construction of a
Hindu temple on the site of a demolished Muslim mosque. But even
more than his stance on any given issue, his accommodating style is
widely seen as the glue that holds together the oddly fitting
pieces of the coalition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent months, journalists have openly asked about the prime
minister's health. Reporters who met him on Sunday when he landed
at the airport bluntly asked if he had any serious health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee laughed and said no. During an interview last November
he gave the same answer when asked whether he was sick. First, he
burst out laughing, then said he had no grave disease. ``Age is a
serious problem,'' he added wryly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his shakiness on his feet, Vajpayee demonstrated his
firm grip on the Bharatiya Janata Party at the convention in Nagpur
in central India. His choice for party president, Bangaru Laxman,
took office this weekend. Laxman, the first party president from a
formerly untouchable caste, had not been the front-runner until the
prime minister anointed him.
</P>
<P>
   Some party leaders and members of hard-line Hindu nationalist
groups associated with the party criticized the government for
failing to protect Hindu pilgrims in Kashmir from a recent
terrorist attack. Some also said the government had been too
willing to enter negotiations with anti-India militants who want
Pakistan included in talks about the future of Kashmir. A territory
that Pakistan wants, Kashmir is India's only Muslim-majority state.
</P>
<P>
   But in brief remarks before he hurriedly left the convention,
Vajpayee warned his critics within the party not to go too far and
violate party discipline.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence Tuesday, the party unanimously adopted a
resolution supporting his decision to attempt negotiations with the
Hizbul Mujahideen in Kashmir _ talks that were aborted after Hizbul
called off its cease-fire on Aug. 8. In more belligerent tones, the
party also warned Pakistan to halt its support to militants in
Kashmir, although Pakistan denies giving such support.
</P>
<P>
   ``A clear message needs to be sent to terrorists and their
masters across the border that every Indian life is precious and
will be defended, and that indulging in cross-border terrorism
cannot continue to remain a cost-free option,'' the resolution
stated.

HYUNDAI SECURITIES GETS ANOTHER $200 MILLION FROM TWO U.S.
INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ A group of Western investors, including
Wilbur Ross, a specialist in corporate rescues, and the American
International Group, plan to increase their investment in three
financial affiliates of the Hyundai Group to $1 billion to gain a
firmer hold on Hyundai Securities, South Korea's largest brokerage
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The increased investment of $200 million, in addition to $800
million announced in June, would give the group _ which also
includes GE Capital, an American subsidiary of Aegon of the
Netherlands and Wisconsin and California pension funds _ a 23.7
percent stake in the brokerage firm. Hyundai Securities is the plum
in the deal: its profit nearly tripled in the last year to 305.2
billion won _ now almost $275 million.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign investors will face a daunting task in trying to
revive the troubled money management arm of the group. The unit,
Hyundai Investment Trust and Securities Co., has liabilities
exceeding its assets by 1.2 trillion won, or $1.08 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Like other such investment businesses in South Korea, Hyundai
Investment Trust saw its financial problems worsen after the Daewoo
Group collapsed under $80 billion of debt. Investment trusts are
the largest purchasers of corporate bonds in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Some Korean shareholder activists said Tuesday that they were
also concerned by signs that Hyundai Securities would retain its
current head, Lee Ik Chi, who in the past has been accused of
misappropriating investors' funds to prop up ailing units of the
Hyundai Group.
</P>
<P>
   If any steps were taken to ensure Lee's position, ``it would be
deeply troubling,'' said Jang Ha Sung, a prominent advocate for
minority shareholder rights and professor of business
administration at Korea University. ``No one knows what was behind
the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest business conglomerate,
is trying to reduce its $48 billion in debt by selling stakes in
its affiliates to foreign investors. Through a tangled web of
equity holdings and debt guarantees in other subsidiaries, South
Korea's giant family-run conglomerates have propped up ailing units
through cash infusions from healthier affiliates. For the Hyundai
Group, its brokerage firm served as the main source of such funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai's government-led creditors in recent weeks have stepped
up demands for restructuring in an attempt to stamp out such
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash-flow problems at Hyundai Investment Trust Securities
expanded liquidity problems to the entire group,'' said Kim Kyoung
Won, a spokesman for Hyundai Securities, which owns a 24.2 percent
stake in the Hyundai Investment Trust. ``But through the AIG
investment, this problem has been solved.''

AN ESCAPE TO EDEN ON VANCOUVER ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOOKE, British Columbia _ Sinclair and Frederique Philip make an
unlikely pair. She comes from Cannes, on the lush Cote d'Azur; he
grew up on the spare Canadian plains. He likes fish; she likes
meat. He is reserved, ironic and intellectual, an international
economist by trade; she has an earth-motherly warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, together they took a white clapboard house, built in 1928
on a lonely promontory on timber-clad Vancouver Island, facing the
Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Olympic Mountains of Washington
State beyond it, and in 21 years turned the place into an enticing
and idiosyncratic retreat for epicures.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sooke Harbour House is one of Canada's half-dozen best
restaurants, and it has a kitchen garden unlike any other in North
America _ more than two acres of herbs, vegetables and edible
flowers, many of them rarities, gradually devouring the lawns
around the house, tumbling down to the sea, scaling hillsides in
every direction, a living tapestry of leaf, shrub and color.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberous begonias with blossoms the size of dinner plates fill
baskets and window boxes, and a few petals are plucked each day to
flavor the mignonette sauce served with freshly opened local
oysters. A climbing fig twines around a dining alcove and provides
fruit in the fall. Aromatic lemon verbena and jaunty nasturtiums
grow in profusion close to the house, adding a sweet scent and
flashes of bright color to the many pleasures of Sooke. Herbal teas
are made from verbena, and nasturtium blossoms enliven salads.
</P>
<P>
   Bergamot and borage flowers, two Philip favorites, will not soon
supplant salt and pepper, but they and other products of the garden
contribute not only subtle flavors but also an element of surprise
to the menu, helping to accomplish the mission of serving only
seasonal, organic food produced or harvested in British Columbia.
People come here, Philip told me, ``for the Canadian experience,''
whether they come from Canada, the American Northwest or farther
afield.
</P>
<P>
   So you will find no caviar and no mangoes at Sooke Harbour
House, because none are produced in the province. But I'll wager
you won't miss them _ not with line-caught sockeye salmon,
trap-caught black cod and Dungeness crab fished out of the waters
of Sooke Inlet; not with roast leg of suckling kid raised by a
local farmer and lobster mushrooms and chanterelles foraged in the
rain forest; not with West Coast mussels, plus marine exotica like
gooseneck barnacles and limpets, all of them gathered by hand from
rock-strewn beaches nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where I go,'' said Edward Tuson, the 36-year-old
head chef, ``Nepal and India, Malaysia, Vancouver, I end up coming
back here. I have total freedom, as long as I play by Sinclair's
rules and keep it local. I invent something, fuss with it, change
the menu every day. There's this fabulous garden, there's a network
of farmers, and I have a fisherman who wakes me at 8, 8:30, every
morning, calling to tell me what's best in the day's catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to 100 people eat here each night, in two big,
alabaster-white dining rooms, one with a huge fireplace, both with
big windows framing the vista of sea and sky. The rooms are
decorated with the work of local artists, commissioned by Philip
(and with whimsical gifts from grateful diners: People send
miniature hats _ straw for summer, wool for winter _ for the duck
decoys on the mantlepiece).
</P>
<P>
   Candles burn in the chandeliers. The window in one door is
shaped like a crab. Like the whole place, the dining rooms are
casual, unpretentious, very much in harmony with the rugged
surroundings, but totally professional.
</P>
<P>
   Self-taught the key players may be, but this is no amateur hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Philip met in 1967 at a party in Nice given by a
friend of hers. He had just arrived from Canada, to work on his
French before heading to Africa. He never got there. They lived in
Aix-en-Provence for a while, then at Grenoble, where he studied
economics, and then in Toronto. On a business trip, he came upon
Sooke Harbour House and decided to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 years, the Philips lived in the basement with their
children and worked upstairs. Making the place go took a kind of
manic concentration and energy, and three years ago, just when they
had almost paid off the mortgage, but not quite, they took out a
new, bigger one to expand the inn to 28 bedrooms. He is now 53, she
52, and the staff, all recruited locally, has grown from three to
80.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sinclair,'' Philip said, ``does his research on anything the
same way as he did the research for his Ph.D. at Grenoble, so when
he decided to start the garden, he read everything in print on
herbs and edible flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the choicest things Philip grows were brought here, in
the form of seed or seedlings from commercial nurseries. That is
the case with the tiny, seductively perfumed woodland strawberries
the French call fraises des bois, as well as the Mabel Grey
geraniums from South Africa, whose leaves have a lemon-lime scent _
a little like Sprite.
</P>
<P>
   But he has learned a lot from the Northwest Indian tribes that
have lived on Vancouver Island since time immemorial and from
people who study them, like Nancy Turner, an ethnobotanist at the
University of British Columbia. They taught him about cooking with
the tender young needles of the fir tree and about many of the sea
creatures that live on the beaches and in the tidal pools. One of
the inn's most talented foragers is Carol Planes, an Indian, who
regularly clambers down slippery rocks to gather shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have been eating this stuff forever,'' Philip
said. ``You listen to them, and you learn.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Early clients blanched at things they were offered to eat.
Philip remembers people asking, ``How can you eat those bitter
greens?'' Philip was often asked to taste a dish first, in a
customer's presence, to demonstrate that it was actually edible.
</P>
<P>
   You still see perplexed looks on people's faces when they sit
down to their first meal and read a menu entry like this one:
``Gooseneck barnacle terrine with grand fir and calendula petal
emulsion, bull kelp pickle and sea cucumber.'' But they soon learn
that weird as it may sound, it tastes like the very essence of the
sea. It tastes like Japan. It tastes very good.
</P>
<P>
   With it and the other inventive dishes on the menu come wines
from a 91-page list _ wines from France and Australia and Italy,
Germany and California and Oregon, including runs of older vintages
of Stag's Leap Cask 23 and Silver Oak cabernet sauvignons; Grange
shiraz from South Australia and choice, scarce Leonettis from
Washington. On top of that, there are intriguing wines from
Vancouver Island itself, as well as the Okanagan Valley, British
Columbia's premier viticultural area.
</P>
<P>
   But the magic of Sooke Harbour House lies in more than its table
and its cellar. The setting is remarkable, with fog and mist
swirling in from the sea, sometimes lying like a duvet on the
harbor. Clearing and clouding over several times a day, the sky
first reveals and then obscures the mountains, like some cosmic
theatrical curtain rising and falling. And all the while, sea lions
and orca whales frolic offshore while ospreys and loons circle
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms, each different, each decorated with Indian and other
local art, are the spacious balcony seats for this spectacle. Most
have fireplaces and refrigerators; each gets its ration of two big
sugar cookies every day.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of place that defies a person to get or stay
uptight. I went planning to catch up on some reading and writing,
but I failed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Philip daughters, Nishka, 19, gave me a running
commentary one morning when I tagged along behind her as she
gathered flower petals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' she said, pointing to some chivelike stems topped with
purple flowers, ``is called `society' garlic, because it's not
supposed to get on your breath or anything. But I have my doubts,
eh? These orange flowers you see everywhere are pot marigolds, or
calendulas. They bloom all year, throughout the calendar, which is
where they get their name. The breakfast people put them in cheese
biscuits, to make the biscuits taste twice as cheesy. Long ago,
they were used to color Cheddar.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would guess where flavors lurk in the garden? Day lily
flowers go into sorbet, carnation petals are added to salads, and
sweet woodruff, an herb with a perky white flower, long used by
Central Europeans in wine punches, is used at Sooke in ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   No culinary use has been found yet for the passionflower vine
that grows along the eaves on one side of the house. It is a pet of
Nishka's, not only because of its pretty, complex purple-blue
flowers, but also because it spreads so exuberantly. ``You can hear
it growing,'' she assured me with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther along, Nishka stopped at two groups of plants,
side by side, which looked identical to me. To her, too, as it
turned out. A book I found later in the house identified one as
Korean mint (Agastache rugosa), which smells like root beer, and
the other, a cousin, as anise hyssop (Agastache foeniculum), which
has a slight licorice flavor. That night, my wife, Betsey, and I
had a sauce subtly flavored with anise hyssop, among other things,
on a piece of black cod. Another night, a small packet of black cod
arrived in a crab and corn broth, flavored with shingeku, or
chrysanthemum leaves.
</P>
<P>
   In both dishes, it was the fresh, sweet taste and the firm,
slightly springy texture of the fish that hit you at first bite.
Only slowly did the herbal flavors assert themselves, adding an
unanticipated contrast.
</P>
<P>
   A gray, gawky cardoon plant grew into a tree near a cluster of
borage plants _ ``borage for the bees,'' Nishka said, ``they love
it.'' So do Englishmen, I told her; they put whole stalks of the
stuff into the Pimms' Cup they like to drink at Wimbledon or after
a cricket match. Across the way, she pointed to a hedge of hops,
grown not for beer but for the delicate young spring shoots, which
the Belgians (and also the Philips) cook like asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   In a shady spot at the foot of the hedge some fernlike sweet
cicely was doing nicely. Some of it was destined for a mild
sabayon, also flavored with ginger and white peaches, which Tuson
served us on superbly briny sea urchin roe he had taken from the
shell a mere five minutes before we ate it.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Cook, head gardener for 13 years, grows all sorts of salad
crops, including shiso, the hauntingly flavored Japanese leaf, and
arugula and red romaine and Red Sails lettuce. Most of them are
planted in raised beds, so the soil can more easily be renewed with
compost, as successive crops are harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's is more or less a year-round operation. It seldom snows
at Sooke, which lies in hardiness Zone 8, the same as Charleston,
S.C., a beneficiary of benign Pacific breezes and currents. A few
of the tenderer plants, like verbena, are lifted from the soil and
kept inside for the brief winter, and cuttings are taken of others
to start fresh plants when spring arrives.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the lettuces, the pansies, the English daisies and
the hardier herbs (like an 11-foot rosemary bush outside one of the
guest rooms) keep right on chugging, year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything flourishes at Sooke. It took Cook a half-dozen
tries to establish Mexican marigolds, which have a flavor similar
to tarragon, and even in this cosseted corner of the Pacific, dill
gets scraggly and sun-hungry basil doesn't grow very tall.
Reassuring, I guess, for us brown-thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   SWEET LAVENDER, MAPLE SYRUP AND CARROT ICE MILK
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Sooke Harbour House
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 40 minutes, plus freezing time
</P>
<P>
   For the carrot puree:
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds organic carrots, trimmed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh organic rosemary or 2 tablespoons dried
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unfiltered organic apple juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   For the ice milk:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups 2 percent milk
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons fresh or dried organic lavender flowers or a 2-inch
cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   8 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   { cup maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   \ cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   \ cup brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce brandy, Cognac, rye or rum.
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare carrot puree, combine carrots, rosemary, apple
juice and brown sugar in a medium nonreactive saucepan. Place over
high heat until simmering, then cover, and reduce heat to
medium-low. Cook until carrots are soft, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove
from heat, and set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a food processor, puree the carrots with any remaining
juice. Process until the puree is very smooth, about 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. To prepare ice milk, combine carrot puree, milk and lavender
in a medium saucepan. Place mixture over medium heat until it just
reaches a simmer. Remove from heat, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a medium nonreactive bowl, combine egg yolks, maple syrup,
granulated sugar and brown sugar. Heat mixture over a double
boiler, whisking until it is thick and light in color, about 15
minutes. Remove from heat, and place a strainer over mixture. Pour
in carrot puree, stirring and pressing with a rubber spatula until
puree passes through into egg mixture.
</P>
<P>
   5. Return double boiler to heat. Whisk until mixture is steaming
and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes.
Remove from heat, and whisk occasionally as it cools. (If mixture
begins to curdle, pour into a blender and process until smooth.)
</P>
<P>
   6. When mixture has cooled, stir in brandy. Freeze in an
ice-cream maker, according to manufacturer's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 1{ quarts (about 6 servings).

THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED LABOR DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA BELKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The time has come to stock up on pens and notebooks
and index cards.
</P>
<P>
   No, I don't mean back-to-school supplies. I mean back-to-work
supplies. My apologies to Julius Caesar and Dick Clark, but the
real year _ the work year _ begins in September. Which means its
just about time (don't panic, you have until next week) for our
collective brains to click back into gear.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this was a dud of a summer in New York _ wet and cold, and
even the lifeguards never had a tan. Even so, it was summer.
</P>
<P>
   Years of conditioning, from grade school through grad school,
have led us to expect that the summer should feel different, and
because we expect it, it is so. We arrive at work later, leave
earlier, take long weekends. Even rush hour comes at different
times.
</P>
<P>
   Those responsible for our mental health set the pace and lead
the way. I have just started work on a magazine article that
requires interviewing a lot of psychiatrists, and although I placed
calls to two dozen of them last week, I have yet to actually reach
a single one.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, businesses are rearranging themselves around
this ebb in the calendar. The owners of We Take the Cake, a
mail-order bakery based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., analyzed their
orders and saw a significant dip in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are traveling, businesses don't have events going on,''
says Kathy Guerke, who owns the company with her husband, Andy. And
then there's the added problem of customers who diet to fit into
their swimsuits. This year the Guerkes closed shop completely for
two weeks in July, leaving on vacation for the first time since
they opened three years ago. (They took a busman's holiday to the
South of France, where they ate a lot of desserts.)
</P>
<P>
   On their return, they cut back their hours, closing every day at
2 p.m. ``The summer schedule will probably last until November,''
said Guerke, who was just back from playing tennis at 3 p.m. one
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Buckley is a senior vice president and partner of Empower
Media Marketing, a marketing-services agency based in Cincinnati
(where, by the way, the weather was beautiful this summer). Her
company is too busy to shut down completely, she says, but has done
other things to ``make it up to our employees'' who would really
rather be outside. Every Wednesday from June through August there
is a catered lunch out on the patio. Each Thursday a truck with a
water tank comes to the parking lot and washes employees' cars,
courtesy of the company. Fridays are half days, Buckley says,
because very little work is done on Friday afternoons. ``Why bother
making calls,'' she asks, ``when all you do is reach people's phone
mail?''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, workers who beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work harder in August than I do in September, that's for
sure,'' said Len Ferber, co-chairman of the technology group at the
law firm of Katten, Muchin &AMP; Zavis in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly sounded tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a client is going on vacation,'' he says, ``he's either
going to give you a lot of work to finish by the time he leaves, so
he can tell his boss, `I got this done, I got that done,' or else
he's going to give you a lot of work to finish while he's on
vacation so it's ready when he gets back.''
</P>
<P>
   In a roundabout way, I'd argue, this proves my point. Ferber is
working so hard this summer because his clients are not.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, I was writing a book proposal over the
summer, and my agent was urging me to hurry so that she could send
it to publishers come September. (I should note that these pep
talks to write faster never came on Friday afternoons because she
closed her office on Fridays during the summer.) September, she
warned, was the only time anyone completed any real work in
publishing. Come October, it seems, everyone is distracted by the
Frankfurt book fair. In November, there's Thanksgiving, followed by
a month of parties, meaning no one can concentrate until the New
Year. The doldrums of January and February are, well, doldrums,
interrupted in March by another booksellers convention, this one in
London. Then there's spring break _ planning for it, then
recovering from it _ and before you can click on your Palm Pilot,
it's Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Labor Day, aptly named because we are about
to embark on the only few productive weeks of the year. Now sharpen
those No. 2 pencils. You're going back to work.

FRENCH CABINET SPLIT OVER CORSICAN AUTONOMY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BONIFACIO, Corsica _ In perhaps the most daring initiative of
his three years in office, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France
has won widespread backing in Corsica for a plan to end decades of
separatist violence in this Mediterranean island. But his proposal
for limited autonomy for Corsicans has caused a crisis in his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Chevenement, long a pivotal figure in Jospin's
Socialist-led coalition, stepped down as interior minister on
Tuesday. He has argued for several weeks that the Corsica plan
threatens ``the unity of France'' and could bring dangerous demands
for special treatment from other French with strong regional
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's strategy, praised by some as the best chance of peace
in a generation, is now also drawing fire from other sides,
including nationalists in the Gaullist Party and the extreme
rightist National Front, which says Paris is giving away too much.
Radical Corsicans want more concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The mood here in Corsica is one of nervous anticipation. A
religious precession winding through the narrow town of Bonifacio
on Tuesday was officially dedicated to St. John the Baptist, but
the prayers were for peace. While polls indicate that a large
majority of Corsicans welcome Jospin's plan, many people fear more
violence. Since the plan was approved by the Corsican Assembly in
late July, extremists here have assassinated a moderate Corsican
politician and set off a new wave of bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the political storm over Corsica has put a sudden end
to the normally sleepy August vacation period. It has also
highlighted how Corsica continues to be an intractable problem for
French governments. To Corsican extremists, anything short of full
independence is a sellout; to French nationalists, any concession
to Corsica would set the stage for unraveling the French
nation-state.
</P>
<P>
   For Jospin, it was clearly embarrassing to find an important
cabinet member opposing his plan, which would give Corsica limited
rights to pass its own laws beginning in 2004. It would have been
Chevenement's task as interior minister to present and defend the
plan in the National Assembly later this year, something he was not
willing to do as a staunch defender of France's highly centralized
political system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Following his resignation Tuesday, Chevenement said that the
Jospin plan ``is a threat to the very definition of France.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Next we might imagine seeing a Basque or a Breton
Parliament,'' he added. ``The law must be the same for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Jospin reportedly tried in vain to keep his ally by his side by
offering him other cabinet posts. The two men have been friends for
more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The outspoken Chevenement, 61, has had famous clashes with his
colleagues before: he resigned in protest as minister of industry
under President Francois Mitterrand in 1983 and walked out as
defense minister in 1991 because he opposed France's participation
in the Persian Gulf war and sided with Iraq. Daniel Vaillant,
another close associate of Jospin and the current minister for
relations with Parliament, was named the new interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   Corsicans seemed somewhat befuddled by the high-level squabble
over their fate. The newspaper Corse Matin announced the cabinet
shake-up with large headlines and cartoons, while some locals
expressed concern over the change. ``All we want is peace and we
thought we were getting there, but who knows now,'' said Anna
Alberti, leaving church this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in France, people have been growing impatient with the
waves of violence and the failed attempts to bring peace to this
island, where separatist demands are pressed by only a tiny
minority. While the Corsica issue attracts little interest in the
outside world, this rocky island of no more than 250,000 people
frequently forces itself onto the Paris agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, in recent decades Corsica has been to France what
the Basque region has been to Spain and Northern Ireland has been
to Britain. But while Britain has relatively little emotional
attachment to Northern Ireland and Spain has already granted
considerable Basque autonomy, Corsica strikes a more complex
historical chord in France.
</P>
<P>
   Although the island only became part of France in 1768, it was
Corsica's most famous son, Napoleon Bonaparte, who did most to
smother regional identities and centralize power in Paris. The
notion of France as a nation, although its inhabitants are not
ethnically homogeneous, stems from the concept born in that era
that they all subscribe to the same principles of French
nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of the 20th century, with France receiving
waves of Christian European immigrants, the country's educational
system turned them into Frenchmen within a generation. Over the
past 30 years, though, with the influx of Arab immigrants, cultural
and religious differences, and the sheer numbers, have made
integration more difficult. Already alarmed by the emergence of
this new multiethnic French identity, many French nationalists fear
that the Corsica plan would formalize the idea of different kinds
of French citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, during a previous attempt to settle the island's
troubles, the French Senate rejected a constitutional amendment
that would have referred to the Corsican ``people.'' Now, those who
criticize Jospin's plan fear that it would be another way of
recognizing a separate ``people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some opposition stems from the belief _ both on the mainland and
on Corsica _ that many of the separatists have links to organized
crime and are themselves engaged in criminal activity.

HER SPOT ON OLYMPIC TEAM NOW SECURE, SERENA WILLIAMS DEFENDS OPEN
TITLE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ White lines marked off the court inside Arthur Ashe
Stadium, but Serena Williams arrived to defend her U.S. Open title
as if she was stepping out onto a dance floor, wearing a party
dress from a Woodstock reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In a black mesh outfit cut low and high, with a fuchsia-colored
tie-dyed print curving along provocative lines, Williams scrambled
to put away points in hot-pink Pumas. But as impossible as she was
to miss during her 6-3, 6-2 bludgeoning of Tina Pisnik on Tuesday,
Williams managed to camouflage herself less than an hour later. In
a hallway outside of an interview room, Williams slipped inside of
a vestibule, where she went unnoticed as Lisa Raymond exited an
adjacent door and walked past her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to run into her,'' Williams admitted a few
minutes later. ``Obviously, she's probably still not feeling great.
It was a tough one to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams wasn't talking about a match. Just a week earlier,
Raymond's lawyer argued in front of an arbitrator in Manhattan that
she _ and not Williams _ had earned the right as the No. 1 doubles
player to represent the United States on the four-woman Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the U.S. Tennis Association had selected the top
doubles player to be the fourth person on the team. But this time,
the coach Billie Jean King went against precedent and chose on
singles rankings alone. And although arbitrator Richard Jeydel
called the USTA's selection process unclear and misleading, he
ruled that Williams would remain on the team with Lindsay
Davenport, sister Venus Williams and Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was devastating to Raymond. And perhaps most
upsetting to her the fact that King, famous for fighting injustices
against women, didn't come to her defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely an irony to that,'' Raymond said after
dismissing Magdalena Grzybowska 6-1, 6-0, on the Grandstand Court
on Tuesday. ``Billie got her Dream Team.''
</P>
<P>
   America has a group capable of sweeping the medals, right down
to the powerful doubles combo of Venus and Serena Williams. This is
the intimidating team King wanted to assemble, the popular players
the USTA needs to promote the sport and the group NBC must be
thrilled to have in order to boost the Olympic television ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It's win-win for everyone but the unassuming Raymond, a career
wallflower on the Tour. Although Raymond is a top-25 singles player
and dominant in doubles, she is more solid than sizzle on the
tennis scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great we have the Williams sisters,'' Raymond
said. ``I think it's great we have the Anna Kournikova's, the
rivalries with the Williamses and Lindsay and Martina Hingis. You
would just hope when you're making a decision like this, that would
be put aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the attention-getters on the women's tour, Serena
Williams may be the hottest product. She is the one who rang the
opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday morning, the
one with a doll created in her stylish image and the defending
champion who turned everyone's head in her first-round match
Tuesday. With overhead smashes that sent the crowd flinching at her
might, with blistering forehands that clipped the lines, her
powerful game was on display. And so was her taste in a tennis
dress she helped design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how well _ how good I look, how well in shape I am,''
said Williams with a sly smile. ``It's just really flattering, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the men will wear dresses next. As a sign of how anonymous
the men's tour has become, there was barely a buzz in Arthur Ashe
Stadium when second-seeded Gustavo Kuerten was upset in four sets
by Wayne Arthurs.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the tour's best hope to fill the void that will soon be
created when Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi leave the stage. Here
was the charismatic Brazilian with the colorful style and telegenic
game. Here was the one player the tour had heavily featured when
officials kicked off a marketing campaign with the slogan ``New
Balls, Please'' in an effort to promote the young stars.
</P>
<P>
   But the instant Arthurs slashed an ace by Kuerten on match
point, the moment the curly-haired French Open winner dropped his
head in defeat, the marketing campaign aimed at their American
audience during the Open suffered a humiliating hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I said to them, I don't want to be promoted,'' said
Kuerten, who is an icon in Brazil. ``I'm already too much promoted.
I want to be unknown. I don't want to go and people recognize me
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some players are more comfortable with attention that others.
Serena Williams seems to revel in it. At times during her match
against Pisnik, she turned ordinary points into theater. Instead of
a simple overhead, she cracked her racket like a whip as she
crushed the ball for winners. Instead of giving up on a well-placed
passing shot by the Slovene, she raced against the odds to reach
it, if only to extend the point one stroke longer.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Williams put on a show for those assembled in
Arthur Ashe Stadium, the site of her first _ and, so far, only _
Grand Slam title one year ago. If Williams feels any pressure from
the hype around her, she isn't letting on. When told that John
McEnroe was quoted as saying a good male college player or senior
player could beat her, she just grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a piece of me?'' Williams said, playfully challenging
McEnroe. ``Obviously, men are stronger than women. He can throw
down if he wants. I don't know. Who knows? It's interesting. It
would be interesting to see where we stand on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Any match with Williams is usually quite a sight. Tuesday,
everyone was riveted to one of the tour's top entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems wherever I go, there's a lot of attention on me,
anyway,'' Williams said. ``It's like I'm used to it. It really
doesn't change with the new outfit, the dolls, Stock Exchange bell.
I'm kind of used to a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   She can disappear when she wants, too. Raymond never saw
Williams as she walked down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a really nice girl,'' said Williams, who was an
unwitting participant thrown into the selection fray. ``She made it
clear that she wasn't bringing the case against me; she just
thought she should be able to go. It's completely understandable.''

 LOBBYISTS AND TECHIES FIND A COMMON THEME: LET THEM EAT STEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the old days, before Microsoft met the Justice
Department, high-tech companies could not tell a lobbyist from a
congressman. Hint: one wears tasseled loafers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the lobbyists and the high-tech executives are so tight they
have gone into business together. This week, the Caucus Room, a
steakhouse, opens in downtown Washington under 65 partners whose
rosters of political connections, high-tech interests, and in some
cases both, are longer than a Manhattan wine list.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas H. Boggs Jr., a prominent lobbyist, and Haley Barbour,
former chairman of the Republican National Committee and now in the
lobbying business, hold the largest shares, $150,000 each. Ted
Leonsis, a top executive at American Online, and Jon Ledecky of
E2Enet are on the list.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bipartisan bunch: Terry McAuliffe, President Clinton's
top fund-raiser; C. Boyden Gray, a former counsel to President Bush
and now with the law firm Wilmer, Cutler &AMP; Pickering; Thomas
Downey, a former Democratic congressman and now a lobbyist; Richard
Burt, the former ambassador to Germany; and Frank Luntz, a
Republican pollster. Even the Senate sergeant-at-arms, James
Ziglar, has a share in the $3.3 million federal-style restaurant
with mahogany paneling and marble floors, not so subtle reminders
of the hallowed halls of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, opening a restaurant seems an unlikely
get-rich-quick scheme. The failure rate is high. But the Caucus
Room quickly became the hottest investment in town and was
oversubscribed in four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like an IPO,'' said Boggs, but one about
contacts, not money. ``It's a downtown watering hole and a place to
make deals,'' he said. ``And it's time for the techies and
politicians to realize they are in the same world. Pre-Microsoft,
techies thought Washington wasn't something they had to worry
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Raoul Fernandez, founder, chairman and chief executive officer
of Proxicom Inc., an Internet company that does business with the
Fortune 500 companies, agrees. ``All tech companies have a level of
sensitivity to educating the Hill,'' said Fernandez, who once
worked for Jack Kemp, a former Republican congressman from New York
and Bob Dole's running mate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an issue right now that I have to have Tommy or
Haley help me out, but I want to stay in touch with those people,''
Fernandez said, adding he could not think of a better way to stay
in touch than investing in their political hangout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted and Jon and I are in this from a business standpoint,''
Fernandez said. ``It's going to provide meeting rooms that are not
available today. I hope being an equity owner will move me up the
list when I need one of those rooms.'' Fernandez has invested
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   And for a lobbyist, owning a restaurant where lobbyists take
their clients sounds like a perfect set up. As John F. Jonas, a
partner in Boggs' firm, Patton Boggs, and a partner in the
restaurant, explained it: ``You are billing them for your time, and
they pay for the meal. In that way it's sort of a sweetheart
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the partners say they are also in it for the status.
``People probably invest in restaurants for the same reason they
invest in thoroughbreds or race cars,'' Jonas said. ``It has
panache to be able to say I have an interest in a restaurant.
Hopefully, the people in the restaurant will be a little nicer to
you. You won't have to beg for a table or sit in the back corner
and have the kitchen door slam into you.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonsis, who burst on to the Washington scene when he bought the
city's hockey team, the Capitals, and a minority interest in its
basketball team, the Wizards, said in an e-mail message that he
became a partner because he ``needed a place to be assured of
having some privacy when I dine with partners such as Michael
Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Becoming a partner in a restaurant was on my list of
101 things to do before I die.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbour hoots at what he calls this ``psychic benefit stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My psychoanalysis is a little dull from drinking bourbon for
40 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One might ask whether Washington actually needs another
steakhouse. But for lobbyists, apparently, you cannot have too many
steak houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food will be good but it won't be the finest French
restaurant,'' Jonas said. But, he added: ``I don't think a great
French restaurant would be a hangout for politicians and lobbyists
because many of them are not of the fine French ilk. Steak is safe
food. You don't have to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But you do have to think about how much. Surf and turf at the
Caucus Room will cost $59.

AS RACISM CONFERENCE IN SOUTH AFRICA OPENS, DIVISIONS STILL
PREVAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The poor of South Africa made their
way from remote farms and rural villages last month to testify
before government hearings around the country. And in their
painstaking accounts of modern-day wrongs, there rang disturbing
echoes of this country's ugly history.
</P>
<P>
   In Coligny, black patients spoke of doctors who still keep
segregated waiting rooms. In Orkney, police officers complained
about supervisors who bar blacks from sharing toilets or spoons
with white colleagues. And in Bloemfontein, black students
described how white classmates hurled condoms filled with water at
them.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, this country's simmering anxieties over racism
have flared as President Thabo Mbeki and Tony Leon, the leader of
the predominantly white opposition, have exchanged bitter words,
and the president has publicly accused Leon of being a racist.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is preparing to hold a national conference on
racism this week, and the testimony from the hearings offers an
intimate look into how racism still touches lives beyond the
headlines and political squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of black people testified, with most complaining about
racial slurs and discrimination in hiring and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   But in rural provinces, a troubling number also described
vicious crimes and places where the rules of apartheid seemingly
remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings were in preparation for the conference, which is to
be opened by Mbeki on Wednesday, in the hope that a public airing
of the problems will unite the country in a battle against hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spoken about reconciliation and we have spoken about
nation-building, but we have never as a nation spoken about
confronting our racist past, and how we move forward and deal with
racism,'' said Pansy Tlakula, a member of the Human Rights
Commission, which is coordinating the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But talk of the conference has highlighted the divisions in this
racially polarized society. The conference has been welcomed by
some and disparaged by others, with supporters and naysayers
falling on predictable sides of the color line.
</P>
<P>
   Of the hundreds who attended the public hearings, only a handful
were white. The rights commission is often dismissed by whites as
being biased against them.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Mine Workers Union, which represents 65,000
Afrikaners in mining, telecommunications and electrical
engineering, plan to picket the conference, saying it fails to
address the racism that white employees now experience in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   While Vusi Mona, a columnist for The City Press who is black,
praised the conference as an ``opportunity to deal with racism
candidly,'' Solomon Jacobovsky described it in a letter to the
editor published Tuesday in The Citizen as a waste of precious
taxpayer dollars. ``What, if anything, have these undertakings
achieved?'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no indication that the conference will ease
tensions between the leading politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Leon denounced Mbeki's insistence on searching for
African solutions to the AIDS epidemic, saying his efforts
represented little more than ``snake-oil cures and quackery.''
</P>
<P>
   The president responded by attacking Leon as ``willing to
enunciate an entrenched white racism that is a millennium old.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to him, a politician who practices his craft on the
African continent, these solutions, because they are African, could
not but consist of the pagan, savage, superstitious and
unscientific responses,'' said Mbeki, who is financing local
scientists in their search for an AIDS vaccine but who has been
criticized for embracing theories about AIDS disparaged by most
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and academics have urged the two men to stop their
quarrel and to find common ground. And while there has been no hint
that tensions between them are easing, the public hearings did
offer tentative signs of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Nel, one of the few whites to testify at rights commission
hearings, said he was pleased that his children were growing up in
an integrated world. And Tlotlo Mokoke, a 9-year-old schoolboy,
testified that in his class white children and black children share
food and toys.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Simpson, the executive director of the Center for the
Study of Violence and Reconciliation, said the conference was a
good idea, although he was doubtful that it would have much
influence on the lives of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real risk that it stays quite a lot of hot air for
most people,'' he added. ``But at the same time, it's an absolutely
central issue. It's very obvious that racism is alive and well.''

MARKET PLACE: TRANSMETA'S IPO 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, a semiconductor company called Transmeta promised to
make laptop computer batteries that would last a full workday.
Though it is still months away from its planned delivery date,
Transmeta has since signed deals with prominent computer makers,
including IBM and Sony, and has filed for an initial offering of
its stock.
</P>
<P>
   That public stock offering is widely expected to get a blazing
reception, despite a market far cooler to new technology offerings
than last year's. After all, the company is backed by two prominent
billionaire investors, the financier George Soros and Paul Allen,
co-founder of Microsoft. Its star employee is Linus Torvalds, the
30-year-old native of Finland who created the free Linux operating
system and who is revered by many young programmers. And its Crusoe
processors promise to be contenders in a rapidly growing market for
laptops and mobile computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some professional investors are not too optimistic about
how the dust will settle after the offering. They point out that
the devices with Transmeta processors have not yet reached the
public, and the company has recorded $119.4 million in losses in
just over five years. And then there is Intel. Though technology
analysts believe Transmeta's technology will have advantages in the
mobile computing market, Intel has proved a fierce competitor time
and again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Torvalds' presence, Transmeta is not a company whose
business is based around the Linux operating system; it is a
semiconductor company that plans to use Linux in conjunction with
some of its chip designs. Nonetheless, some analysts and money
managers raise the specter of slumping Linux-related stocks when
talking about Transmeta. After huge public offerings last year,
shares of Red Hat and VA Linux Systems have lost in excess of 70
percent each this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a hot IPO with a big valuation,'' said
Christopher J. Bonavico, who manages two technology-driven mutual
funds with about $620 million in assets for the insurer
Transamerica. Bonavico does not plan on participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing in nifty technology is very dangerous,'' he added.
``Look where Red Hat is now. You could say I would've bought it and
then sold it, but someone always gets left holding the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Kumar, a semiconductor analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray, was even more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, there was a lot of hype, which has since died
down,'' he said. ``I don't think you can classify their approach as
revolutionary. I don't think the niches Intel is leaving unfilled
are big enough to establish a business model. When your competitor
is Intel, it's a risky proposition. Previous attempts to find
chinks in their armor have failed.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, William P. Savoy, president of Vulcan Ventures,
Allen's venture capital firm, called Transmeta ``one of the most
exciting hardware investments we've ever made.'' He added, ``It's
so appropriate to bring this technology out when the world is
moving to lower and lower power-consumption devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Venu Reddy, a semiconductor analyst at the fund manager Waddell
&AMP; Reed, which did not invest in Transmeta in the private market,
said his firm would likely participate in the offering, even though
he did not believe the Crusoe processor was as groundbreaking as
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you use the Transmeta processor doesn't mean your
battery power will be improved by leaps and bounds,'' he said.
Still, ``even if Transmeta gets 5 percent of the market, we can
make a lot of money,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry that analysts estimate at $40 billion a year, a
new company might not need a leading role to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But Transmeta has high expectations for a company that has yet
to see products with its semiconductors hit the market. The date of
its offering, which has Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as the lead
underwriter, has not been set, nor has a price range. But Transmeta
seeks to raise $200 million for 10 percent of its company,
according to people close to the company, giving it an implied
valuation of $2 billion. At that price, it would need about $128
million in annual sales to achieve a price-to-sales ratio
comparable to that of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta has a built-in audience, the technophiles that are
fans of Torvalds and are curious about Transmeta's chip design,
which uses software for functions that conventional chips do with
transistors. That, in conjunction with other design features, will
allow laptop batteries to run for up to eight hours, instead of two
to four, the company has said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the company unveiled its technology at a heavily attended
press conference in January, Transmeta labored under a veil of
silence and nondisclosure agreements. It was not even entirely
clear it could be called a semiconductor company. The approach only
inflamed curiosity about the company, which was incorporated in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a huge amount of interest, and not just
because Linus is a part of it,'' said Jeff Bates, the executive
editor of Slashdot.org, a popular online journal for technology
enthusiasts that is a unit of VA Linux. ``A lot of people are
curious about how Crusoe works.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates and the site's other editors have posted dozens of stories
chronicling each twist and turn in Transmeta's development,
analyzing the company's patents for clues and posting articles with
titles like ``Another Peep from Transmeta.'' Readers have responded
with thousands of messages.
</P>
<P>
   Before January, rumors on Slashdot had Transmeta collaborating
with the National Security Agency (not true), devising new uses for
Linux (true), and plotting the destruction of the world (not true).
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was, what has Linus Torvalds been working on in
the lab for all these years?'' said Charles Rutstein, an analyst at
the technology consulting firm Forrester Research. ``Now that's
been answered and people are waiting for proof. Show me the
devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutstein, who sees the merits of the company's technology,
expects that the next step will be a ``major manufacturer signing
with them and saying `we're going to produce millions of devices
with Transmeta chips.'''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Alexander Cheung, manager of the hedge fund
Long Bow Capital Partners, believes a recent deal by Sony to use
Transmeta chips in some laptops will be news enough to drive a
lofty offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what IPOs are all about,'' he added. ``People looking
for a ray of hope.''

DELIGHTS OF A FAMILIAR GRAPE 
</HEADLINE>
 - NYT  (Editors: the a in Macon requires a circumflex.) 
 By   ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wine drinkers in this country learn early on about
the Maconnais region in southern Burgundy. Its dry, clean white
wines are generally reliable and inexpensive, and for a beginner,
offer a fallback when choices are otherwise overwhelming. It's as
easy to point to a bottle of Macon-Villages at the wine shop as it
is to ask for a glass of chardonnay at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Macon producers are likewise learning about American wine
drinkers. They now frequently add the word ``chardonnay'' to the
Macon label, since that is, after all, the white grape of the
Maconnais and Burgundy. Few words are so alluring to American wine
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of Macons are made by large cooperatives intent on
maximizing production, and thus fill the beginners' market. But
some Macon wines are made by small quality-minded producers, and
exhibit a delightful concentrated fruitiness that is fresh and
deep, crisp and satisfying. Wines like the Thevenet listed below
and the Petit Chapeau (which comes from property owned by the
celebrated Domaine des Comtes Lafon of Meursault) offer much more
than reliability: they offer pleasure, which beginners can enjoy as
much as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Macons shipped to the United States are generally labeled
Macon-Villages or Macon followed by the name of a particular
village, like Macon-Pierreclos. Also from the Maconnais are wines
labeled St.-Veran and Pouilly-Fuisse, which are more expensive but
not always better.
</P>
<P>
   The artisanal Macons are not always better, either. Some taste
so powerfully of oak that I can only imagine that the winemakers
fancied that they were making expensive white Burgundies. In
Burgundy, such wines theoretically balance the oak with equally
powerful fruit flavors, but in the warmer, flatter Macon the depth
of flavor rarely exists. The wines I like best are made either
without oak or with just a little bit of it to round out the flavor
of the grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The first three of these six wines are significantly better than
the others, though all are more interesting than the
run-of-the-mill Macon.

 &HT;    Foley, McCollum attack hate crimes
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Saying those who commit crimes based on
hatred should be punished, U.S. Reps. Bill McCollum and Mark Foley
announced plans Tuesday to push new federal hate crime legislation.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, made
appearances in Tampa, Orlando, Miami and West Palm Beach to promote
House passage of a Senate hate crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both Foley, who is running for re-election, and McCollum
admitted that chances of the legislation passing this year are
slim. But both argued that if they can stir enough interest in the
bill, legislation could still make it this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with Jewish leaders at Temple Beth El, McCollum said
hate crimes have become an increasingly serious problem. He said
judges should be given the power to lengthen sentences for crimes
based on racial, sexual, religious or gender hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strongest opposition to the bill has come from those
who oppose including ``sexual orientation.'' McCollum said those
who want to leave sexual orientation out of the legislation are
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not gay rights,'' he said. ``The issue is civil
rights and hate crimes that are fundamentally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, McCollum's Democratic rival, Insurance
Commissioner Bill Nelson, accused McCollum of being a recent
convert to hate crimes legislation who is using the issue only for
campaign purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, R-West Palm Beach, defended McCollum, saying the
Altamonte Springs Republican had been involved in hate crimes
legislation long before he became a candidate for office.

INTEL, IBM AND HP AMONG COMPANIES FUNDING LINUX VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thousands of computer hobbyists and software
developers who together honed the Linux operating system from their
homes and small offices could soon have their first central
physical lab for testing new versions of the operating systems and
application programs built to run on it.
</P>
<P>
   In a validation of the growing popularity of Linux, Intel, IBM,
Hewlett-Packard and several other computer companies plan to
announce Wednesday that they will jointly create and finance a
laboratory for developing and testing advances in the onetime
renegade operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Working with prominent Linux developers and promoters, the
companies said, they plan to open the Open Source Development Lab
in Portland, Ore., by the end of the year, then create several
satellite offices around the country to support it.
</P>
<P>
   The companies were vague on details, like the size of the lab,
how much it would cost and how much the project's backers would
invest. The backers said the lab would be run by an independent
director who would essentially choose which projects would be
emphasized and which software would be tested, although they
suggested that the laboratories would be accessible to Linux
developers at large.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the lab will be designed in particular to
create Linux-compatible versions of software to be used on network
server computers that automate corporate financial and human
resource and customer service applications. Linux has not made
significant inroads as the operating system for the computers in
those areas because few such applications are available. Linux has
had strong growth as the operating system for World Wide Web server
computers and for some small and medium-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Linux developers, industry analysts and participants in the
project said one reason Linux had not been moved onto more business
computers was that Linux programmers have not had access to the
hardware needed to experiment with and test new programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what it takes to build a true enterprise
solution, the typical Linux developer does not have access to that
kind of hardware,'' said Michael Tiemann, chief technology officer
for Red Hat Inc., a company that sells technical support for it's
own version of Linux. . ``This is an opportunity to extend our
success and results.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning that the code
that underlies it is available free, though several companies like
Red Hat sell a version along with a contract for technical support.
That contrasts with proprietary operating systems, like Windows NT,
the code for which Microsoft Corp. owns.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the open-source movement say that making a
program's code freely available permits anyone _ hobbyists and
professional engineers alike _ to tinker with it, find bugs and
improve the software.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Balma, the open source marketing director at
Hewlett-Packard, one of the investors in the lab, said the
far-flung contributions had made Linux a stable operating system,
and one in increasing demand. He said, however, that Linux
developers' lack of access to high-end hardware had limited it's
compatibility with existing applications.
</P>
<P>
   But Will Swope, a vice president at Intel, which proposed the
lab, said its would accelerate development of Linux-based
enterprise software.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Linux's share of the server operating system market
has grown strongly. In 1999, it held 24 percent of the market, up
from 17 percent the year before, according to International Data
Corp., a Framingham, Mass., market research firm. International
Data found that the market share leader both years was Microsoft,
with 38 percent in each year.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kusnetzky, vice president for system software research for
International Data, said that beside helping Linux, the lab might
also benefit Intel. He said Intel had not been perceived as a
leader in the field of enterprise servers and that it could help
its reputation by promoting and financing the development of stable
Linux-based systems.

   Back in the 1920s, the designer Basil Ionides was one of
Britain's brightest aesthetic lights. His books _ ``Color and
Interior Decoration'' and ``The Modern English Interior'' _ were
best sellers, the former chockablock with watercolor illustrations
of his homes, prime examples of a scientific approach to the play
of light on bold but carefully graded color schemes. Ionides'
professional piece de resistance was the 1929 mirror-and-glass
decoration of the Savoy Theater in London, whose icy glitter still
staggers the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Ionides (pronounced eye-AH-nuh-deez) was also an outstanding
collector. By the time of his death in 1950, at 66, the half-Greek,
half-English designer and color theorist and his wife, Nellie, had
amassed an impressive haul of early Chinese porcelain. A dish from
this cache, which was sold at Sotheby's in 1963 and 1964, will be a
centerpiece of an exhibition at the Chinese Porcelain Co. at 475
Park Ave. (58th Street) from Oct. 12 to Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring 13 1/2 inches in diameter and about 3 inches deep, the
dish is a rare example of Kangxi famille noire, a style of
decoration whose floral motifs and naturalistic scenes are set on a
near-black background. What makes the 18th-century antique special
is the dark background's gentle luster, a fleeting, slightly
metallic sheen that an enraptured early observer poetically called
``the reflections of a raven's wing.'' Curious, too, is the
technique behind the effect, which must have appealed to Ionides,
whose hallmark was layering of different tones of paint to create a
vivacious surface. Since pure black was difficult to achieve by
Chinese potters of the day, they created a near-black effect by
applying shades of green over blackish-brown enamels.
</P>
<P>
   The show, whose 30-odd exhibits include blanc de chine and
famille verte, features an additional famille noire treasure: A
baluster vase once owned by John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his son
Nelson. Records indicate that the vase may have been purchased from
the estate of J. Pierpont Morgan. Both it and the Ionides dish now
belong to a private collector in South America.
</P>
<P>
   Basil Ionides came by his aestheticism naturally, growing up in
a clan of prominent Byzantine Greeks who emigrated to England
around 1820, eventually gaining fame as patrons of London's art
world in the late 19th century. An aunt was a muse to William
Morris, the high priest of the Arts and Crafts movement. Several
family members were painted by Watts, Rossetti and Burne-Jones, the
Pre-Raphaelite artists; Oscar Wilde and James McNeill Whistler were
family friends.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a fitfully successful stockbroker, Ionides was a
delicate, spoiled child whose artistic bent triumphed over a spotty
formal education. ``I doubt if it be a true advantage for a boy to
be first at a prep school, however good, that is run by a cousin of
his mother,'' recalled Dorothea Butterworth, his elder sister.
``And then at a public school house run by family friends who
encourage him to work or pass time in their own private garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Women played a crucial role in Ionides' life, none more so than
his wife, Nellie Samuel Levy. A friend of Queen Mary, she had
already amassed considerable objets d'art by the time she married
the designer, her second husband, in 1930: Canton enamel snuff
boxes, English chinoiserie silver, 18th-century etchings of the
Thames (she also had a charming weakness for tapestries and
paintings depicting poodles).
</P>
<P>
   When they met, Ionides already had a couple of houses stuffed
with antique ceramics. Not surprisingly, it was art that brought
the couple together. The 40-something widowed philanthropist and
Ionides, a slightly younger bachelor who lived with his mother,
were introduced by Margaret Jourdain, an expert on Georgian
furniture, who recommended Ionides to decorate Nellie Levy's London
house at 49 Berkeley Square West.
</P>
<P>
   Though impressed by his new client's taste, Ionides was not
unmindful of her financial attributes. She marched to the altar
fully loaded with a fortune derived from Shell Oil, which was
founded by her father, Marcus Samuel, one of the first British Jews
to receive a peerage. The money was an asset of which her husband
was immodestly proud. James Lees-Milne, an adviser to the National
Trust, visited Buxted Park, the couple's storied country house in
Sussex, in the 1940s and was astonished to hear the designer _
``pleasant, jolly, bon viveur, large and well-fed,'' he recorded in
his diary that evening _ confide that Nellie Ionides' estate would
be worth more than two million pounds after her death.
Unfortunately for her husband, the Hon. Ionides outlived him by
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ionides transformed the Berkeley Square house into a private
museum. Nellie's hundreds of Battersea enamels _ plaques,
candlesticks, boxes _ were stored in a round vaulted room lined
with glass-fronted cabinets of stripped-down neo-Classical design.
In the next room went a horde of porcelains, arranged on open
floor-to-ceiling shelves. A 1938 photograph of the connecting
spaces shows in the background, propped on a shelf, the dish that
will be on display. Whether it was originally his purchase or hers
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley Square interiors were an exceptional tribute to
Basil Ionides' discerning eye and Nellie Ionides' fortune, as was
Buxted Park (now a hotel). Both houses have long since changed
hands, but the handsome Kangxi dish that graced them remains: Mute
witness to the glory that can spark when two people with
complementary minds are joined as one.

AUSTRALIA'S GRAND OLD MAN OF WINE RETIRES FROM JUDGING 
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: Photos are available by calling Tim Fish of WineToday,

<P>
   HUNTER VALLEY, Australia _ From his hilltop home, Len Evans, one
of Australia's best-known wine personalities, uses binoculars to
survey the activity as far as he can see, much like a feudal lord
keeping a check on the family estate.
</P>
<P>
   From his house, Evans keeps an eye on the construction progress
at his latest venture, the lodge at nearby Tower Estate. He also
takes a peek at The Rothbury Estate, the winery he established in
1968 but lost to Australian wine company Mildara Blass in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Evans turns 70 on Thursday, and for many years he has been
regarded as Australia's grand old man of wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was known as Australian wine,'' Evans recalls. ``In the
great boom of Australian table wine in the 1960s and 1970s, I could
call any wine company and I didn't have to say my name; they knew
my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   That voice and accent are still distinctively Welsh, but his
tastes are decidedly Australian. Although within the Australian
wine world he's renowned for his brusque, opinionated and often
prickly manner, no one ever questions how Evans almost
single-handedly put Australia on the world winemaking stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the patriarch _ the godfather of Australian wine,'' says
winemaker Geoff Merrill of Geoff Merrill Wines, who recently
attended a dinner to mark Evans' retirement after 23 years as
chairman of judges at the Sydney Royal Wine Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to taste, he has that indefinable `something,'''
says friend and fellow wine writer James Halliday, who has known
Evans since 1967. ``When you couple that with his Welsh showman
style, you have fertile ground for a big personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, he says, is a ``boisterous, generous, at times imperious,
at times impulsive, larger-than-life figure intent on having the
best possible time, all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   After 47 years in the Australian liquor industry, Evans remains
indefatigable, much like his California counterpart, Robert
Mondavi. His opinions are still sought and are widely respected
within the wine world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Australia will be one of the three big wine
producers over the next 50 to 60 years,'' Evans declares. ``In 1985
we exported 1 million cases. Today we're well on the way to 30
million a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who began in the liquor trade as a glass washer, has come
a long way, much like the Australian wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was a teen-ager in a British boarding school, Evans has
loved wine. He kept a bottle of Madeira with him in his school
dormitory, which he would sip on Sunday evenings, well aware that
if he were caught it would mean instant expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't drinking it because it was alcohol and I wanted to
get drunk, I was doing it because it was a nice thing to do and I
have always loved the romance of eating and drinking nice things,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the occupation forces in Germany, and leaving a
promising career as a professional golfer, Evans emigrated first to
New Zealand, and then to Australia, in 1955. He took many manual
labor jobs, even building dingo fences in outback Queensland, then
came to Sydney in 1958, where he began the glass washing job at a
Sydney hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a time when Australia was a nation of beer and
fortified wine drinkers. Evans progressed to food and beverage
manager at another hotel, the Chevron Hilton, just as the
Australian table wine industry was emerging.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 he became Australia's first wine writer. In 1965 he
established the Australian Wine Bureau, which began the task of
gaining global recognition for Australian wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people accept the export success of Australian wine
as if it was their own work,'' Evans says. ``But it was 20 years of
an enormously hard slog. We were considered a hick country with
hick wines, just like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I met Robert Mondavi in Harrods department store in
London, where he was offering spotty English youths a glass of
wine; people who wouldn't know who the hell Robert Mondavi was. I
said, `Robert, what the Christ are you doing here??' And he said to
me, `Somebody has got to sell the stuff.' And that's what I was
doing too _ sell the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans wasn't just selling wine, but buying it, too. In addition
to purchasing The Rothbury Estate, he also bought property across
the globe, including two chateaux in France.
</P>
<P>
   While he may have retired from wine judging, Evans is hardly
retiring in any other aspect of his life. He is overseeing the
interior decoration of Tower Lodge, the 12-room guesthouse that is
part of the Tower Estate. Evans is undertaking this project with 12
other Australian business identities, including winemaker Brian
McGuigan.
</P>
<P>
   Evans has also teamed up with Halliday on an Internet wine
venture, Winepros, which keeps him actively involved with the
industry. In his spare time _ not that there is much _ he turns his
hand to making ceramics and mosaics, a hobby he shares with his
wife, Trish. She, along with Evans' three children, have also been
involved in varying degrees in the food, wine and hospitality
world.
</P>
<P>
   Evans claims to have loved every minute of his working life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while I see a wine of extraordinary quality,'' he
says, ``and it really does excite me. After all these years, a
great wine is still a thrill to drink.''

   ATLANTA - After two days of voluntary questioning by police,
Patsy Ramsey said she believes authorities still suspect her of
killing her daughter, JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they still have doubt,'' said Patsy Ramsey in a press
conference outside her attorney's office Tuesday. ``They've been
down this road so long that I don't know that one or two mornings
talking with them will make an abrupt about-face.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday concluded John and Patsy Ramsey's first interviews with
Boulder, Colo., police in two years. Police interviewed Patsy for
more than seven hours and John Ramsey for about two and a half
hours. Despite a nearly 4-year investigation, no one has been
charged in the murder of the Ramseys' 6-year-old daughter in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ramsey attorney Lin Wood called on police to issue a
statement clearing the couple.

   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Disputing suggestions that his campaign was
hesitant to commit to prime-time presidential debates, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas said Tuesday that he wanted all of his debates
with Vice President Al Gore to be held in evening hours when
television audiences were largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of saying I don't want to debate on prime time is
ridiculous,'' Bush, the Republican nominee for president, told
reporters aboard his campaign plane Tuesday morning. ``I want as
many people to watch our debates as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has agreed to three debates with Gore, added, ``I
would welcome all three being in prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and his aides said he was not yet prepared to agree to
any of the three 90-minute forums proposed by the Commission on
Presidential Debates, an independent, bipartisan group that has
been the prime sponsor of general-election presidential debates in
the last three elections.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said that Bush was considering debate proposals
from 53 organizations, including television networks, newspapers
and Web sites. And they left open the possibility that the governor
might not agree to any of the three debates proposed by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more than just the commission debates,'' Bush said.
``There are a lot of opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, executive director of the commission, said that
since the group began sponsoring debates in 1988, every
presidential candidate from a major party has participated in at
least one of its forums.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his remarks about the debates Tuesday in response to a
New York Times article reporting that his aides have resisted the
commission's series of debates, saying they were reluctant to
commit to three prime-time debates on the major television
networks. One other option the aides suggested was a debate on a
Sunday morning public affairs program.
</P>
<P>
   It is traditional for front-runners to be slow about agreeing to
debates, and until very recently, Bush was running well ahead of
Gore in most national polls. But since the Democratic convention
two weeks ago, the race has tightened considerably. And now, many
Democrats believe Bush runs the risk of appearing defensive when he
hesitates on debates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has seized on the issue to try to paint Bush as
faint-hearted about facing off against the vice president on
issues. Tuesday, Gore's campaign formally accepted all three of the
commission debates in a news release that also pointedly noted that
Bush has yet to commit to any of the commission forums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that the commission's proposal offers the
best opportunity for the most Americans to see the candidates in
the most effective forum to debate their views,'' said William M.
Daley, Gore's campaign chairman, in a letter to the commission.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Bush campaign suggested that one reason they
have declined to accept the commission debates is that they want
greater control over details of the forums.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Republican nominee, he feels both the responsibility
and the right to have some input into the format of those debates
to ensure that they are thoughtful and they are substantive,'' said
Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Joseph Allbaugh, Bush's campaign manager, and
Andrew Card, a Bush adviser, would travel to Washington on Friday
to meet with commission officials, as well as television network
representatives, to discuss possible debates.
</P>
<P>
   During his in-flight news conference, Bush said he might have
problems with certain debate formats. ``Sometimes the formats lend
themselves to who best can walk around the stage, act
dramatically,'' he said. ``I'd rather have a good discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what kind of format he has felt most comfortable with,
Bush said, ``The ones that were more free flowing.'' He added,
``Larry King was good,'' a reference to a primary debate on CNN's
``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush became somewhat testy when repeatedly pressed by reporters
about his position on prime-time debates, saying at one point, ``I
can't say it more clearly. I said it yesterday. I was hoping you
all heard me yesterday. Evidently, some didn't. When I say I
welcome the new prime-time debates, it's what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that ``candidate input on format is clearly something
the commission would want to be sensitive to.'' But she added that
the dates, times, formats and locations of the commission's three
proposed debates were the result of 18 months of research ``to try
to determine what's in the best interest of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, Bush traveled to Portland, Maine, where he
appeared with a middle-class family of five that he said would pay
no federal income taxes under his sweeping tax-cut proposal, but
would have to pay more than $900 a year in federal taxes under
Gore's more modest tax-reduction plan. He also appeared at a middle
school to promote his ideas for revamping public education. Tuesday
evening, he attended a fund-raiser in Portsmouth, N.H., that was
expected to raise $300,000.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: DEMOCRATS RELEASE THEIR COMMERCIAL ON PRESCRIPTION
DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee began showing a new commercial
dealing with prescription drugs in nine states on Tuesday, taking
on the issue of the month in the presidential campaign a day after
the Republican National Committee released its commercial.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER Slingshot Media
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN
</P>
<P>
   A druggist filling a prescription, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
an old woman, a hand on a wheelchair, an elderly couple, a clerk
interviewing an elderly woman, an elderly man, two shelves of pill
bottles, a woman on crutches, Vice President Al Gore, a pill
bottle, a prescription envelope being handed to a woman, Bush,
Gore. Graphics repeat most of the words in the announcer's script.
Flitting across the screen almost as fast as the pictures and too
fast to read are lines across the top saying things like ``Source:
C.B.O. Analysis H.R. 4680 6/28/00; U.S.A. House D.P.C. 4/14/00.''
That translates to Source: Congressional Budget Office Analysis of
H.R. 4680, a bill proposed by Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., and Sen.
John Breaux, D-La., that would subsidize insurance companies to
provide drug insurance. The companies oppose the bill, which the
House passed, 217-214, on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT
</P>
<P>
   Narrator: The issue: prescription drugs. George Bush's approach
leaves millions of seniors with no prescription drug coverage.
None. And Bush forces seniors he does include to go to HMOs and
insurance companies for coverage. The National Council of Senior
Citizens says, ``The Bush approach is favored by big drug companies
and leaves millions with no help.'' Al Gore is taking on the big
drug companies to pass a real prescription drug benefit that covers
all seniors. George Bush? Siding with the big drug companies. The
Gore plan: fighting for our seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY
</P>
<P>
   On its major point, a stretch. Democrats contend that Bush wants
it both ways by saying that he has a plan without giving any
specifics that could be criticized. But the Democrats are also
trying to have their cake and eat it, too. As Gore himself has been
insisting daily, Bush does not have a prescription drug plan. ``Put
up or shut up,'' he said on Monday. But the Democratic committee
justifies its accusation that millions of seniors would be denied
drug coverage under Bush's ``approach'' by pointing to analyses,
some independent and some quite partisan, of bills he has said he
likes but wants to improve upon. It is correct that the drug
companies favor an approach that would have private insurers, and
not the federal government, providing drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD
</P>
<P>
   This is almost entirely an attack advertisement, without
explanation of what Gore would do himself to see that the elderly
have prescription drug coverage. The fact that it is, formally at
least, coming from the Democratic National Committee and not from
Gore's campaign may be intended to distance the candidate from its
negativity. But that is a distinction without a difference to
viewers.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are many ways a songwriter today can be
unfashionable. Choosing to write for the American musical theater
is merely one of the surer routes. Though even here, different
songwriters go about being unfashionable in entirely different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   What does unfashionable mean for a musical theater composer?
Often, simply, that your music and musicals are more difficult for
audiences to embrace than a comfortable, familiar show tune.
</P>
<P>
   Take Michael John LaChiusa and John Bucchino. Both write songs
in the classic (some would say outmoded) Broadway manner as
descended from the American popular songbook. Beyond this
commonality, however, their work is strikingly dissimilar. Where
LaChiusa's music flouts tradition with incendiary rebelliousness,
both lyrically and melodically, Bucchino's teases it with
reassuring gentleness. LaChiusa made news last season on Broadway
with two new musicals, ``Marie Christine'' (produced by Lincoln
Center Theater) and ``The Wild Party'' (the Public Theater).
Bucchino quietly labors on the cabaret circuit, offering up songs
derived, in part, from his own unproduced musicals. Where LaChiusa
has lately enjoyed working on broad canvases, Bucchino is very much
a miniaturist.
</P>
<P>
   Both, however, find themselves similarly ignored, dismissed or
worse by a Broadway musical theater culture that prizes
regurgitation over originality. Both also have new CD's that rescue
them to some degree from this ignominy.
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa's are original cast albums. Though the pundits
generally savaged ``Marie Christine'' and ``The Wild Party,'' these
discs (RCA Victor CD 09026-63593-20 and Decca Broadway 012 159
003-2, respectively) are much more than souvenirs of shows that
closed quickly. Liberated from their own onstage pretensions (to
say nothing of the attendant critical hostility), both musicals
stand revealed on CD purely for what they are: Fine, often
ambitiously original, musical theater scores.
</P>
<P>
   This is an accomplishment not to be taken lightly. Compositional
originality remains quite an appreciable achievement for any
musical, particularly following a Broadway season of revivals ad
nauseum and a Tony Award-winner, ``Contact'' (also produced by
Lincoln Center Theater), that got by without a note of original (or
even live) music.
</P>
<P>
   As the records demonstrate, both ``Marie Christine'' and ``The
Wild Party'' had music of ambition and originality in abundance.
Interestingly, ``Wild Party'' also had a competing version last
season, produced by the Manhattan Theater Club, that received
similarly mixed reviews and now has been issued on CD (RCA Victor
09026-63695-2). Its eclectic, contemporary pop score _ by another
talented young composer named Andrew Lippa _ strives for that very
fashionability that LaChiusa's eschews. Both scores are
unmistakably set in the musical theater tradition, but with
purposeful twists. Where LaChiusa audaciously tried to recreate and
reinvent authentic period songs of the 1920s with a contemporary
bite, Lippa opts more ingratiatingly for of-the-moment power
ballads and trendy pop groves, everything from R-and-B to Latin to
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marie Christine'' was even more iconoclastic musically than
LaChiusa's ``Wild Party.'' Yet ``Marie Christine'' had the
magnificent Audra McDonald giving a performance many critics judged
to be the production's only redeeming feature. How fascinating,
then, to hear how little McDonald dominates ``Marie Christine'' on
disc. Rather, her vocal and dramatic brilliance blend felicitously
with the show's more underappreciated charms: The ingeniousness of
LaChiusa's all-American, pan-operatic gumbo of a score and the
exquisite orchestral settings concocted for that score by the
arranger Jonathan Tunick, to say nothing of the show's many
powerful supporting performances. All emerge on this record as
integral contributors alongside McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only question finally left unanswered by this CD is
not Marie Christine's Medea-esque conundrum (how will she murder
those babies come curtain?), but rather what in the world was this
show's crime that so many saw fit to convict it out of hand?
</P>
<P>
   The widespread critical vituperation that greeted LaChiusa last
season, both for ``Marie Christine'' and for his fiercely imagined,
often electrifying ``Wild Party'' score, reflected a disturbing
backlash against a younger composer who dared to confound critical
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing contrast to LaChiusa's bold method and the often
nasty reactions it engendered is the widely neglected work of
Bucchino, whose more retiring approach is lustrously displayed on
his new album, ``Grateful'' (RCA Victor 09026-63594-2).
</P>
<P>
   Bucchino writes in a style that might be described as Sondheim
defanged. His melodies occasionally reveal astringent colors, yet
they are painted with a harmonic palette significantly less complex
_ and therefore more approachable, perhaps _ than Sondheim's, or
LaChiusa's, for that matter. Moreover, as a lyricist, Bucchino,
while aiming for tart-tongued pith, often ends up unrepentently
sweet. His polished, if self-consciously literary, lines delineate
an emotional terrain best summed up in a phrase borrowed from
Sondheim: ``Sorry-grateful,'' wistful reflections on what is most
precious in life.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Top-40 material nor the cutting edge of hip-hop
cool. The realm of ambiguous emotions expressed without the armor
of irony is a dangerously exposed place, and Bucchino exhibits a
great deal of courage venturing there.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Grateful,'' an impressive range of singers take the trip
with him _ from musical theater's Kristin Chenowith and Patti
Lupone to cabaret's David Campbell and Michael Feinstein to elder
popsters like Judy Collins and Art Garfunkel and even a couple of
singing composers, Jimmy Webb and Adam Guettel. All of them deliver
Bucchino's deeply reflective compositions with luminous,
open-hearted sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a record nearly as valuable, in its way, as the
recordings that have preserved ``Marie Christine'' and ``The Wild
Party'' for posterity. Like LaChiusa, Bucchino possesses a singular
voice and an absolute integrity of expression. Of course, the
musical theater stages of Broadway once had room for many such
voices. Now, sorrowfully, one must be grateful simply for CD's that
allow songwriters this diverse to at least leave something beyond
fashion behind.

   RICHIE'S RICH: Rudy, Rudy, Rudy. If only you'd kept your hand on
the immunity idol! But the guy everybody wanted to win ``Survivor''
made a stupid mistake, and instead the million dollars went to the
devious Richard. On the post-finale special with Bryant Gumbel,
Rich said he wants to use the money to start an adventure camp for
troubled teens (where, presumably, they would be forced to go
jogging at 4 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well. Better Rich than Kelly, who came in a close second. As
Colleen said, casting a reluctant vote for the tongue-pierced river
guide, ``Maybe this will make you nice.'' (Personal note to Kelly:
When one is appearing on a
live TV special, it is proper etiquette to KEEP YOUR SHOES ON.)
</P>

NO NEED TO LOOK FOR RAIN _ IT'S IN YANKEELAND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone in Texas wondering where all the rain has gone can stop
looking.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have it.
</P>
<P>
   Not the ones who routinely whip up on the Texas Rangers. It's
the folks in Albany, the one in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas crops and lawns are dead or dying, and some areas
are rationing water, New York's capital city is awash.
</P>
<P>
   While we wonder if the rain will ever start, the Albanians, as
they call themselves, are wondering if it will ever end.
</P>
<P>
   They're calling it a ``monsoon'' and ``the summer that almost
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   As hot, as dry and as sunny as cities in Texas have been, Albany
has been cool, wet and cloudy. A couple of times this summer the
overnight low there dipped into the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   In the Albany Times-Union on Tuesday, people were complaining
about how the rain has ruined vacations, weddings and holiday
plans. Tourism is down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between Albany and Fort Worth on a
normal basis, but this year has been extreme,'' said George
Maglaras, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of in the reverse of what's causing your dry
weather. Basically, you have high pressure in the atmosphere over
Texas. You seem to be right in the middle of it, and we're lucky
enough to have a low-pressure system.''
</P>
<P>
   Maglaras said that a high-pressure area usually has a
corresponding low-pressure area. We've got one. They've got the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, that means that we're hot and dry, and Albany is cool
and wet.
</P>
<P>
   How wet?
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Albany has had 35.13 inches of rain, 11.23 inches
above normal. Since June, they've had 15.88 inches, almost 6 inches
above normal.
</P>
<P>
   Maglaras said Albany had 15 days of rain in July and 12 so far
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite a bit above normal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 30, most of Texas has had zip. For the year, 21.19
inches has been measured in North Texas, about an inch and a
quarter below normal.
</P>
<P>
   Another sprinkle and Albany will be setting records.
</P>
<P>
   So are we. Each day with no rain is a record.
</P>
<P>
   While they have our rain, we have their sun.
</P>
<P>
   Maglaras said a major indicator for Albany is the percentage of
sunshine. The sun shone on Albany only 42 percent of the time in
June. It should be about 60 percent. In July it was 52 percent,
about 12 percentage points below normal.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Texas Tuesday, the sun was shining 89 percent of the
time. It would have been higher except for the dry, tiny clouds
that drifted by for a second or two.
</P>
<P>
   Albany's highest temperature in July was 84. Our high in July
was on the 16th: 106 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Maglaras said July tied for the coldest ever in Albany with an
average daily temperature of 67.6 degrees, 4.2 degrees below
normal.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast in Albany Wednesday called for a low of 63 and a
high of 78, a degree or two cooler than our low.
</P>
<P>
   In North Texas Wednesday, the day should start at about 79 or
80, then rise to a toasty 101 or 102.
</P>
<P>
   There's no rain in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Albany expects showers.

GLICKMAN PROMISES MORE FEDERAL AID FOR DROUGHT-STRICKEN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MAX B. BAKER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOYD, Texas _ Samie Erwin's peanut crop usually is knee-high and
green by now, his watermelons plump and ripening on the vine.
</P>
<P>
   But when U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman toured
drought-damaged North Texas on Tuesday, much of the peanut crop was
brittle, brown ground cover and the melons busted open, puny or
plowed under.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost 100 percent on some fields, 50 percent on others,''
said Erwin, 65, who has farmed all his life near Boyd. ``It could
rain 5 inches now and it won't help.''
</P>
<P>
   After coming face-to-face with the bleak conditions many Texas
farmers face, Glickman announced that his agency is declaring four
additional counties _ Wise, Howard, Reeves and Val Verde _
agricultural disaster areas eligible for emergency low-interest
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty other contiguous counties also may ask for assistance. In
recent months, Glickman declared another 153 counties disaster
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks are really hurting. I don't like to be here on a
day setting records,'' said Glickman, referring to North Texas'
record-setting 60 days without rain. The previous record was set in
1934 and matched in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to examine every avenue there is
administratively, I can tell you right now,'' to help farmers
survive, said Glickman, standing in Erwin's watermelon field, sweat
on his face and dust on his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Texas continued to bake under the sun Tuesday, with the
temperature hitting 103 degrees. High temperatures and winds
continued to deplete the soil moisture and threaten such crops as
hay, cotton and alfalfa.
</P>
<P>
   Texas farmers and ranchers already are expected to lose about
$595 million, a figure that is expected to grow as the drought
continues. The blow to cotton farmers is expected to be $285
million at minimum, economists predict.
</P>
<P>
   The drought's long-term effects could mean higher beef prices at
the supermarket because many Texas ranchers have been forced to
sharply reduce their herds. Cotton supplies should remain plentiful
worldwide, but farm-level prices for U.S. cotton could go up,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
   A longer dry spell than Texas endured during the Dust Bowl days
of the 1930s, the drought has fueled wildfires around the state and
lowered lake levels, forcing some communities to ration water.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service computer models hint at the chance of
rain within 10 days, but Fort Worth-based forecaster Dave Martin
said he doubted that the drought would break. Temperatures are
expected to stay locked in the triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll get something in 10 days, but I wouldn't bet my
house on it,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Glickman's second tour of drought devastation in Texas.
In 1998, the former Kansas Congressman inspected fields in nearby
Slidell. The prolonged drought has withered plants in Texas since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heavy rains in the spring that saved some farmers'
winter wheat crops, what Glickman saw Tuesday near Boyd and the
small Wise County town of Cottondale, where he met with about 100
farmers, was ``pretty bleak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several inches of dust were piled on the roads separating
Erwin's fields. Brittle grass lined the ditches and grasshoppers
buzzed in the plants. Stock tanks across the road, usually holding
water at this time, were cracked and empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad day for me to have to come back and see all
this,'' Glickman said. Although he said he couldn't say how much
will be available for disaster aid, he said Congress has responded
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Charlie Stenholm, D-Abilene, who accompanied Glickman,
said an agricultural appropriations bill pending in the Senate
already contains $874 million for disaster relief and he expects it
to be increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Congress will be receptive to helping our communities
help themselves get through this very difficult time,'' Stenholm
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stenholm said he also plans to ask Congress for funds to make
sure communities such as Throckmorton, the West Texas town that
earned national headllines for its water woes, have enough drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers wearing white straw cowboy hats and sitting on old
cracked wooden pews at the Cottondale Community Center told
Glickman that help couldn't come fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. ``Rooter'' Brite of Bowie said farmers and ranchers need
money to buy hay for their livestock now. Like others, Brite
complained that some past drought relief came too late to do any
good.
</P>
<P>
   Without help, area ranchers and farmers ``aren't going to be in
any shape to come back,'' Brite said. ``We've got to get some
common sense into this.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Farmers Union President Wes Sims of Sweetwater said the
prolonged drought, low crop prices and rising costs are forcing
many Texans out of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of a prominent farming family in his West Texas
community has become a waitress to help her family get by, Sims
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her how her husband was doing, and she said, `Well,
he's so depressed, he don't even want to drive down the roadway to
look at his cotton,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Erwin, who farms with his daughter and son-in-law, he
said he couldn't recommend a life in farming anymore, saying: ``It
would be an injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   But his 15-year-old grandson Bryson insists he will continue to
work the family farm, and Erwin's daughter says they'll get by
somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not been fun,'' conceded the daughter, Gail Erwin Gentry.
``We don't take vacations. We don't go out to eat as much. We try
to hang onto what we make, because we come by it so hard.''

A PARTNER WHO WILL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, September 3) 
 By ANDREW SOLOMON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are two bloodlines in modern puppetry: The
``low'' subversive tradition of Punch and Judy, which is sometimes
called ``marketplace puppetry''; and the ``high'' tradition of
Asian religious ritual and court ceremony, including Indonesian
shadow puppets and Japanese Bunraku.
</P>
<P>
   Punch and Judy tend to bang into each other; the movement is
bawdy and slapstick, and the action and speech are often explicit
and violent in a way that would not be tolerable or feasible in
human theater.
</P>
<P>
   High puppetry (which is not necessarily better than low
puppetry) is gestural and exploits the same kind of control that is
meaningful in ballet: It is a language for the superhuman, for gods
and heroes, for stories told time out of mind to audiences that
frequently know the narrative by heart.
</P>
<P>
   The task facing organizers of the first International Festival
of Puppet Theater, in 1992, was to win adult audiences to the art
form. That was accomplished to some extent by presenting the
political and marketplace puppetry that used to dominate the
American scene. (Examples range from the Bread and Puppet Theater
of Vermont to the Halloween parade in Greenwich Village.) The work
proved its seriousness with its urgent themes.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the festival has become an established part of the
New York theater world, its organizers are less constrained; they
have the leeway to examine other boundaries of puppetry. And that
is what they are doing in this year's festival, which starts on
September 6 and runs though Sept. 24. Many performances (among more
than 200 by 26 companies on 14 stages) are clearly indebted to the
high tradition, and many of them could be featured in an
International Festival of Dance.
</P>
<P>
   One day recently, Cheryl Henson, the festival's executive
producer, spoke about the evolution of puppetry over the last few
years and of the illusion that lies at the heart of the art. As she
described the performances, her long and beautiful fingers became a
pair of amazing legs; then an indrawn hand became a face; then her
palms spread wide to comment on the movement of a bird. The motions
were dancerly. When this was pointed out to her, she replied that
she was unaware of it but said: ``You see, we have both the object
as body and the body as object. The popular image of the puppeteer
is that he manipulates his characters, as though they existed in
time and were being pushed into his purposes. But that's a literary
construct. You are bringing the object to life and it becomes a
puppet when it is animated. The magic of transcendence is in the
details.''
</P>
<P>
   The French Compagnie Philippe Genty, which played to
standing-room audiences in 1992, is returning with a piece,
``Stowaways,'' in which people, puppets and complex poetic props
and sets are all conflated in a confabulation of gesture: You
forget, watching this material, that humans and objects are
different from each other.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Salome,'' the New York performance artist Hanne Tierny uses
disembodied pieces of fabric, metal and live improvised music to
mesmeric effect in her presentation of Oscar Wilde's play.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Echo Trace,'' Heather Henson, Cheryl's younger sister who
works out of Orlando, Fla., uses light and motion to create a
whirling reality as fluid as the refracted planes seen through a
kaleidoscope. She reduces human and nonhuman forms to pattern. The
festival also includes variants on more traditional high puppet
work, including an all-female Bunraku troupe from Japan. (A
complete schedule can be found at www.hensonfestival.org.)
</P>
<P>
   Dance is an art of controlled movement, and so is puppetry. The
two fields have become increasingly intimate. Yet, while dance
pushes the body to its limits, puppetry can explore what lies
beyond those limits. ``Both dance and puppetry use movement as a
means of communication,'' says the performance artist Dan Hurlin,
who teaches dance and puppetry at Sarah Lawrence College and who
will be presenting two new works in this year's festival. ``I
always tell my students not to use the puppet like a microphone. Is
it really necessary that your puppets talk? Any given puppet can do
only a limited number of things, and if you don't have to waste
precision on the jaw, you can do far more with the figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others who are performing this year, Hurlin visibly
shares the stage with his puppets. The miracle here is that you so
believe in the life of the inanimate object that you keep your eye
fixed there rather than on the puppeteer.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the performer uses his own body and the body of
the puppet, giving an object motions he cannot make himself in what
Cheryl Henson calls a ``gestural ventriloquy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a kind of freedom, practical and aesthetic, that has
parallels in film but none in live performance,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   David White, who has presented puppetry at Dance Theater
Workshop, where he is the director, has also worked closely with
festival organizers. ``There's always a kind of uncertainty in
dance about who's in charge,'' he says. ``Dancers talk about what
they contributed and whether they get credit. Puppets don't talk
about that. They reveal a kind of God-in-the-machine aspect of the
social contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Choreographers have given human beings a grace that lifts them
above the human, and puppeteers give human grace to inanimate
objects. ``At a great dance performance,'' Henson says, ``you are
often distracted from a dancer's humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   White says: ``You are already suspending disbelief when you
accept a toe shoe as a foot, when you allow for the proscenium.
Puppetry goes the rest of the way. It allows you to examine what
life can exist when the humanity is eliminated. In this time of
rapidly developing technologies, puppets are engineering with a
human face. Puppetry is a mechanics of being.'' And Hurlin adds,
``Puppetry is a three-way mirror of design, engineering and
dramaturgy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Aesthetics,'' Friedrich Schiller speaks of how the
``shapeless gesture'' and ``the confused noises of perception''
begin to ``obey a rhythm and weld themselves into a song.''
``Gesture'' is the most popular word among practitioners of high
puppet arts, and it is the honing of gesture into a series of
astonishing rhythms that makes for the success of this work.
</P>
<P>
   Though they can appear compellingly fragile, figurative puppetry
and nonfigurative-object theater are robust media for formal
abstraction. This year's festival is full of meanings and stories,
but it is also a cavalcade of beautiful movement for much of which
language is only a backdrop. It is a great leap outward,
startlingly different from and enchantingly similar to the
conventions of modern dance _ as radical and fresh as the first
inventions of Martha Graham or Isadora Duncan.

ARTHURS SERVES UP A BLOW TO BRAZILIAN PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you're talking off-off-off Broadway in tennis, the
metropolis of Wrexham, Wales, might come to mind. The mind it came
to would probably be as far out and forsaken as the Wrexham Tennis
Club, where a few weeks ago a multitude of 20 gathered to watch the
defeat of a stranger from Slovakia named Ladislav Svarc by another
stranger from Australia named Wayne Arthurs.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been a Wales of a match except that Arthurs
knocked the spark out of Svarc with a sinister serve _ a snaky,
venomous sidewinder that was still rattling and ravaging Tuesday on
quite a distant and different stage. Arthurs had promoted himself
to Broadway _ the US Open _ by sneaking through the back door of
qualifying, and he was shooting out the bright lights of a leading
man, Gustavo ``Guga'' Kuerten, the world's No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Arthurs, standing No. 96 for the current season, was the extra,
the spear-carrier who speared the star, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6
(7-1), in a vast amphitheater that became Wayne's world.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly, the Brazilian stock market crashed, coffee bushes
wilted, the county's samba dancers pulled up lame, and the Amazon
showed signs of drying up. Green and gold flags slid to half-mast,
and the president declared a state of mourning. Their beloved Guga
couldn't get out of the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Indianapolis, where Guga broke his hard-court jinx by
capturing that title nine days before, is also off-Broadway. But
that triumph of the French Open champion, Brazil's most adored
athlete, had raised his compatriots' hopes that he could succeed on
the mean green slabs of Flushing Meadows, where he barely lost in
the quarterfinals to Cedric Pioline a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But how could the leading man get his lines straight as Arthurs
kept cranking his left arm so ominously and unleashing serves that
sped or spun so unnervingly, amounting to 58 of his points (26
aces, 32 unreturnables)?
</P>
<P>
   Guga was in retreat, backing up as far as 4 yards behind the
baseline to give himself a longer, better look at balls that seemed
to be yellow BB's or apparitions wobbling crazily with slice and
topspin. After a while, the Brazilian felt he needed cataract
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guess to return, and sometimes you guess right,'' Guga
said. ``I didn't do the right thing at the right time. The right
time was all the break points I had'' _ he cashed one of nine _
``that can change it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great feeling coming here, great expectations. But
Arthurs is a tough guy for the first round. He can beat anybody in
the first round with that serve. I had chances.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Arthurs kept the ball tight to Kuerten's body on those
crucial break points _ rib-ticklers that weren't funny in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Arthurs, a willowy, 6-foot-3-inch blond out of Adelaide, is a
throwback, an old-fashioned Aussie serve-and-volleyer,
chip-and-charger. But nobody in Australia knew that. He was living
in England, dinking along in small tournaments such as the
unremarkable Wrexham Challenger, making a living.
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly at Wimbledon '99, where he also qualified, his life
changed through his own deeds _ and the misdeed of countryman Mark
Philippoussis. Arthurs began serving as though he had a thunderbolt
up his sleeve, going unbroken in six starts, and he nearly beat the
best returner in the business, Andre Agassi, in the fourth round.
Suddenly he was warmed in the sunshine of Aussie Davis Cup captain
John Newcombe's broad smile.
</P>
<P>
   Newc was impressed, then destitute shortly afterward, when
Philippoussis tumbled while beating Pete Sampras in the
quarterfinals and wrecked a knee. Arthurs, whose dreams of playing
Davis Cup for the homeland had never been realistic, was now in
Newcombe's plans, though not for the quarterfinal victory over the
US in Boston, clinched by Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   But Rafter broke down at the US Open, and Arthurs was in the
lineup for the semis against Russia, a rookie at 28. Only one other
Aussie had debuted at a more advanced age: Horace Rice at 39 in
1913. Arthurs came through big-time, beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov and
Marat Safin to put his guys in the final.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Philippoussis was back to ice another Davis Cup for
Australia, but Arthurs was proudly on the sidelines. ``Yes, I
thanked Mark for getting hurt and giving me my chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wrexham, Wales, in July, for heaven's sake?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bad Wimbledon,'' he said of another Wayne's world
situation, in which he fell to Wayne Ferreira immediately. ``I
needed matches, and I got five in winning the Wrexham Challenger.
Also $3,500, and the applause of about 20 spectators.'' Plus a
handshake from the inimitable Ladislav Svarc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few more here today,'' he said, recalling the
14,000 witnesses to his southpawing of Kuerten in the gross canyon
called Ashe Stadium. More than had ever watched him toil, and shine
as no qualifier had done in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Arthurs had made a long journey from off-off-off Broadway
to Broadway itself while plunging Brazil into despair. He has come
up in the world, making some decent money, moving to Pinner in
Middlesex, the hometown of a singing tennis degenerate named Elton
John. He is not immodest in saying he serves better than John.
``But he sings better than me,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But the fond folks in Australia wouldn't mind if their newfound
Wayne crooned a couple of Elton's hits to highlight his afternoon
feat. He made Guga look like a ``Candle in the Wind,'' sobbing,
``Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road.''

HOW A TEACHER CAN INFLUENCE A WHOLE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, September 3)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rare as great performers are, even rarer are great teachers of
performance. Today, in the field of violin playing at a supreme
virtuoso level, there are only two categories of teachers: Dorothy
DeLay and all the rest. DeLay, as she is invariably known (though
long married), has been teaching at the Juilliard School for more
than half a century, and the roll of her former pupils includes
Itzhak Perlman and Sarah Chang, Midori and Kennedy, Gil Shaham and
Robert McDuffie, Cho-Liang Lin and Shlomo Mintz.
</P>
<P>
   Success like this will, of course, breed success. Students will
use their best endeavors to take lessons from the star teacher.
Parents will push their gifted offspring her way. Managers will
look to her to be training the next prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   But there must be a lot more to it than that. Exceptional young
musicians are often delicate seeds; they need teachers with special
talents to make them grow.
</P>
<P>
   What those talents are, in DeLay's case, has until now been a
mystery. Now 83, she has never sought publicity, nor has she
published memoirs or a description of her methods. For more than a
decade, though, she was closely observed by Barbara Lourie Sand,
whose resulting book, ``Teaching Genius: Dorothy DeLay and the
Making of a Musician'' (Amadeus Press), at last opens the door to
DeLay's studio.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, it turns out, has no secrets. What she does have is a
sound grasp of some basic rules that can be applied to any kind of
training.
</P>
<P>
   1. Teach the student, not the subject. The approach has to be
tuned not just to students' accomplishments but also to their
personalities. In some cases DeLay _ mystifying most of her pupils
_ has seen a trait worth developing in someone even though that
person is not going to become a professional musician. The person
is paramount.
</P>
<P>
   2. Expect a lot. What you teach _ information and principles but
also, and more important, habits and disciplines of thought and
practice _ will have to last a lifetime. DeLay explains how, at the
start of her teaching career, she imagined a circle of exacting
listeners sitting in on her classes: Toscanini, Heifetz and others.
What would they want to hear? How would they respond? From this
exercise came the rigorous program she gives her pupils to take
them through their five hours of daily practice.
</P>
<P>
   3. Be positive. Fear is a strong incentive, but only for as long
as the teacher is part of the pupil's life. Encouragement lasts
forever. (Isaac Stern suggests that DeLay's characteristic
endearments _ ``Sugarplum,'' ``Sweetie'' _ covered the problem of
not being able to remember so many names when she was seeing dozens
of students each week. But the cuddliness _ partly a front, of
course _ also helps pupils feel that their teacher is on their
side.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Ask questions. This is where negativity comes in, but subtly.
By questioning students, the teacher invites them to think about
what they are doing and why. In time, they may start to discover
their own faults and find other ways of doing things. They may
come, in effect, to teach themselves.
</P>
<P>
   5. Learn. Making the lesson a dialogue has another advantage,
that the student may start to teach the teacher, at least in how to
teach. Teaching is about giving but also gaining.
</P>
<P>
   6. Be yourself; or if not that, at least be someone. Having a
distinctive teacher makes the lesson special. A lot of DeLay's
success may be owed to the scarf she always wears around her
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   7. Break down problems. Students learn little from being told _
in however positive a way _ that they have done something wrong.
And they learn nothing from being told or shown the ``right'' way.
The teacher has to analyze, has to detect just what is going amiss
and why.
</P>
<P>
   8. Let progress show. DeLay, like all other music teachers,
marks her students' copies of their pieces to indicate details that
need attention. She then thoroughly erases those markings as the
problems get solved. Perfection is the clean copy.
</P>
<P>
   9. Do not shun trickery. Sand reports the nice story of a boy
who said he could not possibly manage the speed DeLay asked for at
a certain point in a piece. So she put the metronome away and just
asked him to play the passage over and over, a little bit faster
each time, until, lo and behold, he was attaining the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   10. Remember what cannot be taught _ but not so as to relax your
efforts. However much they are given good examples, encouraged and
taught to question, some students will go farther than others.
Innate talent is an issue here, of course, but so is innate
determination. There are parts of students' minds that cannot be
reached, though they may be released.
</P>
<P>
   11. Be a team player. DeLay works with colleagues who take care
of part of the instruction process, and she recognizes the
importance of parents, especially where young children are
concerned. Nothing will be achieved unless at least one parent is
backing the teacher and promoting good attitudes toward work at
home.
</P>
<P>
   12. Attend to everything. Nothing is beneath the teacher.
Nothing is beyond the teacher's competence to care. DeLay's pupils
have the benefit of her advice in everything from concert dress to
relationships with managers.
</P>
<P>
   13. It never ends. Not only does DeLay make a point of hearing
her ex-pupils perform whenever she can, but they clearly know, to
judge from the evidence assembled in Sand's book, that they have
been marked by her for life.

CREDIT SUISSE BUYING DONALDSON, LUFKIN &AMP; JENRETTE FOR $12.8
BILLION

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Credit Suisse Group is expected to announce Wednesday
that it plans to buy Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, a Wall Street
investment bank, for about $12.8 billion, according to people
involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   An acquisition of Donaldson by the big Swiss bank would be the
second buyout of a Wall Street firm by a Swiss bank this summer,
and it would expand Credit Suisse's presence in financial markets
in the United States and Europe. The bank already owns Credit
Suisse First Boston, an investment banking unit that has become a
powerhouse in underwriting Internet companies and other technology
stocks in the last few years. Adding on Donaldson would make First
Boston the leading underwriter of high-yield, or junk, bonds, and a
top-ranked underwriter of stocks and provider of merger advice to
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse is offering to pay $45 cash and $45 in stock to
AXA SA, the French financial-services conglomerate that owns 72
percent of Donaldson, and $90 in cash for the rest of Donaldson's
shares, said people involved in the negotiations. Credit Suisse is
setting aside another $1.2 billion in a bonus pool to be used to
retain employees, those people said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Donaldson, Lufkin shot up early Tuesday as rumors of
an imminent buyout swept around financial markets. Shares of
Donaldson rose nearly 20 percent, or $16.44, to $82.25. Shares of
DLJDirect, which track the firm's online trading business, rose
$2.25, to $10.19.
</P>
<P>
   According to people involved in the negotiations, the deal came
together quickly during the last few weeks. In documents drawn up
by investment bankers, Donaldson was referred to by the code name
``diamond.'' One of those documents estimated that, together, the
two firms would have ranked fifth among U.S. securities firms last
year with combined net income of $1.8 billion. In the first half of
2000, they would have had net income of $1.2 billion, the document
showed.
</P>
<P>
   AXA would wind up owning about 8 percent of Credit Suisse.
Analysts and investors said that AXA had been looking for a buyer
for Donaldson to reduce the volatility of its earnings, and
possibly to raise cash to expand its insurance and money-management
businesses. AXA is the majority owner of AXA Financial, formerly
known as the Equitable Life Insurance company. AXA Financial in
turn is the majority owner of Alliance Capital, a fast-growing
mutual fund company.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout would spell the end for Donaldson 40 years after it
was founded by three partners who used stock research as the
foundation for building an independent investment bank. The name is
likely to disappear as the firm's operations are merged with First
Boston's. The online stock-trading unit, DLJDirect, will be renamed
CSFB Direct, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Roby, the chief executive of Donaldson, would become
chairman of First Boston's executive committee. First Boston's
chief executive, Allen Wheat, would run the combined investment
banking operations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they were concerned about the amount of overlap
between the two firms' investment banks. People involved in the
negotiations said the merger was expected to yield about $1 billion
in annual costs savings by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Smith, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, said she
had ``mixed feelings'' about the proposed deal. ``It certainly
would help their market shares,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``Culturally, there could be some clashing,'' she said.
``DLJ is more conservative and has a partnership-type feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson traditionally has been one of the most generous firms
on Wall Street. It pays out a higher percentage of its revenues _
about 54 percent last year _ to its employees than most other
firms.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is starkly different from the proposed $12 billion
acquisition of PaineWebber Group by another Swiss bank, UBS AG.
That deal, announced seven weeks ago, would give UBS a nationwide
network of brokers to sell the stocks and mutual funds created by
its investment bankers. UBS executives said they planned to operate
PaineWebber, the fourth-largest brokerage firm in the United
States, as a separate unit of the company and expected minimal
overlap between the two firms.
</P>
<P>
   First Boston and Donaldson are essentially competitors in the
creation, sale and trading of investment products. Both firms rank
high in the underwriting and trading of stocks, especially those of
young companies in fast-growing industries, such as technology,
telecommunications and health care.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Donaldson has dominated the junk bond
business, an area of expertise it started building a decade ago by
hiring salesmen and traders from Drexel Burnham Lambert, the
defunct firm that was home to junk-bond maven Michael Milken in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, that specialty has not served Donaldson so well. The
market for junk bonds has been in a protracted slump. At the same
time, a bigger investment bank, Goldman Sachs has made a big push
into the business. So far this year, Goldman has raised more money
for clients by selling junk bonds than any other firm has.
</P>
<P>
   By paying a premium to buy Donaldson, Credit Suisse is betting
that the market for junk bonds will rebound strongly. Combined, the
two firms would stand atop the junk-bond underwriting rankings,
known on Wall Street as league tables.
</P>
<P>
   David Williams said he thinks Credit Suisse is making a smart
wager _ but then, he is biased. Williams manages the Excelsior
Value and Restructuring Fund, which owns about 275,000 shares of
Donaldson stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think junk bonds are a screaming buy in here,'' Williams
said. ``But I bought it because it was cheap. The moral of the
story is it pays to buy cheap stocks.'' Williams said he thought
$90 a share was a fair price for Donaldson because it amounted to
about three times the firm's book value, or the value of its assets
minus its liabilities. Three times book value is considered the
going rate for securities firms. UBS is paying slightly more than
that for PaineWebber.

GORE PITCHES HIS HEALTH CARE PLAN FOR UNINSURED CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo NYT 14 is being sent to NYT photo clients.

 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Vice President Al Gore kept his campaign
focused on health care Tuesday by emphasizing his plan for
providing coverage to the country's 11 million uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, for insuring all children by 2005, relies primarily
on an expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program, or
CHIP, an initiative that has provided coverage, with modest
premiums, for about 2 million children since its enactment in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The program now covers children in families with incomes up to
200 percent of the poverty level, and Gore would raise that ceiling
to 250 percent, or to about $41,000 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to cover every single child within this next
presidential term,'' Gore said, addressing a group of parents and
health care workers that had been gathered by his campaign in a
park here.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico is a swing state that was carried by President
Clinton in 1992 and 1996. Before then it had voted for the
Republican nominee in six consecutive presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Access to health insurance is a serious problem in the state,
where 14 percent of poor children are uninsured, the sixth-highest
proportion of any state, according to the Census Bureau. The
problem is particularly severe among Latinos and American Indians,
and Gore laced his comments Tuesday with Spanish phrases.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee had little to say about his Republican
rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But, in what has become a
regular feature of his policy discussions, he closed his remarks by
challenging Bush to issue a detailed plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presently he has not presented any plan to address this
problem,'' Gore said of children's health coverage, ``but there is
still time, even before Labor Day, to offer these specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush, called Gore's claim
``inaccurate,'' and said Gore should explain why the number of
uninsured children had increased by more than 2 million during the
Clinton-Gore years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Bartlett said, has put forth a plan to provide a tax
credit of up to $2,000 for premiums on health insurance policies
bought by families with incomes of $30,000 or less. Families
earning $30,000 to $60,000 would qualify for a smaller credit.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Bianchi, a Gore policy adviser, said the Bush credit would
not be large enough to help many families buy insurance in the
private market.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals, which would increase access for both poor
children and their parents, would cost an estimated $95 billion
over 10 years. The CHIP program relies on states to sign up
eligible children. The state and federal governments share the
cost, with the federal government paying most of it.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to raise the income ceiling for CHIP coverage is
the centerpiece of Gore's plans to move incrementally toward a
system of universal health coverage. That incremental approach, he
has said, reflects the lessons learned from Clinton's failed
efforts to insure all Americans in one vast restructuring of the
American health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it clear that the proposals that I'm announcing
here do not represent a complete solution to every problem in
health care,'' Gore said. ``The approach that I'm recommending is
the step-by-step approach, paso a paso, so that we move toward
universal health insurance for all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic primaries, Gore's opponent, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, criticized his reliance on the CHIP program, because it
has had difficulty enrolling all eligible children. Currently an
estimated 7 million children eligible for CHIP are not enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged that shortcoming Tuesday, but placed blame for
it on states that, he said, ``put up barriers to participation''
because they ``don't really want to put their own money into the
program, and so they make it difficult for families to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some governors, noted Bartlett, the Bush spokesman, have
attributed the problem to a lack of flexibility in federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has outlined a series of measures intended to lower what he
called the ``cultural barriers'' to enrolling in CHIP. Those
measures include simplifying applications for coverage, eliminating
asset tests that sometimes intimidate eligible families, requiring
states to change their minimum eligibility periods to a year from
six months, and allowing families to apply by mail instead of in
person.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president would also allow families with incomes above
the higher CHIP ceiling that he proposes to buy insurance for their
children, through either CHIP or Medicaid. Those families would
have to pay a full premium, but the financial burden would be
reduced somewhat if they applied for Gore's proposed 25 percent tax
credit on health insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Another Gore proposal would extend CHIP coverage to the 7
million uninsured parents of children who are eligible for either
CHIP or Medicaid. Some 85 percent of the parents of eligible
children are not insured, according to Gore aides.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan, states could set their own eligibility levels
but would receive federal matching funds for those parents they
enroll. If health coverage for parents is provided, Gore reasons,
families will be more likely to seek coverage for their children as
well.

   SAN ANTONIO _ Laura Bush and Tipper Gore might want to pay a
visit to the First Ladies' Hall at the Smithsonian Institution. In
this exhibit, usually crowded with tourists, first ladies are known
by their china and their clothes, not their resumes. The gowns of
the nation's first five first ladies are even displayed on headless
mannequins, symbolizing, perhaps, that heads are not really
necessary in this role.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Americans have not known quite what to do
with the wives of presidents. Those who spoke their minds, like
Mary Lincoln, Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton, were vilified
for meddling in the nation's business. Those who failed to assert
themselves as individuals, like Mamie Eisenhower and Pat Nixon,
were derided as female furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am more like a state prisoner than anything else,''
wrote our very first first lady, Martha Washington, in a letter of
complaint to her niece.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before the next first lady arrives in the White House, we
should reinvent the role. Does it still make sense to have a first
lady who is not hired, elected or paid by anyone, but is treated
like knockoff royalty and held to archaic standards of behavior?
</P>
<P>
   In their own marriages, some presidential wives may still prefer
the traditional approach. If Bush or Gore wants to be a
stay-at-home wife, fine. However, let's not expect her to do
anything substantial about raising literacy levels or improving our
mental health. And let us not have a first lady answer to any title
that begins with ``co-'': co-partner, co-conspirator, co-president.
</P>
<P>
   Some feminists favor making the job a loosely defined full-time
position. They reason that since first ladies are required to share
the public stage, we owe them a salary. But that presumes that the
woman who is first lady has something useful she wants to offer the
country. She might be like Lou Hoover, who preferred the sidelines
to the spotlight. ``My husband gives the speeches,'' Hoover said,
``and I receive the roses.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if the first lady has a career interest of her own? We
should know from observing Hillary Clinton that a woman who has her
own fierce ambitions cannot easily give up her personality to a
subservient role. That particular game of pretend is up.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four wives of the men on the major party tickets
this year have master's degrees: Laura Bush in library science,
Tipper Gore in psychology and Hadassah Lieberman in American
government and international relations. The fourth, Lynne Cheney,
holds a Ph.D. in English. It is ludicrous to expect women like
these to give up their own interests to serve solely as their
husbands' adjuncts, even if we paid them.
</P>
<P>
   A better solution would be to abolish the title of first lady
altogether and treat the wives of presidents as most wives are
treated in this country. In other words, they could stay home and
pursue their own interests or go out and get paying jobs of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   American women today mix and match roles of their own choosing.
A White House wife might easily be a mother, a highly paid
professional in her own right and a wifely hostess when the
occasion demanded it. For the sake of their dignity, it is time to
stop letting the women in this position be defined by the gowned
mannequins in the Smithsonian.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ This week President Clinton went to Arusha,
Tanzania, hoping to witness the signing of a peace agreement ending
the genocidal war in Burundi. All too predictably _ and despite the
presence of Nelson Mandela as a mediator _ the only agreement in
evidence for Burundi's warring ethnic groups to sign was
essentially meaningless, with prominent armed factions refusing to
be included.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's public support for Mandela's unenviable task in
Burundi is a wasted symbolic gesture, squandering the prestige of
the United States, just as the mediation effort itself squanders
Mandela's mythic abilities. Both men should realize that a
democratic renewal of central Africa is not possible unless the
Hutu-Tutsi problem is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The boilerplate approach to diplomacy in civil conflicts _ an
emphasis on power sharing between hostile groups and a transition
to real democracy _ is hopeless in this case. Rather than trying to
force the Hutu and the Tutsi to live together, Mandela ought to
openly voice the belief of most ordinary Africans: that peace
cannot come to Burundi or neighboring Rwanda unless the Hutu and
Tutsi are separated by an international border.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi and Rwanda are dysfunctional states created by old
colonial borders. The Tutsi, who constitute only 15 percent of the
population in both countries but control the governments and the
armies, will absolutely not permit genuine democracy because the
Hutu, with their 85 percent majorities, would dominate any free and
fair elections. Burundi's flirtation with experimental democracy in
1993 ended when the Tutsi-dominated military overthrew and killed
the Hutu president after he had been in office five months. In
Rwanda, the first-ever Hutu government carried out the orchestrated
genocide of 1994, in which over half a million Tutsi were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would power-sharing arrangements, or giving the Hutu some
sort of autonomy within each country, be realistic. The Tutsi
governments have vowed that they will never give up any part of the
state or allow a Hutu majority in the army. Hutu and Tutsi in both
countries see the exclusive control of the state as an essential
precondition to their survival as a people.
</P>
<P>
   Redrawing the map of central Africa may seem radical, but
consider what has happened elsewhere since the end of the Cold War.
The Soviet Union was broken up largely along ethnic and cultural
lines (the war in Chechnya is an example of what can happen when
non-Russian people are kept under Moscow's rule). The conflicts in
the former Yugoslavia have been quelled only when lines have been
drawn to divide ethnic groups or armed troops keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Kosovar Albanians and Serbs, the Tutsi and the Hutu
cannot live together or tolerate each other. The differences
between the two groups are not linguistic, cultural or racial; the
division is simply about power. Over the centuries, caste and
status solidified identities, with the Tutsi emerging as rulers.
Belgian colonial rule further entrenched and distorted Tutsi
domination, creating the ineradicable hatreds that have exploded in
the last decade into gruesome atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Now all of Central Africa is affected. Since 1998, troops from
Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi have supported an insurgency to
overthrow President Laurent Kabila of Congo largely because of his
failure to curb attacks on the Rwandan government by Hutu operating
out of eastern Congo. Zimbabwe, Namibia, Chad and Angola have sent
troops into Congo to support Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   A real solution to the Hutu-Tutsi conflict _ and the Congo war _
would be for a U.N. panel to redraw the maps of Burundi and Rwanda
to create two wholly new states: one for the Hutu, the other for
the Tutsi. Mandela's imprimatur on such a proposal would instantly
legitimize it in Africa _ and within the Clinton administration.
The logistics of such a plan may seem daunting, but in the end it
would be far better to conduct large population transfers now than
to accept genocide every few years.

<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Her car has been shunted to the side of the
road. The air has been let out of its tires. The military
authorities say they are offering her food and medical care, but
they are also making sure she is going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-democracy leader of Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has
been camped in her car for six days now near a small country town
in a symbolic attempt to travel to meet with her supporters.
</P>
<P>
   She has done this four times before, in 1998, sitting stubbornly
in her small white Toyota for as long as 13 days at a time,
unharmed but firmly prevented from carrying out her political
activities.
</P>
<P>
   An official of her party, the National League for Democracy,
described the standoff as a ``war of endurance.'' It is a phrase
that applies equally well to her 12-year battle of wills with the
military rulers of her country, the former Burma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story hasn't changed very much over the years,'' a Western
diplomat said. ``It's a standoff between the government and Aung
San Suu Kyi and her movement. It's perhaps worse to the extent that
the government now seems engaged in an attempt to destroy her party
definitively, once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   As the years have passed and her party members have been jailed
or forced to halt their political activities, Aung San Suu Kyi's
options have narrowed. She has been struggling just to keep her
movement alive and to hold the attention of foreign governments
that is perhaps her political lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   The Burmese military junta is equally stubborn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when the people rose up against three decades of
military repression, the army crushed huge demonstrations by force,
taking hundreds of lives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, with Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest, her party won
an overwhelming victory in a surprisingly free parliamentary
election. The military reacted by annulling the results and
tightening its grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 she was freed from formal house arrest but found herself
surrounded by security officers and restricted in her movements and
political activities.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband, a British scholar, was dying of cancer two
years ago, the government denied him permission to visit her,
suggesting that it would be more appropriate for her to visit him
abroad. She refused, convinced that the government would prevent
her from returning, and he died without seeing her.
</P>
<P>
   Her current foray out of the capital, Yangon _ the former
Rangoon _ demonstrates the weakness of her position as well as its
strength. It shows how few options she has to challenge Myanmar's
leaders but also how little she needs to do to draw international
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``She needs to keep people, not only in Burma but the rest of
the world, aware of the continuing repression and deprivation of
rights in Burma,'' said Sunai Phasuk, a political scientist at
Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. Her gesture drew immediate
support from the United States and Britain, as well as the
London-based rights organization Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States condemns this abridgment of Aung San Suu
Kyi's right to freedom of movement and her right to visit whomever
she chooses,'' said Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond statements of support, there is little that foreign
governments can do to affect the political situation in Myanmar.
The United States has banned new investment there and barred visits
from its leaders. The European Union has shunned Myanmar at
international meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But Myanmar's leaders have only hunkered down, apparently
comfortable with an international isolation that they first imposed
on themselves in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In its public statements about the current confrontation, in the
town of Dalla just across the river to the south of Yangon, the
government has taken a lighthearted tone verging on ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that ``security conditions'' do not permit her to
travel farther, it portrays her _ and 14 supporters traveling with
her in two vehicles _ as enjoying a pleasant rural interlude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daw Suu Kyi and her travel companions are still continuing
taking a rest at Sarpachaun Ward of Dalla Town, a small but
charming and scenic town which is a 10-minute boat ride from
Yangon,'' read a statement issued on Monday. ``While Daw Suu Kyi
visits some homes in Sarpachaun Ward, her travel companions and
attendants enjoy visiting downtown Dalla as well as taking daily
dips in Sarpachaun stream.''
</P>
<P>
   It said that a doctor and six medical assistants were standing
by. And it suggested that she ``return home and continue her
political activities in a more secure environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The government-controlled press joined the fray Tuesday, though
it did not mention Aung San Suu Kyi's attempted car trip, deriding
her as a ``democracy princess'' and asserting, ``She'll go down the
drain eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also took the opportunity to argue against
economic sanctions, which she and her party support, saying the
sanctions had cost jobs in manufacturing and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the party claims to be promoting human rights,'' an
official statement said, ``in reality the very rights of the people
of Myanmar to enjoy a better and fuller life have been undeniably
violated and abused by the very same people calling for democracy
and human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Photographs released by the government show two vehicles parked
amid shrubbery, joined by a makeshift tent and surrounded by
pink-shirted supporters, most of them members of the youth wing of
her party.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the cars were parked on a dirt trail about 180
yards off the main road, blocked from going farther by two trucks.
They told Agence France-Presse that the air had been let out of her
tires and that party members were taking turns standing by her car
with a large umbrella to shield Aung San Suu Kyi from the hot sun.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the travelers ``a determined group,'' party members
reached by telephone in Yangon said they were sending extra food,
medicine and mosquito repellent in preparation for a long stay.

SPLIT IN WASHINGTON DEEPENS OVER MISSILE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska)   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon and the State Department are sharply
divided over how far work on a limited national missile defense
system could proceed before the United States would be required to
give Russia formal notice that it was violating a crucial arms
control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Pentagon and State Department said that
disagreement within the administration was a primary reason for
Defense Secretary William Cohen's delay in making a recommendation
to President Clinton this month on proceeding with the project.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has focused on the point at which construction of the
missile system, which involves elaborate radar installations, would
violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, which lies at
the heart of the arms controls built up over the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have steadfastly refused any changes in the treaty
to permit elaborate new radar installations, fearing that they
would lead to a larger system that would undermine Russia's nuclear
force.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the agencies said Cohen was wrong when he told
the Senate Armed Services Committee last month that administration
lawyers had reached a consensus. Cohen said then that there was
agreement that building a crucial radar station in Alaska could
continue until 2002 before the United States would violate the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That represents just one of three interpretations drafted by
administration lawyers, the officials said. But senior
policy-makers at the State Department and the National Security
Council are strongly opposed, the officials added. The opponents
contend that this interpretation would be overly aggressive and
unilateral, and would surely anger the Russians and European
allies.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pentagon, Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, said
Cohen and his aides declined to discuss his Senate testimony. Cohen
is the administration's leading advocate of building missile
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to President Clinton declined to discuss the internal
debate but confirmed that officials were considering several
options and that Cohen's statement last month did not reflect a
consensus view. ``It is true that there are a number of options
available to the president,'' said P.J. Crowley, a National
Security Council spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The question of when the United States would violate the treaty
is a pivotal one that Clinton has to answer before approving even
limited steps to begin building a radar station on Shemya Island at
the western edge of the Aleutians. The Russians would surely object
to the United States and its allies. American officials'
interpretations vary based on when in the construction process the
treaty violation would occur.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is now widely expected to make a recommendation to Clinton
in a few weeks on how to proceed. But the officials said the legal
questions could delay a decision to move ahead further.
</P>
<P>
   The division is so sharp that Clinton may be forced to choose
among conflicting advice, if he decides to move ahead at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really squishy business,'' a senior military officer
said. ``Smart lawyers can disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Pentagon timetable, the first contracts for the Alaska
radar work, as well as a site for the missile interceptors, would
have to be awarded this year so that work could begin next spring
and a working system could be in place within the administration's
goal of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials have warned that the United States could
face a threat from some countries, including North Korea, by then.
There is universal agreement that building the radar would amount
to a violation of the treaty. The administration had hoped to
negotiate amendments with the Russians that would permit the
limited system now being developed, but Moscow has refused.
</P>
<P>
   Officials previously said that Clinton would decide this summer
whether to deploy a system. But with the Russians objecting and
even the allies expressing concern, the officials have since
signaled that Clinton simply plans to decide whether to move ahead
with an initial development. He would leave a final decision to
deploy _ and break the treaty _ to the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the legal interpretations have become so important,
because each interpretation sets a different moment when Clinton
must, as the treaty requires, give the Russians six months' notice
of American intent to withdraw from its anti-missile restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House's request, lawyers from the State Department
and the Pentagon have drafted the three legal interpretations of
the treaty that, in their view, would allow some work to begin
without breaking the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance before the Senate's Armed Services Committee
on July 25 and again at a news conference the next day, Cohen said
that administration lawyers had reached a consensus that the United
States would not violate the treaty until workers laid down rails
that would support the radar itself at the station at Shemya. That
is not scheduled to happen until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen emphasized that Clinton had not yet made a decision, but
at the news conference he added, ``There is a consensus that until
such time as the construction is under way that would lay the rail,
so to speak, for the actual radar being deployed there, that would
not constitute a breach.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense and administration officials said that Cohen, the only
Republican in Clinton's Cabinet was expressing his support for the
most liberal interpretation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That view, the officials said, is being challenged by senior
aides to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, including the
undersecretary of state for arms control, John D. Holum, who is the
chief arms control negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have an aggressive interpretation of the treaty to
argue that the rails are the point at which you would be in
violation,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   All the interpretations drafted by the lawyers would overturn a
legal understanding dating from the Reagan administration that even
the most minimal steps to construct parts of a missile defense _
including pouring concrete _ would breach the treaty. For years
during the 1980s, Reagan aides insisted that a half-built radar
station near Krasnoyarsk in Siberia violated the treaty and
eventually forced the Russians to halt the work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The second interpretation holds that the United States would be
in violation at the point workers begin pouring concrete, which is
scheduled to begin next May. Given the fact the treaty requires
either the United States or the Russians to give six months' notice
of an intent to break out, Clinton would have to then notify the
Russians by December, just as his second term ends.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said that Clinton is loath to be the president
who brings an end to the ABM treaty, which has been strongly
supported by arms control advocates since it was negotiated in the
Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   The third interpretation argues that a violation would not occur
until the concrete foundation for the radar site is complete. That
is expected later next year or even the year after, depending on
weather conditions and other potential delays. That would leave the
decision on breaking the treaty to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The senior administration official said that the question was
proving especially difficult since the treaty does not specify what
exactly would amount to a violation. ``There is some room for legal
interpretation,'' the official said, ``but I think it's fair to say
that not all of the options are equally defensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the administration's proposal said moving ahead
with a missile defense _ while arguing that the first steps toward
it would not constitute a violation _ would amount to a diplomatic
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Coalition to Reduce
Nuclear Dangers, an advocacy group here, said that unlike the
Russian radar at Krasnoyarsk, there would be no question that the
site at Shemya was intended to be part of a system that would
ultimately violate the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has made it abundantly clear what the
purpose of this would be,'' Kimball said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's own schedule has increasingly been called into
question because of test failures and delays in building a new
booster rocket for the missile interceptors. ``If the technology
isn't there, you don't have much of a choice,'' one official said.
``If you can foresee that the system won't be ready until 2006 or
2007, why would you push it now?''

COMMENTARY: YUPPIES UNITE! MOATS AND OCTOPI FOR ALL! 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore has been doing better. But there's still a
lot of skepticism about whether his angry populism can work.
</P>
<P>
   The times seem out of joint for inflaming the haves and the
have-nots. And the vice president, sporting a moussed 'do and those
heathery polo shirts, hardly looks like Willie Stark.
</P>
<P>
   How do you stir up the masses in an America where the masses are
fat and sated? If you call self-indulgent yuppies to the
barricades, will they follow, or will they lounge behind, sipping
their Claret Bordeaux Wine Casked Islay Single Malt (aged 12
years), talking on their 70-mile-range cordless phones in their
Hammacher Schlemmer hammocks, making reservations at spa.com?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for yuppies everywhere, I say, bring on the class war!
Just make it first class.
</P>
<P>
   That is the beauty of yuppies: We are greedy, but never
gratified.
</P>
<P>
   It will be easy for the vice president to tap into boomer angst
and schadenfreude. As we have been reminded by the current mania
for ``Survivor''-type shows, which thrive on manipulation,
humiliation and Darwinian machination, a prosperous country is a
sadistic country.
</P>
<P>
   As Jacques Barzun writes about the Marquis DeSade in ``From Dawn
to Decadence'': ``A sadist does not simply enjoy inflicting pain;
he is a blender of ecstasies.'' In other words, a prosperous
country is a decadent country, in pursuit of easy pleasure and easy
pain. More breeds the desire for more.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can't win simply by firing the ire of the poor and middle
class because there aren't enough of them any more. (Besides, not
enough of them vote or give soft money). He needs to find a way to
incite the yuppies, who like to think of themselves as middle class
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as hard as it seems. Gore simply has to pit the
have-nots and haves against the have-it-alls.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to pit the masses of instant millionaires against the
economic royalty of instant billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Even though yuppies are rolling in it, they long to feel like
the obstreperous, striving, anti-bourgeois afflicters of the
comfortable they think they once were.
</P>
<P>
   They may have dodged the Vietnam War, they may feel their
parents were the Greatest Generation, but here at long last is a
war they can get into: a faux class war.
</P>
<P>
   But EveryAl is on the wrong track, crusading to help seniors get
cheaper arthritis pills. If he is going the drug route, he should
be helping yuppies get the prescription drugs they rely on to
smooth out the stress of pampered lives __ Xanex, Zoloft, Valium
and Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   But EveryAl will have to work harder at playing on arriviste
envy, reminding yuppies of all the luxury items they still don't
have.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for him, new needs are being invented everyday. He
just has to point out to yuppies that, as FDR once put it, they are
relatively ill-housed, ill-clothed, and ill-fed. Not to mention
ill-shod, ill-transported and ill-wived. Out there in America,
EveryAl should be asking:
</P>
<P>
   Does your toddler toddle in Gucci baby booties?
</P>
<P>
   Do you sashay in cashmere denim and merino worsted suits with
22-karat gold-thread pinstripes (beaten into leaf), the same kind
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia used to cover the seats of his Boeing
747?
</P>
<P>
   Do you display your octopus and black squid in a custom
cylindrical architectural aquarium?
</P>
<P>
   Do you live on your own island? Do you get there on your own
Dassault Falcon 2000 Jet? Does someone butle on the island? Does
the butler clean with a Miele limited-edition platinum vacuum
cleaner?
</P>
<P>
   Do you have your own offshore bank?
</P>
<P>
   Does your third country home have a fine 19th century
honey-colored limestone chimney piece with gothic detailing over a
concave frieze carved with five foliate bosses, and jambs carved
with trefoil arches? I mean, does it?
</P>
<P>
   Did N-Sync play your kid's Bat Mitzvah? Did Britney do the bris?
</P>
<P>
   For crying out loud, do you have your own moat?
</P>
<P>
   Trophy wives for everyone! Even women. Soccer moms especially.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need George W. Bush if you have your own personal tax
consultant to dodge and shelter you.
</P>
<P>
   ``A flat TV in every pot!'' EveryAl should cry. ``You shall not
crucify mankind on an 18-karat-gold-plated cell phone (hand-placed
diamonds optional)!''
</P>

 &HT;    Turner's call for peace stirs summit
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Turner roused religious leaders from around the world
Tuesday with a vigorous speech exhorting them to work to foster
tolerance, end hatred and rid the world of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us together can't get a Russian submarine that's sunk
in only 300 feet of water, can't get the people to the surface, and
yet they say all these nuclear missiles are safe,'' Turner said to
loud applause. ``Don't believe it. I mean, they're not safe at all.
The only safe thing to do is get rid of 'em! Get rid of 'em now!
Right on!''
</P>
<P>
   Turner made his appeal as he gave the keynote speech to the
Millennium World Peace Summit, a gathering at United Nations
headquarters in New York of more than 1,000 leaders of different
religions. Turner, who once called Christianity ``a religion for
losers,'' played an important role in convening and financing the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Turner Foundation, which operates domestically, and
the U.N. Foundation, which supports U.N.-related projects
internationally, Turner has made hundreds of millions of dollars in
charitable contributions. The Atlanta businessman who founded CNN
and made billions of dollars in cable television is a vice chairman
of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   With the assistance of former Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), Turner has
been working to create a foundation dedicated to reducing the
threat of nuclear weapons and materials around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing people clad in ethnic and religious garb from around
the globe, Turner talked of his own struggle with faith and issued
a plea for harmony and understanding among people of different
races and religions.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was vintage Turner _ an ad-libbed, vigorous,
impassioned performance, delivered loudly and with many gestures.
He pantomimed boxing as he described the relatively harmless wars
of days gone by, and swimming, which he said people the world over,
who are essentially the same, like to do when it's hot.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of such a summit took shape a couple of years ago in
a conversation between Turner and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, said Bawa Jain, who is general secretary of the event.
Turner commented on the value of having leaders of different
religions commit, in writing, to peace; Annan agreed and worked to
organize the conference. Turner, who donated $300,000 through his
Better World Fund, is honorary chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The religious gathering, a prelude to the U.N. Millennium
Summit, which is expected to draw about 150 world leaders Sept.
6-8, has not been without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Deferring to the Chinese government's disapproval, organizers
invited Tibet's Dalai Lama to only the last two days of the summit,
to be held outside the U.N. headquarters building at a New York
City hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of 10 million Buddhists,
refused to attend.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, which was Webcast live around the world, Turner
said he began as a very religious child and had planned to become a
missionary.
</P>
<P>
   But his faith was shaken, he said, because adherents of his
branch of Christianity _ he did not identify it _ believed that
only they could enter heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just confused the devil out of me because I said, `Heaven's
going to be a mighty empty place with nobody else there,''' he
recalled. It struck him as something that just couldn't be right.
</P>
<P>
   Turner came eventually to the conclusion that there is only one
God, who manifests himself differently to different people.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout history, many wars have been fought in the name of
religion. But with the advent of nuclear weapons, Turner said, war
is something the world can no longer afford.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to assembled leaders of Judaism, Christianity, Islam,
Hinduism and other faiths, Turner used a religious appeal to plead
for help in ending the threat he said nuclear weapons pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that God wants us to blow ourselves to kingdom
come,'' he said. ``I can't believe he put us here so that would be
our final act.''

<P>
   Russian and Norwegian divers will begin next month to remove the
bodies of the 118 sailors who died in the sinking of the nuclear
submarine Kursk. Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said that the
divers would cut six holes in the sub and that Russian divers would
enter to retrieve the bodies. The sub will be raised next year, he
said. Klebanov repeated that Russia believes that a collision with
a foreign vessel caused the sinking, rejecting American reports
that a torpedo exploded inside the sub.

CLINTON SAYS DISBARMENT IS TOO HARSH A PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even if President Clinton lied under oath to a
federal judge about his relationship with a White House intern,
disbarment would be too strong a penalty, the president's lawyers
said in court papers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their statement, filed with the Pulaski County Superior Court in
Arkansas, was in response to a recommendation by a state
disciplinary committee that he be stripped of his law license
because of ``serious misconduct.'' The committee has said he gave
false testimony in 1998 about his relationship with the intern,
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement, Clinton's lawyers noted that the president
still disputed that his testimony was technically false. But even
if the allegation were correct, the lawyers said, ``a sanction of
disbarment would be excessively harsh, impermissibly punitive and
unprecedented in the circumstances of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers, David Kendall and Nicole Seligman of
Washington, said in their filing that Clinton's alleged offense was
not connected to the practice of law nor was he convicted of _ or
even charged with _ a felony. In Arkansas, they said, disbarment
has never been imposed in a case that did not involve a felony
conviction or a matter involving the practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   A trial on the disbarment issue could occur sometime this fall.
In any event, Judge Leon Johnson, who is presiding over the case,
has indicated that he expects to conclude the proceedings before
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary case involves Clinton's statements under oath
on Jan. 17, 1998, when he gave a deposition in the sexual
misconduct lawsuit brought against him by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In the presence of Judge Susan Webber Wright, a federal trial
judge who was presiding over the civil lawsuit, Clinton said he had
never engaged in a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and he denied
that he had ever been alone with her but for a fleeting moment.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton acknowledged in August 1998 that he had had an
improper physical relationship with Lewinsky, Wright ruled that his
behavior in the deposition constituted contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president,'' she said, ``deliberately violated this
court's discovery orders, thereby undermining the integrity of the
judicial system.'' She said that ``sanctions must be imposed to
redress the president's misconduct and to deter others who might
consider emulating the president's misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright fined Clinton $1,202 to cover her costs in traveling to
Washington to attend the deposition and ordered him to pay some
$90,000 in fees to Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that his deposition testimony, in which he
denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky, was accurate because
the oral sex in which they engaged in did not fit the definition of
sexual relations that had been approved by Wright.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What a lovely summer this has been in New York. The
only thing more fun than having one winning baseball team is having
two, and New York is currently blessed with that.
</P>
<P>
   There has been 12 o'clock lightning in two boroughs, and there
has been midnight suspense from Western time zones when it was
impossible to turn off the television set and get some sleep, and
there was even Benny Agbayani's grand slam from Japan just as day
people were getting ready to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   Rock around the clock. What a season. How hard it is to take
even a day away from baseball to ponder the U.S. Open or to ponder
rumors of another year of professional football.
</P>
<P>
   How excruciating it is to anticipate the weeks of attention to
the bizarre charm of synchronized swimming and dressage at the
Summer Games in Sydney, while Derek Jeter and Mike Piazza are (as
Red Barber used to say) tearing up the pea patch.
</P>
<P>
   The summer became even more glorious Tuesday when the Mets woke
up in their collective beds in New York in a tie for the best
record in baseball, while the Yankees stirred in their respective
hotel rooms in Seattle still ensconced in first place in their
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play this game for the fans,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine
said. ``It should never be lost in the shuffle. If you're a fan of
the Mets, you've waited weeks, months, years for this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets tried to stay on top last night against the Houston
Astros in a fresh and autumnal Shea Stadium, with the Braves' home
game against the Reds flickering on the scoreboard behind right
field.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are clearly the novelty act in this city of good
feeling, not having been in first place this late in a season since
1990. Bear in mind that last October's heroics came only after a
season of bickering and brinkmanship, skittering slumps and
flailing egos. Now the Mets have the best record in baseball since
the All-Star Game break, and there is serenity everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I injured or being rested?'' Robin (.234) Ventura asked
Valentine when he was informed he was not in the starting lineup
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two laughed, a far cry from recent years when Valentine had
to deal with assorted mutineers and grumps, and was occasionally
tetchy himself.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is so calm that he almost, that is, almost seemed to
enjoy being in first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're playing, the daily thing is important,'' Valentine
said. ``You just play 'em. I understand totally that the only
standings that count are at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, however, did note, ``We were five or six games behind
only two weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   How true. Although separated by hundreds of miles Tuesday night,
the Mets had caught up with the Braves. It was a minor version of
the way the 1951 New York Giants caught up to the Brooklyn Dodgers,
after a 13{-game deficit, and leaned on the batting cage in
September and leered at the Dodgers as if to say, ``We didn't
die.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had the feeling that the Braves knew that for at least
one night the two teams had, finally, been equal in the standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always the team that was behind the Braves,'' Agbayani
said. ``They'll be aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani thought that last year's nervous-making wild-card
heroics had led to a calmer Mets team this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed last year, it was so exciting,'' said Agbayani, a
rookie back then. ``We kept wondering: `Are we going? Aren't we
going?' We had to wait out the wild card. After last season, you
feel you can do it all, not just the wild card. As a team, we've
been through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani knows the drill now. Last days of August, home game,
the Open across the way, tickets to be had. He, Darryl Hamilton,
Ventura, Todd Zeile and Edgardo Alfonzo all went over to catch a
few matches at midday Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely amazing how they return first serve,'' said
Agbayani, talking about the men who regularly return serves of 125
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't touch those serves. Maybe the second serve, even
with the spin they put on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets wandered back across the boardwalk to prepare for the
Astros. They had 31 games left in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to prattle of a Subway Series, but this much is
true: Only the most sour Met and Yankee fans can work up a hatred
for the other side in a season that has been so sweet, so far.

FLORIDA COLLEGES ENROLL MORE MINORITIES UNDER NEW ADMISSION
POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The first freshman class selected to Florida's state
college system since Gov. Jeb Bush put an end to race-based
admissions has shown, instead of a decrease in minority enrollment,
an increase of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose plan allows the admission of the top 20 percent of
graduating seniors from each state high school, whether
predominantly black, white or Hispanic, said the increase is proof
that diversity in other college systems can be accomplished without
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most diverse in history,'' said Bush of the incoming
freshmen, who are the first students to be admitted without
affirmative action mandates since racial set-asides were put in
place in Florida in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He said his plan, called One Florida, produced an incoming class
of more than 40 percent minorities _ blacks, Hispanics, Asians and
Native Americans _ and could be a model for other states whose
affirmative action laws are being challenged in the courts or at
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the plan say it is far too soon, after one year,
to call it a success. Some experts on education reform called the
plan a gimmick that merely gives old affirmative action a new name.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed the criticism as he celebrated what he said was a
clear victory in a difficult social and political arena. Black
leaders here had said the plan would cripple college admissions of
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent the last 10 months getting blistered by people who
didn't believe we could do this,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, he said, ``debunk the myth that One Florida would
result in fewer minority students going to Florida colleges and
universities. We can promote both opportunity and diversity in
higher education without using unfair and legally suspect racial
preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that, unlike Texas and California, which have similar
programs that produced initial drops in minority enrollment,
Florida ``did not wait for a legal challenge or a ballot
initiative,'' before instituting the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Texas courts threw out affirmative action laws in 1996, but the
state eventually restored its racial mix on college campuses under
a plan by Texas Gov. George W. Bush's administration that admitted
the top 10 percent of students in each school.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said he used elements of the Texas plan in his own. But
it was California's end to affirmative action, in a statewide vote
in 1997, that may have forced the Florida governor's hand.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Connerly, a businessman and black conservative who led the
battle to end affirmative action in California, had turned his
attentions to Florida, and Bush's One Florida plan was seen as a
way to blunt that looming battle in a year that his brother was
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan, who fought against it when Bush unveiled it
in November, said that the affirmative action program he ended was
already steadily improving minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature,'' said State Sen. Kendrick Meek, D-Miami,
whose district includes much of Miami's black community. ``We'd
like to see the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Florida plan does something old affirmative action
did not do: It allows students to pursue an education without the
stigma of set-asides and lowered admission standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every student entering our system today can be proud of what
we accomplished, and be confident that achievement, not skin color
or ethnic background, is the only measure of merit in our
universities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3,202 incoming students, 1,234 were minorities, and all
10 colleges in the state system increased their enrollment of
blacks, according to statistics from the university system.
</P>
<P>
   That increase of black enrollment was not just at predominantly
black colleges, but also at Florida's two leading state-run
universities _ the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and
Florida State University, in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   The number of enrolling black students at the University of
Florida was up 33 percent from last year; at Florida State, the
number rose 21 percent. Hispanic student enrollment went up 19
percent at the University of Florida grew by 19 percent, and at
Florida State it rose 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading universities enrolled 577 more black and
Hispanic students this year than last year. Bush said the state's
universities aggressively recruited the best minority students who
qualified under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some education reform experts said that the plan is merely an
altered version of affirmative action with a new name.
</P>
<P>
   Sam J. Yarger, Dean of the School of Education at the University
of Miami, pointed out that one school's top student may not even
rank in another school's top ten percent. The plan creates quota
systems in each school, ``which is not related to any external
standard,'' said Yarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should call Florida One Bush's Theory of Relativity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real argument,'' he said, ``is whether minorities are
entitled to positions in the state university system when there is
a non-minority applicant with better academic and other relevant
credentials. Why don't we just have that argument?''

YOUTHS ARRESTED FOR ``KILLING FOR THE THRILL'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS and RUTH TEICHROEB  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ Eight youths _ including boys only 11, 12 and 13
years old _ have been arrested for a beating death and series of
vicious attacks that police say were committed for the ``thrill''
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, that's what they were doing _ killing for the
thrill,'' said police spokesman Jim Mattheis.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest suspect would be entering sixth grade next week and
is believed to be the youngest person ever facing a murder charge
in Pierce County. Several suspects burst into tears when police
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Experts point to a kind of ``pack'' behavior among youths inured
to an escalating level of violence by exposure to extremely violent
video games, movies and other media.
</P>
<P>
   Running with a gang can be ``infectious,'' said Karil Klingbeil,
an associate professor of social work at the University of
Washington and social work director at Harborview Medical Center in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like a virus,'' she said. ``A kid alone walking
down a street wouldn't even think of attacking someone. But the
group bravado gives him a tag-along mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspects, all males who range in age up to 19 years old, are
expected to be charged with first-degree murder, possibly as early
as Wednesday. All were booked into juvenile detention or jail.
</P>
<P>
   All the suspects are believed to have participated in the Aug.
19 assault of Erik Toews, who died Friday from multiple injuries
suffered when he was beaten, kicked and clubbed with sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Toews' brother said the young age of the accused makes
his death tougher to comprehend and resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Families of murder victims naturally want revenge and it makes
it easier when the person charged is ``the most evil person out
there,'' Brian Toews said. ``Then you can just feel good about
locking them up and throwing away the key.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you are talking about kids, you wonder about the
circumstances of their guilt,'' he said. ``And that is stealing
away part of our grief. It makes it even more unresolvable for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Erik Toews, who was working two jobs to help support his mother
and one of his brothers, was attacked in the 1300 block of North
Fourth Street, near the family's home in the city's historic
Stadium District.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old man was walking home from work at a neighborhood
coffee shop when he was assaulted shortly after 10 p.m. in what
police say was an unprovoked attack.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the youths arrested Monday night and Tuesday have
been linked to nine assaults that have occurred near Wright Park
since July 26. And they suspect the youths committed a number of
other assaults in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are other cases out there that haven't been
reported ... possibly because the people were assaulted by little
kids,'' Mattheis said.
</P>
<P>
   The youths suspected of taking part in the assaults all live in
the same neighborhood, near Bryant Elementary School and only
blocks away from the scene of some of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The youths knew one of the men they attacked and that victim was
able to assist the police investigation, Mattheis disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Police also gained valuable information while working undercover
in the Wright Park area last Wednesday night, he said. Police
encountered and talked to some of the eight suspects at that time.
</P>
<P>
   None of the suspects was surprised to see the police show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew we were coming,'' Mathheis said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are not part of any organized gang. They are just
neighborhood friends, Mattheis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids just got together and decided they were going to go
out and beat somebody up,'' he said. ``That was their whole
intent.''
</P>
<P>
   In such circumstances, younger children follow the orders of
older teens to win acceptance, said Sgt. Dianne Newsom of Seattle
Police Department's gang unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to belong,'' she said. ``And they don't want to go
against the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Klingbeil, the Harborview social work director, predicted that
as more details come out, the youths will share some common
elements in their backgrounds, from low self-esteem and alienation
to truancy and family violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect these kids are heavily involved in instances of
family violence _ child abuse, spousal abuse and that sort of
thing,'' Klingbeil said.
</P>
<P>
   But she also said there will likely be a few suspects who until
now had decent grades and had never been in trouble until lured
into criminal activity by their peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the desire for a sense of belonging that takes you into a
gang,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The crimes obviously raise the question of parental supervision,
said Newsom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it sad? It makes you wonder what 11-year-olds were doing
out at midnight,'' Newsom said. ``Society needs to do something
about the parents who allow that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Klingbeil said some of the parents had probably given up
on their children, others may be shocked by how far astray their
offspring have gone.
</P>
<P>
   A worrisome trend is that more younger children are committing
violent crimes, she said. And they have a limited ability to
understand consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very impulse-ridden kids,'' Klingbeil said. ``They
don't start out the day thinking they are going to murder that
night _ let alone get caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Many children are exposed from infancy on to extreme violence in
movies, videos and on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a normalizing effect,'' Klingbeil said. ``And there are
usually more pleasant endings on television than in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Toews said the family is devastated by the loss.
</P>
<P>
   `If he had died from an accident or an illness, we could have
eventually made some sense out of it. But the fact that he was
senselessly beaten to death makes it harder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma police Chief James Hairston agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the senseless nature of this that makes it so
disturbing,'' Hairston said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that most of the youths reported committing the
assaults were black and Hispanic and all but one of the victims was
white had led to public speculation that the attacks were racially
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   But police said that wasn't the case and noted two of the youths
arrested are white and one of the victims was black.
</P>
<P>
   Police have come under fire for not warning residents of the
attacks until after Toews died. Critics said his life might have
been spared if police had warned of the danger. Seven of the
attacks occurred before Toews was assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   But Hairston and Mattheis continued to insist that the
department acted as quickly as it could. They said detectives
weren't able to detect a pattern in the assaults until days after
Toews was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we didn't want to raise the level of fear in the
community,'' Hairston said.
</P>
<P>
   Police will hold community meetings in the next few days to
discuss their handling of the case and assure the public that the
attacks were not racially motivated, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   Police withheld the names of those arrested and released little
information about them. They said some had prior juvenile records.
But others, including the 11-year-old boy, have not been in trouble
before, Mattheis said.
</P>
<P>
   Toews' friends and co-workers, meanwhile, were hoping some good
would result from his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a greater awareness and sense of community now,''
said Cole Peregrine, Toews' supervisor at The Usual Coffee and News
in Tacoma. ``We are not just an island and need to support each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the neighborhoods where the attacks occurred were
relieved to learn of the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be nice to be able to walk on the streets again and
not have to worry about whether someone is sneaking up behind
you,'' said Ronald Taylor, who lives near Wright Park. ``I'm glad
they made some arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody was completely happy. Some worried about the
next outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really depends on what happens next,'' said Deb Tippen, who
lives just a few blocks from where Toews was killed. ``We're safer,
but for how long?'' she asked. ``The arrests are not a permanent
fix.''

OFFICIALS SAY AIR FORCE PILOT WAS `BUZZING' IN-LAWS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CHRIS VAUGHN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ An Air Force Reserve pilot killed Monday
evening was ``buzzing'' his in-law's farmhouse when he apparently
lost control of his F-16 and crashed into their field, authorities
and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Stephen W. Simons' actions in the minutes leading up to the
fatal accident _ witnessed by his in-laws and a number of family
friends outside the farming community of Tulia in the Texas
Panhandle _ is likely to be the focus of the Air Force's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as stunned colleagues from the Fort Worth-based
301st Fighter Wing mourned privately, Air Force safety
investigators arrived to interview witnesses and examine the
wreckage of the single-seat, single-engine $20 million jet fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Simons, 41, of Fort Worth, an experienced fighter pilot of
almost 20 years, was headed east to Naval Air Station Fort Worth
from Utah on Monday evening when he flew low over his in-laws'
house, said Trooper Wayne Beighle of the Department of Public
Safety in Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was saying `hi' and something went wrong,'' Beighle said.
``We had no indications the plane was trailing smoke or there were
any problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One witness said he had done aerobatic maneuvers before the
crash. This wasn't the first pass he had made.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Byrd, a neighbor and long-time friend of Simons' in-laws,
witnessed the accident with her husband, who had come out of their
farm implement business to see Simons pass by about 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came by twice,'' she said. ``We don't know what happened.
He lost altitude and clipped a little hog shed. It's just terrible.
It's something you don't want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Byrds counted Simons as a friend. He visited this summer
when his family was in town, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Monday's flyover of his in-laws wasn't the first one.
``He had done it before,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Roberta Smith, a spokeswoman for the 10th Air Force, said
there would be no comment on the reports of Simons' actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those rumors and hearsay and eyewitness reports are all things
the accident investigation board looks at,'' Smith said. ``They'll
be completely thorough in finding out what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Simons family said they did not want to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Simons' death shook the close-knit brotherhood of the 457th
Fighter Squadron, which he belonged to since the early 1990s. The
last time a squadron member was killed was 1987, when an F-4
crashed into Lake Worth near the naval air base, killing the pilot
and weapons officer.
</P>
<P>
   The squadron ceased flying operations Tuesday and isn't likely
to resume them for another day or two to give pilots a break,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in shock,'' said Maj. Jeff Smiley, the squadron's
operations officer. ``We're just numb and we're trying to collect
ourselves. We need to find out what happened and we need to take
care of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley described Simons, the father of two girls, as a
``Renaissance man,'' who spoke German and Spanish and was a
``first-rate'' pilot who had more than 2,000 hours in the F-16,
F-15 and F-4 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   He had combat sorties over Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iraq,
including a stint this summer enforcing the so-called no-fly zone
over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Simons, a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, had also been
a first officer for Delta Air Lines since 1988, most of that time
based out of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. This summer, he began
flying out of John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on the Boeing
767, an airline spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was an awesome dad and husband,'' Smiley said. ``I had a
lot of envy for him because of the way he handled his personal
life. His family came first.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force will conduct two separate, concurrent
investigations _ one that is released only to Air Force personnel
and one that is public. The Secretary of the Air Force will also
receive a briefing on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The safety investigation, which is not public, is usually
completed within a month and is used internally to try to prevent
future accidents, said Col. Dave Williamson, chief of the safety
issues division at the Pentagon.

U.S. NEWS CHIEF AT CNN EXPECTED TO QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Kaplan, who has been the president of CNN's U.S.
news-gathering operation since 1997, is expected to announce
Wednesday that he is leaving the network, executives close to the
situation said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN executives are also planning to announce other major changes
in the network's executive structure.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation comes at a particularly difficult time for CNN,
a unit of Time Warner Inc., leaving its leadership unclear in the
heart of a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's ratings have been sliding precipitously recently and its
parent company is about to complete its merger with America Online.
In some respects, the timing could not be worse, losing the chief
of its domestic news unit while it is in the midst of covering the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   News of Kaplan's departure began circulating through CNN late
Tuesday afternoon and took many on his staff by surprise. There
were conflicting reports as to whether he was leaving on his own
accord or if he was asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, his tenure at the network has been rocky.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan joined CNN after a 17-year career as a producer at ABC
News, where he won 34 Emmy Awards serving as executive producer of
both of that network's leading news programs ``Nightline'' and
``World News Tonight.'' He also became the first executive producer
of the ABC news magazine program ``Prime Time Live.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his hiring, CNN executives said they expected him
to lead the network to improved ratings. But his time at CNN has
been marked by a series of confrontations over news and personnel
decisions. The main show that Kaplan created, ``CNN Newsstand,''
was embroiled in an embarrassing fiasco in 1998 when its very first
program, called ``Tailwind,'' a report charging that U.S. forces
used nerve gas in Vietnam, was found to be so full of errors that
it had to be retracted, complete with an on-the-air apology. Two
producers were fired and one executive resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's job was considered in jeopardy at the time but he was
absolved of the final responsibility for the broadcast by the CNN
President Tom Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the highly popular Lou Dobbs, the anchor of the
network's most profitable program, `'Moneyline'' quit after
fighting with Kaplan over news coverage that interrupted Dobbs'
programs. ``Moneyline'' has since dropped sharply in both ratings
and profits, and Dobbs has been publicly wooed by NBC.

   At one point last year, CNN's founder, Ted Turner, expressed
interest in bringing Dobbs back to CNN, a move that Kaplan strongly
opposed. Dobbs did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Many at CNN had expected that Kaplan would leave the network
after this year's election campaign was over.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation Tuesday night that his departure might
have had something to do with the network's ratings during the
Republican National Convention, which were lower than they were
four years ago. However, its ratings did recover for the Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word Tuesday night on who will replace Kaplan. But
several people close to the situation said there would be various
other changes in store for the CNN executive structure.
</P>
<P>
   Eason Jordan, who is in charge of International news for the
network, was expected to be promoted to an editorial position in
which he would oversee all the CNN news operations. Jim Walton, in
charge of CNN's sports division, was also expected to take a larger
role with the network.

FOSTER'S DEAL TO BUY BERINGER PUTS OTHER WINERIES IN PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Foster's Brewing Group's $1.14 billion
acquisition of Beringer Wine Estates Holdings is likely to prompt a
new wave of consolidation among California's premium wineries,
analysts and industry executives said on Tuesday. The deal, they
said, effectively puts the ownership of significant independent
winemakers in play.
</P>
<P>
   News of the offer for Beringer by Foster, the Australian beer
and wine company, came a day after another California wine
producer, R &UR; . &LR; H. Phillips, said it would be purchased by Vincor
International of Canada for $92 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other independent winemakers that could become takeover targets
include Kendall-Jackson, Robert Mondavi and Sutter Home.
Kendall-Jackson, considered a likely candidate for an initial
public offering, had been in talks with Beringer about a possible
merger, but the talks broke off last week, an executive close to
the winery said, because of conditions raised by Jess Jackson,
Kendall-Jackson's founder.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Beringer, Foster is buying the oldest operating
winery in the Napa Valley of California, with 10,200 acres of
vineyards. Beringer _ which over the years has grown well beyond
its onetime boutique-winery status _ had sales of $700 million in
the fiscal year that ended in June. In addition to Beringer labels,
its brands include Chateau St. Jean, Souverain and Napa Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Foster already owns several leading Australian winemakers, and
in February, it bought Windsor Vineyards in the Sonoma Valley of
California, the No. 2 direct seller of wine in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the acquisition of Beringer, Jean-Michelle Valette, a
wine industry consultant and former president of Franciscan
Vineyards, said, ``While there were half a dozen premium wine
companies that had all attained the same scale over time, all of a
sudden you now have a clearly dominant player, with global reach
and distribution in a number of significant markets. I think it's
going to cause a big scramble among the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Beringer rose $10.25 on Tuesday, to $55.31 on the
Nasdaq Stock Exchange; Robert Mondavi added $1.13, to $40 on the
Nasdaq. Class A shares of Canandaigua Brands, of Fairport, N.Y.,
were up $2.19, to $53.81 on the New York Stock Exchange.

SUPREME COURT CONTINUES STAY BARRING MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court continued a ban Tuesday on the
distribution of marijuana for medical purposes in California,
signaling that it might consider the issue in its fall term.
</P>
<P>
   The court voted 7-1 to grant an emergency request from the
Clinton administration to postpone enforcement of a lower court
ruling that would have allowed the Oakland Cannabis Buyers'
Cooperative to distribute the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision was the latest development in a clash between
federal narcotics laws and a 1996 California voters' initiative to
allow seriously ill patients to grow and use marijuana for pain
relief, with doctors' approval. Similar initiatives have since been
passed in several other states.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, had
ruled that medical necessity could be a defense to a federal
criminal charge of distributing drugs. That ruling overturned an
earlier one by U.S. DisTrict Judge Charles R. Breyer in San
Francisco that barred distribution of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers had called the 9th Circuit finding
dangerous and said it would encourage drug traffickers and promote
disrespect for the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision to stay the 9th Circuit ruling was
not surprising; it would have been extraordinary for the highest
court in the land not to let the government have its day before the
tribunal. The court will decide whether to hear the case when it
returns for its fall term.
</P>
<P>
   Only Justice John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the
government had failed to show that allowing ``seriously ill and
dying patients'' to use marijuana would undermine the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer disqualified himself because he is
Judge Charles Breyer's brother.
</P>
<P>
   The case is U.S. v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, A-145.

BUYOUT OF DLJ CATAPULTS CREDIT SUISSE INTO GOLDMAN SACHS' LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DLJ-CREDIT-SUISSE) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When investment bankers talk about the competition,
they tend to base much of their comparisons on one slice of the
business: the high-flying, much publicized world of mergers and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Credit Suisse's acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette illustrates the importance placed on the multibillion
industry of advising companies on whom they should take over or
sell to next.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between Credit Suisse and Donaldson is expected to
catapult the combined company into a league with Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the top two firms and possibly
edging out Merrill Lynch for No. 3 in completed deals so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the acquisition bolsters Credit Suisse's mergers
and acquisitions practice in key areas like the ultracompetitive
and fast-growing telecommunications industry. Donaldson has advised
on some of the largest telecommunications deals recently, working
on Deutsche Telekom's acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless for about
$50 billion and France Telecom's purchase of Orange for $37.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomson Financial Securities Data, Credit Suisse
First Boston, the investment banking unit of Credit Suisse, ranked
No. 4 in completed merger and acquisition deals worldwide for the
first half of the year, completing 173 deals, which represents 21.2
percent of the advisory market.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson ranked No. 14, with 157 deals, representing 6.5
percent of the advisory market.
</P>
<P>
   Combining Donaldson's telecommunications advisory team with
Credit Suisse First Boston's telecommunications and well-respected
technology group should help the new firm raise even more business
as both industries continue to converge, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Credit Suisse First Boston lured Frank Quattrone
away from Deutsche Bank to build its technology team, making it one
of the best in country. Credit Suisse First Boston's technology
team has advised on deals like Terra Network's acquisition of Lycos
for $12.5 billion.

 &HT;    Bengals' Dillon returns to practice following arrest
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Bengals Pro Bowl tailback Corey Dillon returned to
practice on Tuesday, but gave few details about an alleged
altercation with his wife that led to his arrest in a Seattle
suburb on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a hallway outside the Bengals locker room at Paul
Brown Stadium, Dillon refused to discuss what happened but wouldn't
deny that he struck his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tragedy that this happened,'' he said. ``I never
intended to be in this situation and bring this kind of cloud over
the team. I never intended for this to happen. It's bad. It's real
bad. Hopefully, in due time, it'll be cleared up and I can move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy, arrested players
are ``required to undergo an immediate, mandatory clinical
evaluation and, if directed, appropriate counseling'' that is
supervised by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Players convicted of a crime are subject to disciplinary action
by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue that could include a fine or
suspension without pay. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league
doesn't comment on cases unless a fine or suspension is announced.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon, who has a hearing scheduled Sept. 27, met with Bengals
president Mike Brown, head coach Bruce Coslet and running backs
coach Jim Anderson on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to talk to (us),'' Brown said. ``We had a meeting
and he explained what happened. I don't think it's understood
accurately publicly, but he has to bear up under the criticism and
earn his way back into the good graces of the pubic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In time, this will be resolved and when everyone has a better
knowledge of it, I think it will fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Bengals front office said Dillon's ordeal could
affect his performance on the field. Dillon held out 20 days of
training camp before signing a one-year $3 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' said Eric Ball, a former Bengals
running back who works with players as the team's director of
player relations. ``He's had a long battle with his contract. He's
worked hard. He's done well. He's done what has been expected of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this (arrest), it's going to be a setback. But I think
Corey is the type of person who can bounce back from it and move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon, 24, was arrested in Federal Way, Wash., on Saturday by
police officers who responded to a domestic violence complaint.
</P>
<P>
   When officers arrived, they found Dillon's wife bleeding from
the mouth in front of a house. Dillon, who was in the driveway, was
booked into the King County jail for investigation of fourth-degree
assault and was released a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the couple were in a car when the alleged fight took
place. Dillon's wife got out of the car and walked one block to the
address where police were summoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to explain my side of the story,'' Dillon said. ``But
right now, it really doesn't matter what I say. This is prejudged.
Right now, me talking about it is not going to help the situation.
As far as I'm concerned, this should have never happened. This was
accidental and in due time I hope people will see what really
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been tough on both of us. It's pretty tough on me. I
really haven't had that much contact with her, and I've been
advised not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon's arrest is the latest setbacks for the team.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the NFL's anti-crime policy, Bengals starting left
guard Matt O'Dwyer was suspended the first two games of the 2000
season for his involvement in a July 1999 bar brawl in Long Beach,
N.Y. His suspension was later reduced to one game. He'll miss the
Sept. 10 opener against the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Kick returner Tremain Mack and offensive tackle Jamain Stephens
were each suspended four games in 1999 for violating the NFL's
Substance Abuse Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon had been arrested in March 1998. He was charged with
driving under the influence, negligent driving and driving with a
suspended license. Three months later, he pleaded guilty to lesser
charges of negligent driving and driving with a suspended license,
got fined $500 and received two years probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my teammate,'' quarterback Akili Smith said of Dillon.
``I'm going to trust whatever he says and then it's time to move
on.''

AUSTRALIAN BREWER BUYS BERINGER WINE FOR $1.14 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   By HELEN PITT   
 WineToday.com   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ Australia's Foster's Brewing Group Ltd.
announced that it has acquired leading California premium wine
producer Beringer Wine Estates, a California premium wine producer,
for an estimated $1.14 billion or $2 billion in Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, announced Tuesday in Melbourne, is part of a
merger agreement between the two companies. Following the merger,
Beringer would be wholly owned by Foster's, which also owns the
Australian wine company Mildara Blass. Foster's said in addition to
its tender offer, it will also assume $319 million in Beringer debt
($560 million in Australian dollars).
</P>
<P>
   Mildara Blass owns a number of Australian wineries, including
The Rothbury Estate, Wolf Blass, Jamiesons Run, Yarra Ridge and
Yellowglen.
</P>
<P>
   Beringer owns several top-selling U.S. premium wineries, among
them Chateau St Jean, Chateau Souverain, Meridian Vineyards, Stags'
Leap Winery and St Clement.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will be launched by way of a tender offer for
Beringer shares at $55.75 cash per share. Beringer stock closed
Monday on Wall Street for $45 1/16, up $1.50 from Friday's close of
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Beringer senior management team, including chairman and
chief executive Walt Klenz, and Wine Master Ed Sbragia will
continue with the company following the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's president and chief executive officer Ted Kunkel said
acquiring Beringer will create the world's first truly global
premium wine company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining event for Foster's,'' Kunkel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This combination gives us a business partner with a similar
philosophy,'' said Klenz in a prepared statement. ``It will provide
us with access to new markets and new business opportunities which
assures Beringer Wine Estates' place as a key player in the world's
premium wine industry going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In a webcast conference from Melbourne, Kunkel said the
acquisition would double the size of Foster's wine division and
create a ``new industry leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential exists for significant global cross-selling
opportunities between Beringer and Mildara Blass, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exports currently account for 50 percent of Mildara Blass'
revenue, while Beringer's exports currently account for less than 4
percent of Beringer's, Kunkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's bought Mildara Blass, one of Australia's top five wine
companies, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The deal shocked some wine industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This floors me,'' said Jon Fredrikson of the San Francisco
wine research and consulting firm of Gomberg, Fredrikson and
Associates. ``At the price they are agreeing to pay, they are
showing how much faith and respect they have in the wine industry
in the U.S. The price they are paying is something you expect from
the high technology field and not from the wine industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredrikson said that Foster's has already proved its interest in
getting into the U.S. market when in February it bought Windsor
Vineyards, with annual sales of $34 million, as part of its online
wine retailing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives them (Foster's Mildara Blass) some good positioning
for the premium brands; they should get more shelf space lineage in
U.S. stores even in the same price point,'' said Eileen Fredrikson
of Gomberg Fredrikson. She added that even though Beringer has a
strong export arm, Foster s will add some international strength
for its exports.
</P>
<P>
   One question on the minds of some analysts is what happened to
the rumors swirling about Beringer buying Kendall-Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still can't comment on those kinds of rumors,'' said Mora
Cronin, vice president of public relations for Beringer. ``We can
comment on this (the Foster's acquisition) and we're excited about
it and the new chapter in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall-Jackson had no comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin said that no changes are expected as a result of the
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, it is business as usual. No layoffs are planned.
The organization will remain unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Beringer is the oldest continuously operating winery in the Napa
Valley. Texas Pacific Group, an investment firm, and its affiliates
own 52 percent of Beringer. Beringer owns or controls more than
10,000 acres of vineyards in California.
</P>
<P>
   Combined revenues for Beringer Wine Estates and Mildara Blass
Ltd. for the first half of 2000 were $886 million.

   E-COMMERCE AMAZON.COM TO OPEN FRENCH WEB SITE

<P>
   The online retailer Amazon.com will open a French-language Web
site, selling books, music and videos. The new site, Amazon.fr, is
the company's third venture outside the United States, after online
stores for Britain and Germany. A spokeswoman said the company
hoped to serve French speakers outside of France as well.
Amazon.com, based in Seattle, will operate the French site from

Separately, Amazon.com announced that it had expanded its marketing

   MUSIC SITE MAKING A SHIFT
</P>
<P>
   GetMusic, the online site owned by two big music labels,
Bertelsmann and Seagram's Universal Music group, is getting out of
selling music. GetMusic plans to announce Wednesday that it is
entering five European countries, but the music sales will be
handled by Bertelsmann's BOL unit. GetMusic is also looking for a
company to take over the music store it now runs on its original
site in the United States, perhaps CDNow, the ailing company that
Bertelsmann agreed to buy last month, said Andrew Nibley,
GetMusic's chief executive. Nibley asserted that GetMusic, with 1.2
million users, had strong prospects as a media company, earning
money from advertising. For now, it is the No. 1 site for Internet
users under the age of 12, thanks largely to its close ties to
Britney Spears and N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   BRONFMAN MAY TESTIFY AGAINST MP3.COM
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Seagram Co., Edgar J. Bronfman, Jr., is
expected to testify Wednesday in a federal trial being held to
determine the scope of the damages that MP3.com will pay Seagram's
Universal Music Group for violating its copyrights with its
Internet music service. MP3.com's chief executive, Michael
Robertson, concluded testifying before a skeptical Judge Jed Rakoff
on Tuesday, saying he had not set out to willfully violate
Universal's copyrights when he created an online database of
thousands of albums.

<P>
   INTERNET BET IS BUYING 360HIPHOP
</P>
<P>
   BET.com, a Web site created in February as adjunct to the Black
Entertainment Television cable network, has reached a tentative
agreement to buy a key competitor, 360HIPHOP.com. That Web site,
started in June by Russell Simmons, the founder of Def Jam Records,
is geared to music trends and information. Under the agreement, the
two companies will combine business operations, but maintain
separate Web sites. BET.com is ranked among the most popular
African-American-oriented sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   NEW VERTICALONE BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   VerticalOne, a unit of the S1 Corp., is expected to announce
Wednesday that it will provide account-aggregation services to
Yahoo and to Wells Fargo bank, allowing them to provide a single
place on the Internet where their customers can keep all of their
financial data, like the balances in their bank and brokerage
accounts, frequent-flier programs and credit cards.

   HARDWARE GATEWAY TRIES TAX PROMOTION
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to take the no-tax edge away from pure direct-sales
rivals like Dell, Gateway will temporarily absorb the sales tax for
consumers who buy desktop and notebook PCs at most of its 290
Country Store locations. The promotion, which began Tuesday and
ends Thursday, was started after Gateway executives saw sales spike
when states like Pennsylvania and South Carolina offered sales-tax
blackout periods to their residents. ``The response to that program
was huge, so we decided to extend it to additional states,'' said
Brad Williams, a company spokesman.

   DALLAS _ A federal judge has ruled that Texas' system for
administering preventive medicine and certain other health care for
children in Medicaid programs is badly flawed, and he has ordered
the state to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Judge William Wayne Justice of U.S. District Court found
that the state had not lived up to the terms of a 1996 consent
decree or provided appropriate health care under federal law to
more than 1.5 million children eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ruling was focused on the Early Periodic Screening,
Diagnosis and Treatment program, which exists, the judge said, ``to
ensure that poor children receive comprehensive health care at an
early age, so that they will develop fewer health problems as they
grow older.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice, in a ruling filed Aug. 14, found, among other
things, that the state had failed to educate indigent families
about available treatments and had not provided transportation to
see doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also found that the managed care plans that serve
about one in three Texans on Medicaid had not provided appropriate
care. He cited inadequate and incomplete medical checkups and said
that in some cases health maintenance organizations had improperly
blocked children's access to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   In one example, the judge cited testimony about a 17-month-old
boy who had been treated for ear infections 17 times. After
treating the boy three more times, the boy's new primary care
doctor sought permission from the family's Medicaid HMO to send the
boy to an ear, nose and throat specialist. But the request was
turned down because the primary care provider had not treated the
boy six times in the past six months, as was required by the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit was filed in 1993 on behalf of Texas
children eligible for Medicaid. About 1.4 million children in the
state do not have health insurance, according to public-interest
groups, and about 600,000 of those are eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
presidential candidate, has faced accusations of striking
inadequacies in the state's health care for poor and uninsured
children.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush's office, said the state
was spending more money on Medicaid outreach programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is important for children to receive
preventative health care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit originally resulted in the 1996 consent decree meant
to improve health care for indigent children. But earlier this
year, lawyers for the plaintiffs returned to federal court in
Austin to argue that the state was not living up to the decree.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Zinn, the lead plaintiff lawyer, noted that last year
Texas lawmakers enacted a moratorium on expanding managed care into
any new areas of the state. ``The judge's finding on managed care
confirms that the state does not yet have its house in order,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolynn Singleton, a registered nurse who owns four clinics in
North Texas that serve mostly poor patients, described the state
system as chaotic and very difficult for indigent patients to
navigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most are worried about keeping their lights and water on, not
whether their child has immunizations or health care,'' said
Singleton, who testified in the suit. The system, she said,
``imposes too many barriers that isolates them from that care.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered the state to propose remedies within 60 days.
Defendants include officials at the state's Health and Human
Services Commission and Department of Health. Both agencies, which
are run by appointees of Bush, referred questions about the lawsuit
to the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Horton, a spokeswoman for that office, said the attorney
general had not decided whether to appeal, and that it was too soon
to say what remedies might be proposed. She declined to comment
about the judge's characterizations of the state's system, but she
pointed to court filings by the state that contend that the state's
efforts are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   According to those filings, the state made almost 5 million
``outreach'' contacts to clients last year; the budget for medical
transportation has increased by 300 percent; and a $7.6 million
contract for Medicaid outreach services is the largest in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Zinn noted that lawmakers, including Bush, have pushed tax cuts,
representing money that could go toward health care and other
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts pushed by Bush have become a political issue as the
state has run into a larger-than-expected budget shortfall, owing
in part to higher Medicaid expenses from rising prescription costs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say Bush's state tax cuts have hurt services, and
suggest that his national tax-cut proposals are risky. Republicans
say shortfalls happen every budget cycle.

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, Aug. 27
about an MSNBC billboard promoting ``The News With Brian Williams''
misstated a comparison between the average audience for the
program's 9 p.m. showing and what MSNBC says was its cumulative
audience during April. The average nightly audience of 203,000 is
one-206th of the cumulative audience of 42 million, which includes
the number of different viewers tuned in to at least one minute of
any of its showings, including four repeats a night. It is not

&HT;    UNION CARD FULFILLS A DREAM FOR BUDDING MAKEUP ARTIST

   LOS ANGELES _ Tinseltown is an ideal place to reinvent yourself
career-wise, as Kathleen Freeman-Smith said she found after leaving
her native London and her life as a variety show dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Only, at first she had no idea what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the Toluca Lake resident will mark this Labor
Day as a makeup artist for feature films and TV shows as a new
member of Make-Up Artists &AMP; Hair Stylists, Local706.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the union ended three years of nonunion shoots that
dragged on for up to 18 hours for little, if any, pay -- conditions
that took the glamour out of prepping stars like Timothy Hutton and
Rebecca DeMornay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, definitely hard,'' said Freeman-Smith, 32.
``There's a lot of people out there that want to do the same thing.
You start out and work for free or assist people and take whatever
you can to build up a portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a union trainee, she can become a journeyman in two years
and head a production's makeup department.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming one of the 1,429 active union members makes
Freeman-Smith eligible for health benefits, a pension and industry
recognition, said union representative John Inzerella.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to have a career in this, you have to be
part of the union -- we have all the big shows,'' Inzerella said.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in north London, Freeman-Smith said, she never
envisioned living in Los Angeles, working in the film business.
</P>
<P>
   She met her future husband on a cruise ship in the Mediterranean
and followed him first to his hometown of Atlanta before they moved
to Los Angeles so he could pursue a career making documentaries and
films.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in no position to help me, but certainly being close to
productions got me serious enough to look a little further into
what I might want to do,'' Freeman-Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-week course in makeup in Hollywood introduced her to the
craft. It was up to her to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of glamour in it -- you work long hours,
you're up at 5 in the morning, working nights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Smith said he knew his wife's persistence would pay off:
``She came to America not knowing what she wanted to do and after
seeing my line of work in film and television, she might be
interested in makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman-Smith said she enjoys the technical challenges of
applying regular and special effects makeup and has little interest
in meeting celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   During the years of struggle, she kept focused on her goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first leave makeup school, everyone's desperate to
join the union,'' she said. ``Everyone has the impression that once
you're in the union, you start to work on big movies. Now that I'm
in the union, it's great, but you have to start on the bottom again
and work your way up.''
</P>
<P>
   That means building a rapport with producers and directors of
union shoots because her old contacts on nonunion productions are
of no use now.
</P>
<P>
   Union membership has conferred several advantages, such as
working feature films, getting significantly better pay plus
overtime, something her nonunion colleagues only dream of.
</P>
<P>
   But the uncertainties of her early career persist in prospects
of a strike next year by actors, writers and directors that could
be financially devastating for all production workers.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: BIG CORPORATE TRAVEL-MANAGEMENT COMPANIES
OPTIMISTIC

   ``I'm sorry, I don't see you in the computer at all,'' said the
ticket agent at the Continental Airlines counter. She had been very
helpful, tapping away diligently, looking for my name and the
electronic ticket that I insisted would be attached to it.
</P>
<P>
   Beside me, my wife looked plenty worried. She always travels
with a paper ticket, which she books through a travel agent. But I
sometimes use e-tickets, booking bargain fares through one of the
online travel sites.
</P>
<P>
   On this day in mid-August, we were traveling together on
separate business, happily to the same place: Phoenix. We'd also
tacked on a week of vacation, planning to finish our chores within
a few days and then drive down to Tucson to ride horses for a week
at a ranch in the Sonoran Desert.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket clerk stopped tapping and gave me a look of dark
sympathy. The word ``whoa'' formed in my mind. This is embarrassing
to admit, considering that I write a newspaper column about, ahem,
business travel, but it seems that I had showed up at the airport
with a piece of paper that said ``Arizona Trip'' across the top.
The paper, which I thought was a printout of a confirmed e-ticket
reservation, was in fact nothing more than a printout of a planned
itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Through my own dumb fault, when I thought I was booking my
multiple-destination ticket online about six weeks earlier, I had
neglected to click through to actually complete the purchase. I had
printed out the incomplete itinerary and tucked it in my travel
folder, blissfully unaware that I didn't have a ticket. Now the
plane was about to board, and all I had was a sheet of typing
paper.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the flight was full except for a single first-class seat,
priced at a terrifying $2,200, one-way. Worse yet, there was no
flexibility in my schedule. I absolutely had to be in Phoenix that
night for a series of interviews starting the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   In a fix like this, who you gonna call? Well, friends, you
better believe I called a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   My wife flew off on schedule. Desperate, I phoned American
Express and explained the problem. The agent tapped for about 30
seconds and, voila, I was booked a few hours later on a nonstop
Continental flight from Newark to Phoenix, with a return flight
from Tucson. What's more, the agent informed me that I was
automatically upgraded to first class, since I was paying full
fare. I got to Phoenix only about six hours behind schedule, and we
were galloping across the desert a week after that.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could report that the cost to keep me on schedule was
somewhere close to the original $660 fare I believed I had booked
online. In fact, it was about $2,100, round trip. This illustrates
the difference between the prices for air fares paid by most
leisure travelers, who have the flexibility to book well in
advance, and business travelers, who often do not have any
flexibility and have to make last-minute arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   But my experience also illustrates a reason major
travel-management companies, after a few years in which the travel
agent world has been rocked and compressed by the virtual
disappearance of commissions from airlines, are feeling pretty
optimistic these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get jammed up on a trip, and it sure is nice to pick up
the phone and have someone fix the problem right away,'' said Hal
Rosenbluth, the chief executive of Rosenbluth International, one of
the top five U.S.-based corporate travel-management companies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, hundreds of small travel agencies have gone out
of business as airlines sharply reduced commissions. But at the
annual convention of the National Business Travel Association in
Los Angeles last month, representatives from the big
travel-management companies were sounding quite happy.
</P>
<P>
   Smart travel-management companies, which now charge fees for
services rendered rather than depending on commissions from the
airlines, are in fact prospering in a new competitive environment
that cedes a small portion of the market to the pure online bargain
bookings and at the same time opens up more room for specialized
services, especially for corporate travel.
</P>
<P>
   The big agencies are ``no longer seen as intermediaries for the
airlines,'' said Jud Linville, president for corporate services at
American Express, where air travel bookings grew 13 percent last
year, to $10.9 billion. Travel management has become ``a very
rational business _ we get paid for the value we create,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the big travel agencies are actually scrambling to hire
people. ``The industry now has a lot of technology with not a lot
of forethought,'' said Rosenbluth, whose company booked $2.4
billion in air sales last year, according to Business Travel News,
a trade publication. ``One of our real concerns now is the need to
attract good people'' to handle growing customer service demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to come down to who can attract, train and retain
the best people,'' he said. &QL;

AT&AMP;T SHARES UP ON SPEEDY EXCITE(AT)HOME DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO with ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's stock rose Tuesday on the news that the company had
incorporated Excite(at)Home into its operations more quickly than
expected, suggesting a speedier move into high-speed Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not all good news for AT&AMP;T investors. Standard &AMP;
Poor's said Tuesday that it had put the company's debt on review
for a possible downgrade, citing management miscues and costly
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   After the stock markets closed on Monday, AT&AMP;T said that it had
increased its voting stake in Excite(at)Home to 74 percent from 56
percent, giving it a controlling interest. AT&AMP;T will now include in
its own results the figures for Excite(at)Home, a broadband
provider based in Redwood City, Calif. The companies had been
expected to consolidate their financial results in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T has thrown a life preserver to Excite,'' said Emily
Meehan, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a communications consulting
company. ``Now it remains to be seen whether Excite will bleed
profits from AT&AMP;T or get turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors bid AT&AMP;T's stock up $1.13, to $32 Tuesday, but the
shares remain deeply depressed, off nearly 50 percent from the
52-week high in November. The company is said to be considering a
number of ways to bolster the stock.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P, the credit-rating agency, cited concerns about AT&AMP;T's
costly acquisitions of TCI and MediaOne, which made it the nation's
largest cable television operator, as major reasons for putting the
stock on its watch list for possible downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a fait accompli, but it shows we're very concerned
about the general direction of AT&AMP;T,'' said Rick Siderman, senior
telecommunications credit analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's. Still, it
is not clear if any downgrade will increase AT&AMP;T's borrowing costs,
because Moody's Investors Service already rates AT&AMP;T lower than
S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P said that AT&AMP;T's long-term debt could be cut more than one
notch below its double-A-minus rating and its short-term rating of
A-1-plus.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, S&AMP;P expressed concerns about ``operational and
management miscues'' in AT&AMP;T's core businesses of long-distance
service, which has been squeezed by fierce competition, and its
wireless services _ concerns echoed by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management has gone from little room for error to almost
none,'' said Pascal Aguirre, principal in the business strategy
group at Renaissance Strategy Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Closing the Excite(at)Home transaction early will have little
impact on the company's earnings projections for the entire year,
stock analysts said. But for the third quarter, AT&AMP;T's earnings
will be reduced by an estimated 5 cents. Operating earnings will be
35 to 38 cents a share, the company said, down from its previous
target of 40 cents to 43 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Excite(at)Home lost an estimated $2.5 billion last year on
revenue of about $500 million and continues to lose money this
year, according to Renaissance Strategy.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T picked up another company Tuesday that did little to
improve its bottom line immediately but gave it a solid footing in
Latin America. AT&AMP;T Latin America, which was formed by AT&AMP;T last
year, merged with the South American telecommunications company
FirstCom to form Latin America's newest specialized broadband
communications provider.
</P>
<P>
   FirstCom, whose stock had been traded on the Nasdaq, has served
businesses and other high-volume customers in major cities in
Chile, Colombia and Peru. During the first six months of this year,
it posted a net loss of $32.4 million, or $1.06 a share. Patricio
Northland, FirstCom's chief executive, attributed the losses to the
heavy build-out of the company's fiber optics network in the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The new AT&AMP;T Latin America stock began trading on Nasdaq on
Tuesday and closed virtually unchanged at $17.38. Since the
regional company was formed last year, AT&AMP;T Latin America has
aggressively moved into the region, by acquiring Netstream in
Brazil and Keytech LD in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Northland, who is now chief executive of AT&AMP;T Latin America,
said the company had identified 22 business centers in Latin
America where it would focus its marketing efforts. It already has
a substantial presence in 10 of them.

A CALIFORNIA JUDGE SAYS FORD FACES IGNITION RECALL
</HEADLINE>
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a ruling that could deal a blow to the Ford Motor Co., a
California judge late Tuesday largely agreed with complaints that
Ford knowingly installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly 2
million vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In his tentative decision, Alameda County Superior Court Judge
Michael E. Ballachey said he intended to issue orders ``compelling
recall and repair'' of the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The part in question is an ignition module that regulates
current to the sparkplugs. In 300 models, the module was mounted on
the distributor near the engine block, where it was exposed to high
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Car buyers' lawyers said Ford had been warned by an engineer
that high temperatures would cause the device to fail and stall the
engine. Consumer advocates estimated the costs to Ford of
compliance would be $70 million to $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision, which will be discussed at a hearing at the
Alameda County Court on Sept. 28, could be more damaging to Ford's
reputation than to its finances, consumer advocates said. In the
wake of the Firestone tire recall, the company is working hard to
retain public trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bad news at a bad time,'' said Clarence M. Ditlow of
the Center for Auto Safety in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the tire recall, he continued, the company is
mounting television ads that say, ``Trust us, we put safety first.
This decision says, We put profits first.''
</P>
<P>
   The California plaintiffs brought their case against Ford in
September 1997. Their lawyers produced documents intended to
establish that Ford withheld information from federal regulators
about the engineering defect.
</P>
<P>
   In his 10-page ruling, Ballachey was sharply critical of the way
Ford dealt with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
``Ford's strategy, clearly established by the credible evidence,
was `If you don't ask the right question, we don't have to answer
with what common sense tells us you want to know,''' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Krusel, a Ford spokeswoman, said, ``The real-world data
and engineering analysis is in direct conflict with the court's
ruling.'' She added: ``There is simply nothing to fix. We expect
this ruling will be reversed on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, a mistrial was declared in the first phase of the
case, in which jurors were asked to determine if Ford was liable
for damages. In that trial, Ford denied any defects.

SWEDISH COMPANY BEGINS HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID FOR LONDON STOCK
EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL with SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ OM Gruppen AB, the owner of the Stockholm stock
exchange, began a $1.2 billion hostile bid Tuesday for the much
bigger London Stock Exchange, touching off the first takeover fight
for an exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Swedish exchange announced its cash-and-stock
offer, the London exchange _ which is seven times the size of the
Swedish one _ postponed indefinitely its Sept. 14 shareholder vote
on its planned merger with the Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   And, adding to the tumult, Rolf Breuer, the chairman of the
Deutsche Boerse, said in an interview with The International
Herald-Tribune that the exchange was prepared to consider changing
its agreement with the London exchange into ``a friendly takeover''
instead of a merger of equals. Deutsche Boerse, however, would take
its cue from London on whether to proceed with a sweetened offer,
people close to those discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Frankfurt exchange said that it had no plans
to enter a bidding war. But officials there said it was unclear
whether other contenders _ like the Euronext alliance of the Paris,
Belgian and Dutch exchanges _ would also consider an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the debate would reopen, we would be very interested to
enter the debate,'' said Vincent Van Dessel, general manager of the
Brussels exchange. ``But I am not sure an offer is something we can
envisage.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the fate of the 200-year-old London
exchange, and its control of the world's oldest and Europe's
biggest securities market, will most likely be tied more closely to
one or more European exchanges, which are trying to devise new ways
to trade across borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll end up in bed with the Germans or we'll succumb to the
Swedes,'' said Richard Grossman, a director of Redmayne Bentley
Stockbrokers, which is a shareholder in the London exchange.
``London is bound to lose its independence.''
</P>
<P>
   London is dominated by the trading floors of big American banks,
which in the past have supported the idea of a London-Frankfurt
merger because of the trading volumes and increased liquidity it
would yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have the volume and that's what
London-Frankfurt has got,'' one executive said.
</P>
<P>
   A combined London-Frankfurt exchange would be known as iX and
would trade securities with a combined market value of $4.3
trillion, compared with Stockholm's $330 billion. London alone
trades $2.8 trillion in stocks, compared with more than $11
trillion on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's developments come after two years of muddled efforts
by European exchanges to meet investors' demands for a single
market after the introduction of the single European currency, the
euro, and to confront a challenge from cheaper and more nimble
Internet-based stock-trading networks.
</P>
<P>
   Those trends have increased pressure on exchanges like London's
to issue their own shares to speed consolidation. But Tuesday's
hostile bid highlighted the risk of going public in a market as
fragmented as Europe's and as vulnerable to predators. The
London-Frankfurt merger is supposed to be a precursor to an
alliance with the Nasdaq stock market, offering 24-hour global
trading in high-growth stocks. That deal would collapse if the
London-Frankfurt merger falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq said Tuesday that it was ``committed to the iX venture,
with its economies of scale and its vision for a global market
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   However, its chairman, Frank Zarb, said recently that ``Nasdaq
will be in Europe one way or another,'' implying that the exchange
could consider other options.
</P>
<P>
   OM began its hostile bid after officials at the London exchange
rejected an initial overture Friday, saying they were dissatisfied
with the amount of detail OM had provided, according to executives
close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, OM offered stockholders in the London exchange (PS)7
in cash and 0.65 of a new OM share, valuing each share of the
London exchange at (PS)27.19, or $40, 16 percent more than Friday's
closing price. The London exchange called the offer ``derisory''
and urged its shareholders to take no action. OM has 28 days to
publish its offer.
</P>
<P>
   OM said its offer was conditional on 90 percent approval by
London exchange shareholders _ a threshold that might prove
difficult to reach, according to traders in London and Frankfurt.
The London-Frankfurt deal would have required 75 percent approval
at the Sept. 14 meeting, now postponed.
</P>
<P>
   OM's move came after shareholders in the London exchange, most
of them relatively small traders, had already signaled their
unhappiness with the London-Frankfurt deal, arguing that there was
insufficient detail on issues like cost, regulation, clearing and
settling to evaluate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was imperative that there was a delay in voting,'' said
Brian Mairs, a spokesman for an industry group representing private
client and other noninstitutional traders, which account for
one-third of the shares in the London exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to offer the same benefits to us as to the big
players,'' he said, referring to the big banks operating in London,
which have generally remained silent on the OM bid despite the
sense among some of them that, in the words of one executive, ``the
reality is that iX has a lot more support out of the public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some analysts said, the uncertainties surrounding
the Sept. 14 vote probably encouraged OM to make its bid, possibly
to thwart the creation of a European giant or to hobble the
London-Frankfurt merger while OM rolls out the Jiway pan-European
electronic trading platform that it is developing with Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   But the OM bid drew criticism from shareholders like Guinness
Peat, a finance group that owns about 1 percent of the London
exchange, which called the Swedish offer ``pretty unappealing''
because it undervalued the London exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors have complained that OM's bid is based on
overvalued OM stock.
</P>
<P>
   OM, which is using its status as a leading supplier of market
technology to support its bid, went on the offensive Tuesday to
promote its bid, calling it ``a perfect match.''
</P>
<P>
   ``LSE would keep its strong position, with OM, a leading
technological supplier, at its side; it's a very serious
alternative to iX,'' said Olof Stenhammar, OM's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the proposed iX merger squanders the potential
of LSE and that with our proven management skills and leading
technology, we can secure LSE's position as the pre-eminent
European stock exchange,'' he added.

   HOLLYWOOD HOLDOUTS
</P>
<P>
   Joe Eszterhas, the Hollywood screenwriter whose credits include
``Basic Instinct'' and ``Showgirls,'' is urging industry
colleagues, many of them Democrats, not to contribute to the
Democratic Party until Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Joseph
Lieberman explain their positions on ``freedom of creative
expression.'' In a full-page ad in Tuesday's Daily Variety, the
widely read trade paper, Eszterhas took issue with comments by
Lieberman about excessive sex and violence in movies and television
shows. He accused Lieberman of making ``not so veiled threats''
about withholding license renewals, instituting federal
prosecutions and legislating censorship if writers and studios did
not censor themselves. Lieberman's spokeswoman, Kiki McLean,
replied, ``When there are products that are not necessarily good
for our kids and our families, he's not going to be shy to
challenge the industry. He's somebody who believes strongly in the
First Amendment and has always had an open dialogue about what we
can do voluntarily to help our families do better.''
</P>
<P>
   LABOR ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has created a Web site where Vice President Al Gore
will hold a live Web cast on Labor Day for union members. The Web
site will allow union members to send e-mail messages to political
candidates, including the Vice President, Gov. George W. Bush and
members of Congress. The Web site _ www.workingfamilies.com _ will
also feature a speech by John Sweeney, the union president, and
video messages from what labor leaders call ``The Texas Truth
Squad,'' a group of workers from Texas who are traveling the
country to accuse Bush of doing little on issues that unions care
about. On the site, users will also be able to register to vote and
can examine the voting record of candidates for federal office. The
site will be up from Aug. 30 to Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN OUT OF ACTION
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party presidential hopeful Patrick Buchanan has canceled
all public appearances until after Labor Day, after undergoing a
second gall bladder operation because doctors found another stone.
``He feels a lot better and is coming along fine,'' said Brian
Doherty, his campaign spokesman. ``But after two operations and
losing 15 pounds or so from not being able to eat much, he needs to
rest another week.'' Buchanan first underwent a gall stone
operation on Aug. 17. After being released from the hospital on
Aug. 19, he was recovering at his Northern Virginia home when he
had a sharp abdominal pain. Doctors removed a second stone on Aug.
23 and he was released three days later. He plans to remain at home
until Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN ON GORE
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman has a new, pointed pitch about his running
mate. He says Vice President Al Gore is the best leader for the
information age. Speaking to several thousand communications
workers in Anaheim, Calif., Tuesday, Lieberman warned that the
United States could not afford to have a president in the 21st
century who did not understand the new economy and technology.
Then, in a not-so-veiled dig at whether Gov. George W. Bush had the
depth and preparedness to lead in a high-tech age, he invoked a
couple of not-so-swift television cartoon characters, saying, ``We
as a nation can't afford to make Barney Rubble investments in a
George Jetson world.'' Lieberman said that Gore not only understood
the new economy and technology but wanted to speed its advances by
investing in training people and by making college tuition
tax-deductible.

   The Frankfurt exchange indicated it was willing to consider

DUST OF 25   HOUSES COLLAPSING CLOUDS PHILADELPHIA'S REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW JACOBSBy    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Things had been looking up in this long-suffering
city. Downtown was thriving again, the new mayor was still savoring
his honeymoon and this month's Republican National Convention left
Philadelphians with a feel-good, ego-boosting bounce.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria has come crashing down with a spate of building
collapses that have helped to remind people here that there is a
crumbling wasteland of neglected neighborhoods just beyond the
glittering city center.
</P>
<P>
   A soggy summer, decades of deferred maintenance and
Philadelphia's swampy past have conspired against the city's 30,000
vacant and decaying row houses, most of them north of the office
buildings and hotels that have sprouted downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Thursday, 25 buildings have come down, either
partially or fully, and city officials estimate that another 3,100
are in imminent danger of falling. So far no one has been seriously
hurt, though two men were slightly injured by the collapse of a
wood awning. Until last week, the city averaged about 20 collapses
a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is it going to stop?'' Robert Solvibile, the commissioner
in charge of building inspections, asked with exasperation. ``This
is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the rash of collapses a crisis, housing officials
commandeered a police helicopter Tuesday morning and began an
aerial survey of the city's most dilapidated neighborhoods.
Solvibile said airborne inspectors had spotted more than a dozen
buildings on the verge of tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to triple its cadre of 20 inspectors by the end of
the week, the city is teaching housing authority employees how to
spot a dangerously decaying row house. Officials say they plan to
double the number of emergency demolitions to about 60 a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a problem, and we're determined to make sure it's
solved before it becomes a tragedy,'' said Barbara Grant, a
spokeswoman for Mayor John F. Street, who has been in office since
January.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent blush of prosperity, much of Philadelphia
remains untouched by the good times. The city is still saddled with
tracts of abandoned houses, the legacy of a hemorrhaging of 500,000
residents that began in the 1950s. During years of mismanagement
and municipal bankruptcy, the rows of elegantly detailed brick
houses, many now vacant, began to fall into disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   Even occupied houses began to crumble as their owners grew older
and poorer. Mark Alan Hughes, a professor of public policy at the
University of Pennsylvania, said recent studies indicated that more
than half of all home owners in the city were over 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have elderly widows who haven't been up to the third floor
in years,'' Hughes said. ``Then a little leak in the roof and a
rainy summer can lead to a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's swampy terrain has also contributed to the
sagging foundations and listing facades. Although William Penn
built his colonial outpost on solid ground, the 19th-century
builders who threw up thousands of brick-faced row houses for the
growing middle class were not as thoughtful. Many of the most
troubled neighborhoods were built on the soot and debris that
developers used to fill in the marshes that once stretched
alongside the Schuylkill and Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   Even wealthy home owners are bedeviled by the unstable ground,
said Hughes, who had to shore up the walls of his 1866 home with
reinforcing rods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the resources, you can deal with it,'' he said.
``If you don't, it can be catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, other aging cities have tackled the problem of
abandoned housing with more success. Chicago, Baltimore and New
York have aggressive programs to quickly identity and demolish
buildings at risk of falling down. Elyse Fink, a spokeswoman for
the Department of Buildings in New York, said there were only a
handful of collapsed buildings incidents last year, most of them
involving new construction. ``We just don't have as many empty
buildings as we used to,'' Fink said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his mayoral campaign last year, Street made urban
renewal a central theme and he has promised a $250-million
neighborhood rehabilitation program that will be paid for with
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who live in the city's more bedraggled
neighborhoods say they have already seen some improvements. Soon
after his election, the mayor began a program that removed more
than 30,000 abandoned cars from local streets. Even before the
recent spell of collapses, a fast-track demolition process allowed
contractors to dismantle houses as soon as they were condemned by
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the improvements, it was hard to find anyone in North
Philadelphia with rosy predictions of renewal. After years of
living with drugs, poverty and violent crime, many residents said
they now had a new fear: dying beneath a pile bricks.

<P>
   Standing in front of a vacant lot on 29th Street, James Bark,
14, recalled how the house there had quietly fallen in on itself a
few days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cloud of dust was so thick, I couldn't see anything,'' he
said, shaking his head. He looked down the block and gestured to
dozens of other forlorn houses, their facades peeling off, others
with roofs supporting small groves of trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hang out in front of these abandoned buildings,'' he said.
``Any one of those could go. Our house could fall. The house next
door could fall. We just don't know anymore.''

U.S. DEPORTATION LAW DESCENDS STERNLY, AND OFTEN BY SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., N.Y., Texas, Mass.)   By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 21, Alejandro Bontia had a 16-year-old girlfriend
whose mother was angered that her teen-age daughter was involved in
a relationship. She informed the police, and Bontia found himself
charged with sexual contact with a minor and given four years'
probation. Bontia, now 34, a Web designer who is now married with a
son, never had another brush with the law. The youthful dalliance
was, at least in his mind, chalked up to the foibles of
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   But the Immigration and Naturalization Service has a long
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act of 1996, Bontia, because he had a record, was a
wanted man. Immigration service officials stopped him at Newark
International Airport on Jan. 30 as he and his family came back
from a wedding in the Philippines. He was imprisoned for more than
six months before raising bail of $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his old girlfriend wrote a letter in his defense
saying that the relationship was consensual, he is now fighting to
avoid being sent back to the Philippines, where he was born and
lived until he was 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting with other detained immigrants in the Hudson
County Corrections Facility on July 4, watching the special on NBC
with Katie Couric,'' Bontia said. ``She talked about how this was
the land of opportunity, freedom and justice. We howled with
laughter. The motto of the Statue of Liberty in today's America is:
give me your poor, your tired and your hungry, because we still
have empty jail cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been many complaints from immigration
lawyers and even INS officials about the harshness of the 1996
immigration act, the United States is continuing to deport
immigrants who once committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Like phantoms barreling down from a hazy, distant past, ancient
crimes and misdemeanors, sometimes decades old, have been dredged
up by investigators at the immigration service to condemn tens of
thousands of immigrants to swift and usually irrevocable removal
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the crime is irrelevant. If it is considered an
aggravated felony _ shoplifting can be an aggravated felony _ the
immigrant must go. Judges have little or no discretion to ward off
the blunt results of the 1996 legislation, part of the Republicans'
push to rewrite laws considered too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests, with immigration and police officers at times
descending on the homes of people on their list, have been
widespread in recent months. And county jails and detention centers
are being packed in many cases with men and women who were never
sentenced to serve jail time for their original crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Even INS officials concede that treating all immigrants with
equal harshness is unfair. ``The law is sweeping, even
overreaching,'' said Bill Strassberger, an INS spokesman in
Washington. ``We have told Congress that changes need to be made
and some discretion needs to be returned to our immigration judges.
But as the law stands now, the ability of the immigration judges to
look at all aspects of the individual's life, including the crime
committed, whether they are members of the PTA, what their jobs are
or if they have a family is no longer possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are picked up, most are deported. And we are deporting
people who at the time of their conviction did not commit a
deportable offense, but under the new law can be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a bill in the House to soften some effects of the law,
including a provision to remove the section that allows the
immigration service to deport people for crimes that were not
deportable offenses and were committed before 1996. Many
congressmen, including some Republicans who voted for the 1996
legislation, have formally asked the immigration service to ease
up. But for now, the steamroller effect of the law is wreaking
havoc with lives across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sponsors of the 1996 bill that told the INS it had no
discretion tried to get off the hook by then telling the INS to use
the discretion they had purported to take away from the INS,'' said
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``That helped some, but the INS
commissioner cannot order law enforcement officers not to enforce
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints, the number of immigrants being deported
for past crimes has been rising every year since the bill was
passed.
</P>
<P>
   The original bill still has its supporters. Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, who is chairman of the subcommittee on immigration and who
sponsored the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act in the House, said in a statement that before
the bill was passed, Border Patrol agents were ``powerless against
illegal aliens'' who ``knew how to exploit weak federal laws to
avoid deportation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The law provides the Immigration and Naturalization Service
with unprecedented resources and confronts illegal aliens with
tough new laws,'' his statement continued. ``The benefits are
evident. Crime has dropped in border communities. Drug cartels have
been hampered. Illegal immigration has slowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers blame the bill for an increasing number of
lawyers' quitting immigration law. They also say the imposition of
mandatory detention for those who are picked up has crippled the
ability of those lawyers who are left to communicate and plan cases
with their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS moves people, often in the middle of the night, to
remote detention facilities, such as the one in Oakdale, La.,''
said Regis Fernandez, an immigration lawyer in Newark, N.J. ``It is
impossible to effectively represent someone when they are 1,000
miles away and have limited or no access to a phone. It is much
harder for people detained to retain and pay for a lawyer. There
are fewer and fewer attorneys left willing to stomach the absurdity
of this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many families are rudely finding out that fathers or husbands
had minor problems with the law and are coping for the first time
with prolonged absences.
</P>
<P>
   Garibaldy Mejia, 54, a grandfather and livery-cab driver who
founded a radio dispatch company, has been a pillar of the
Dominican community in upper Manhattan's Washington Heights.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 4, on his way back from finalizing the papers after
his father's death in the Dominican Republic, immigration agents at
Kennedy International Airport stopped him. His green card and
Dominican passport were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   He was placed in a detention center, because 15 years ago he was
arrested with a small amount of cocaine and charged with a
misdemeanor. He pleaded guilty to possession, paid a $100 fine and
received two years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia is now being detained in Oakdale, La. Nearly all drug
offenses, no matter what the magnitude, are grounds for deportation
under the law. And because he was picked up coming into the United
States, said his lawyer, Kerry Bretz, he is not eligible for bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not seen him since July 24,'' said his daughter,
Teresa Mejia, 21. ``It was 15 days before we heard from him after
they took him at the airport. He made one phone call from Maryland.
Then he called when he reached Louisiana. We are devastated. My
parents have been married for 30 years. I have two older brothers,
but I am the only one who can have a conversation about this
without crying.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who committed more serious crimes, served their time
and have turned their lives around, the government's refusal to
consider their long pilgrimage back to becoming productive members
of society is viewed as disheartening. For many, it is as if the
effort to become a better person has been branded by the state as
futile and irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Freire, 43, said he fell in with gangs as a young man and
was involved in a fatal stabbing in 1975. He served 15 years in
prison. Since 1990, shortly after his release, he has worked for
ZZZ Carpentry, starting out as a day laborer but slowly mastering
the craft of woodworking.
</P>
<P>
   He started a family, never informing his wife of his past. He
does not drink or use drugs and in the words of his employer, Derek
U. Huntington, is a model employee.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 30, scores of police and armed immigration service
agents arrived at Freire's two-bedroom apartment on West 174th
Street at 5:30 in the morning and took him away in handcuffs. His
wife, Evelyn, 41, his son, Luis, 9 and his daughter, Jennifer, 5,
watched a man they said was either at his home or his job for the
last decade punished a second time for his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Freire is free on $10,000 bail and is waiting for his hearing
with the Board of Immigration Appeals in September. But Bretz, his
lawyer, says that the appeal will probably not be successful and
that deportation, unless the law is changed, is most likely
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to prison, my brother and sister were young,''
Freire said, drinking coffee after finishing a day's work at a Soho
loft. ``I missed watching them grow up. I vowed not to miss this
with my own children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not the man I was 25 years ago,'' he continued. ``But how
can I take my wife, who is from Puerto Rico, and my children with
me to Ecuador, a country I do not know and have no connection with?
This is my home. I am American. This is my life. I have worked hard
to create something good with my life, and now _ because of what I
was, not who I am now _ it may all be taken away.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Texas drought `very bleak'
 &HT;    Agriculture secretary adds 24 counties to disaster list
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By EVAN MOORE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman visited
drought-stricken farmers near here Tuesday and termed conditions
``very bleak'' as North Texas edged past a 66-year record with 60
consecutive days without rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   That mark surpassed the record set in 1934 and matched in 1950
when the northern portion of the state went 59 days without rain.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman visited a farm in Wise County, then spoke with farmers
near the town of Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that this is a regional drought. It
extends up through the midwest.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you have to take into account that this is the fourth year
out of five for some of these farmers. Many of them have been
receiving assistance for some time now.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've seen is very bleak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My primary reason for coming here was to talk to folks and
then go back and look at what we can do administratively to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Glickman had named 153 Texas counties as either
primary or contiguous agricultural disaster areas. He added 24 to
that list Tuesday, bringing the total to 177. Farmers in those
areas will be eligible for low-interest loans through the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drought causes more damage than hurricanes, floods and
earthquakes, but it's insidious,'' Glickman said. ``The long-term
effects will be difficult to assess.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said he intends to make recommendations to Congress for
additional monies for farmers, but, realistically, with only about
30 days left in the legislative session, little may come of that
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Congress created the National Drought Policies
Commission to look into what can be done,'' Glickman said.
``Hopefully, they'll have a report soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to the east of the area Glickman visited, Tarrant County
has been among the hardest hit, although no water rationing has
been instituted in Fort Worth or its suburbs, and the overall
supply is not critically low, said Mike Williams, spokesman for the
Tarrant Regional Water District.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our `west fork' lakes are really low, but our major supply
comes from Cedar Creek and Richland Chambers (southeast of Tarrant
County) and they're at about 93 or 94 percent capacity,'' Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   The west fork, or Tarrant County Lakes, includes Bridgeport,
currently 17 feet below normal; Eagle Mountain, 8 feet below
normal; Lake Worth, 2 feet below normal, and Benbrook, 7 feet below
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the soil moisture content is so low, people just keep
pouring water on their lawns,'' Williams said. ``If this continues,
we may be asking for voluntary rationing, then enforced rationing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suggest that people limit their watering to about 1 inch
every five days.''
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be little or no relief in sight, said Bill
Proenza, director for the southern region of the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a regional drought,'' said Proenza. ``It's affecting
not just North Texas, but New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, Georgia and Florida _ just about the entire southern
region.''
</P>
<P>
   The area is as dry as the northwestern United States, where
record wildfires have plagued firefighters in recent weeks, Proenza
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not having the number of fires, or the severity of
fires, simply because we haven't had the high winds, and we have
more roads and it's quicker and easier to put them out here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, looking forward to September, we're still looking at
`climatology' (excessively dry) conditions. I'm afraid there's no
great change in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   That could spell financial setbacks for North Texas ranchers,
who have traditionally looked forward to rain in early September.
Steve Munday, director of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers
Association, said some area ranchers have begun liquidating herds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others are culling their herds pretty deeply, and I expect the
statewide cattle inventory will be off a few percentage points this
year,'' Munday said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feed them when the grass is low, but there's not much
you can do when you run out of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, cattle prices haven't dipped too low yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought's effects were felt early in the small, North Texas
town of Throckmorton, where the reservoir began running dry in July
and town residents began digging a pipeline to a water tower 21
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The line was finished in less than two weeks with the help of
675 volunteers, said Throckmorton Public Works Director Steve
Bowlin. He said two pump stations have since been installed and the
line was being pressure-tested Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found two leaks, but we're getting them fixed and we should
have it pumping by some day next week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's none too soon, Bowlin added. The receding waters of
Throckmorton Lake were about 6 inches above the pump level Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The effects also are reaching south to Austin and San Antonio,
the latter of which is the nation's largest city to rely solely on
ground water for its municipal supply.
</P>
<P>
   There, the state's largest springs are drying. The U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service has reported that Comal Springs in New Braunfels
and its source, the Edwards Aquifer, are dropping and the
endangered fountain darter fish could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope lies in the tropical storms that usually form in
September, Proenza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get in the position of wishing for
disasters,'' he said, ``but, sometimes they can be monsoonal and
bring nothing but rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most we can hope for at present.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, however, Proenza's satellite pictures showed no
storm formations and only one weak area of precipitation, east of
Florida.

RAMS ARE INSPIRING UNDERDOGS IN WAITING 
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When was the last time you heard these words: Teams are dreaming
of becoming the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   It was not too long ago that the Rams were the punch line of
jokes, Lawrence Phillips, the team's No. 1 draft pick, made the
police blotter once a month and the stadium was filled not with
bodies, but boos.
</P>
<P>
   A Super Bowl changed that. A remarkable long-shot story changed
that. Everyone is now a Rams wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend the National Football League begins its first
season of the new century and clearly the sport has embarked on
Football A.D.: After Dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of empires like the San Francisco 49ers and the
Dallas Cowboys comes a wide-open game and the notion that any team
with an accurate quarterback, speed and confidence can snag the big
prize.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis proved that using that formula can change a
franchise's fortune in an instant as the Rams jumped from four
victories in 1998 to a 13-3 regular-season mark last season,
followed weeks later by a Super Bowl championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a cadre of teams, some in the middle of the pack,
others at the bottom of the pile, that believe they can make the
leap that the Rams made. What is unclear is the accuracy of those
feelings. Are these hopes realistic, because the NFL is now a
parity-filled league, or do these teams need to wake up and smell
the Gatorade?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is trying to find the next Rams, but you know what, I
don't think there is one,'' said General Manager Ernie Accorsi of
the Giants, a team that might be a contender in the ``Who Wants to
Be the Next St. Louis?'' sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Rams did was remarkable,'' Accorsi said. ``It was
unprecedented. You have all these prognosticators on television and
teams saying who will be the next Rams. But no one seems to be
considering that what the Rams did may never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to the dreamers, many of whom are players
emerging from the optimism-fest known as training camp, and your
cynicism will be met with a smirk. The rallying cry of some teams,
as one player said, seems to be, ``Hey, if the sorry Rams can do
it, so can we.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's only natural to look at what the Rams did and
think you can do it, too,'' Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan
McNabb said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Armstead, a Pro Bowl linebacker with the Giants, said:
``There are going to be surprise teams. There are always surprises.
Why not us?''
</P>
<P>
   That is what a lot of teams are asking: Why not us?
</P>
<P>
   The question is certainly being heard in Philadelphia. The
Eagles, winners of five games last season, have a franchise
quarterback in McNabb, a solid runner in Duce Staley and a strong
defense. The Eagles also play a last-place schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland is another possible St. Louis. The Raiders have a good
runner in Tyrone Wheatley, who, despite splitting time with
Napoleon Kaufman last season, still rushed for 936 yards and eight
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, coming off a 7-9 season, think they have the
quarterback to make a serious push. But the difference between New
York and St. Louis _ and it is a huge one _ is that St. Louis had
one of the best pass defenses in football last season. The Giants
have far from that.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets won their last four games in 1999 to finish 8-8 in what
amounted to one of Bill Parcells' best-ever coaching jobs.
Quarterback Vinny Testaverde is back from his Achilles' injury and
running back Curtis Martin remains one of the most dangerous
weapons in football.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells is no longer coaching the Jets and neither is the
former defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, who is at New England.
That is too much brainpower to lose. The Rams had a unified,
top-notch coaching staff in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Jets, the Baltimore Ravens also had eight victories a
year ago, and they might be the most intriguing of the teams trying
to duplicate what the Rams did. The Ravens won't have as far to
climb, so they don't fit into the true Rams model, but Baltimore
had a history of heartbreak when the franchise was still in
Cleveland, and in that the Rams and the Ravens have a common
ground. The John Elway-led Denver Broncos beat Cleveland three
times in the American Football Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Ravens, like the Rams a season ago, have one of the top
defenses in the league, a potential franchise runner in the rookie
Jamal Lewis and a quarterback, Tony Banks, who was excellent in the
last half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Baltimore is a popular pick. To truly fit the miracle Rams
mode, a team has to come from nowhere. Cincinnati, Chicago or New
Orleans _ now those are real Rams wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Accorsi and others are right. Maybe looking for the next
Rams is like Geraldo Rivera searching for Al Capone's hidden vault.
It's a sexy idea but not truly attainable.
</P>
<P>
   Then again the Rams were not supposed to have a chance. So maybe
fans in Cleveland should start packing their bags for a little
Super Bowl trip.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Darin Erstad is still bothered by soreness in
his left side and will remain in the designated-hitter role
tonight, and possibly longer, rather than take up his customary
spot in left field.
</P>
<P>
   After Erstad tested his side Monday by throwing it was thought
he was close to returning to the outfield. But manager Mike
Scioscia confirmed Tuesday that his All-Star left fielder is still
feeling pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not playable in left field,'' Scioscia said. ``After he
threw the other day, he was still feeling discomfort. It's the only
thing that bothers him: throwing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate it being anything long term, but he won't
be in the outfield (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are idle Thursday, then begin a seven-game trip
Friday night in Chicago. Tuesday night, Erstad batted leadoff and
was the DH for the fifth game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   SEPTEMBER SONG: Major-league clubs may expand their rosters
beginning Friday. Scioscia anticipates the Angels will promote only
five or six players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring up guys who can help us,'' he said. ``Guys
aren't coming up if they can't contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   One example is backup catcher Shawn Wooten. He would have been
called up anyway, Scioscia said, but was brought in earlier when
Matt Walbeck, ordinarily the backup, injured his knee last week and
was placed on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also have several players eligible to return from the
DL, including pitchers Tim Belcher, Mike Fyhrie, Seth Etherton and
Jarrod Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   SMILE, IF YOU CAN: The Angels assembled in center field at
Edison Field several hours before Tuesday night's game for the
annual team photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not really the team picture,'' cracked one press boxer,
well aware of the Angels' overloaded disabled list, ``that's really
(team physician) Dr. (Lewis) Yocum and all his patients.''
</P>
<P>
   And, also from the press box ...
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia and a reporter were discussing the proper pronunciation
of reliever Al Levine's name _ le-VINE or le-VEEN? _ and Scioscia
said, finally, ``I don't care what it is as long as he keeps
throwing that blowing ball up the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy with the bat-bustin' heavy pitch settled the argument.
It's le-VINE.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: The Angels' protest of their 11-inning, 7-6 loss
Aug. 21 in Boston was formally denied Tuesday by the AL office.
``We felt we were on solid ground,'' Scioscia said, ``but the
league didn't see it as solidly as we did.'' ... The Angels worked
out a two-year extension of their affiliation with Cedar Rapids
(Iowa) of the Single-A Midwest League, taking the partnership
through the 2002 season. The Angels have had a Single-A farm in
Cedar Rapids since 1993. Current Angels catcher Bengie Molina
played on Cedar Rapids' 1994 championship club. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Spontaneous prayer expected at Friday Santa Fe high school
football game
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By KEVIN MORAN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, Texas _ As many as 10,000 people may surround this
small town's public stadium Friday to ``spontaneously'' recite the
Lord's Prayer before Santa Fe High School's first football game of
the season, Christian ministers predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No Pray, No Play, a group headquartered in Temple, had urged
people from throughout the state to come to Santa Fe to pray before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Since, the stadium, being used for the first time this year,
holds fewer than 5,000 people, others are expected to gather
outside to join in the call to prayer, issued in response to a June
Supreme Court ruling against student-led prayers over the stadium's
public address system.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending, both inside and outside the stadium, are being
encouraged to begin praying after the National Anthem is played,
said the Rev. Eugene Easterly, pastor of Santa Fe's Aldersgate
United Baptist Church and president of the Ministerial Alliance of
Santa Fe and Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Easterly, flanked by 10 other area church pastors, said the
alliance is encouraging people ``to continue their long-standing
tradition of public prayer'' by attending Friday's game between
Santa Fe and neighboring Hitchcock High School and participating in
a prayer from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   The June U.S. Supreme Court ruling which banned student-led
prayer at such football games resulted from a 1995 federal lawsuit
in which the Santa Fe Independent School District was accused of
sponsoring religious activities on public campuses and humiliating
at least one Mormon student over religious issues.
</P>
<P>
   School board members and most Santa Fe area residents have
criticized the ruling and decried a court-ordered end to pre-game
prayer that has gone on for decades in Santa Fe and most other
Texas towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prayer will be spontaneous,'' Easterly said. ``It will not
be led by anyone. Prayer has been a part of this (football)
experience for a long time here in Santa Fe and I think it will
happen this way. ''
</P>
<P>
   Easterly said the alliance believes such prayer will not violate
the court's ruling and lawyers in the case said as much when the
ruling came down.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer, Easterly said, is not meant to offend anyone.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site for No Pray, No Play includes a ``warning'' to
non-Christians, stating, ``If you are someone that doesn't like to
be exposed to prayer, you may want to show up a little late for the
game. We can sympathize with you and understand your frustration.
Christians have to turn their heads, close their ears and change
their channels to avoid exposure to things we don't like
everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts bearing the No Pray, No Play group's name already were
circulating in Santa Fe Tuesday, some bearing the state's outline
with an arrow pointing to Santa Fe and the legend ``Don't Mess With
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Kody Shed, a lay praise and worship leader at Temple's
Cornerstone Christian Fellowship, is the group's director. He and
Cornerstorne Pastor David Newsome traveled to Santa Fe to help
organized the prayer effort.
</P>
<P>
   Shed, 27, who owns a home security firm and sells home
entertainment systems, said No Pray, No Play expects 10,000 people
from across the state to show up in Santa Fe Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is negotiating with Galveston County Fair officials
to use the fairgrounds for a prayer rally after the prayer at the
football game is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe School District Police Chief Jeff Chernowski and Santa
Fe Police Chief Barry Cook said they anticipated some sort of
prayer effort at the opening game and have been planning for weeks
to handle more people and traffic than normal on a game night.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said anyone who engages in disorderly conduct in or around
the stadium could face arrest but he had not heard of any organized
opposition to the prayer plan.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe school trustees earlier announced they did not intend
to challenge the Supreme Court ruling by authorizing a student to
lead a prayer or similar inspirational statement before the game.
Easterly said school officials have not been a part of the
planning.
</P>
<P>
   Preparatory to Friday's events, the alliance is sponsoring a
youth prayer rally at 7 tonight at the Maranatha Christian Center
on Avenue L in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Activities will include a Christian musical group, Tejano
Praise, ministers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe High Indians and the Hitchcock High School Bulldogs
are scheduled to play at 7:30 p.m. Friday. The Santa Fe prayer
activities appear to be part of a national movement.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, prayers were said in Mississippi and South Carolina
prior to football games. And in North Carolina, a group rallied to
urge the recitation of the Lord's Prayer at games.
</P>
<P>
   No loudspeaker was used when a crowd of about 4,500 stood Friday
before a football game in Hattiesburg, Miss., to say the Lord's
Prayer. That same night, in Batesburg-Leesville, S.C., the student
body president prayed over the public address system.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 25,000 people gathered for the rally at a football
stadium last week in Asheville, N.C., urging the recitation of the
Lord's Prayer at football games.
</P>
<P>
   Shed has set up a Web site at www.nopraynoplay.org.
</P>
<P>
   Shed said No Pray, No Play is affiliated with Kingdom Builders
International, a nonprofit Christian organization.

CBS' `BLACK ROCK' BUILDING IS SAID TO BE FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Viacom, which acquired CBS this year, plans to sell
Black Rock, the elegant granite-clad skyscraper built to symbolize
the broadcasting company's view of itself as ``the Tiffany
network,'' according to officials involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The building could be placed on the market as early as next
month, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-story tower, at 51 W. 52nd St. in Midtown Manhattan,
could fetch up to $370 million, according to real estate industry
estimates. Viacom executives said they were in the early stages of
discussions with a real estate brokerage firm and that any
potential sale would not involve moving many _ if any _ CBS
employees out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   They added, however, that those plans could change. If the
building was sold with CBS continuing to occupy about half of it,
real estate analysts said, the sale price would very likely be
significantly decreased.
</P>
<P>
   The officials from Viacom and CBS, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that given the hot real estate market in that area
of Midtown, near Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler building,
selling Black Rock would be more profitable than continuing to
lease it to other tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old building was placed on the market last year, but
was taken off because the bids, which were about $300 million, were
too low. But real estate industry officials said the company could
get significantly more for the building now, especially if it moved
many CBS employees into other Viacom buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a market with no vacancies, and they are one of the
only significant blocks of space in Midtown Manhattan,'' said Darcy
Stacom, the executive director for financial services at Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield, a commercial real estate brokerage firm in Manhattan.
``Clearly, the first time CBS went to market they were offering a
fully leased building. If they are now going to offer an entire
block of space, it will be an attractive investment opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   If the building is sold without CBS as a tenant, Stacom
estimates, it could garner as much as $425 per square foot, or
about $369 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though Black Rock is a relatively young building, it was made a
New York City landmark in 1997. Noted for its minimalist design and
its somber, dark granite skin, Black Rock stands in stark contrast
to the steel-and-glass towers nearby on the Avenue of the Americas.
It has the distinction of being the only skyscraper designed by the
famous modernist Eero Saarinen.
</P>
<P>
   The potential sale was first reported Tuesday by Bloomberg News.
Insignia/ESG, a commercial real estate company that has done
business with Viacom, is the leading contender for the project,
officials familiar with the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after decisions by the other two major networks,
NBC and ABC, to move parts of their operations out of that section
of Midtown. Each of the networks has been acquired in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The building was built by William S. Paley, the founder of CBS,
in the 1960s, when the network was moving beyond its status as a
premier broadcast network and expanding into films, magazines and
theater production. It began serving as the CBS headquarters in
1968, as Walter Cronkite and other distinguished journalists kept
the network's pre-eminence in news broadcasting unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   To Paley, Black Rock was not just a building; it was a monument
to the company's success.
</P>
<P>
   But management problems, competition from cable and other
factors all contributed to troubles at Black Rock. In 1987, CBS
began retrenching and focusing the company more solidly on
broadcasting. In 1981, CBS had 9,900 employees working in New York;
by 1992 there were only 4,700.
</P>
<P>
   That year, CBS, which has studios on West 57th Street, began
moving workers out of Black Rock and began leasing the building to
law firms and other tenants. The company now occupies only 350,000
square feet in the 870,000-square-foot building.
</P>
<P>
   Black Rock, named for the Canadian granite used for its exterior
and lobby walls, is the only skyscraper built by Saarinen, the
architect of the Vivian Beaumont Theater and the butterfly-shaped
T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy International Airport. It was one of the
last projects designed by Saarinen, who died in 1961, three years
before CBS moved in.
</P>
<P>
   A building must be 30 years old to become a New York landmark;
that designation was given to Black Rock at age 33, in 1997. ``We
did it with a group of buildings to get the best of the modernist
buildings,'' said Katy McNabb, a spokeswoman for the New York City
Landmarks Preservation Commission. ``We wanted to show people what
they had to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   In its designation report, the commission called the building
``one of New York's premier post-World-War-II-era skyscrapers and
one of the country's great works of modern architecture.'' The
report said it was New York's first postwar reinforced-concrete
skyscraper. Saarinen said his goal was to build a structure that
was both elegant and ``the simplest skyscraper in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite CBS' diminished presence at Black Rock in recent years,
it has gone to great lengths to protect both the symbolism and
architecture of the building, a notion that has comforted historic
preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Willis, an adjunct professor of urban studies at the
Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at
Columbia University, said that the dark color and the absence of
interpretations in its facades made the building unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was designed to be the simplest modernist building in New
York City,'' Willis said.
</P>
<P>
   Its entrances are on West 52nd and West 53rd streets, creating
the effect of an absolutely pure granite slab on the Avenue of the
Americas. ``Certainly, it is one of the most elegant of the
modernist buildings,'' Willis added. ``It is self-consciously
unlike the other modernist buildings, with its somber quality and
its minimalist style. It is not like the glass box.''

GILBERT DE BOTTON, BANKING REFORMER, DIES AT 65 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gilbert de Botton, a Swiss banker who helped change the way the
wealthy manage their money and became a significant figure in the
London worlds of modern art and old-book collecting, died Saturday
at his house in the South of France. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, after moving from Zurich to London, de Botton created a
money management firm called Global Asset Management in partnership
with Nathaniel Charles Jacob Rothschild of the English branch of
the famous banking family.
</P>
<P>
   The firm pioneered what was then a revolutionary technique for
managing the fortunes of the rich. Previously the wealthy would
entrust their money to banks or financial institutions, which then
gave the funds to their own in-house managers to invest.
</P>
<P>
   But de Botton reasoned that no single bank could hope to employ
all the most talented money managers in the world. So he adopted a
different technique, collecting funds from rich individuals,
identifying the finest managers and then creating special funds
with his clients' money for them to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Often called the multimanager approach, the technique is widely
used today. ``Gilbert de Botton pioneered it to give his clients
superior investment performance by using only the most talented
managers,'' Rothschild said in a telephone interview from London.
</P>
<P>
   Today Global Asset Management, which started with initial
capital of $1 million, has about $14 billion under management. In
1999, de Botton sold the firm to UBS, the big Swiss bank, for about
$600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Feb. 16, 1935, into an Alexandrine Jewish family, de
Botton began his education at Victoria College in Alexandria,
Egypt. But in 1952, the increasing difficulties that Egyptian Jews
were facing forced the family to leave the country. De Botton
continued his education at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and at
Columbia University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he went to work for Ufitech S.A. Union Financiere, a
Zurich-based finance house owned by Abdullah Zilhka, one of three
brothers originally from Baghdad who all became prominent
businessmen in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the English and French branches of the Rothschild
family picked him as founding managing director of Rothschild Bank
AG, the joint bank they had decided to establish in Zurich and
which by 1981 had over $2 billion under management.
</P>
<P>
   Bank Rothschild made headlines in 1978 when Algeria asked it to
resign from a syndicate of European and Arab banks organizing a $33
million loan for the Algerian government because of its Jewish
connections.
</P>
<P>
   De Botton was a formidable linguist, fluent in Arabic as well as
all the major European languages. In 1962 he married the former
Jacqueline Burgauer. They had a son, Alain, now a well-known
London-based writer, and a daughter, Miel. The marriage ended in
1988. Two years later, he married Janet Green, eldest daughter of
Baron Wolfson, a prominent British industrialist.
</P>
<P>
   De Botton and his second wife were avid collectors of modern art
and they served as trustees of the Tate Gallery in London. De
Botton had a particularly important collection of works by the
British artist Francis Bacon, who also painted his portrait.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he collected rare books and at the end of his life
was engaged in recreating the private library of the French
philosopher Montaigne, tracking down and acquiring the books that
were dispersed after his death in 1592.

EVEN THE POOREST IN INDIA FALL UNDER THE `MILLIONAIRE' SPELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 7th graf, The show ..., to clarify translation of show's
title.) 
By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ Maqbool Ahmed has dreams of instant wealth,
which ordinarily would require a mighty burst of imagination from a
man living in the Bombay slum of Geeta Nagar, a hideous warren of
hovels where the air reeks of kerosene and fish, and there are only
24 toilets for 6,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But come 9 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, Ahmed, like
virtually everyone else in this monsoon-swamped ghetto, ignores the
leaky roof, turns on a cheap black-and-white television and watches
the Indian version of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even I know Josip Broz Tito was not the leader of Egypt,''
Ahmed said confidently last night, harrumphing at a confused
contestant named Ravi who must have slept through the Cold War and
was now using a valuable ``lifeline'' to phone his friend Murli for
help. ``The correct answer is Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Since early July, India _ a nation where the average person
would need 2,325 years of income to become a millionaire _ has been
obsessed with ``Kaun Banega Crorepati,'' the &UR;  &LR; Indian version of the
game show created in Britain and now exported to 31 countries
including the United States, Japan, Israel, Finland and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   East is East and West is West, and this is where the twain have
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands the language of money,'' said Ahmed, 41,
who peddles envelopes from a pushcart for a living. ``The show is
simple to follow. I am not so smart, and I know many of the
answers. Maybe I will be a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is unusual here because of its extravagant production
quality and the large jackpot. Crore is a number meaning 10
million. A crorepati, then, is actually someone with 10 million
rupees _ about $222,000 at current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Ratings are as yet an inexact science in India, but by some
counts ``Crorepati'' is being watched nightly by more than 100
million people. In a single leap it took Star TV, owned by Rupert
Murdoch, from the No. 3 to the No. 1 spot among the nation's cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 85 percent of the viewers in Bombay and 93 percent in
Kanpur,'' said Sameer Nair, who is in charge of the network's
programming. ``Of course, the joke is: what are those other 7
percent up to?''
</P>
<P>
   This can be a tough country for television. In 1965, when in
America Ozzie and Harriet were starting their last season, there
were still fewer than 1,000 television sets in all of India. Even
today, only about one-third of the households have televisions _
and less than half of those are set up for cable or satellite
reception.
</P>
<P>
   India's population has topped 1 billion, but the nation is a
polyglot of 17 major languages. Most people in Calcutta do not know
what the people in Madras are saying. ``The Wheel of Fortune'' was
tried without much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``India has no national language and has a low level of
literacy; this is not a place for a game like that, based on word
play,'' said Amit Khanna, a television executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crorepati'' is in Hindi, with English thrown in here and
there. Its popularity is highest in the nation's so-called Hindi
Belt in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The show is hosted by Amitabh Bachchan, a legendary leading man
in Indian films and now a suave graybeard at age 58. His movie
career had hit the skids, and ``Crorepati'' has become his
resurrection. Contestants occasionally kiss his feet. Fan letters
sometimes come written in blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was apprehensive about whether I could deliver the goods,''
Bachchan said in an interview, relaxing in an apartment built for
him near the stage set. It is modeled after a Swiss chalet. ``In
films, people always put words in my mouth. Here, it is a very ad
hoc, ad lib kind of atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Regis Philbin, he has become famous for this litany: ``Are
you sure? Confident? Is that your final answer?'' It is presumed
here that this is a Bachchan touch, part of his pose as a
philosopher-guide.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Millionaire'' format, as created by the British
production company Celador, is highly scripted. It is the fast food
chain of quiz shows.
</P>
<P>
   The patter is precisely pat. The look of each set is identical.
A computer program synchronizes the music and lighting. British
technicians train the local crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``They send us a production bible, about 300 pages,'' said
Ravinath Menon, Crorepati's executive producer. ``It's all a
formula. Our idea was not to re-invent the show, but to duplicate
the show.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Indian masses are wild about the program, some of the
intelligentsia have been sniffy. P.C. Joshi, a retired academic,
said he has an ``instinctive revulsion'' to the show and has
refused to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Joshi headed a national commission that warned that
careful controls must be maintained on television programming or
Indian culture will be befouled.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, such taint came to seem inevitable in the early
'90s when Western tastes began to invade the airwaves via
satellite. Shows such as ``The Bold and the Beautiful'' were
decried for licentious plots dependent on bed-hopping. In time,
however, local producers have developed their own various soap
operas rich with sexual escapades. It turned out that most people
here did not object to shows that depicted adultery, as long as the
adults involved were Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crorepati,'' despit its Western roots, is not seen as an
invasion. ``Money is money, finally, and I think Indians just adore
it and always have,'' said cultural critic Shanta Gokhale. ``We're
inveterate gamblers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival networks have game shows in the works that will offer
similar amounts.
</P>
<P>
   But being on the show would seem to require far more luck than
is common in Geeta Nagar. People from there do call the show,
trying to register their names. For them, it is like buying a

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Texas drought `very bleak'
 &HT;    Agriculture secretary adds 24 counties to disaster list
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By EVAN MOORE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman visited
drought-stricken farmers near here Tuesday and termed conditions
``very bleak'' as North Texas edged past a 66-year record with 60
consecutive days without rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   That mark surpassed the record set in 1934 and matched in 1950
when the northern portion of the state went 59 days without rain.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman visited a farm in Wise County, then spoke with farmers
near the town of Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that this is a regional drought. It
extends up through the midwest.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you have to take into account that this is the fourth year
out of five for some of these farmers. Many of them have been
receiving assistance for some time now.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've seen is very bleak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My primary reason for coming here was to talk to folks and
then go back and look at what we can do administratively to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Glickman had named 153 Texas counties as either
primary or contiguous agricultural disaster areas. He added 24 to
that list Tuesday, bringing the total to 177. Farmers in those
areas will be eligible for low-interest loans through the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drought causes more damage than hurricanes, floods and
earthquakes, but it's insidious,'' Glickman said. ``The long-term
effects will be difficult to assess.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said he intends to make recommendations to Congress for
additional monies for farmers, but, realistically, with only about
30 days left in the legislative session, little may come of that
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, Congress created the National Drought Policies
Commission to look into what can be done,'' Glickman said.
``Hopefully, they'll have a report soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to the east of the area Glickman visited, Tarrant County
has been among the hardest hit, although no water rationing has
been instituted in Fort Worth or its suburbs, and the overall
supply is not critically low, said Mike Williams, spokesman for the
Tarrant Regional Water District.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our `west fork' lakes are really low, but our major supply
comes from Cedar Creek and Richland Chambers (southeast of Tarrant
County) and they're at about 93 or 94 percent capacity,'' Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   The west fork, or Tarrant County Lakes, includes Bridgeport,
currently 17 feet below normal; Eagle Mountain, 8 feet below
normal; Lake Worth, 2 feet below normal, and Benbrook, 7 feet below
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the soil moisture content is so low, people just keep
pouring water on their lawns,'' Williams said. ``If this continues,
we may be asking for voluntary rationing, then enforced rationing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suggest that people limit their watering to about 1 inch
every five days.''
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be little or no relief in sight, said Bill
Proenza, director for the southern region of the National Weather
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a regional drought,'' said Proenza. ``It's affecting
not just North Texas, but New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, Georgia and Florida _ just about the entire southern
region.''
</P>
<P>
   The area is as dry as the northwestern United States, where
record wildfires have plagued firefighters in recent weeks, Proenza
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not having the number of fires, or the severity of
fires, simply because we haven't had the high winds, and we have
more roads and it's quicker and easier to put them out here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, looking forward to September, we're still looking at
`climatology' (excessively dry) conditions. I'm afraid there's no
great change in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   That could spell financial setbacks for North Texas ranchers,
who have traditionally looked forward to rain in early September.
Steve Munday, director of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers
Association, said some area ranchers have begun liquidating herds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others are culling their herds pretty deeply, and I expect the
statewide cattle inventory will be off a few percentage points this
year,'' Munday said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feed them when the grass is low, but there's not much
you can do when you run out of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, cattle prices haven't dipped too low yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought's effects were felt early in the small, North Texas
town of Throckmorton, where the reservoir began running dry in July
and town residents began digging a pipeline to a water tower 21
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The line was finished in less than two weeks with the help of
675 volunteers, said Throckmorton Public Works Director Steve
Bowlin. He said two pump stations have since been installed and the
line was being pressure-tested Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found two leaks, but we're getting them fixed and we should
have it pumping by some day next week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's none too soon, Bowlin added. The receding waters of
Throckmorton Lake were about 6 inches above the pump level Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The effects also are reaching south to Austin and San Antonio,
the latter of which is the nation's largest city to rely solely on
ground water for its municipal supply.
</P>
<P>
   There, the state's largest springs are drying. The U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service has reported that Comal Springs in New Braunfels
and its source, the Edwards Aquifer, are dropping and the
endangered fountain darter fish could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope lies in the tropical storms that usually form in
September, Proenza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get in the position of wishing for
disasters,'' he said, ``but, sometimes they can be monsoonal and
bring nothing but rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most we can hope for at present.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, however, Proenza's satellite pictures showed no
storm formations and only one weak area of precipitation, east of
Florida.

LIEBERMAN DEFENDS HIS CALL FOR GREATER ROLE FOR RELIGION
</HEADLINE>
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Explaining his call for a greater role for
religion in public life, Sen. Joseph Lieberman said he meant it as
a matter of public discourse, not public policy, adding that he
does not consider those who are not religious to be amoral or unfit
for public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really less a matter of programs or legislation than
it is of giving respect to the constructive role that faith can
play in the lives of individuals, and in the lives of the
community,'' Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee,
said in an interview aboard his campaign plane late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spoke a few hours after the Anti-Defamation League
issued a statement criticizing his emphasis on his faith and saying
religion should have no place in the political arena. With that
criticism, one of the nation's most prominent Jewish groups was
publicly chastising the first Jew to be nominated by a major party
for national office.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lieberman knew of the Anti-Defamation League's
statement when he gave the interview on Monday night, his aides
said on Tuesday that he did not then know its details. The senator
declined to discuss the statement Tuesday, ignoring reporters'
shouted questions as he hurried from a convention of the
Communications Workers of America that he had addressed here.
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign spokeswoman, Kiki McLean, said, ``He is someone
who always expresses his support of tolerance and separation of
church and state, and believes the ADL does a lot of good work, and
in this instance respectfully disagrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving a homily at a church in Detroit on Sunday, Lieberman said
that ``there must be a place for faith in America's public life,''
and quoted John Adams and George Washington, linking both the
founding of the nation and morality to religion. He offered much
the same sentiment on Monday at a breakfast with religious leaders
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But in the interview on Monday night, he said he had not meant
to suggest that irreligious people cannot be moral. ``Religion in
my opinion can be, and in my opinion usually is, a source of good
behavior,'' he said. ``But two things: I know religious people who
I consider not to be moral, and I also know people who are not
religious who I consider to be extremely moral. So, you know, I'm
talking here about probabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would object to an atheist's being president, he
said, ``Personally, no, if I thought it was a good person'' _ a
more liberal stance, polls show, than a great majority of Americans
take.
</P>
<P>
   He said he respected former Sen. Bill Bradley's refusal to talk
about his religious views during the presidential primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of religion is nothing new for Lieberman, who made it part
of his previous campaigns and wrote about it in a book published
this year, ``In Praise of Public Life.'' At virtually every stop in
this campaign, he mentions his own devout faith and the faith of
Vice President Al Gore, frequently telling his listeners that
people of all religions are ``children of the same God.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have both talked about
religion in interviews and debates, Lieberman has gone further,
making his faith a central part of his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's comments have inspired a debate on the role of
religion in politics, raising concerns in some quarters about
maintaining the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday's New York Times/ABC News Webcast, ``Political
Points,'' the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans
United for the Separation of Church and State, accused both parties
of using religion to pander for votes.
</P>
<P>
   On the same Webcast, Forest Montgomery of the National
Association of Evangelicals said the media applied a double
standard, treating Lieberman more gently than they would a
conservative Christian saying the same things. But Montgomery
added, ``Evangelicals are very comfortable with everything the
senator's been saying.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, N.M., on Tuesday, Gore defended Lieberman in a
series of interviews with local television stations around the
country. ``He also believes as I do in separation of church and
state,'' Gore told KSDK in St. Louis. ``I believe in what he's
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and his aides have been quick to draw distinctions
between his own comments and efforts by some Christian
conservatives to mingle religion and politics, noting, for
instance, that he supports abortion rights and opposes organized
prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a difference here between respecting faith and
feeling free to talk about the way in which it informs and benefits
American life, and talking about it in a way that may make some
people feel excluded,'' Lieberman said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that some people who are particularly sensitive
to religious discrimination may get uncomfortable when people talk
about their faith, but I find it both informative and
encouraging,'' he added. When religious Christians discuss their
faith, as Gore has done repeatedly, ``I don't feel excluded by
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think somehow for various reasons we either started to talk
about religion in ways that were divisive, or we stopped talking
about it altogether,'' he said. ``I think we lost something
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he put his views in the context of the nation's
founders, who he said valued both faith and religious freedom. They
saw that in a society in which government does not tightly control
people, ``it's helpful to have other sources of good behavior,'' he
said, ``and so religion is one of those. So in that sense, it is an
ally of government in trying to create a good society.''

RICO STATUTE CAN BE USED AGAINST LAPD, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, The case ..., to add judge rejecting city
request to dismiss case.) 
By DON TERRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A federal judge has ruled that the government's
anti-racketeering statute, created to deal with drug bosses and
organized crime figures, can be used in lawsuits against the
troubled Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Besides allowing one of the largest police departments in the
United States to be dealt with as a criminal enterprise, the
decision by Judge William J. Rea of federal District Court
drastically increases the city's potential liability in its worst
police scandal in decades, since the law permits a longer statute
of limitations and could triple the damages the city could
otherwise face.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves claims by one of the many people who say they
were victims of violent and corrupt officers at the department's
Rampart Division, whose actions are at the heart of the scandal.
The city had tried to have this case thrown out, and in making his
ruling on Monday the judge rejected that motion.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said Tuesday that it appeared the department would
be the first police agency in the country to face trial under the
statute, which over the years has come to be used in a wide variety
of litigation. Edwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University
of Southern California, said he spent Monday evening researching
the matter and could find no other case in which a police
department had been brought to trial using the statute, known as
RICO _ the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law.
</P>
<P>
   Rea did not deal with the credibility of the plaintiff's claim
that the department condoned and authorized the actions by corrupt
officers, but said that if those accusation were true, they would
constitute racketeering activity and so would come under the RICO
law.
</P>
<P>
   Under RICO, the statute of limitations is 10 years, rather than
1 year as in other civil rights litigation, so the ruling could
open the courtroom to many more cases.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the lead plaintiff in the case, Louie Guerrero,
says that the police beat and falsely arrested him on drug charges
in November 1997 and that he was released from prison before
details of the Rampart scandal became known last year. Under other
civil rights laws, his lawsuit against the department would have to
be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 criminal cases have been overturned as a result of
the scandal, in which officers are said to have planted evidence
and beaten people in a struggling Latino neighborhood for sport and
profit.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have previously estimated the city's liability at
between $125 million to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the plaintiffs prevail,'' Chemerinsky said Tuesday, ``there
is staggering potential liability for the city, just staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chemerinsky cautioned that the judge had simply ruled that
the case could go forward. ``Whether the plaintiffs can ultimately
prove it,'' he said, ``we'll just have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Yagman, a lawyer for Guerrero, said, ``We have in effect
converted a civil rights lawsuit into a racketeering lawsuit and
it's about time.'' Yagman said he had no doubt that ``a reasonable
jury will look at the evidence and agree with what I've been
claiming for years: that the LAPD is essentially a criminal
enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Yagman said his four-lawyer firm has 19 Rampart-related cases
and 50 more on file. He said the lawyers were analyzing 100 more
potential cases and had brought in a firm with 26 lawyers to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're thinking about hiring even more lawyers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the police department and the mayor's office declined to
comment and referred all calls to the Los Angeles city attorney's
office. Mike Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney, said,
``Obviously, we're disappointed in the ruling, and we're reviewing
our options.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rampart scandal has embarrassed the Los Angeles Police
Department for months as story after story about corrupt and brutal
officers have chipped away at a reputation already tarnished by the
O.J. Simpson case, the Rodney King beating and the riots of 1992.
The image long polished by Hollywood and sent across the world by
reruns of ``Dragnet'' seems long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the city and the U.S. Justice Department are negotiating an
alternative to having the federal government sue the police
department for a pattern of civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Rea also refused the city's request to throw out the plaintiff's
request for an injunction that would forbid police officers to
engage in the planting of evidence or commit perjury, two pillars
of the Rampart charges of official abuse.

LAZIO SUGGESTS MRS. CLINTON LIED ABOUT HIS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio charged Tuesday that Hillary Rodham
Clinton had deliberately distorted his voting record in Congress,
and he prepared to unveil a new advertisement Wednesday that aides
said would feature Sen. John McCain harshly challenging Clinton's
fund-raising practices in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be a doormat,'' Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican,
declared outside Junior's Restaurant on Flatbush Avenue in
Brooklyn, where he had just consumed a breakfast of scrambled eggs,
home fries and cheesecake. ``It is fair to criticize my record. It
is not fair to make things up about my record.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio made his remarks as both candidates for the Senate
struggled to seize the high ground in the debate over who went
negative first, even as both exhibited a level of bellicosity that
is unusual coming the week before Labor Day, which traditionally
marks the start of the full-fledged campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   The state Democratic Party announced that its new ad on behalf
of Clinton began broadcasting Tuesday. It ties Lazio to Newt
Gingrich, the former House speaker, and asserts that Lazio
supported Gingrich in Congress while expressing opposition to some
of his initiatives while campaigning in New York. The ad says,
``Tell Lazio to stop playing both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Lazio complained about Clinton's campaign tactics, he
prepared to escalate his own offensive with a second attack ad in
three days. This one, an adviser said, features McCain, the Arizona
Republican who has championed campaign finance reform, asserting
that Clinton's embrace of the issue was untrustworthy given her
extensive reliance on such funds.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is a prime sponsor of legislation in the Senate that
would bar the use of so-called soft money, the largely unregulated
donations raised by party committees and outside groups. Clinton
has endorsed the bill. He has also praised Clinton this year,
saying she would be a Senate ``star'' if elected.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain ad, as well as another asserting that ``you can't
trust'' Clinton, will be the two main Lazio TV commercials on the
air leading up to Labor Day. Although the ostensible issue raised
by the McCain ad is campaign finance, aides to both candidates say
there is little evidence that New York voters are particularly
interested in that subject. The real purpose of the ad, a Lazio
adviser said, is to use a politician popular with New Yorkers to
raise questions about Clinton's credibility in an area where
Republicans and Democrats both believe that Clinton is vulnerable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both ads have long been planned, although Lazio asserted that he
was introducing them only in response to Clinton's attacks over the
last month. She has cited votes he has cast against Democratic
initiatives to provide federal financing for hiring teachers, and
to expand Medicare benefits to pay for prescription drug benefits
for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more down in the mud that they get, the more they distort
and spout untruths, the more it's going to be necessary for us to
correct our record,'' Lazio said, adding: ``You know what the story
is. She's stuck in the 40's in the polls. They can't win by being
positive. They can only win by trying to tear me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was on a campaign fund-raising trip in Seattle on
Tuesday. Cathie Levine, her spokeswoman, challenged Lazio's
assertions. ``The day Lazio entered the race he promised to run a
positive campaign, and has launched negative attacks against
Hillary since his announcement speech,'' she said. ``Maybe it's the
drop in the polls. Maybe it's because he can't run on his record on
the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides have claimed that Clinton was distorting his
record; the candidate went further Tuesday, suggesting that she was
lying. Asked for examples, he noted that she had said he had voted
to cut Medicare spending, when in fact he had voted to cut
increases in Medicare spending. Republicans and Democrats have long
argued over whether it is fair to refer to that vote as a vote to
cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton out of town, it fell to state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall and New York City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi to continue the
first lady's attacks on Lazio's tax plan. They asserted that he had
deliberately underestimated the cost of his tax plan to distance
himself from Gov. George W. Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio attacked Clinton after stopping by Junior's, where he had
breakfast with Ruth Morris, a Democrat from Brooklyn, among others.
Morris said she did not approve of all the negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But Morris also said she might vote for Lazio because she was
unhappy with Clinton's failure to enact a national health care
plan. And her enthusiasm for Lazio grew after he told her that he
would pay for her eggs and home fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in here to have breakfast _ and next thing we knew we
had an entire contingency from the press,'' Morris said. ``We asked
him to pay. And he did. First thing the Republicans have done for
me in a long time.''

GINETTA SAGAN, 75, HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATE AND WWII RESISTANCE
FIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ginetta Sagan, a leader of the American branch of Amnesty
International who as a girl fought World War II's injustices in
Europe and suffered for it, died last Friday at her home in
Atherton, Calif., between San Francisco and San Jose. She was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said the American organization, which
named her honorary chairwoman in 1994, the year she also received
the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Sagan, a native of Milan, was active in Italy's anti-Fascist
resistance in World War II and survived torture and imprisonment.
Denied dignity and freedom then, she championed prisoners of
conscience for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   She came to Washington in the 1960s and helped establish the
American division of Amnesty International. The worldwide group had
been founded in London in 1961 to speak for the victims of
oppressive regimes. Today, Amnesty International has 1.1 million
members, 290,000 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When she moved to California, Sagan formed the group's first
outposts in the western United States. She served two terms on the
national board, and Amnesty International USA now gives an annual
Ginetta Sagan Award for outstanding work on behalf of oppressed
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Sagan was born Ginetta Moroni, the daughter of doctors who would
both work for the Italian Resistance. By the time she was 17, she
was taking clothing and food coupons to beleaguered Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents were arrested in 1943, and she never saw them again.
That year she became a courier for a clandestine party in northern
Italy and helped print and distribute pamphlets. She was betrayed,
and arrested by the Fascist authorities, who subjected her to 45
days of interrogation and torture.
</P>
<P>
   But there were instances of unexpected kindness, too, she had
said: A jailer once threw a loaf of bread into her cell, and inside
she found a matchbox and a slip of paper with a single word:
``corragio'' _ courage.
</P>
<P>
   And when members of the Resistance engineered her escape from
prison in the Alpine town of Sondrio, near Lake Como, on April 23,
1945, they were helped by two German officers.
</P>
<P>
   She then lived in Paris with her godfather, an American banker,
and attended the Sorbonne. By 1951, she was studying child
development at the University of Illinois' Chicago campus, where
she met and married Leonard Sagan, a medical student. Their work
and travels took them to Washington, Boston, Japan and finally the
San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to forming new Amnesty chapters, Sagan established
the Aurora Foundation, which documents civil rights abuses in
countries with authoritarian governments.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Sagan, a physician, died in 1997. Sagan is survived
by three sons: Loring, of San Francisco; Duncan, of Newark, Calif.;
and Pico, of London, as well as six grandchildren.

EXPERTS DOUBT NEW YORK PLAN TO FINGERPRINT FOR MEDICAID 
</HEADLINE>
   By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When electronic fingerprinting was introduced five years ago, it
caught the imagination of politicians who saw it as the ultimate
high-tech weapon to fight welfare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   New York was among the first states to require welfare
recipients to be fingerprinted, and as it proclaimed success
against welfare cheats, other states followed. Now New York is
extending electronic fingerprinting to people applying for
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is little evidence that so-called finger imaging _
intended to deter would-be double-dippers using fake identity
papers _ has had any significant impact in preventing fraud. In
fact, a study by the state three years ago found that other welfare
changes had made finger imaging largely superfluous from the
outset. But the state has refused to make that $658,000 study
public, and now calls it outdated and flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the finger imaging program is an effective method of
fraud deterrence,'' said Robert Doar, executive deputy commissioner
for the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, ``and along
with a whole other range of things related to welfare reform, has
contributed to making the welfare program in New York significantly
more credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Doar credited finger imaging with the dropping of more than
38,223 people from public aid since it began in 1995 at a savings
of $297 million, most of it in the first two years.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Paul J. Sticha, an expert who recently reviewed
such programs nationally for the federal government, said the study
was highly relevant. In an experiment using control groups, finger
imaging made no difference in the dropout or approval rates of
welfare recipients, regardless of whether they were told in advance
that their fingerprints would be checked.
</P>
<P>
   Had the report been made public, Sticha said, other states that
adopted such programs might have reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   New York's expansion of finger imaging into Medicaid comes as
the biometric identification industry _ which uses computers to
recognize personal physical characteristics _ is lobbying hard
around the country to bridge the gap between public acceptance of
such systems to curb welfare fraud, and public resistance to more
general applications, like requiring fingerprint images for cashing
a check, getting a driver's license or filling a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Besides New York, seven states _ California, Connecticut, New
Jersey, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts and Illinois _ use such
systems for some or all welfare recipients, and eight more are
considering them.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those states have rejected finger imaging for
Medicaid patients, since their own health officials say it would do
little to curb Medicaid fraud, which is committed mainly by
doctors. The officials also say it could work against the
bipartisan goal of encouraging enrollment by the uninsured.

   ``Those of us who are concerned about fraud and abuse in the
Medicaid program recognize that the major problems are not in
beneficiary enrollment, but rather, durable medical equipment that
isn't delivered, or home health services that don't show up,'' said
Timothy M. Westmoreland, chief Medicaid official for the federal
government. ``I would be concerned about any policy that had the
effect of steering eligible people away from Medicaid.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal official said the Health Care Financing Administration
would investigate whether a finger imaging requirement was legal
for Medicaid, adding, ``Some verification is appropriate, and other
activities that suggest verification are intimidation of eligible
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's report, ``Automated Finger Imaging System
Comprehensive Evaluation,'' was submitted in 1997 by the research
consultants Macro International and Maximus Inc., and accepted in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sticha, who reviewed a copy of the 120-page final report
obtained by The New York Times, said the most scientifically
compelling part was the controlled experiment that tracked groups
of recipients told to report for recertification at welfare centers
in the Bronx and two upstate counties, Monroe and Niagara.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experiment found no difference between the treatment and
control groups, or the differences seem to be just as likely to be
in one direction as the other,'' Sticha said. ``The picture from
the experiment is zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the study that examined overall caseload trends
were more difficult to interpret, he added. Researchers tried to
give the state the benefit of the doubt, Sticha said, in
calculating $40 million in annual savings from an estimate that the
caseload was 3.7 percent lower than had been predicted, even though
that figure fell within the 5 percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   The study found it statistically impossible to calculate how
many people stayed away because of finger imaging, rather than
because of all the other reasons caseloads were already declining
sharply, including a rebounding economy, tough work requirements,
anti-fraud home inspections and shortened eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1999 report for the Agriculture Department on biometric
systems nationwide, Sticha estimated that finger imaging resulted
in a 1.3 percent decline in the welfare rolls due to both reduced
fraud and the deterrence of eligible people for reasons like
embarrassment or fear. But he now says that had he seen the New
York study, ``I would have revised that estimate downward.''

TESTAVERDE IS READY FOR HIS CLOSE-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde leans back in a chair, easily crossing the legs
that are more closely scrutinized than the Rockettes'.
</P>
<P>
   It is a week before the New York Jets' regular season begins at
Green Bay on Sunday, and Testaverde responds to questions about his
Achilles' tendon and big toe with confidence brimming so fully that
he pounces on speculation about his health with all the momentum of
Venus Williams closing fast on a floating drop shot.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the toe?
</P>
<P>
   ``Never did,'' he said. ``To be successful in this league you
have to play hurt. All the little injuries, the less serious ones,
if you can't play with those type of injuries you can't play in the
National Football League.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has taken a grueling road back to this level of
conviction from the season-ending Achilles' injury he sustained in
the opening game last season. It is a quality the Jets will
immediately have to rely on after an off-season of tumult.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde took fewer than 50 snaps during the preseason, and he
has not played since Aug. 12, so he has not completely shorn the
rust that still mottles him.
</P>
<P>
   His goal was not merely to play again, but to return to his
level of play in 1998, when he threw for 29 touchdowns and seven
interceptions in leading the Jets to the brink of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Testaverde moved smoothly and threw strongly in his
limited action this preseason, his numbers were unimpressive: 11 of
21 passing for 244 yards, with two interceptions _ both for
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that he does not know how he will perform during the
first games. A slow start in September would not be unexpected,
especially since Testaverde is learning to live without Keyshawn
Johnson and with new receivers like Vincent Brisby and Laveranues
Coles.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Al Groh is so sure of Testaverde's readiness that he
said he had not given Testaverde's health much thought after
watching him run last week in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde said he never had a doubt about attempting a comeback
from the Achilles' injury, even when he could have wondered what he
would return to. Bill Parcells was going to the front office and
Johnson was going to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde spent six to eight hours a day rehabilitating the
Achilles' with a dizzying prescription of whirlpool therapies,
massages, stretches and balance exercises.
</P>
<P>
   His mind was addled by the tedium and his body _ bereft of any
aerobic work _ was soft. He felt lousy, even though he was never in
pain. And when he could finally start lifting weights and running
again, his body was sore every day and he was slow. ``I went
through this period when I thought, `This is impossible,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the eight-month mark in his rehabilitation, Testaverde felt
his explosiveness returning, but that accomplishment was
overwhelmed that day by the concern that once the first hits from
another team came, he might be able to go no further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know,'' Testaverde said. ``Can somebody land on the
back of my foot and everything be OK? You don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dan Marino ruptured his Achilles' tendon in 1993,
Testaverde was on the sideline with Cleveland. That was as much as
Testaverde knew about such an injury until he found himself in the
training room last year, hearing the whispers that Marino, who was
hurt at age 32, was never the same afterward. Testaverde's
ignorance was his shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ruptured Achilles'; it doesn't sound like much,'' Testaverde
said. ``Once it's you in that situation, you realize the severity
of it. During training camp I went out to dinner and a man came
over. He said, `The same day you did yours, I did mine.' He was in
the Marines. He can no longer perform his duties, so he's working
in a restaurant. I think about him; I think about me. He can't
perform his duties for his country because of that. Can I come
back?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever doubts Testaverde harbored were exacerbated by the
constant irritation at the mention of his age. He will turn 37
during the season, a point that has buzzed about him like a
persistent fly.
</P>
<P>
   The backup quarterback, Ray Lucas, and running back Curtis
Martin think Testaverde is stronger now than before, because his
arm and legs are well-rested from the layoff. With each day of
practice, Lucas said, Testaverde's throws grew crisper, his
decisions grew faster. The game, as Testaverde put it, slowed down
in his mind's eye.
</P>
<P>
   He has stopped thinking about the heel and he has shelved
thoughts of retirement. Those were born of his own fears, which he
has allayed. With opening day upon him, Testaverde said he is
exhilarated.
</P>
<P>
   The critical test of his confidence came in a preseason game
against the Baltimore Ravens, when the 330-pound defensive lineman
Sam Adams grasped Testaverde from behind by his ankles and pulled
him to the ground. Adams landed on the back of Testaverde's left
heel, driving his big toe into the ground. The Jets were anxious
when Testaverde got up limping, but Testaverde had a
glass-half-full view of the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about the heel when I got hurt,'' he said.
``All I could think about was the shooting pain in my toe. Which
was good. I'm confident in everything now, mentally and physically.
Throwing the football, taking off running, having that feeling of
dropping back in the pocket and taking a hit if I have to.''

A BUYING SPREE AND A PLAN TO BOOST RACING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ While horse racing's marketers have
extolled their own performances but called for more consolidation
to save the industry, two of the sport's most aggressive executives
have driven forward on parallel paths with their own solution:
buying and networking racetracks across America.
</P>
<P>
   The two are Frank Stronach, president of Magna Entertainment,
and Tom Meeker, president of Churchill Downs. Between them, they
now own 13 racetracks and control 40 percent of the market share of
racing's $13.7 billion gambling business.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, Stronach and his worldwide auto-parts
company have spent more than $300 million to buy Santa Anita,
Golden Gate Fields and Bay Meadows in California, Gulfstream Park
in Florida, Remington Park in Oklahoma and Thistledown and Great
Lakes Downs in Ohio. And they make no secret of the fact that they
would like to add Monmouth Park in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs, meanwhile, has spent more than $325 million in
cash or stock to acquire Hollywood Park in California, Calder Race
Course in Florida, Ellis Park in Kentucky and Arlington
International in Illinois. Those tracks joined a company that
already included Hoosier Park in Indiana and Churchill Downs, home
of the Kentucky Derby, the premier race in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Meeker, a 56-year-old lawyer who has been calling the shots at
Churchill Downs since 1984, arrived early in Saratoga Springs this
month for the annual Round Table Conference of racing owners and
officials on Aug. 13. The main message this year was delivered by
the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, which is still
debt-ridden in its third year as racing's ``league office.'' But
Meeker put his own goal bluntly:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to reach a critical mass, to deliver our
product to the people of the United States and, ultimately, the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   By product, he meant horse racing and the gambling that goes
with it. But Meeker said he was not threatening to crush small
tracks under the advancing armor of large tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help the industry,'' he said, ``if we recognize that
there will be consolidation. There will be dominant players. The
smaller tracks fear that `these big boys are going to try to put us
out of business.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But Frank Stronach and the New York Racing Association group
and the other big players, we don't want to put anybody out of
business. We want them to stay in business to take our product.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach, a 67-year-old Canadian who runs his global empire from
Toronto, speaks of his racetracks as entertainment centers with
family appeal. He is also a successful horseman. His Stronach
Stables produced Red Bullet, winner of this year's Preakness. And
he has openly contested the spending and tax methods of the
National Thoroughbred Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each track will have its separate needs,'' Stronach said,
reviewing his goals. ``When I first went to Santa Anita, I noticed
that the soup in the dining room wasn't hot enough. At Gulfstream
Park, there has been some problem with the condition of the turf
course. And they have racing for only 60 days or so each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make sure of the product you are selling. And you
can enhance it with entertainment that is appropriate and
meaningful to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach, a focused man from Austria with a great mane of white
hair, takes pride in the benefits that Magna has installed for its
employees, such as bonus payments and a voice in the company. He is
forcefully direct in manner. He wasted no time in starting major
construction projects at Santa Anita (and making sure the soup was
hot) after he bought the track last year.
</P>
<P>
   The family of racetracks operating under the banners of Meeker
and Stronach already control two essential ingredients of racing:
the horses and the betting money. Lonny Powell, the director of
racing for Magna and Stronach's chief deputy, said from his office
at Santa Anita that this was part of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem in our industry,'' he said, ``is to
guarantee the supply of horses. It might be a stretch in some
places, but if you control racing circuits, you guarantee fuller
fields.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in the struggle to gather racetracks into circuits with
common goals, where does Magna stand?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably, we're getting to the early part of the middle,''
Powell said. ``The first part was very accelerated. But we'll
continue as long as the moves are part of our plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan has three aspects. First, to achieve as much
efficiency as possible from standing tracks. Second, in markets
where it's doable, to enhance the year-round facilities of tracks
in a racing environment, tracks like Santa Anita and Gulfstream,
with their great locations. And third, to build a simulcasting
network with the tracks associated with Magna, with home betting
obviously the aim.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Stronach and Meeker have not squeezed the lemon dry.
Despite the expenditure of $325 million in cash or capital to
expand Churchill's network, Meeker said no drain on resources had
been felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this has put a strain on our resources,'' he said.
``With the acquisition of Arlington Park this year in exchange for
stock, our debt ratio actually dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   What role will the New York Racing Association play, and what
damage may it suffer, if Stronach and Meeker keep rolling forward?
It is conceivable that the NYRA may even end up competing with
Stronach and Meeker in the bidding for New York's Off-Track Betting
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always concerned that you can keep offering
high-quality racing,'' said Terry Meyocks, president of the NYRA,
which has a state franchise to operate the Belmont Park, Aqueduct
and Saratoga tracks. ``All we can do is try to keep offering the
best product we can. We hope we're important enough to hold our own
in any racing business, no matter who dominates it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meyocks pointed out that the NYRA, with a 20 percent share
of the national gambling market in racing, held a special legal
position that would preclude it from joining the gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have to change the law in New York state before we
could acquire tracks outside,'' he said. ``We're licensed to run
the three franchise tracks in New York, but none others.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Stronach and Meeker keep casting their eyes and their
money coast to coast, pursuing consolidation, which they are
betting will revive horse racing before it is too late.

HIS RECORD MAY FALL, BUT SNIDER WILL ALWAYS BE `LORD' OF THE
DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before they are linked by numbers, which should be any day now,
they were linked by attitude.
</P>
<P>
   They are Dodgers outfielders, separated by more than four
decades. Two power hitters, whose home ballparks were nearly 3,000
miles apart, united by approach.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Snider was a Dodgers institution, one of the ``Boys of
Summer'' who brought fame, and finally, a World Series title to
Brooklyn. He spent 16 years as a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield is a comparative Dodger newborn, in his third
season with the Dodgers, with his fourth club overall.
</P>
<P>
   It is Snider _ ``The Lord of Flatbush'' _ who has for 44 years
held the Dodgers' single-season home run record. In 1956 he led the
National League with 43 home runs, the last Dodger to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It's a record Sheffield is likely to surpass soon. He's at 40
now, with more than a month to play.
</P>
<P>
   And neither cares.
</P>
<P>
   Snider said it never meant all that much to him. Sheffield said
it really doesn't matter to him whether he sets any record.
</P>
<P>
   Their approach is the same _ it's just a stat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have mixed emotions because 43 was a number as far as
I was concerned,'' Snider said. ``Numbers weren't all that
important _ it was winning the game and winning the pennant.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield admits he knows almost nothing about Snider _ redubbed
``The Silver Fox'' when the team moved to Los Angeles _ but echoes
his sentiment about individual statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just numbers, just records,'' Sheffield said. ``It's
about wins and losses to me. Some guys like to play the game for
people to recognize their numbers. But I play to be recognized by
how many rings I can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm playing this game for money or awards. I
have money. I have awards. It's about wins and losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Snider, now retired as a broadcaster, spends his summers
overlooking the Pacific from his place in Fort Bragg, a small
community four hours north of San Francisco. He spends the other
three seasons overlooking the sixth fairway on a Fallbrook golf
course.
</P>
<P>
   Life seems good for Snider, who turns 74 next month. He is in
relatively strong health following 1987 bypass surgery. He has cut
down his memorabilia signings to about five a year. He is still
married to Bev, his high school sweetheart in Compton, after 54
years. He works in a pair of Dodgers Fantasy Camps every year.
</P>
<P>
   And if Snider is something less than fanatical, he still remains
interested in the team he helped lead to two World Series titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I check and see how they do every day when I pick up the paper
and look at the box score,'' Snider said. ``I'm not what you call a
rooter. I sleep through the night if they don't, but I like to see
them win. They were my bread and butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Snider came West with the team when they moved to Los
Angeles, playing in the Coliseum and later collecting the first hit
at Dodger Stadium, it was in Brooklyn his legend grew.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, New York was home to three of the greatest center
fielders of all time _ Snider (Dodgers), Willie Mays (Giants) and
Mickey Mantle (Yankees).
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke was a five-point player,'' said Dodgers senior vice
president Tommy Lasorda, a former teammate. ``Duke was a power
hitter who could hit for average, could run, field and he could
throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duke was an outstanding ballplayer. When they talk about
center fielders, they talk about Mantle and Mays. But, damn, you
have to put that guy in there with them. He was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Snider was often overshadowed by Mays and Mantle, though he
actually led the three in homers and RBI during the four seasons
(1954-1957) they all played full-time in New York. He hit more home
runs in the '50s (326) than any other major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who shows little regard for personal records, he set
plenty. He is the only player to twice hit four home runs in a
single World Series ('52, '55). He became just the third player to
hit 40 or more home runs in five consecutive seasons, and Babe Ruth
and Ralph Kiner were the others.
</P>
<P>
   Snider still has the National League World Series records for
home runs (11) and RBI (26). The 389 home runs, 1,271 RBI and 814
extra-base hits he collected as a Dodger remain team records.
</P>
<P>
   Snider spent the final two years of his career with the Mets and
Giants, but while with the Dodgers took in a young, hard-throwing
right-hander who also hailed from Southern California _ Don
Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   The two remained close friends long after their careers ended
and their duties as broadcasters (Snider with the Padres, Expos and
Dodgers) kept the miles between them.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Meyers-Drysdale said there was a mutual respect between the
two, although it could sometimes manifest in unusual ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old-timers game, either Duke or Pee Wee (Reese) would
get up against Donny, and Donny would always knock them down,''
said Meyers-Drysdale. ``They just had this love relationship, this
respectful relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when Duke went through the card-show thing, there was
still a respect about Duke and the way he handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``card-show thing'' found Snider in court. Snider and
Willie McCovey pleaded guilty to income tax evasion in 1995. Snider
admitted not reporting $100,000 in cash from card show and
memorabilia appearances from 1984-93.
</P>
<P>
   Snider was fined $5,000 and paid about $30,000 in back taxes. He
was sentenced in Brooklyn, where he took full responsibility and
apologized to his fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took some advice from the wrong person,'' Snider said.
``They said take this and don't declare it. Then they're the ones
that told the IRS they had given me X-amount of dollars. I made a
mistake. But I'm not making it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching-friendly Dodger Stadium has helped to keep his team
home run record in check _ 43 home runs being a fairly modest total
by today's standards. Only five other major-league teams have a
single-season record that's lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more surprised it hasn't been broken than anything else,''
Sheffield said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield already has the Marlins' home run record. He hit 42
for Florida in 1996. Snider said he met Sheffield once while he was
Marlin, but Sheffield doesn't remember it.
</P>
<P>
   Snider said they spoke by phone last Sunday. He told Sheffield
he won't be back in Southern California for another week, so hurry
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said instead of coming to your games and be sitting there
waiting for you to do it, go ahead and get it done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said if Sheffield hasn't broken the record by the time he
returns to Fallbrook, he might come up for a game, but isn't
interested in camping out at the stadium until it falls.
</P>
<P>
   Snider said he was in Florida last week for a memorabilia show
with ex-Dodger pitcher Johnny Podres, who kidded him his record was
about to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `That's fine,''' Snider recalled. ``And then Johnny
said, `Yeah, but you've still got one record nobody is ever going
to break _ the Brooklyn Dodgers home run record.''' &QL;

JONES IS CONSIDERED THE BEST, AND WANTS TO PROVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The longer Roy Jones Jr. boxes, the more comfortable
he feels with his career, and his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the undisputed light-heavyweight champion (42-1, 34
knockouts), was in Manhattan Tuesday to promote his next fight, a
12-round championship pay-per-view contest against Eric Harding
(19-0-1), Sept. 9 at the New Orleans Arena. For Jones, the bout
looks like another mismatch, a showcase for his immense skills,
fighting an opponent who will enter the ring as a heavy underdog.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, regarded by many as the world's best boxer, has speed,
power, and showmanship that bring electricity to all of his fights.
Yet, at age 31, Jones has won so many fights so handily, he has
begun to search outside his weight class for an opponent who will
provide the defining challenge of his career. His only loss was a
controversial disqualification against Montell Griffin in 1997,
when Jones knocked out Griffin when he was down on one knee. Yet,
Jones avenged that loss immediately with a first-round knockout of
Griffin in his next fight.
</P>
<P>
   Jones talks about moving down in weight to fight the unbeaten
Felix Trinidad, or perhaps moving up for a one-time heavyweight
challenge against either Evander Holyfield or Lennox Lewis. But
even if a marquee event like that never happens for Jones, he
insists that he will remain secure about his place in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to see a big fight like that take place, like
with Trinidad, but we're talking one or two years down the road,''
Jones said. ``I can't plan on that. What if he loses to Fernando
Vargas before then?
</P>
<P>
   ``As for fighting a heavyweight, I would do it one time only, to
try and win the championship. I don't want to be a heavyweight. I'm
not that desperate for a big fight. When I was supposed to have big
fights in the past, I walked through them. James Toney was supposed
to be a big fight, but I dominated. Bernard Hopkins hasn't lost
since I beat him, but I beat him with one hand. If someone comes to
me with a big fight like Felix Trinidad and we can agree to it, I'm
cool with that. But at this point, I don't have to prove
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is coming off an 11th-round technical knockout of Richard
Hall in May, a fight Jones dominated from start to finish.
Meanwhile, Jones has been negotiating with HBO for months regarding
a new contract, but so far, an agreement has not been reached.
Asked if he would re-sign with HBO, Jones was noncommittal. Jones
also manages nine or 10 fighters, and he feels committed to look
after their careers and his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said it was a bad relationship with HBO, but I've got
about five or six more years in this game, and I need to capitalize
on that,'' Jones said. ``This might be the last contract that I
negotiate as a professional athlete. I want to have a place where I
can bring my fighters. After the position I've established in this
game, I shouldn't have to beg for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner Sports, sounded
optimistic that a contract agreement with Jones would eventually be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've left a deal on the table since December,'' Abraham said.
``Roy has never accepted that deal, but we've left it there out of
respect for Roy. Roy is an icon. The deal will get done, or not get
done, when Roy is ready. After the Harding fight, he is a free
agent. But there's no better place than HBO, and we hope to sign
him. I still believe Roy is the best fighter in the world. Other
fighters have risen in the last year _ Felix Trinidad, Shane
Mosley. But I still think Roy stands alone.''
</P>
<P>
   And after the Harding fight, Jones still expects to be in a
class by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might try to hurt me, but if I was him, I wouldn't try to
do that,'' Jones said. ``When I get hurt, I only get stronger.'' &QL;

AND SO IT FLOWS: TALE OF THE CITY
</HEADLINE>
  By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The City Council speaker called a news conference at
Columbus Park in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday to illustrate vividly
the findings of a council study on drinking fountains in city
parks. It did not go exactly as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The council's Office of Oversight and Investigation had checked
the fountains in more than 300 parks across the city and found
rusted spigots, basins littered with chicken bones and standing
water that threatened to attract mosquitoes infected by the West
Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said 23 percent of the fountains
did not produce any water _ including the one in Columbus Park _
and 36 percent failed to dispense water properly.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the Parks Department to overhaul 1,500 of the
city's nearly 2,500 outdoor drinking fountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as hard to get a free sip of water in our parks as to
get a taxi at rush hour,'' Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not always.
</P>
<P>
   Between Monday afternoon, when word of the news conference
circulated, and Tuesday afternoon, when Vallone was intending to
try _ for the benefit of reporters and television cameras _ to get
a drink from the broken fountain in Columbus Park, something
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the news conference began, it was discovered that
the drinking fountain in Columbus Park worked just fine.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the Parks Department, wise to Vallone's plans,
dispatched plumbers to the park to make hurried overnight repairs,
denying Vallone the drama of a broken spigot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show, if they can fix this overnight, what
they could do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner,
said he welcomed the council survey and did not dispute its
findings. He attributed the poor condition of park fountains to
their age, which he said generally exceeded 50 years, and complex
underground plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their figures are essentially reasonable, and they have called
attention to an annoying problem,'' Stern said. ``Now it is in
their hands to provide a remedy.''

&HT;    LOS ANGELES WAKES UP TO WET MORNING
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRENT HOPKINS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A surprise shower dampened Los Angeles on Tuesday
in the first measurable August rainfall in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudy skies that had been blanketing the area suddenly dropped
nearly one-third of an inch of rain in Van Nuys, the wettest spot
in the Los Angeles region, the National Weather Service reported.
Burbank recorded 0.13 of an inch and downtown Los Angeles had 0.07.
</P>
<P>
   The last time any measurable amount of rain fell in August was
1990, when a half-inch was recorded in Burbank, Weather Service
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It last rained in Los Angeles on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Service predicted that the storm would clear out
late Tuesday with partial clouds and fog this morning, and clear
skies in the afternoon through the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Weather Service officials said the cause of Tuesday's shower was
a low-pressure system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an upper-level low-pressure area sitting off the edge
of the coast pulling up a lot of the moisture from the south,''
said Ray Tanabe, weather information specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Weickmann of the National Weather Service's Climate
Diagnostic Center in Washington, D.C., said it could have just as
easily not rained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairly random fluctuation that doesn't have to have a
particular cause. Weather patterns are a chaotic phenomena. We
can't always say that there's a particular reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain offered little relief from the fire danger brought on
by a dry summer, said Bob Collis, spokesman for the Los Angeles
Fire Department, dismissing the rain as minor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit of rain doesn't make too much difference, you
need copious amounts like El Nino. As soon as it dries out, we'll
be back where we started.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after three years of typically eccentric El Nino and
La Nina conditions, there are signs the weather phenomena are
calming, according to the latest satellite data from the
U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the global climate system is finally
recovering from the past three years of dramatic swings from the
extra-large El Nino of 1997-1998, which was followed by two
unusually cool and persistent La Nina years,'' said oceanographer
William Patzert of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's rain was a major inconvenience for those on the
freeways in the morning. Between 5 and 9 a.m., the California
Highway Patrol recorded 45 collisions, said Officer Frank Sansone.
Though no fatalities were attributed to the rain, the number of
crashes was up 71 percent from the same period last week.

CITY'S COLLEGES TURN AWAY IMMIGRANTS WHO DON'T MASTER ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
  By KAREN W. ARENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Business was brisk on Monday at City College's
English-as-a- second-language department _ the headquarters for
teaching English to foreign students.
</P>
<P>
   There was Rachid Haddoury, a husky 27-year-old who had two years
of college in Morocco before coming to New York. He wanted to
enroll as an engineering student at City College of New York. Yet
when placement tests showed that his English reading skills were
still weak and his writing only somewhat better, it was not clear
whether the college would offer him classes in English as a second
language. The college has begun to discourage students from
enrolling until their English is better.
</P>
<P>
   Next came Vladimir Cuevas, a 19-year-old student from the
Dominican Republic who studied English at an Educational
Opportunity Center run by the State University of New York on 125th
Street in Manhattan for a year. He did not do well on the reading
or writing tests either. When he came to register this week, he was
told he needed better mastery of English before he could enroll.
</P>
<P>
   They were part of the steady stream of students on Monday in the
office of Elizabeth Rorschach, the department chairwoman, sitting
in the black armchair next to her desk, pleading to join intensive
classes in English as a second language, or ESL as they are known.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching immigrants has long been a primary mission for City
College, where fewer than 44 percent of the incoming freshmen in
1998 spoke English as their first language.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of ESL students has been slipping at City College
and other parts of City University in recent years. Last fall, City
College filled 17 class sections with foreign students learning
English. Now it is budgeting for five.
</P>
<P>
   College officials say they are seeing fewer applicants needing
English as a second language. But the college is also barring
students like Cuevas, the Dominican student with relatively low
scores, saying the students need to improve their English first.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, such students might have been allowed to enter the
college and spend several years improving their English while they
took college courses. Now, City University has told its senior
colleges to reduce the number of less-prepared students, and that
includes some of those who know the least English.
</P>
<P>
   Under university policies being phased in this year and next,
the senior colleges are not supposed to enroll students who have
not passed all of the university's placement exams. Foreign
students who have attended high school outside the United States
are exempt from this policy; they may enroll without having passed
the reading or writing placement tests. But once enrolled, they are
given only a year to pass them.
</P>
<P>
   That is a stiff challenge for foreign-born students weak in
English. So the colleges are trying to enroll those who are closest
to passing and are advising the rest to attend adult education
classes or the university's language immersion institutes, so they
can improve their English without using up financial aid or
struggling so hard in classes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new university guidelines are not binding on City
College until next year, college officials have been trying to
improve the caliber of their student body anyway. When officials
judged which students had a real chance of academic success, those
not ready for the highest level of ESL were not included.
</P>
<P>
   But success can be difficult to predict, especially for students
who speak limited English. And there are disagreements at the
college and around the university about how selective to be.
</P>
<P>
   Rorschach and some other faculty members are concerned that the
university standard is unnecessarily harsh; because teenagers and
adults can take many years to perfect a new language, it may be
unfair to judge students by whether they are likely to pass
university placement tests in a single year, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Weinbaum, a City College mechanical engineering
professor, said a recent review of the approximately 1,500 students
who had graduated from the engineering school between 1993 and 1997
found that nearly a third had required instruction in English as a
second language.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the students who came to Rorschach's office were
eager to be put in intensive English classes, a few, like Kyah
Thuya, a student from Myanmar, were dismayed to find that they were
considered barely qualified to enter City College and would have to
take 10 hours a week of noncredit courses, probably for a year or
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to waste time,'' said Thuya, frowning, after
talking with Rorschach. He said he had spent two years at the
Newcomers School in Queens after arriving in New York in 1998 and
passed the Regents English exam with a score of 66.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Espaillat, a transfer student from the Dominican Republic
who entered City College last year, t has failed the writing test
three times and says he must pass it before the spring semester if
he is to stay enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I will make it if I work hard,'' he said on Monday,
adding that he was thinking about paying for private lessons to
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my life,'' he said. ``I don't want to work as cashier
or in grocery store. I want to keep going.''

LEITER LEAVES WITH AN INJURY, AND THE METS FALL TO THE ASTROS,
11-1 
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Leiter pitched and Moises Alou swung and a foul
ball came next. It happened nine times in one at-bat in the third
inning Tuesday night, and if it was painful for a Mets fan to
watch, imagine how Leiter felt.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' left-hander was already in pain, with a strained
muscle in his backside. Then Alou delivered a single that skipped
up the middle and scored a run, continuing a torturous four-run
inning that kicked off the Houston Astros' 11-1 victory. Leiter is
not expected to miss his next start, but he left after that third
inning, his shortest start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Derek Bell also left the game with an injury,
departing in the eighth after he banged his left knee against the
padded wall down the right field line in pursuit of a foul fly.
Bell suffered a contusion and X-rays were negative; he is
day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The only remaining drama after the Astros built their 4-0 lead
was whether Atlanta would lose and thus preserve the Mets' tie for
first place in the National League East. The Braves were beaten,
4-2, by the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter lost to Houston for the second time this month, his
record dropping to 14-6. Wade Miller, the Astros' rookie
right-hander, pitched a complete-game five-hitter, improving to
3-5.
</P>
<P>
   The game was marred by sloppy play; the Mets made three errors,
including one by Lenny Harris, whose shaky fielding at third base
earned mock cheers from fans who had little else to make noise
about.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter felt discomfort warming up, and it worsened during the
game. But it was hard to tell anything was wrong until the third
inning, which would have been painful enough for him without an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   After Roger Cedeno walked with one out, Julio Lugo smacked a
liner toward Harris, who has been an important contributor for the
Mets but had not started in five games. Robin Ventura is healthy
but has struggled, with one hit in his last 16 at-bats, and Manager
Bobby Valentine gave him the night off even though Houston started
a right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an answer,'' Valentine said, when asked why
Ventura has struggled, ``and it's not because I haven't given it an
awful lot of thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has been fine defensively, though there's no telling if
he would have caught Lugo's line drive. In any case, it deflected
off Harris's glove and rolled into foul territory, good for a
double. Jeff Bagwell came up next and bounced a single up the
middle, putting the Astros ahead, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo walked, putting runners at first and second, and
Alou's killer at-bat came next. The Astros' right fielder saw 11
pitches and did not swing and miss at any. He fouled off the first
four pitches, then took a pitch as Bagwell stole third.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter tried everything, but Alou kept fouling off pitches _
seven in all after the second strike _ before he bounced a ball off
the mound and through the middle for a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching coach Dave Wallace came to the mound, and Leiter
stayed in to strike out Tony Eusebio. But Chris Truby singled in a
run, and Tim Bogar tapped a ball toward third. It was the classic
Ventura play _ the third baseman charges, barehands it and flings
it to first, falling over as he throws. But Harris, not Ventura,
was at third, and his throw was too late to catch Bogar.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth run scored, and after Leiter got Miller to ground to
Harris, the left-hander's night was over. Pat Mahomes batted for
Leiter after two singles opened the Mets' third. But Mahomes popped
up his bunt attempt, Darryl Hamilton struck out and Bell grounded
out to strand two runners.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes's night was just as rocky when he took the mound. The
Astros scored before Mahomes got an out, on a single, a stolen base
and a Lugo double, and another run came in on a sacrifice fly. That
put the Astros ahead, 6-0, and they could have had another run in
the fifth, but the Mets successfully appealed a play at third,
claiming Truby broke for home too soon on a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   No matter _ Houston had another big inning left, scoring three
times in the sixth in a rally touched off by Bagwell's 40th homer.
Mahomes was lifted after allowing five runs in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jerrod Riggan, a 26-year-old right-handed closer, was called up
from at Class AA Binghamton, arriving at Shea Stadium in the middle
of the game. Riggan worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning, getting three
groundouts.

 &HT;    CNN president Kaplan will leave network
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - CNN will announce the departure today of Richard A.
Kaplan, president of CNN-U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of a reorganization of upper management at CNN
News Group, which includes CNN International, CNNfn and CNN-SI.
</P>
<P>
   The exact scenario of Kaplan's leaving was not available Tuesday
night and CNN executives would not talk on the record. Kaplan could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, head of CNN's domestic channel, is scheduled to announce
his departure at an executive meeting today. Sid Bedingfield, CNN
executive vice president and Kaplan's key lieutenant, is expected
to be named interim president.
</P>
<P>
   Other CNN management changes are expected, including the naming
of Phil Kent, a financial executive from Turner International, as
chief operating officer of CNN, and a promotion for Eason Jordan,
president of international networks and one of CNN's key movers.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN reorganization, which has been in the works for some
time, is designed to better position the news network in the
changing world of media and the Internet. CNN is a key part of the
pending America Online-Time Warner merger and the network's
expansion will be tied closely to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, 53, was brought in three years ago to revitalize
CNN-U.S. and raise the network's ratings. Although he instituted
major changes that were praised by analysts _ such as hiring Jeff
Greenfield as a political commentator, building a more modern
newsroom and eliminating a lot of repeated news _ CNN's ratings
have been down about 35 percent all year, compared to 1999. In
addition, cable competitor Fox News Channel has been gaining ground
on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   During CNN's 20th anniversary celebration in May, CNN Newsgroup
chairman Tom Johnson blamed the ratings slump on an unusually
lengthy period of slow news. ``When there is no news, our audience
is very weak,'' Johnson said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hired Kaplan in 1997 from ABC News, where he had earned
a reputation as a tough, respected and sometimes intimidating
executive producer of Ted Koppel's ``Nightline.'' He was charged
with making the network sharper, better and higher-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the CNN staff divided into pro- and
anti-Kaplan factors. He moved some anchors aside and shook up the
production staff. Anchors called the 6-foot-7-inch Kaplan ``T Rex''
behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first major moves was the launch of the newsmagazine
``NewsStand'' in July 1998. Originally conceived as a joint effort
with Time Warner magazines Time, Fortune and Entertainment Weekly,
Kaplan intended the program to be ``appointment television'' that
viewers would turn to even when there was no major news story.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan thought so highly of it that for the first time, actor
James Earl Jones changed his announcement from ``This is CNN'' to
``This is CNN NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   But the program exploded on launch with a story about Operation
Tailwind, a U.S. military mission in Laos in 1970. CNN alleged U.S.
soldiers used nerve gas and targeted U.S. defectors. Peter Arnett,
one of CNN's heroes of the Persian Gulf War coverage, was the
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry from the military was loud and sustained. CNN ordered
an investigation and soon retracted the story and apologized. One
key producer was allowed to resign, two others were fired and
Arnett was barely used again, until finally his contract was not
renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Many veterans at CNN blamed Kaplan, who had worked hard on
``NewsStand,'' for the fiasco. ``NewsStand'' eventually evolved
into little more than the 10 p.m. CNN news block.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan also oversaw the building of CNN's new newsroom in 1998.
The $7.5 million project improved CNN's on-air look and gave relief
to staffers, who previously had been crammed into close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Kaplan launched ``The World Today,'' the 8 p.m.
newscast anchored by Wolf Blitzer, Joie Chen and Jim Moret, again
with great fanfare and talk of it being CNN's ``flagship''
newscast. When a hurricane threatened the East Coast or there was a
big news story, the ratings soared. But as has always been the case
for CNN, when the story went away, the audience went away.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of these launches, remakes and attempts to boost
ratings without sacrificing CNN's credibility, Kaplan was the
source of constant rumors inside CNN that he was on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, though, he survived a run-in with Lou Dobbs, the
powerful ``Moneyline'' anchor and friend of Ted Turner, and emerged
triumphant with Dobbs leaving CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's crowning moment at CNN was the 20th anniversary in May.
He helped assemble a huge roster of VIP speakers and guests, and
took particular joy in planning the blow-out party in Philips Arena
with Diana Ross and the Supremes providing entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not clear how much of a role CNN's ratings
decline this year played in Kaplan's departure, it's likely that he
would have been seen as victorious if the network's ratings had
risen.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways at CNN behind the scenes, there are large framed
graphs that chart the ratings through the years, showing peaks (the
Gulf War, the O.J. Simpson trial) and valleys (the rest of the
time).
</P>
<P>
   During his three years at CNN, Kaplan refused to hang one in his
office. He said last year: ``I actually detest those graphs.''

 &HT;    CNN president Kaplan will leave network
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - CNN will announce the departure today of Richard A.
Kaplan, president of CNN-U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of a reorganization of upper management at CNN
News Group, which includes CNN International, CNNfn and CNN-SI.
</P>
<P>
   The exact scenario of Kaplan's leaving was not available Tuesday
night and CNN executives would not talk on the record. Kaplan could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, head of CNN's domestic channel, is scheduled to announce
his departure at an executive meeting today. Sid Bedingfield, CNN
executive vice president and Kaplan's key lieutenant, is expected
to be named interim president.
</P>
<P>
   Other CNN management changes are expected, including the naming
of Phil Kent, a financial executive from Turner International, as
chief operating officer of CNN, and a promotion for Eason Jordan,
president of international networks and one of CNN's key movers.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN reorganization, which has been in the works for some
time, is designed to better position the news network in the
changing world of media and the Internet. CNN is a key part of the
pending America Online-Time Warner merger and the network's
expansion will be tied closely to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, 53, was brought in three years ago to revitalize
CNN-U.S. and raise the network's ratings. Although he instituted
major changes that were praised by analysts _ such as hiring Jeff
Greenfield as a political commentator, building a more modern
newsroom and eliminating a lot of repeated news _ CNN's ratings
have been down about 35 percent all year, compared to 1999. In
addition, cable competitor Fox News Channel has been gaining ground
on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   During CNN's 20th anniversary celebration in May, CNN Newsgroup
chairman Tom Johnson blamed the ratings slump on an unusually
lengthy period of slow news. ``When there is no news, our audience
is very weak,'' Johnson said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hired Kaplan in 1997 from ABC News, where he had earned
a reputation as a tough, respected and sometimes intimidating
executive producer of Ted Koppel's ``Nightline.'' He was charged
with making the network sharper, better and higher-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the CNN staff divided into pro- and
anti-Kaplan factors. He moved some anchors aside and shook up the
production staff. Anchors called the 6-foot-7-inch Kaplan ``T Rex''
behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first major moves was the launch of the newsmagazine
``NewsStand'' in July 1998. Originally conceived as a joint effort
with Time Warner magazines Time, Fortune and Entertainment Weekly,
Kaplan intended the program to be ``appointment television'' that
viewers would turn to even when there was no major news story.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan thought so highly of it that for the first time, actor
James Earl Jones changed his announcement from ``This is CNN'' to
``This is CNN NewsStand.''
</P>
<P>
   But the program exploded on launch with a story about Operation
Tailwind, a U.S. military mission in Laos in 1970. CNN alleged U.S.
soldiers used nerve gas and targeted U.S. defectors. Peter Arnett,
one of CNN's heroes of the Persian Gulf War coverage, was the
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry from the military was loud and sustained. CNN ordered
an investigation and soon retracted the story and apologized. One
key producer was allowed to resign, two others were fired and
Arnett was barely used again, until finally his contract was not
renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Many veterans at CNN blamed Kaplan, who had worked hard on
``NewsStand,'' for the fiasco. ``NewsStand'' eventually evolved
into little more than the 10 p.m. CNN news block.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan also oversaw the building of CNN's new newsroom in 1998.
The $7.5 million project improved CNN's on-air look and gave relief
to staffers, who previously had been crammed into close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Kaplan launched ``The World Today,'' the 8 p.m.
newscast anchored by Wolf Blitzer, Joie Chen and Jim Moret, again
with great fanfare and talk of it being CNN's ``flagship''
newscast. When a hurricane threatened the East Coast or there was a
big news story, the ratings soared. But as has always been the case
for CNN, when the story went away, the audience went away.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of these launches, remakes and attempts to boost
ratings without sacrificing CNN's credibility, Kaplan was the
source of constant rumors inside CNN that he was on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, though, he survived a run-in with Lou Dobbs, the
powerful ``Moneyline'' anchor and friend of Ted Turner, and emerged
triumphant with Dobbs leaving CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's crowning moment at CNN was the 20th anniversary in May.
He helped assemble a huge roster of VIP speakers and guests, and
took particular joy in planning the blow-out party in Philips Arena
with Diana Ross and the Supremes providing entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not clear how much of a role CNN's ratings
decline this year played in Kaplan's departure, it's likely that he
would have been seen as victorious if the network's ratings had
risen.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways at CNN behind the scenes, there are large framed
graphs that chart the ratings through the years, showing peaks (the
Gulf War, the O.J. Simpson trial) and valleys (the rest of the
time).
</P>
<P>
   During his three years at CNN, Kaplan refused to hang one in his
office. He said last year: ``I actually detest those graphs.''

WHITMAN PRESENTS HER GOALS BEFORE THE ELECTION WHIRLWIND 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   TRENTON, N.J. _ Cautioning that
election-year politics should not be allowed to overshadow New
Jersey's pressing public policy issues, Gov. Christe Whitman
challenged legislators on Tuesday to enact modest increases in
financing for several health care programs and to tighten campaign
finance restrictions when they begin their fall session next week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at a briefing in the State House, the
governor unveiled her legislative wish list for the fall: an
additional $25 million to expand the state's prescription drug plan
for the elderly; $17 million to allow more low-income families to
qualify for the Family Care health insurance program; and at least
$10 million to increase the amount the state reimburses doctors who
treat Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   In a proposal that may encounter opposition from legislators,
Whitman also offered campaign finance restrictions that would force
all advocacy groups that advertise for or against candidates to
identify their members and donors.
</P>
<P>
   During her seven years as governor, Whitman has made it a ritual
to publicly release her legislative priorities in January, when she
delivers her State of the State message and makes budget proposals.
But the governor, who must step down in January 2002 because of
term limits, said she broke with tradition this year because she
did not want the presidential race, or the political jousting
between the legislators who hope to succeed her, to unduly dominate
the state's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it's a big election-cycle year, there's time to
get some of these issues out of the way,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   With just 16 months remaining in her term, Whitman said she was
determined to strengthen some of the policies she has championed
since taking office in 1994. She asked that the Family Care
program, which was enacted last year to help low-income residents
afford health care, receive additional financing to allow all
families with an income of up to $10,000 to qualify. The governor
said it was crucial to raise the cutoff limit from its current
level of $8,000 because many of the people who have left the
state's welfare rolls in recent years do not qualify for coverage
now and have less incentive to remain in the work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so focused on welfare-to-work and making it work,'' she
said. ``We need to remove barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two leaders of the Legislature _ Donald T. DiFrancesco,
the Senate president, and Jack Collins, the Assembly speaker _ are
both vying for the Republican nomination for governor in 2001, and
Whitman acknowledged that they are likely to exert more power over
the legislative agenda during the next year.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco, for instance, recently announced a proposal for
property tax relief and is scheduled to release a health care
package on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she was pleased with much of DiFrancesco's plan,
especially a provision that would allow patients to sue health
maintenance organizations if they receive substandard care.
</P>
<P>
   She said she would also ask legislators to form a panel to help
patients through the complex process of challenging decisions by
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she hoped that the election year would help marshal
public support for her campaign finance proposals, which would
require more public disclosure by donors and advocacy groups and
eliminate the state's matching funds for contributions from
out-of-state sources. But the governor did not push for some of the
more sweeping proposals to overhaul the state's campaign finance
laws, like limiting expenditures in local races or reducing the
$30,000 donation limits to political action committees controlled
by New Jersey legislative leaders.

VICTORINE NAMED TO U.S. TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Galaxy midfielder Sasha Victorine had just
finished training Tuesday when he got the word from team
administrator Eddie Hidalgo _ he's going to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Victorine, named an alternate on the U.S. U-23 Olympic team two
weeks ago while fellow Galaxy teammates Danny Califf and Peter
Vagenas were named to the team, is going to Sydney after all.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Soccer officials will make it official this afternoon.
Victorine will replace Chicago's Chris Armas, who strained his knee
Aug. 16 while playing a World Cup qualifier against Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Armas' injury, it has been a waiting game for
Victorine, who will play his final regular-season game with the
Galaxy tonight against San Jose at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he'll join Califf and Vagenas for Olympic training
in Chula Vista before leaving for Sydney on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   All three Galaxy Olympians will miss the final two
regular-season games and at least the first round of the MLS
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting feeling to get the word,'' said Victorine.
``And it's relief at the same time. It's a big weight off my
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to keep it off my mind as much as I could, but it was
impossible with everyone talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's great news for Victorine, it's another tough blow for
the Galaxy (13-8-8, 47 points), which is trying to catch Western
Division-leading Kansas City (14-7-8, 50 points). The Wizards lead
by three points (one full game) with three games to play.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the Galaxy is without starters Cobi Jones
(U.S.), Luis Hernandez (Mexico) and Mauricio Cienfuegos (El
Salvador) tonight. All three are in training for World Cup
qualifiers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Earthquakes (6-15-8, 26 points) helped even things
out. San Jose is without seven players _ Ronald Cerritos, Wade
Barrett, Richard Mulrooney, Giovanni Savarese, Jimmy Conrad,
Mauricio Solis and Scott Bower _ because of national team
commitments, injuries or suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice change to play someone else that misses some
players,'' Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said. ``But for us, since the
deal with Luis went down, we've only had 10 days where we have had
the whole team together. That's not an excuse, but it's been hard
to establish rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's a surprise the Galaxy is still within striking
distance of K.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a surprise considering how often we have turned down
opportunities to catch them,'' said Schmid. ``We have had numerous
chances, but every time we get presented with an opportunity we
say, `No thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   With strikers Victorine and Jones gone, Schmid will audition
Sebastian Vorbe and Seth George up front. One of these two will
earn a starting nod during the playoffs with Victorine lost to the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our depth has not shown itself up front,'' said Schmid. ``But
I've got to start somebody up there.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: RAY'S ILL-TIMED REPORT 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 30:
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he succeeded Kenneth Starr as independent
counsel, Robert W. Ray has been aware of the need to conclude the
investigations of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in a
fair and timely way, without needlessly disrupting the campaign
season. Ray has dribbled out reports on two elements of a broad
inquiry that has lasted more than five years and cost $50 million.
Now, according to a story by Neil A. Lewis in Tuesday's Times, Ray
plans to deliver the third and potentially most controversial
report in mid-September or shortly thereafter _ in other words,
just when the New York senatorial contest between Mrs. Clinton and
Rep. Rick Lazio is kicking into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   This page has long supported a full investigation of Whitewater
and all the other unresolved allegations involving Bill and Hillary
Clinton that disappeared from public view during the Lewinsky
scandal. In March, Ray reported on allegations that the White House
had improperly collected confidential FBI files, which he
attributed to a bureaucratic foul-up. In June, he reported on Mrs.
Clinton's role in the firing of seven White House travel office
employees. Though he found no grounds for prosecution, Ray was
correctly critical, in our view, of Mrs. Clinton's sworn statements
that she had nothing to do with the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   The third report will deal with the allegations that originally
got everyone's attention, mainly that the Clintons had used their
influence during the president's years as governor to prop up a
failing Arkansas savings and loan, and that Mrs. Clinton in
particular had not been fully candid about her role. Those issues
had been raised initially by investigative reports in the Times.
</P>
<P>
   But if the independent counsel had the evidence to bring a
criminal indictment against Mrs. Clinton on Whitewater, he should
have and would have done so by now. At this point, given Ray's
inability to bring indictments, the need for an orderly election
overrides the need for a detailed report summing up the
prosecutor's findings. In such a report, Ray is almost certain to
pass judgment on Mrs. Clinton's behavior and subsequent testimony,
much as he did in the Travelgate report. It is because of this that
fundamental questions of timing and fair play arise.
</P>
<P>
   Ray argues that a mid-September release will leave plenty of
time for comment and rebuttal. This ignores political reality. Ray
has had months to bring a prosecution or to get information of
persuasive political importance before the voters. In the absence
of stunning new information worthy of prosecution, he should stand
aside and let the voters decide based on the existing voluminous
public record. If Ray cares at all about his credibility, and about
whether the public sees his report as an objective document or a
time bomb lobbed at Mrs. Clinton's campaign, he will delay until
after the campaign.

UCLA'S MARTIN HOPES FOR BETTER THINGS THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The book about Kenyon Coleman's 1999 season would
be called ``When Bad Teams Happen to Good Players.'' If anybody had
bothered to write a book about such a forgettable season.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman is too pleasant a fellow to say that about his
teammates. But I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Coleman, the large-but-likeable defensive
lineman and UCLA co-captain, had never played on a team with a
losing record. In fact, he'd never played on a team that failed to
win a championship of some sort, not in three seasons at Alta Loma
High in San Bernardino County and not in two Rose Bowl seasons in
college.
</P>
<P>
   The only ribbing he'd ever had to endure was the most flattering
sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember teasing him during his sophomore year, when it
looked like we were on our way to the (national) championship, that
he was going to win titles in both high school and college, and
that would make him kind of unique,'' said Michael Coleman,
Kenyon's older brother, who is a UCLA football team manager.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Bruins' 20-win streak ended disastrously with losses to
Miami and Wisconsin at the end of the 1998 season, and they went
4-7 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it hurt him pretty bad when we lost last year,''
Michael said. ``We would go home, and people would be telling him,
`You guys are sorry.' It was real hard on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman could take satisfaction in personal achievement. He
finished the year with a strong game (nine tackles) against USC,
and was named second-team All-Pac-10 by the conference coaches. But
the USC game was a defeat, and the team finished ninth in the
Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Not much satisfaction in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't really separate (team and individual) things,''
Michael said. ``People tell him, `You did this and that,' and he
says, `Whatever.' He's a team player.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 6-foot-6 and 280 pounds, did a lot of this and that in
his junior season, but none of it was enough to make winners of the
Bruins. Their defense ranked ninth in the Pac-10 and their offense
wasn't any better in the first year after Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was playing up to my ability, but when you're in that
situation, you always feel you could do more to help the team,''
Kenyon said.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's team orientation probably began early in life. He's a
member of a large family, with a brother and three sisters, all
collegians. His father, Johnny, is a retired IRS auditor, and his
mother, Patsy, took care of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny was a strict father (was the IRS thing a tip-off?) who
made church attendance mandatory. Kenyon still gets on his knees
and prays in the locker room before games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenyon would score 50 points in a basketball game,'' Michael
said, ``and our dad would humble him and tell him, `You need to
work with your teammates more.'''
</P>
<P>
   If only it worked that way in football, where even the best
player is at the mercy of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 21, is the best player on the UCLA team that is
unranked as it opens its season against No.3 Alabama on Saturday at
the Rose Bowl. The Sporting News rates him All-Pac-10 and
second-team All-America. Draftniks size him up as a first-round
pick for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts see his talent even though his statistics (50 tackles, 3
sacks last year) are unspectacular.
</P>
<P>
   This year his numbers should grow. After switching from end to
tackle each time UCLA went to the nickel defense in 1999, making
him more susceptible to double-teams by opposing blockers, he'll be
at end on every play in 2000, free to show off his pass-rushing
ability.
</P>
<P>
   The defense as a whole is supposed to be improved. Coleman sees
the whole team improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season started out with the handicapped (parking) thing,
and then we had a lot of injuries,'' he said in the campus athletic
offices. ``You felt kind of helpless. You'd think, `If we fixed
this one thing, it would get better.' But you couldn't do that
because so many things went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman thinks the Bruins, healthy and more experienced, have
top-15 potential. If he's right, he'll have a much happier season.
</P>
<P>
   Top 15 means never having to hear you're sorry. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A RISKY AMERICAN COURSE IN COLOMBIA 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 30:
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's President, Andres Pastrana, deserves American support
for his efforts to reduce drug production and trafficking and begin
peace negotiations with Marxist guerrillas. Pastrana's political
position is shaky at the moment, and President Clinton's visit to
the port of Cartagena on Wednesday may help reinforce it. But the
Clinton trip will also inaugurate a misguided expansion of American
support to Colombia's security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's army and police are fighting a simultaneous war
against drug producers and Marxist guerrillas who now control as
much as half of the country's territory. It is unrealistic to
imagine that the $1.3 billion aid package, most of it to supply 60
military helicopters and train a new army anti-narcotics brigade,
will only be used against the drug traffickers and not also against
the guerrillas who provide them with armed protection.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with Washington helping an elected
democratic government combat a brutal armed insurgency. But this
particular guerrilla conflict, which has been raging for decades,
has reached a military stalemate and needs to be resolved at the
negotiating table. Delivering close to $1 billion in American
military aid does not seem the best way to encourage both sides to
talk peace.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's army has a terrible record of violating human rights.
Regrettably, the House stripped the aid legislation of safeguards
to improve military professionalism, and Clinton unwisely waived
one of the remaining human rights provisions to let aid begin
flowing immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package contains some good features, including nearly
$240 million for human rights training, judicial reform and
programs promoting alternative economic activities for peasants now
making their living from drug cultivation. It will be up to
Clinton's successor to see that American aid is used to promote
peace and development, not to draw Washington into an endless
guerrilla war.

NELSON, MAVERICKS GET THEIR BIG MAN IN LAETTNER
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Two weeks after helping foil a four-team, 11-player
trade involving Patrick Ewing and Vin Baker, Dallas Mavericks
coach/general manager Don Nelson finally got his man.
</P>
<P>
   After Nelson convinced the Detroit Pistons they were getting a
raw deal in a proposed four-team trade, the Mavericks reaped the
benefits Tuesday by acquiring Christian Laettner and Terry Mills
from the Pistons in exchange for forwards Cedric Ceballos and John
Wallace, point guard Eric Murdock and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Laettner and Mills fill the Mavericks' need for more big bodies,
and they have the Pistons to thank for this deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That earlier four-team deal would have been the worst trade
we've ever seen for Detroit,'' Nelson said Tuesday from his
off-season home in Hawaii. ``They were an hour from putting that
thing to bed, but we gave them a reason to take a second look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of phone calls and a lot of hard work. But the
bottom line is we got a couple of good players and Detroit made a
much better deal than they would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Laettner, 31, is a natural power forward who played the past two
seasons for the Pistons. The eight-year veteran _ he was the third
overall pick in the 1992 draft by Minnesota _ averaged 12.2 points
and 6.7 rebounds while starting all 82 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he likes the idea of starting Laettner at center
because Shawn Bradley is prone to foul difficulties whenever he
starts. But he also said Bradley will start some at center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be in control of that matchup as a coach,'' Nelson
said. ``But I think Shawn and Christian will do what's best for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Mills, he also doubles as a power forward and center and
has a deft shooting touch from three-point range. Last year Mills
started 78 of the 82 games he played for the Pistons and averaged
6.7 points and 4.8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos was the principal figure the Mavericks lost in the
trade. Last year Ceballos was third on the team in scoring (16.6),
led the Mavericks in rebounds (6.7) and finished tied for third for
the NBA's Sixth Man Award.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Murdock were acquired earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said he didn't bring Laettner in to
be a savior, adding that he'll also back up Gary Trent at power
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get a lot of minutes and he'll get a lot of shots, just
like Ced did,'' Cuban said. ``So we're ready for him to contribute,
but not to be the focal point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian is the absolute student of the game. I think he'll
really enjoy the sets that we run; they're not really complicated
and they give everybody on the court a chance to excel.''
</P>
<P>
   For salary-cap purposes, it helped, too, that Laettner is in the
final year of a contract that pays him $6.725 million this season.
Meanwhile, Mills, 32, signed a three-year contract with the Pistons
before Tuesday's trade.
</P>
<P>
   However, only the first year of the contract ($1.4 million) is
guaranteed, meaning the Mavericks can dump him after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said Tuesday's trade was held up for almost two days
because some other teams were trying to break it up. Cuban added
that Laettner telephoned to tell him how excited he was to sign
with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Both Laettner and Mills come from a winning pedigree, albeit on
the collegiate level. Mills played a key role on the Michigan squad
that captured the 1989 NCAA title, and Laettner helped guide Duke
to NCAA championships in 1991 and '92.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago the Pistons were set to receive spare parts David
Wingate, Vernon Maxwell, Greg Foster, Tyronn Lue, Vladimir Stepania
and John Celestand and draft picks in a four-team trade with
Seattle, New York and the Los Angeles Lakers. The Sonics would have
received Ewing with Baker going to the Knicks and Laettner to the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson, who coveted Laettner, got in the middle of it, and
the rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coup because of two things,'' Nelson said of Tuesday's
events. ``First of all, we got Laettner. And second, we messed up
the big trade and kept Seattle from getting better and the Lakers
from getting better.'' nn

  The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 30:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress has become a crucial battleground this election year
with Republicans trying to strengthen their slim majority in the
House and Democrats battling to overturn it. New Yorkers are
beginning to see some evidence of this struggle in several key
primaries to be held September 12.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Suffolk County, 2nd District.: The seat relinquished by
Republican Rep. Rick Lazio to run for the Senate has become one of
the key swing districts nationally for both parties. On the
Republican side, Joan Johnson, town clerk of Islip, offers
Republicans a high-profile choice over Robert Walsh, a retired
banker. Johnson, an African-American, was featured prominently at
Republican convention. With her strong community credentials and
moderate views on social issues, Johnson would be the better choice
for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic primary pits two solid candidates against one
another _ David Bishop, minority leader of the Suffolk County
Legislature, and Steven Israel, majority leader of the Huntington
Town Board. Bishop has a number of key party endorsements, but we
recommend Israel for his broader knowledge of national and
international affairs and his ability to forge bipartisan
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn-Queens, 9th District.: After a promising first term,
Rep. Anthony Weiner is being challenged in the Democratic primary
by City Councilman Noach Dear. Weiner has fought energetically for
gun control, noise abatement of airlines and relief for abused
women. Both candidates support campaign finance reform. Weiner
voted for the Shays-Meehan bill last year, and Dear promises to
support it if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Dear, an ardent conservative on many issues including abortion
and gay rights, is also listed on the Republican line in this
district. On the Democratic line, we recommend Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn, 10th District.: Rep. Edolphus Towns is being
challenged by Barry Ford, a Harvard-trained lawyer who did well
against the congressman in a three-way race two years ago. Towns
has a powerful organization in this district, but after 18 years,
his record in Congress has been minimal and his support for tobacco
and other special interests is troubling. For that reason, we
endorse Ford, an energetic community activist who wants more
educational improvements, school construction and an empowerment
zone for the area.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn, 11th District.: Una Clarke, who cannot run for
re-election to the City Council, has turned to the district seat
now being held by her former mentor, Rep. Major Owens, who has
represented the area since 1982. Owens has not kept up with his
constituent services, making him vulnerable to someone who has been
a formidable voice in the city on women's and immigrant issues.
Both sides have turned this into an excessively bitter contest.
However, Clarke campaigns under the shadow of a $48,000 fine from
the city's campaign finance board that remains unresolved. For this
reason, we recommend Owens.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 30:
</P>
<P>
   It may be tempting to put all the blame for the latest Wall
Street hoax on on the frenetic pace of today's financial and news
cycles. But this was also a case of greed taking advantage of lax
vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, investors in Emulex, a maker of fiber optic
communications equipment, shaved more than $2 billion off the
company's market value. A terse press release announced that the
company's chairman was departing, and that it would be restating
its earnings for the past two years. Trouble is, Emulex never
issued the press release. Internet Wire, an online news-release
service, had accepted the document from a third party claiming to
be Emulex's public relations firm, without checking its
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters who tried to reach California-based Emulex failed
because of the time difference. Presumably the bogus publicist had
wagered in the markets that the stock would plummet, as it did from
$103 to $45 Friday morning once a number of financial news outlets
carried the item. The Nasdaq market finally halted trading on the
stock at 10:33 a.m. It snapped back once trading resumed early that
afternoon, after the hoax had been revealed. But for some
investors, the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Wire has called the perpetrator a ``very sophisticated
criminal.'' But in truth, the low-cost service and several
reputable media organizations dropped the ball; this criminal could
have been thwarted with a single phone call. Emulex and the Nasdaq
can also be faulted for not reacting more quickly to events. Surely
in this day and age investors should not lose billions to fraud
simply because California is in a different time zone.

A CALIFORNIA JUDGE SAYS FORD FACES IGNITION RECALL
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for rewriting throughout; adds about 300 words of new
reporting at end.) 
By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a ruling that could deal a blow to the Ford Motor Co., a
California judge largely agreed late Tuesday with complaints that
Ford knowingly installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly 2
million vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary decision, Alameda County Superior Court Judge
Michael E. Ballachey said he intended to issue orders ``compelling
recall and repair'' of the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The part in question is an ignition module that regulates
current to the spark plugs. In 300 models, the module was mounted
on the distributor near the engine block, where it was exposed to
high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Car buyers' lawyers said Ford had been warned by an engineer
that high temperatures would cause the device to fail and stall the
engine. Consumer advocates estimated that it would cost Ford $70
million to $250 million to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision, which will be discussed at a hearing at the
Alameda County Court on Sept. 28, could be more damaging to Ford's
reputation than its finances, consumer advocates said. In the wake
of the Firestone tire recall, the company is working diligently to
maintain public trust in its products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bad news at a bad time for the Ford Motor Co.,'' said
Clarence M. Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto
Safety in Washington. The company, he noted, is broadcasting
television ads that say, ``Trust us, we put safety first.'' Then,
Ditlow said, ``This decision says, `We put profits first.'''
</P>
<P>
   The California plaintiffs brought their case against Ford in
February 1996. It covers about 1.8 million Ford vehicles registered
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, plaintiffs' lawyers produced documents intended to
show that Ford withheld information from federal regulators about
an engineering defect that can cause the vehicles to stall at high
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   In his 10-page preliminary ruling, Ballachey was sharply
critical of the way Ford dealt with the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration. ``Ford's strategy, clearly established by
the credible evidence was `If you don't ask the right question, we
don't have to answer with what common sense tells us you want to
know,''' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The opening sentence of the next paragraph in the tentative
decision reads, ``Ford withheld responsive information from NHTSA
that it was obligated to divulge.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Krusel, a Ford spokeswoman, responded, ``The real-world
data and engineering analysis is in direct conflict with the
court's ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These modules performed as well as any alternative design at
the time,'' she added. ``In 18 years, there has never been any
evidence proving that any accident or injury'' had ever been caused
by one of the modules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is simply nothing to fix,'' Krusel said. ``We expect
this ruling will be reversed on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey L. Fazio, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, called
the decision ``a complete vindication of the claims we have made
against Ford.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the traffic safety agency could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling addresses violations of two California
statutes: the Consumers' Legal Remedies Act and the Unfair
Competition Law.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, a mistrial was declared in the first phase of the
case, in which jurors were asked to determine whether Ford was
liable for compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were deadlocked 7-5 and 8-4 on two key questions of
liability. Nine votes were needed for a verdict in the civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   In that trial, Ford denied any defects, saying its vehicles were
no more prone to stalling than any others and posed no safety
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Ford paid a record $425,000 fine for delays or
omissions in providing information to the traffic safety agency
about problems with ignition switches that could cause fires. About
25 million Ford vehicles built from 1983 to 1992 had such switches.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' groups in five other states have filed class-action
lawsuits against Ford relating to the ignition modules, which are
different from the switches. Those cases have been delayed pending
the outcome of the California case.

DESPITE SLIGHT BREAK IN HEAT, MAN DIES IN KANSAS CITY HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR and DONNA McGUIRE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ After more than a week of 100-degree
temperatures, the relentless heat wave has claimed its first
victim.
</P>
<P>
   A family member found the body of a 68-year-old man late Monday
in his uncooled Northeast area home. A fan buzzed inside, but it
probably just increased the elderly man's body temperature by
circulating hot air, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For eight days now, temperatures in parts of the metropolitan
area have hit at least 100 degrees. A weak weather front brought
some relief Tuesday to Kansas City's north side.
</P>
<P>
   That brought a divergence in temperatures from north to south _
a disparity that reached its greatest difference at 2:30 p.m., when
the temperature at Kansas City International Airport was 87 while
at New Century AirCenter in southwest Johnson County, Kan., it was
100.
</P>
<P>
   The official high at KCI on Tuesday was 91, which was a break
from a 105-degree Monday. New Century AirCenter's high Tuesday was
100. Kansas City's record high for a Tuesday, set in 1984, was 110.
Today the high may reach 102 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Across the metropolitan area, social service agencies,
utilities, cities and school districts were reallocating resources
to combat the effects of the heat. The area remains under a heat
advisory today, and Health Department officials urge people,
particularly the elderly, to take precautions and stay cool.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools were letting students out early.
</P>
<P>
   The weather also kept the Kansas City area under an orange alert
for ozone, a warning that air pollution may rise to unhealthy
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Local utilities _ both electric and water _ reported record
consumption on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the heat wave's human toll that concerned most on
Tuesday. This week's heat-related death brings the year's total to
six, but health officials worry that the number could quickly rise
if the intense heat lingers. The forecast calls for temperatures in
the 100s and high 90s through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last year 21 died in the summer heat. Those concerns had social
service agencies scrambling Tuesday to establish cooling shelters
and provide air conditioners, fans and information about how to
stay cool.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Williams, 94, had no air conditioner in her Northeast
area home on Monday, and she regretted having to close her front
door at sunset. It meant she would be stuck inside her steamy home,
without a breeze, all night.
</P>
<P>
   Before relief came her way, she stretched out on the living room
couch, near the front door where the breeze once flowed. And she
turned off a large floor fan borrowed from a neighbor. It was
blowing only hot air, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was afraid to look at the thermostat. She didn't want to
know how hot it really was. Finally, she got the idea to soak bath
towels with water and drape them across her body. She also wet a
wash cloth and periodically brushed it across her cat, Blackie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those wet towels sure saved me,'' she said Tuesday afternoon,
a few hours after two men from Bishop Sullivan Center installed a
new window air conditioner for her.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Woods, chairwoman of the Kansas City Health Department's
heat task force, cautioned that when temperatures are around 100,
fans do little more than circulate the hot air. They may even raise
the body temperature of someone trapped in that heat, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans can be helpful, she added, if people spray their bodies
with water or use wet towels, as Williams did.
</P>
<P>
   In response to last year's heat wave, Bishop Sullivan Center has
provided about 300 free air conditioners this year to low-income
elderly and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think this program has helped,'' said Executive
Director Tom Turner, who purchased an air conditioner for Williams
on Tuesday after hearing of her situation.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, which quickly gave away the five air conditioners it
had available Tuesday, expects to receive about 30 more today. That
likely won't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   By 1 p.m. Tuesday, more than 150 people had called seeking help.
A few others dropped by the agency's office on Truman Road. One man
looked downcast when a staff member said about 100 people were
ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Nena Sudan, who lives a few blocks from the agency, was among
many turned away in recent days because her home already had one
window air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that,'' Sudan said Tuesday in her rented
Northeast area home. ``But I'm just suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   One window air conditioner cools her living room and a small
downstairs bedroom, where her husband, Sabir Sudan, sleeps in a
hospital bed. The 51-year-old Vietnam veteran has kidney cancer and
arthritis in his spine.
</P>
<P>
   Nena Sudan, 57, avoids sleeping on the cooled couch downstairs
because it hurts her arthritic hips too much. Her upstairs bedroom
gets so hot, she can't sleep there until 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 p.m., it was 104 degrees up here
with the fans going,'' she said, huffing from climbing 12 wooden
stairs from the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes someone else will donate a window unit for her.
</P>
<P>
   The Sullivan Center and United Services Community Action Agency
are seeking money to buy more air conditioners. United Services
provided 360 units to Missouri residents before running out earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   An officer from the Kansas City Police Department's East Patrol
Division called to check on elderly people Monday and Tuesday as
part of the patrol's senior watch program.
</P>
<P>
   One 95-year-old woman reported dizziness, heat problems and
possible dehydration Monday but refused to seek medical attention.
She had an air conditioner but refused to run it regularly because
of the electric costs.
</P>
<P>
   A worried officer, Donna Rollo-Leap, went to the woman's home
with paramedics. The woman still refused a hospital visit, but
Rollo-Leap finally persuaded her to stay at her granddaughter's
home for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't think (people) understand is there is help for
their utility bills,'' Rollo-Leap said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the metropolitan area, hospitals reported people seeking
treatment for heat-related problems.

LAWRENCE LETS GO OF RECORD HIGHS AS STUDENTS MONITOR AN `ARCTIC'
96 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Outside, temperature readings again flirted
with 100 on Tuesday. Inside the University of Kansas Storm
Prediction Center, three student meteorologists wrote down the
readings, printed them out and dutifully recorded them on
clipboards filled with thick stacks of other numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But these KU students don't have to read the thermometer to know
it's hot outside. Before Tuesday's comparatively arctic 96 on
Tuesday, Lawrence endured back-to-back highs of 109 degrees,
national highs for each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony of all this,'' said KU senior Keith Weber, 21, ``is
that we're at the hottest spot in the nation and the weather lab
has no air conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, the air-conditioning unit on the sixth floor of
KU's Malott Hall has refused to do its job.
</P>
<P>
   But the students monitoring the lab's numbers are still there,
albeit wearing shorts and sweat-drenched T-shirts, trying to
capture readings as furnacelike drafts from four fans surround
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do get kinda used to it after a while,'' said Matt Makens,
a 20-year-old junior. ``We're still laughing about it, though. And
if it does get cooler, we'll be the first to know.''
</P>
<P>
   If?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, it will get cooler; we just don't know when,'' Makens
said.
</P>
<P>
   The KU weather lab is an unofficial National Weather Service
monitoring station. It houses $30,000 worth of computers and
monitoring equipment that help examine the science of Lawrence's
weather from ground level to the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Not a cloud was in sight Tuesday from an office window facing
some residence halls on the KU campus. Just endless blue. On the
roof of Malott Hall is a weather monitor that records wind speeds
and humidity and temperature readings at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night at midnight, it was 89 degrees,'' Makens said.
``We're right on the boundary of wet weather...but the southern
winds are sucking up all the warm Texas air and just blowing it on
us. If it could just shift a little, we'd have rain.''
</P>
<P>
   He used a computer model to demonstrate. ``Only thing is, the
computers are out to lunch too, because of the heat,'' he said.
``They base their prediction models on what it should be from
previously recorded weather averages. The computers don't even know
about these extreme temperatures. One model told us it would be in
the high 80s today.''
</P>
<P>
   The three students shook their heads.
</P>
<P>
   In weather like this, human beings _ and their knowledge of
fluid mechanics and weather systems _ beat out a computer guess any
day, the students said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the professors are always telling us, `don't marry
the models,' '' said senior Brian Koochel, 23.
</P>
<P>
   David Braaten, an associate professor of atmospheric science,
explained that the weather temperatures are only as accurate as the
monitoring stations that record them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Lawrence, our weather data is recorded out at the municipal
airport,'' he said. ``If we only beat the Texas record by two or
three degrees, well, that can always be chalked up to the
calibration of the instruments or the site location of the
sensors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Automated Surface Observing System sits off to the side of
the main runway at Lawrence Municipal Airport, a few miles from
Interstate 70.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is actually eight modules mounted on poles. Each
module analyzes one aspect of the weather and reports the
information to computers in Lawrence and Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   But inside one dome-shaped unit, a fan whirrs continuously. Here
is where the thermometer sits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most people don't know,'' said Braaten, ``is that every
temperature printed in the newspaper or broadcast over television
or radio is really a shade temperature.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit, he explained, always records the temperature inside
the housing cooled by the fan, because scientists want to know the
temperature of the air, not the solar temperatures on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're standing out in the sun, it's safe to say that you
can easily add 30 more degrees and you'd be pretty accurate on the
actual temperature,'' he said. ``But that probably won't make
anyone feel any better.''

TWO CASINOS FINED FOR NOT PREVENTING UNDERAGE GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two Kansas City casinos were fined a combined
$500,000 on Tuesday for failing to prevent a 16-year-old girl from
boarding the riverboats during a weekend gambling spree in June.
</P>
<P>
   Station Casino Kansas City and Harrah's North Kansas City Casino
&AMP; Hotel were each hit with $250,000 fines by the Missouri Gaming
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second such offense for Station Casinos Inc., which
paid a $250,000 fine in 1997 after a woman and her 12-year-old
daughter were caught playing slot machines at the company's St.
Charles, Mo., casino.
</P>
<P>
   The action Tuesday also included new allegations that Station,
on separate occasions in May and June, had let 20-year-old males
gain entrance to the Kansas City casino with false identification
and gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Station and Harrah's have 30 days to accept the fines or file
appeals that would be resolved at a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Troy A. Stremming, Station's Midwest counsel, acknowledged the
casino's responsibility but told commissioners the company may
appeal the amount of the fine, which he termed ``excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Stremming noted that company employees apprehended the underage
gamblers in all three cases and reported them to the Gaming
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Station Casinos takes this matter very seriously,'' he said.
``Unfortunately there's not a perfect system in place. Sometimes
(underage gamblers) find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age girl, who was said to appear much older, presented
another person's driver's license to Station employees during the
evening of June 9 and was admitted to the casino. Until Sunday
morning, that ID fooled pit bosses, bartenders, card dealers and
others.
</P>
<P>
   She was with her mother at least part of that time, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on June 9 the girl also was admitted to Harrah's Mardi
Gras casino boat and gambled there, too.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, 41-year-old Carla Jean Wilson of Ash Grove, Mo.,
near Springfield, is a well-known player at area casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Clay County authorities in July charged Wilson with a class B
underage gambling misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up to six
months in the county jail and a fine of up to $500. She is
scheduled to appear in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several Station employees who had contact with the girl were
fired or disciplined, but casino executives refuse to divulge how
many employees were involved.
</P>
<P>
   One of those fired was Becky Meyer. The 49-year-old Raytown
woman was the first of several employees who inspected and approved
the girl's false identification.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said Tuesday that she was still out of work.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she sympathized with the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad that the boats have to pay,'' Meyer said. ``I think
she (Wilson) should have to pay. She knew what was right and what
was wrong. A 16-year-old should know right from wrong, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's officials had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the commission approved the relicensing of
Harrah's North Star, the smaller of its two casino boats.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's Assistant General Manager Bill Noble disclosed to the
commission that once Harrah's completes its announced $45 million
expansion of the Mardi Gras casino about a year from now, the North
Star will close and probably replace a smaller Harrah's vessel in
Metropolis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The company had said earlier it would continue to operate both
vessels in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Noble said Kansas City customers had expressed a clear
preference for the larger Mardi Gras boat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of expanding operations by more than 1,000 slot machines
and nearly 20 table games, the change will result in only a
marginal increase in Harrah's gambling capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Noble pledged that no employees will lose their jobs in the
consolidation.

COMMERCIAL FEDERAL TURNS DOWN BANKER'S OFFER TO BUY COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City banker Tom Burcham and a fellow
investor said Tuesday that thrift giant Commercial Federal Corp. of
Omaha, Neb., had rejected their offer to buy the company for what
they said was $1.3 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   The $13 billion-asset institution owns banks and thrifts in
Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas and five other states and operates 22
branches in the Kansas City area. The company is the fourth-largest
savings and loan in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Burcham, 58, is chairman of Missouri Bank &AMP; Trust Co., a small
bank in downtown Kansas City owned by Burcham and members of his
family. He owns less than 3 percent of Commercial Federal's stock,
which he acquired when the company purchased Burcham's stake in
First United National Bank and Trust Co. of Great Bend, Kan., three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Burcham and fellow investor John Eggemeyer III, president of the
bank investment firm Castle Creek Capital in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif., said they had proposed to pay Commercial Federal
shareholders $18.50 in cash and 25 percent of the common stock in a
new holding company they planned to form. The two estimated their
offer to be worth $24 for each share of Commercial Federal, or
about $1.3 billion. That would represent 40 percent more than
Commercial Federal's book value.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Federal's stock has been in the doldrums for more
than two years, closing Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at
$16.88, down from its 52-week high of $23.81 and its April 1998
peak of $39. The stock's book value as of March 31 was $17.29.
</P>
<P>
   The two said they learned this week that their unsolicited offer
had been rejected. Burcham said Commercial Federal's chairman and
chief executive officer, William Fitzgerald, informed the two that,
based on a restructuring Commercial Federal announced earlier this
month, the company's board did not support the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald on Tuesday said Commercial Federal's board, ``along
with our financial advisers, saw (Burcham and Eggemeyer's
proposal), as submitted, as not being of substantial value for the
shareholders, given the restructuring that has been under way for
the past six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald declined to comment further and referred inquiries to
Merrill Lynch, Commercial Federal's investment banker. Merrill
Lynch officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Federal, parent company of Commercial Federal Bank,
announced Aug. 15 that it expected to take a pretax restructuring
charge of $118 million to $138 million to get rid of more than $2
billion in lower-yielding assets and to pay off higher-cost
borrowings. The company also said it would expand its stock buyback
plan by up to 5.5 million shares, or 10 percent of its outstanding
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Like other financial institutions, Commercial Federal has seen
its cost of raising funds from deposits and other sources rise in
tandem with interest rates, shrinking its interest margins. The
Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since June
1999, from 4.75 percent to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad that they've rejected this offer,'' Eggemeyer
said Tuesday. ``The company has missed its earnings estimates now
for basically two years. They've written off $250 million, or
almost 20 percent of their capital, in that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let their chief financial officer go about nine months
ago, they let their president go about four months ago and most
recently had major defections in their community banking group. So
you've got management in turmoil, a company that has underperformed
for an extended period of time and a lot of angry shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Burcham and Eggemeyer said their offer was backed by Credit
Suisse First Boston, a major investment bank. The two said they
sent a formal proposal letter to Fitzgerald on Aug. 17 and received
Fitzgerald's negative reply, dated Aug. 24, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they were concerned that Commercial Federal's board
did not give their offer a proper hearing and that shareholders
were not informed of the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating that this offer never saw the light of day,''
Eggemeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Burcham said he and Eggemeyer ``have no intention of trying to
do a hostile takeover'' and considered their negotiations with
Commercial Federal concluded.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Franklin Mutual Advisors, a mutual fund that
holds about 8.3 percent of Commercial Federal's stock, urged
Commercial Federal to seek a buyer. Although nothing came of the
effort, Franklin secured two seats on Commercial Federal's board
after a bitter proxy fight.
</P>
<P>
   An Aug. 16 research report by Friedman Billings Ramsey &AMP; Co.
Inc., an Arlington, Va., investment banking firm, stated that
Commercial Federal might receive ``continuing pressure from
shareholders to sell the company as management continues to
struggle as an independent institution.'' The report pegged the
thrift's worth at between $20 and $24 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning about three years ago, Commercial Federal embarked on
an aggressive acquisition campaign, completing seven purchases in
six states totaling nearly $4 billion in deposits. The acquisitions
included Midland Bank in Lee's Summit, which Commercial Federal
bought for $83 million in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Eggemeyer, 54, has served as a top executive at a variety of
financial organizations, including First Chicago Corp., Norwest
Corp., Chemical Banking Corp., U.S. Bancorp and Drexel Burnham
Lambert. He co-founded Castle Creek, which invests in financial
institutions, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he orchestrated the sale of Western Bancorp in Newport
Beach, Calif., to U.S. Bancorp for $958 million, or 4.4 times its
book value.

SMITH DOES THINGS HIS OWN WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ivy League-educated, professorial Homer Smith
always brought a unique perspective to coaching football. After
all, what other quarterback coach would spend half of practice flat
on his back under center just to make sure the snap was executed
properly?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only place to see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also brings a unique perspective to UCLA's season opener
Saturday against No.3-ranked Alabama. He's one of few links between
the schools, having done several tours of duty as the quarterback
coach and/or offensive coordinator at both places.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old Smith, who retired after the 1997 season at
Arizona, lives in Tuscaloosa, where he tutors young quarterbacks,
has his own Web site (www.homersmithfootball.com), and publishes
manuals on anything from clock management to a quarterback's
footwork.
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches may have taught the same plays, but they rarely
did it like Smith.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA receivers coach Ron Caragher was a backup quarterback under
Smith for two seasons. He remembers Smith emphasizing how important
it was on option plays for the backfield to maintain its formation
as the play unfolded, like fighter pilots do.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, a flight squadron buzzed over Spaulding Field.
Smith, who had coached at Army, had called in a favor from some
friends in the military, Caragher said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is revered in Alabama for bringing the Crimson Tide's
offense out of the dark ages in 1989, when unheralded quarterback
Gary Hollingsworth set school records for attempts and completions
and Alabama won its first 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA, he's more renowned for his work with Tommy Maddox, Rick
Neuheisel and Tom Ramsey, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In his first stint at the school in 1972-73, he was the
architect of the Bruins' wishbone offense under head coach Pepper
Rodgers. In 1973, the Bruins averaged a school-record 400.3 yards
per game rushing and scored 56 rushing touchdowns _ marks which
still stand.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the schools, Smith says, is like grits
and glitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is different significantly (in Alabama),'' he said.
``There's more fervor, and it goes year round. There are just more
talk shows about it, the newspapers print more. It occupies a
bigger part in the athletic picture than it does in L.A., and the
fans get a little more heated. But UCLA has a classy program.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who might have broken the mold by taking a year off from
coaching in 1982 to pursue a masters in theology at Harvard, is
going with convention in this game: he likes Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think UCLA will get points on Alabama's great defense
because they play great offense year-in and year-out,'' he said.
``But Alabama's player strength and speed will make a difference
every time the ball's kicked and every time the ball's put in play.
And Alabama's very strong at quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   KOCHER HEALING: Defensive tackle Ken Kocher, who suffered a high
ankle sprain last Tuesday, may play against Alabama. He was walking
around Spaulding Field on Tuesday without the aid of crutches or a
walking boot for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears if he keeps progressing he might be able to play,''
head coach Bob Toledo said, adding that Kocher wouldn't start and
would likely be on the field for 15-20 plays.
</P>
<P>
   KICKS FOR FIKSE: Sophomore Nate Fikse will punt Saturday,
holding off true freshman Chris Kluwe, though Toledo said he may
use Kluwe some. A decision on whether Ryan Nece, who has been
bothered by torn cartilage in his left shoulder, or Marcus Reese
will start at weakside linebacker will likely be made today, Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   CORRECTION: Seniors Oscar Cabrera and Kenyon Coleman were voted
captains for the season, not for the Alabama game. &QL;

SPRINT'S PRESIDENT LOOKS AT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Since Sprint Corp. and WorldCom Inc. gave up
on their $129 billion merger, Wall Street has kicked the breath out
of Sprint's main stock.
</P>
<P>
   The shares, known by their FON trading symbol, closed Tuesday at
$32.56, less than half the $76 in stock that WorldCom was going to
pay. Sprint's separate PCS stock, which tracks the operation of its
wireless business, traded Tuesday at $48.06, 20 percent off its
price July 13 when the deal was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the stock price slide has sickened Ronald T. LeMay,
Sprint's president and chief operating officer. But during a recent
interview, LeMay outlined Sprint's plan to address Wall Street's
uncertainties about how the telecommunications company will move
forward independently.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, which employs roughly 20,000 people in the Kansas City
area, will shift from being known primarily as a national
long-distance provider to a mover of voice and data by both land
lines and wireless technology, LeMay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not happy at all where the stock price is. I am a big
shareholder too. I can empathize because I am feeling it,'' said
LeMay, whose value of Sprint and Sprint PCS securities has fallen
by about $223.7 million, to about $127.6 million, since the merger
was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The company will focus on markets worldwide where it is
currently building out networks of its Internet backbone _ which
connects Internet service providers to the Internet _ and its
wireless broadband technology.
</P>
<P>
   Its wireless broadband, the ability to provide Internet service
with wireless technology, has the potential to reach roughly a
third of the U.S. market to serve both consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, LeMay said Sprint would work its way out of the
stand-alone consumer long-distance market, packaging its
long-distance with such services as PCS wireless and Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not going to be the same uniform national market people
have gotten accustomed to when people look at long-distance
carriers,'' LeMay predicted. ``It is going to be much more a
locally oriented market with long-distance and other things as
components.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question there are fundamental changes occurring in
the market. The question, analysts said, is whether nine months of
merger negotiations sapped Sprint of some of the talent, drive and
agility to master the rearranged steeplechase.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying the right things, that the market is changing
and they are changing to meet that challenge,'' said Jeff Kagan, a
telecommunications industry analyst based in Atlanta. ``Recognizing
the problem and admitting you have a problem is half the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still have to deal with the reality, that they are
without the same bench strengths they had a year ago. The company
has to either go it alone and fill in all of their weak spots or be
acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of what has happened to Sprint's share price is tied to
the annulment of the merger, analysts say. Investors are
disenchanted with the telecommunications category generally, and
the shares of AT&AMP;T, WorldCom and many others are trading well off
prices of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for long-distance service continue to drop, putting
pressure on company earnings at the same time many companies are
investing tens of millions of dollars in the data and wireless
networks essential to be competitive. That revaluing of the
telecommunications industry was already under way at the time that
Sprint's merger with WorldCom was canceled, giving a double hit to
Sprint's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts still MORE
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...double hit to Sprint's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts still like Sprint. They say it is innovative and
has a motivated work force and some strong assets, particularly its
wireless and local phone services. But they say that several
factors tied to the failed merger raise questions about Sprint's
ability to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   One is the loss of more than half a dozen top executives. A
provision of the Sprint stock option program allowed options that
otherwise would take years to earn to become available when
shareholders approved the merger, even if the deal was not
finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts even question whether William T. Esrey, the chief
executive who built Sprint into a force to be reckoned with, is the
person to lead it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Esrey and his top people said Sprint could succeed alone and
then they went into the WorldCom deal,'' said Steve Koppman, senior
analyst with Dataquest, a division of the Gartner Group of
information technology consultants. ``Now, when he says they can go
on their own, it doesn't sound credible to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   LeMay called that assessment ``hogwash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill said very clearly...at the time that we decided to merge
with WorldCom, that going alone was still a viable strategy. To
suggest that we had concluded that we couldn't make it on our own,
there wasn't a strategy we couldn't employ going forward, it
absolute hogwash,'' LeMay said. ``People are engaged in revisionist
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street wants Sprint to clearly articulate a strategy and
present people who can carry out that strategy, and Sprint is
working to do that, LeMay said. ``That's the issue, not Bill
Esrey.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will present its plans and introduce the new
management to investors and analysts in presentations before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans include Sprint's place in the explosive growth
expected in data transmission. Though Sprint does not have the
world's largest Internet backbone, it is often acknowledged as one
the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Internet backbone business is about a billion dollars now
and is growing at about 75 percent a year,'' LeMay said. ``We think
we can accelerate that growth next year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sprint has its Integrated On-Demand Network,
or ION technology, which allows customers to use multiple fax,
phones or Internet hookups through a single line into the home or
business. Though Sprint has some difficulties with that technology,
LeMay said it was the technology customers wanted, a single line to
provide all their voice and data needs.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of 2002, LeMay predicted, Sprint also will be
able to offer ION services through its wireless network, greatly
expanding its market potential. That means the company will be able
to offer the service without having to work through a local
telephone provider. And it will be able to serve customers who live
too far away from special equipment to get high-speed Internet
connections by land lines.
</P>
<P>
   The tremendous growth of data movement over wire lines will
happen with wireless service as well, LeMay said: ``People are
going to find uses for that technology that we simply cannot
comprehend now. It is a major part of our growth opportunity. It is
just a matter of timing.''
</P>
<P>
   But in any transforming market, timing can be everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole industry is going through a major shift. All
companies, including Sprint, face uncertainty,'' Kagan said. ``But
Sprint also is facing these challenges after they lost a lot of
senior talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Esrey's time to become a bold visionary leader or step
aside. It can't be business as usual. Sprint is at a very important
transition point. We will just have to wait and see.''

STOCK LOSSES FOR SPRINT EXECUTIVES HAVE BEEN HUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Eds. please note: This is a sidebar to SPRINT-FUTURE.)
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Another day, another 10 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That is the average Sprint Corp. Chief Executive William T.
Esrey has lost on the value of his Sprint securities every day
since July 13, when Sprint and WorldCom Inc. called off their
proposed merger in the face of opposition from regulators in the
United States and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Sprint and WorldCom gave up on their $129 billion
merger, Sprint's stock ticked up slightly. The next day it started
a decline that has seen it drop to levels it had not seen in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Shares and options Esrey received that were worth more than $700
million at the merger price, even after accounting for the average
price Esrey had to pay for the shares, were worth about $244
million at Tuesday's stock close of $32.56 for Sprint FON shares
and $48.06 for Sprint PCS shares, a loss of more than $472 million.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey is not alone, of course. Most Sprint employees have stock,
and then there are the rest of the shareholders. The company's
capitalization, the value of all Sprint FON shares and PCS shares,
dropped to $73.5 billion, compared with the $115 billion WorldCom
was going to pay, not counting the $14 billion in debt it would
have assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's tracking stock for PCS traded Tuesday at 28 percent off
its 52-week high of $66.94 on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not much to say. The disappointment of the failed
merger lingers,'' said Tom Burnett of Merger Insight, a research
firm for institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's broadband and Internet assets are strong, and its local
telephone service is solid, but until the market decides what
Sprint can earn independently, its stock will suffer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to guess, I would say it is within 10 percent of a
tradable bottom,'' Burnett said.
