<HEADLINE> Iraq Claims to Have Downed Enemy Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq claimed on Thursday that
its anti-aircraft units have downed one of U.S. and British
warplanes which attacked civilian facilities in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as
saying that at 11:00 (0800 GMT) eight formations of U.S. and
British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace violated northern
Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes bombarded civilian facilities in the region,
leading to the injury of one civilian, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
One of the enemy planes was hit by anti-aircraft fire and
soldiers and residents in the region confirmed that they saw the
plane falling to the ground while other enemy planes fled to their
base in Turkey, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed several times in the past that its
anti-aircraft units downed U.S. or British warplanes patrolling
the no-fly zones, but each time the United States and Britain
denied any loss.
</P>
<P>
At 7:45 (0445 GMT) six formations of U.S. and British warplanes
coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi
airspace, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq
last December, their warplanes have made 14,542 sorties over the
so-called northern and southern no-fly zones, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting
the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south against
possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, regarding them
as unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain as they are not
covered directly by any United Nations resolution.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Enhance Competitiveness of Private </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba promised here Thursday to make deliberate effort to
sharpen the competitive edge of the business of his country in
emerging world of commerce and trade.
</P>
<P>
When opening a shopping center here run by a South African
company, the president said that his government is fully aware of
the need to develop local industrial and manufacturing capacity
and will support all such efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Our competitive edge as a nation can only be improved if
individual enterprises are accorded the opportunity to compete
favorably with similar enterprises outside our boundaries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that trading nations, after all, attain their status by
virtue of their manufacturing establishments run by the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Economic development requires the creation of a competitive
edge, spearheaded by indigenous business efforts, fully supported
by government efforts and policies at providing an enabling
environment that assists private sector business development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said his government will continue and intensify dialogs with
 business community to make Zambia grow and compete favorably.
</P>
<P>
In a reaction to the lamentation that Zambia has become a
trading nation, he said there is nothing wrong with trading if it
is used as a stepping stone to manufacturing, adding that the
fastest growing economies in the world belong to trading nations.
</P>
<P>
Trade, however, should not be an end in itself. Trade should
instead stimulate demand and create a market for local products,
he observed.

WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Richard Holbrooke, U.S.
chief envoy to the United Nations, urged Congress Thursday to pay
the country's arrears to the world organization.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke made the remarks at a high-level international
conference on preventing atrocities.
</P>
<P>
"We must match our rhetoric with resources, empty words (and)
resolutions which governments don't even want to agree with are
insufficient," Holbrooke said at the Holocaust Memorial Museum
here.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke promised he would try to persuade legislators that
"the bare minimum" is to pay late dues so the United States
doesn't lose what influence it has at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. statistics show that the U.S. owes the U.N. 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars and must pay 350 million U.S. dollars by December 31
to keep its seat in the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled Congress has held up payment of
arrears to the U.N. for years.

Forum '99 seminar ended here Thursday with the participants
agreeing that the information and communication technologies are
important elements to promote economic development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
An in-session report of the seminar rica must
combine the economies of scale with competition, improve the local
skills to cope with the brain drain problem, and establish stable
framework for investment.

international partnership must be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Malian President Alpha Konare said at the plenary
session of the forum that it is highly necessary to establish true
partnership with developed countries and donor agencies to ensure
that Africa does not fall far behind in the globalization process.

<HEADLINE> Apocalyptic Christians Deported from Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Thursday ordered
the deportation of 11 Apocalyptic Christians who have been held in
detention for four days by the police.
</P>
<P>
Two of them were deported to Britain Thursday afternoon and the
other nine will be deported later in the evening to the United
States, Israeli police said.
</P>
<P>
The deportation of another 10 will be decided later because
their appeals against expulsion are under considerations, the
police added.
</P>
<P>
Those 21 Apocalyptic Christians, including five children, were
arrested by the police on Monday during a pre-dawn raid on their
Jerusalem headquarters.
</P>
<P>
All of those Christian members, some of whom arrived in Israel
several years ago, were ordered to be deported because their visas
had expired.
</P>
<P>
According to Interior Ministry, the Christians rounded up on
Monday included 14 Americans, three British nationals, three
Jamaicans and one Australian. One of them, an American woman with
a ticket home next month, has already been released from custody.
</P>
<P>
This was the third deportation this year of Apocalyptic
Christians whom Israel fears may be planning violent actions in
the Christian millennial year with the hope of hastening the
arrival of the Messiah, the expected deliverer according to Jewish
and Christian belief.
</P>
<P>
Israel police fear some of the end-of-time Christians would
commit mass suicide in Jerusalem if the prophecies do not come
true.

<HEADLINE> Barak Asked to Reconsider Hawatmeh's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli politicians urged
Thursday Prime Minister Ehud Barak to reconsider permitting
Palestinian opposition leader Nayef Hawatmeh to return to the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The politicians made this call after learning that Hawatmeh had
said publicly that armed struggle against Israel is legitimate.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh, leader of the Damascus-based Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), has reportedly told Qatar's
television on Wednesday that "struggle is legitimate" as long as
Jewish settlers remain on Arab land.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, a key architect of the interim
peace deals with the Palestinians, said Hawatmeh should be banned.
</P>
<P>
"Israel should prevent the arrival of Nayef Hawatmeh in the
territories. Israel can not accept his declaration that he would
continue with the armed struggle," Beilin's office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Haim Ramon, minister in the prime minister's office, said the
security authorities should re-examine the issue and recommend to
the prime minister what to do.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami told the Israel Radio
that Hawatmeh's return should be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
Barak gave the green light on Monday to Hawatmeh, 63, to return
to the Palestinian-controlled territories in light of his support
to the peace process and under the request of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh set up the DFLP in 1969 as an opposition faction to
Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement. Israel holds Hawatmeh
responsible for the deaths of 24 school children and a soldier
during a shoot-out between Israeli soliders and the DFLP members
who had taken over a school in northern Israel in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh opened reconciliation talks with Arafat in Cairo in
August this year and said he supports Arafat's efforts to strike a
permanent peace settlement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The United States dropped DFLP from its terrorist list earlier
this month.

WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Thursday her country will do what it can
to help Armenia fight terrorism while directing Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott to return to the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Albright said she
telephoned Armenian President Robert Kocharian to express her
"personal condolences and sorrow" at the deaths of the country's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a few gunmen broke into the parliament building
in Yerevan, Armenia, and killed Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsian,
Speaker of the Parliament Karen Demirchian, Deputy Speaker Youri
Bakhshian and Leonard Petrosian, minister of operations.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the United States wanted to try to make sure the
former Soviet Union "does not become an area for terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Talbott was in Armenia before assassins seized the parliament
and took hostages. He then went to Moscow, where he received
Albright's instructions to return to Yerevan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, President Bill Clinton Wednesday condemned the
shootings, saying he was shocked and saddened by news that
attackers burst into a question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
"I condemn the senseless act against individuals actively
engaged in building democracy in their country," Clinton said.
"The victims and their families are in our thoughts and prayers."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed renewed U.S. support for the
beleaguered republic, adding his country had developed strong ties
with Armenia and would continue to help maintain democracy there.
</P>
<P>
"At this time of tragedy we renew our support for the people of
Armenia and their leaders as they continue to build on the
principles today's victims have so courageously embodied," Clinton
said.

CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said on Thursday that the development of the
Mauritanian-Israeli relations is "a step in an inappropriate time
regarding the Arab situation."
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid deplored the reported step to set up diplomatic
ties between Mauritania and Israel as advanced, coming prior to
agreements for final settlement between the Arabs and the Jewish
state, said Talat Hamad, spokesman for the league's chief.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Mauritanian Foreign Minister Ahmed Ould Sid Ahmed
and his Israeli counterpart David Levy are to sign an agreement on

</P>
<P>
Mauritania will be the third Arab country to take the step
after Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid will follow the situation with Mauritanian
officials to know the motives prompting the move, Hamad said.
</P>
<P>
Mauritania's possible move has triggered adverse reactions from
permanent delegates of Arab countries to the Arab League. The
Syrian envoy, Issa Darwish has called on Mauritania to backtrack
on the move whatever the gains are.
</P>
<P>
Arabs hope that the Arab world will not go ahead with
normalization with Israel in a bid to keep pressure on Israel to
seek just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.

WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Mauritania signed an

</P>
<P>
"It is a sovereign decision, taken by us as a sovereign state,"

<P>
Jiang pointed out that the Chinese people have valued their
traditional friendship with their Moroccan counterpart. It has
been a set policy for the Chinese government to continue the
development of friendly cooperation with Morocco in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
"Morocco has important influence among Arabic, Islamic and
African countries," Jiang said. "China attaches importance to the
role of Morocco in regional and international affairs and it is
willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Morocco
over international and regional issues, so as to safeguard the
interest of the developing countries including China and Morocco."
</P>
<P>
Jiang formally invited King Mohammed VI to visit China at his
convenient time. The King said he felt honored for the invitation
and expressed gratitude.
</P>
<P>
The King said that the bilateral relationship between his
country and China is based on mutual respect and that is why it
can pass by the clouds and enjoy sound development.
</P>
<P>
During his father's time, he said, Morocco has played the role
of balancing in Africa and the Middle East, and China is also
playing an important role of balancing at the international stage
these days.
</P>
<P>
The King said that his country is willing to develop
continuously cooperation with China in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state also exchanged views over the bilateral
economic and trade relationship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that it is the common wish of the two countries to
further boost the economic and trade cooperation, which still has
great potential for development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said China has attached importance to
developing its economic and trade relationship with Morocco, and
has encouraged enterprises of the two countries to strengthen
exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to make joint efforts with Morocco on the
basis of equality and common development to probe actively for new
channels for bilateral economic and trade cooperation so as to
boost it to a new height," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
The King said that Morocco will exert its efforts to make
Chinese entrepreneurs invest in Morocco as in their own country.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two sides signed two agreements on the
Chinese government's provision of preferential loans to Morocco
and on economic and technological cooperation between the two

<HEADLINE> Sudan Reiterates Commitment to Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail on Thursday underlined his country's determination to
continue the national reconciliation process and remove the
obstacles to the drive.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Ismail stressed Sudan's commitment to an
Egyptian-Libyan plan for helping achieve peace and reconciliation
in his country.
</P>
<P>
He added that he conveyed to Mubarak the Sudanese government's
view on the importance of coordinating between the Egyptian-Libyan
initiative and that of the Eastern African Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed in August the five-point peace plan
calling for permanent cease-fire in Sudan and a preparatory
meeting on a peace conference to be attended by the parties
related to the Sudanese issue.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and Sudan's Muslim opposition parties
have accepted the proposal, but the Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA) has rejected it, arguing that it favors the role played by
IGAD in mediating a solution to the civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim parties and SPLA form an umbrella opposition group,
the National Democratic Alliance. The parties want to share power
with the Islamic government while SPLA has been fighting since
1983 for greater autonomy in the mostly Christian and animist
south.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has voiced keenness on securing Sudan's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and keeps close contacts with Sudan's
opposition, for fear that the possible disintegration of Africa's
largest country may endanger its major water source, the Nile.
</P>
<P>
Ismail, who arrived in Cairo on Saturday, said he conveyed a
message to Mubarak from Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on
dealing with Sudan's reconciliation drive and the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also underlined his interest in normalizing relations
between Egypt and Sudan, stressing that he has instructed the
concerned authorities to exert efforts to achieve this objective,
the Sudanese official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who was present at the
meeting between Mubarak and Ismail, termed Egypt's relations with
its southern neighbor as "developing in the current juncture,"
noting that the ties are "deeply rooted and historical."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of a visit to Egypt by the Sudanese
president, Moussa said "there is a planned visit and President
Mubarak has welcomed such a visit."
</P>
<P>
The last time al-Bashir visited Egypt was in 1996 when he came
here to take part in an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two Arab countries soured in 1995 after Cairo
accused Khartoum of masterminding an assassination attempt on
Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also blamed Sudan for harboring Islamic militants
attempting to topple its secular government and install strict
Islamic rule. Sudan, however, has denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the goodwill showed by both countries
and frequent exchange of visits by senior officials have
significantly improved the ties.

<HEADLINE> France: Embargo on British Beef Costs Britain Nothing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- France said Thursday that the
maintenance of embargo on British beef will cost Britain nothing
because there is no market for British beef in France and other
European countries.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Agriculture Jean Glavany said in an
interview with the daily La Croix that the British know very well
there is no demand for British beef in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"A lifting of embargo has only symbolic meaning," he said.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain are entangled in a dispute over the lifting
of embargo on British beef as Paris refuses to do so with the
argument that the mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, is far from being eliminated in Britain.
</P>
<P>
A European Union experts team studying the dispute seems
divided over whether the French stand is justifiable, and it
wishes to let France and Britain solve the question themselves.
</P>
<P>
London has accused France of trade protectionism by banning
British beef from its territory.
</P>
<P>
Glavany said that the British accusation is "absurd" because
Denmark has only imported 69 kilograms of British beef since it
lifted embargo three months ago.
</P>
<P>
He also said that not one truck of British beef has ever passed
through France to go to France's two big European neighbors, Italy
and Spain, which have lifted the embargo.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Developing Countries Call for Fair Play in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries are
complaining that they are suffering from negative consequences of
globalization and called for global governance in order to ensure
fairness, equality, democracy and diversification in the process.
</P>
<P>
The appeals came at the Second Committee of the 54th General
Assembly session, which is in charge of economic and financial
affairs, began the three-day debate Tuesday on the U.N. role in
globalization and interdependence. This is the first time for the
committee to discuss the issue under a separate item.
</P>
<P>
Describing such a discussion as "both timely and necessary,"
many representatives from Asia, Latin America and Africa listed
the sufferings of the developing countries in the globalization
process.
</P>
<P>
Nitin Desai, U.N. under-secretary-general for economic and
social affairs, said, "Concerns about globalization arise
basically from the belief that there is no one in charge. The
uneven impact of globalization is thus a main area of concern."
</P>
<P>
Rebutting an argument by supporters of globalization that it
was a panacea for all economic difficulties faced by developing
countries, Inam-Ul-Haque, a Pakistani representative, said that
globalization was in many ways "a new form of economic colonialism
and represented the success of ravenous capitalism."
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that the world economy is not global," he said.
"Trade, investment and financial flows are mostly concentrated
within the developed blocs."
</P>
<P>
The vast, cheap labor pools of developing countries were being
exploited by multinational corporations, he said, adding that
commodity prices were manipulated and constantly lowered to ensure
the developed world a continued supply of cheap raw materials.
</P>
<P>
"The markets of developing countries are being pried open in
the name of trade liberation, while the developed economies
limited access to their own markets," he said. "A large majority
of developing countries suffered the negative consequences of
globalization, but had virtually no role in defining the rules of
the game."
</P>
<P>
S.R. Insanally, a Guyanan representative who took the floor on
behalf of the Group of 77 developing countries, said that while
the effects of globalization continued to extend into the daily
life of people everywhere, "the process itself has engendered in
many a sense of powerlessness and loss of control."
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, the results of globalization to date have
been a mixed bag," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, China's deputy permanent representative to the
United Nations, told the Second Committee that the rapid
development of globalization has raised new questions, brought
about many uncertainties and given people much to think about.
</P>
<P>
"Feckless and unruly growth and uneven expansion as resulting
from economic globalization have posed a new question to us,
namely, how to execute effective guidance and governance of the
globalization process," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the Chinese statement, Mirtha Maria Hormilia Castro, a
Cuban representative, said, "Although globalization was an
irreversible reality, it is also true that its promised rewards
have not materialized."
</P>
<P>
"There is an increase in extremes of social inequality at all
levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
Growth in developing countries in the 1990s was lower than the
5.7 percent of the 1970s. One fifth of the world's population,
living in wealthy countries, accounted for 86 percent of
globalization production.
</P>
<P>
"Within such a complex context, understanding globalization is
of vital significance for developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, Aflonso Valdvieso, representative of Colombia,
said, "Globalization and interdependence challenge certain aspects
of state sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States
(AOSIS), Patrick Albert Lewis of Antigua and Barbuda, said, "It is
clear that globalization leads to a reduction of the sovereignty
of states, with the weakest and the smallest being the biggest
losers."
</P>
<P>
"Sadly lacking in the arguments for globalization is the need
to provide for the pace, direction and content of liberalization,
given diverse national levels of development and the need to build
up national capacities," he said.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Spells out China's Stand on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin spelled out a four-point position of the Chinese government
on the Middle East question, during his talks here with King
Mohammed VI of Morocco on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four points are as follows:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, China advocates peace instead of resorting to
violence, cooperation instead of confrontation and inclusion
instead of exclusion.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, China maintains that broad respect should be given
to the territorial integration and sovereign independence of each
Middle East country, its security be ensured, the legitimate
national rights of the Palestinian people be restored and
respected, and people of all nations should live in peace and
harmony.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, China supports relevant parties of the Middle East to
take as their strategic choice the peaceful settlement of disputes
through negotiations. China also hopes that they will carry out
without reservation the relevant United Nations resolutions,
adhere to the principle of "land for peace" and insist in
implementing the existing agreements.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, China hopes that the international community will
increase its efforts of promoting peace. China will as always
work for the realization of a comprehensive, just and lasting
peace in the Middle East together with the international
community.

<TEXT>
<P>
Putting the negative effects into their perspective, many
representatives called for the proper world governance in the
process so that a safety mechanism can be set up to protect the
interests of developing countries at large.
</P>
<P>
"The globalization process so far has advanced on the basis of
market economy and been driven by profits," Shen Guofang said. "It
is inequitable by its very nature."
</P>
<P>
"The government of one country can redress market-born domestic
inequality through domestic policies and regulations," he said.
"Likewise, global inequality should be redressed through effective
global governance, instead of being allowed to go unchecked."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that global governance needs a global perspective,
not a Western one," Shen said. "We hope that global governance
will fully embody fairness, equality, democracy and
diversification and will promote common prosperity and development
throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
Many countries, especially those from the developing world,
called upon the 188-member United Nations to play a role in the
globalization process.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations should conduct in-depth study and
discussion on this issue and make it a priority in its work in the
months and years to come," Shen said. "To promote healthier and
more balanced development of globalization, the United Nations
should keep globalization's impact on developing countries under
constant monitoring, come up with policies and measures in
response to such impact and appraise the effectiveness of these
policies and measures."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Luiz Tupy Caldas de Moura of Brazil said,
"Globalization does not occur in a void. Economic processes
developed under institutional mechanisms had not yet adjusted to
the new realities of globalization."
</P>
<P>
"The challenges of globalization cannot be effectively dealt
with by countries on a unilateral basis," he said. "The United
Nations, in particular the Economic and Social Council, is
uniquely suited to initiate a comprehensive discussion of how to
turn the potential benefits of globalization into a reality
worldwide."
</P>
<P>
Adam Adawa, the Kenyan representative who spoke on behalf of
the members of the East African Community (EAC) of Kenya, the
United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda, said, "Globalization and
interdependence can be uneven and unpredictable. There is a
clearer need to ensure that the benefits of globalization and
information are shared equitably among nations and their peoples."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is fully mandated to play a central role in
facilitating and achieving international consensus on the
globalization issue," he said. "The thrust of such a consensus
will be to enhance multilateral cooperation for development
through genuine partnership, aimed at promoting and strengthening
responses to the diverse development needs of developing
countries."
</P>
<P>
"A genuine partnership at the bilateral and multilateral level
can play an important role in the success of the development
process of developing countries, especially sub-Saharan
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kwabena Osei-Danquah, a representative from Ghana, said, "What
has been left unsaid is how urgent it is for the United Nations to
validate and assert its leadership in the process."
</P>
<P>
"In view of its universal and democratic character, the United
Nations is the only body with the authority to lead the process of
restructuring the international financing architecture and
ensuring a stronger, more stable and system," he said. "It is
equally equipped to design a coherent network of global governance
that linked finance, trade and development."

<P>
ATHENS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday held a grandiose
military parade in the northern city of Thessaloniki to celebrate
the 59th anniversary of "No" day when it was dragged into World
War II after rejecting Benito Mussolini's ultimatum to surrender
to the fascist forces or be invaded.
</P>
<P>
Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos and Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, along with thousands of people gathering along the
parade route, watched the army units march by as well as the new
weapons acquired by the country's armed forces, the Macedonian
Press Agency (MPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
F-16 fighter jets, Mirages and Apachi military helicopters flew
over the parade grounds in different formations.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos said that the Greek people would always remember
the days of the 1940s with emotion and today's national desires
focused on repelling any questioning of Greece's sovereign rights,
on the just solution of the Cyprus problem, development and the
prosperity of the Greek people.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said in his message that
the Greeks had shown on the battlefields in 1940, and then in the

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday met in a closed-door session to learn what is
the impact of the U.N. sanctions on the Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF), briefed the Security Council on her recent trip to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Also briefing the 15-member Council was Benon Sevan, executive
director of the Office of the Iraq Program, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday took the aim at the
United States for confronting to hold up contracts that he said
could relieve the suffering of ordinary Iraqis trying to cope with
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the Security Council Monday, Annan said the
number of holds on contracts has continued to increase in the past
two months -- to 572 contracts worth about 700 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been barred from selling its oil on the open market
since the Security Council imposed sanctions following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. Concerned that ordinary Iraqis were suffering
the brunt of the sanctions, the council in 1998 began allowing
Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil provided the proceeds went to
buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
The program lets Iraq export 5.26 billion U.S. dollars in oil
every six months primarily to buy food and medicine, but has been
expanded to include other sectors including water, utilities and
spare parts for the oil industry.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Increased Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice President Christon
Tembo called here on Thursday for strengthening regional economic
integration in an effort to trade favorably under World Trade
Organization (WTO) regime and benefit from other multilateral
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Opening a meeting of ministers of transport and communications
of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),
Tembo said that the regional grouping faces a formidable challenge
of heavy debt burden and unfavorable trade terms, which manifest
in that exports from the African continent is under-priced in the
world market while imports from outside the region cost them
dearly.
</P>
<P>
"We are increasingly being marginalized in the global economy.
For example, Africa's share of global trade has fallen from 5.9
percent in 1980 to 2.3 in 1996. This has resulted in, among
others, low standards of living, reduced life expectancy and a
general decline in economic prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged COMESA to reduce the negative impact of the unequal
exchange of trade with the outside world by increasing trade among
its member countries.
</P>
<P>
In order to trade with one another more effectively and to
integrate the regional economies systematically, a secure
political environment should be created, conditions for free
movement of factors of production should be addressed, private
sector development should be achieved and both physical and
non-physical barriers to trade should be removed, he said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, transport and communications play pivotal roles
in facilitating free movement of factors of production and goods,
Tembo said.
</P>
<P>
"The attainment of a COMESA free trade area by the year 2000
shall require total commitment from us all. I, therefore, urge you
not only to make decision, but to establish implementation and
follow-up mechanisms, both at the national level and at the level
of the secretariat," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting, the ministers will discuss and make
decisions on liberalization of air transport, provision of better
air traffic management systems and establishment of regional
telecommunications interconnectivity.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President, Moroccan King Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Moroccan King Mohammed VI held extensive and in-depth
talks here Thursday over bilateral relations and international and
regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The King praised the development of bilateral relationship
since diplomatic ties between the two countries were established
41 years ago. He expressed the confidence that Jiang's current
state visit will undoubtedly inject new vitality to the bilateral
friendly relations of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang first expressed the grief over the death of King Hassan
II, who had made immortal contributions to the national
independence and development of Morocco, and to promoting the
peace process of the Middle East and the solidarity between the
Middle East and African countries.
</P>
<P>
Hassan has enjoyed high prestige in African, Arabian countries
and even in the whole world, Jiang said. He has also had deep
friendship with several generations of Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that under the excellent leadership of King Mohammed
VI, Moroccan people will surely build their country into a more
prosperous one.
</P>
<P>
"Although China and Morocco are far apart, friendship between
peoples of the two countries has enjoyed a long history. Both of
the two countries have suffered exploitation and aggression of the
Western colonialists in modern history and national
sovereignty has been infringed upon," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In contemporary history, Jiang said, both countries have taken
precious their respective self independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity. Morocco is one of the first African
countries that have established diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have always held the feeling of gratitude
toward their Moroccan counterpart for their support for China's
revolutionary cause and construction, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 40 years, he said, bilateral relationship has
enjoyed steady development under the common concern of leaders of
the two countries, and cooperation in economic and trade,
cultural, hygienic sectors has been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
"Coordination and cooperation over international affairs have
been increasing day by day," Jiang said, adding that the longtime
friendship between the two countries has demonstrated that so long
as countries abide by the basic norms of international
relationship and insist on the five principles of peaceful
co-existence, relationship between nations will develop soundly
and smoothly even though they have different social systems.

</P>
<P>
According to the minister, 1.5 million displaced Angolans have
benefited from the international aid donated by foreign
governments or non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, a country suffering civil conflicts over 30 years,
more than two million people have been forced to leave home and
become displaced persons. A majority of the displaced persons are
living in principal cities around the country, without arable
fields, seeds and agricultural utensils.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the military situation in the central
plateau, Angola has seen other tides of displaced persons flowing
into the crowded cities. Displaced persons in Luanda, Huambo, Bie
and Malanje are in dire need of alimentary goods and the means of
production.
</P>
<P>
Malungo also announced a new donation offered by the Italian
government, worth 3.5 million u.s. dollars, as emergency
assistance for the population in critical situation.

<HEADLINE> Stability Restored in South Angola: Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Luanda, October (xinhua) -- The Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) have
restored "military stability" in Angola's southern provinces of
Huila, Namibe and Cunene, according to the command of the south
front of the government troops.
</P>
<P>
General Francisco Furtado made the statement in a press
conference in the city of Chicomba, in Huila Province, saying that
"the government troops have taken the control of all the
municipalities in the three provinces."
</P>
<P>
Furtado told reporters that his troops are currently engaged in
" pursuing and completely annihilating" the rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi, in a bid to guarantee the stability of local situation
and the security of the population and their personal possessions.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, there exist to-and-fro buses and trucks freely
shuttling among the provinces. Traffic and transportation through
the highways leading to Huambo and Benguela provinces have also
been resumed.
</P>
<P>
During the over-30-year civil war in Angola, the rebels of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) had the
control of the rural areas and the principal highways, which has
hindered travels and goods transportation.
</P>
<P>
But the recent victory achieved by the government troops in the
central plateau and the eastern province of Moxico has encouraged
FAA to restore stability and security in the southern provinces
while the rebels have moved into the forest areas, far away from
main cities and principal highways.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Begins Visit to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo started his talks with U.S. leaders Thursday, hoping to
get more assistance from the United States and solve the problem
of his country's heavy debt.
</P>
<P>
And the United States is seeking to make Africa's most popular
nation a stabilizing force for the rest of the continent through
the visit of Obasanjo, who was elected president in May.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo first went to the Pentagon for a meeting with Defense
Secretary William Cohen and was then to go to the White House for
talks with President Bill Clinton and a joint news conference.
</P>
<P>
Washington is Nigeria's largest trade and investment partner,
with the United States relying on Nigeria for about 10 percent of
its oil. The United States also considers the sub-Saharan country
as a potential engine of economic growth and a keystone of peace
and stability on the continent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of States Madeleine Albright visited Nigeria
earlier this month and said Washington wanted to triple or
quadruple U.S. financial aid to Nigeria to possibly 100 million
dollars as a reward for its "move to democracy."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo was the first elected president after military leader
Gen. Sani Abacha passed away and Nigeria held the presidential
election in May.
</P>
<P>
"What we're witnessing here is a coming of age, if you will,
for Nigeria under the Obasanjo government," said White House
National Security Council spokesman Jim Fallin. "Obasanjo's
leadership bodes well for our future relationship and successes."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has billions in oil wealth but is struggling with 31
billion dollars in debt, and Clinton has advocated debt
forgiveness for poorer nations. He is also interested in
coordinating the assistance Nigeria is getting from 18 federal
agencies under an umbrella effort, the U.S.-Nigerian Joint
Economic Partnership Commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- A Yemeni economic report has emphasized that if the
country's cereal crop production remains at the present level, its
food deficit by the year 2010 will cost 1.5 billion U.S. dollars
to cover.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a study worked out by Khalid Ragih Sheikh, advisor of
the Yemeni higher council for economic, investment and petroleum
affairs, the Arab daily "Al Hayat" reported Wednesday the food gap
in Yemen has grown from 46 percent in 1970 to 76.52 percent in
1997, while deficit in wheat alone has soared by 94 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study said the import of cereals rose from 1.5 million tons
in 1993 to 2.3 million tons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- An official Yemeni source has disclosed that the
coming phase of the privatization plan in Yemen covers 47
establishments and factories, foremost among which are the Aden
refineries, three cement plants, pharmaceutical factories, ground
services in six international airports, land transport and
communications.
</P>
<P>
"Al Hayat" quoted the manager of the technical office for
privatization, Abdul Karim Al-Saeedi, as saying that the
forthcoming step involves the formation of the higher
privatization committee composed of Yemeni cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
GAZA -- Representatives of Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority have agreed to expand the list of future Palestinian
imports, and the reciprocal reimbursement of purchase taxes.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-language daily "Alam Al Yom" on Wednesday said that
according to the agreement, debts claimed by Palestinian
establishments will be settled, and the two sides will cooperate
in the combat of car thefts.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed on the commodities which the
Palestinian Authority will be allowed to import from Jordan and
Egypt without imposing Israeli custom fees.
</P>
<P>
Israel agreed to reimburse to Palestinians the purchase taxes
on Israeli commodities directly bought from the producer in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese Central Bank will begin selling new
local-currency securities this week to help commercial banks find
a home for some of their surplus funds.
</P>
<P>
Starting on Thursday, the Central Bank will sell certificates
of deposit (CD) each week with maturities of six months and one
year, in addition to the 45-day and 60-day CDs.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The United States has agreed to grant aid to the
Lebanese government to build five dams across Lebanon, the Arabic
newspaper As Safir reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper didn't mention the exact sum to be donated, but it
indicated that the U.S. Agency for International Development will
announce the agreement in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
It said an official from Lebanese Hydraulic Resources Ministry,
Fady Qumair, received the pledge from Senator Joseph Mason, head
of the U.S. agency, during an official visit to the U.S.

<HEADLINE> British Government to Pay Damages to Spanish Fishermen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's highest court ruled
Thursday that Britain will have to pay compensation estimated at
100 million pounds (about 160 million U.S. dollars) to Spanish
fishing companies unlawfully banned from operating
British-registered vessels 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords upheld a 1998 Court of Appeal ruling that a
group of nearly 100 owners and managers of Spanish vessels were
entitled to sue over the government's moves to prevent them "quota
hopping."
</P>
<P>
In 1988 the Conservative government of Britain passed laws
intended to stop Spanish fisherman increasing their take of fish
by the ploy of using British fishing quotas.
</P>
<P>
The legislation was later found to have broken European law.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous ruling Thursday, five law lords ruled that the
breach was sufficiently serious to entitle the fisherman to claim
compensation.
</P>
<P>
They said that although the government's intention was to
protect British fishing communities, the effect was to
discriminate against Spanish nationals, thereby flouting one of
the most basic principles of European law.
</P>
<P>
The government had deliberately decided to run the risk of
introducing the legislation, knowing that it could be unlawful.
Justice required that the wrong should be made good, the law lords
said.
</P>
<P>
The amount which now could be claimed by the Spanish in
individual court cases has been estimated at 80 million pounds
(about 130 million U.S. dollars). But interest and legal costs are
expected to push the total bill to be picked up by the British
taxpayer at over 100 million pounds.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Bars Barak to Speak at Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel's internal security
service Shin Bet has refused to let Prime Minister Ehud Barak
speak at the Tel Aviv square where former Israeli leader Yitzhak
Rabin was assassinated, Israel Radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Shin Bet, which provides security to Barak, also refused to
let Barak appear at a memorial rally on the fourth anniversary of
Rabin's assassination on November 4, saying it can not ensure his
safety.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources as saying Shin Bet is
exploring creative ways to allow Barak to attend the rally in Tel
Aviv, and one option is for Barak to make a televised speech from
a room in a nearby building to be broadcast to the crowd on a
large screen.
</P>
<P>
Barak plans to speak to tens of thousands of people from the
stage where Rabin spoke before a right-wing Jew opposed to his
peace moves shot him dead four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Shin Bet can not escape the shock of the murder four years
ago and need to take all necessary precautions, Public Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami told the radio.
</P>
<P>
A public inquiry into the Rabin assassination criticized the
Shin Bet for lax security measures and a failure to anticipate the
threat of a Jewish assassin.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll of 500 Israelis released by Gesher, a group
promoting tolerance, showed 58.5 percent believe that Israel has
yet to learn the lesson of Rabin's murder and 72 percent believe
a political killing may happen in Israel again.

</P>
<P>
Andrei Pavel, a wild card, also reached the quarterfinals of
the indoor tournament, beating qualifier Daniel Vacek 6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Mariano Zabaleta upset 16th-seeded Magnus Norman 6-3, 6-4.
</P>

Martin, runner-up at the U.S. Open last month, is ranked world
No. 4. The American has now reached the quarterfinals or better in
11 of the 15 events played this year.
</P>
<P>
Briton Rusedski, No. 16 in the world, relied on his big serve
to sweep aside Haas, the rising German star who was seeded No. 11.
</P>
<P>
In the round of eight, Rusedki will play Martin, to whom he
lost in the fourth round of the U.S. Open after winning the first
two sets.

<HEADLINE> Somali Subclans Reach Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Agonyar and Warsangeli
subclans of faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed Thursday reached a
temporary cease- fire, ending a two-day intensified armed
confrontation in north Mogadishu, Somalia.
</P>
<P>
This came as a result of an extensive meeting by local elders
and prominent figures from the rival militiamen. The negotiations
began on Wednesday afternoon and lasted deep into the night.
</P>
<P>
The two sides went into clashes in the areas of Fagah,
Kallunkah and El- Tubboweyneh Tuesday afternoon. Six militiamen
from both sides were killed in the exchange of fire.
</P>
<P>
However, although the subclan clash in Mogadishu has come to an
end, a series of other insecurity accidents were witnessed in the
past twenty-four hours in the area. On Wednesday afternoon, the
cashier of Medina Islamic court was shot dead and four others, two
from the Islamic militiamen and two bystanders, were wounded when
a gunman from the court militiamen controlled by warlord Muse Sudi
Yalahow opened fire inside the court.
</P>
<P>
Two young girls were also shot dead Wednesday night in
Manapolio district of north Mogadishu. According to
eyewitnesses, a young gunman opened fire at the two girls, who
were smelling fresh air outside their gate.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by another accident Thursday morning when
two men carrying an assault rifle entered a stereo studio in Karan
district and killed the man selling cassettes there.

UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday announced that the United Nations will send a
humanitarian mission to Chechnya, Russia, most likely before the

<P>
The U.N. chief made the announcement in a statement, issued by
his spokesman, in which Annan voiced his concerns over "the severe
impact" of the conflict in Chechnya, Russia, on the civilian
population and called for a political situation to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Annan "is in touch with the Russian authorities and has sent a
senior official to Moscow to discuss the possibility of sending
U.N. humanitarian mission to Chechnya," the statement said. "Those
consultations were successful, and a mission will leave for the
region very soon -- possibly before the end of the month."
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general has for some weeks been concerned about
the severe impact on the civilian population, many thousands of
whom have been driven from their homes," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general reiterates his appeal to both sides in
the conflict to show restraint, and to take special care to avoid
civilian casualties," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"While the problem of terrorism is one of legitimate concern to
all governments, it is important that the response to it should be
proportional, and that the provision of humanitarian law in armed
conflict are respected at all times," the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook Thursday urged fellow Commonwealth leaders to use a
forthcoming summit of the bloc to form plans to take the 54-nation
group into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the Institute of
Commonwealth Studies at the Royal Commonwealth Society in London,
Cook said the upcoming summit was a chance to make the group
relevant in future decades.
</P>
<P>
The next commonwealth summit is scheduled to be held in Durban,
South Africa, in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that in the summit the commonwealth should try to
find ways to tackle goals like human rights, economic development,
the environment and international security.
</P>
<P>
"At Durban we need to lay the groundwork for the Commonwealth's
agenda in the coming century... we need an action plan, not just
declarations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said he would be holding talks on the
outcome of the meeting in a few days.
</P>
<P>
"We will consider the report at the Durban summit and we will
decide there what further action to take," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the Commonwealth bloc of nations had a headstart in
the technological revolution under way because it spoke English,
"the language of the Internet and 80 percent of electronic
commerce."
</P>
<P>
That advantage should be exploited, he said.

SANAA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A Yemeni official dismissed as
"groundless" a report by Israel's Yediot Ahronot that Yemen and
Israel are making secret contacts to establish diplomatic ties.

He reasserted his country's principled position on this issue,
saying that the establishment of such relations can never be
realized before realizing just, permanent and comprehensive peace
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The relations should be based on the restoration of the Arab
rights, the declaration of Palestinian statehood and the
termination of the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon and Syrian
Golan Heights, he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Such basis could guarantee lasting peace, security, stability,
coexistence and prosperity for all the peoples of the region, the

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Send Mission to Northern Caucasus, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday announced that the United Nations will send a
humanitarian assessment mission to Northern Caucasus near
Chechnya, Russia, most likely before the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the announcement in a statement, issued by
his spokesman, in which Annan voiced his concerns over "the severe
impact" of the conflict in Chechnya, Russia, on the civilian
population and called for a political situation to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued as Russian troops closed in on the
Chechen capital, Grozny, and Russian planes reportedly pounded the
city for a second day. About 190,000 refugees have fled since
fighting broke out a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.N. spokesman read the statement, which said that
the U.N. mission will be sent into Chechnya. However, he announced
a revised statement, saying that the mission will only go to
Northern Caucasus, where refugees are concentrated. The revision
was seen as a move to avoid interfering in Russia's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Annan "is in touch with the Russian authorities and has sent a
senior official to Moscow to discuss the possibility of sending
U.N. humanitarian mission to Chechnya," the statement said. "Those
consultations were successful, and a mission will leave for the
region very soon -- possibly before the end of the month."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General has for some weeks been concerned about
the severe impact on the civilian population, many thousands of
whom have been driven from their homes," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General reiterates his appeal to both sides in
the conflict to show restraint, and to take special care to
avoid civilian casualties," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"While the problem of terrorism is one of legitimate concern to
all governments, it is important that the response to it should be
proportional, and that the provision of humanitarian law in armed
conflict are respected at all times," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In situation as complex as that in Chechnya, the solution must
ultimately be political," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
This is the third statement by Annan on Chechnya in a month.
In the two earlier statements, Annan expressed concern over the
humanitarian situation in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in U.S. Navy's Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Two pilots were killed as a
jet from the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels precision flying team crashed
in a wooden area in southern Georgia State of the United States
Thursday, the U.S. Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
"The accident took place around 12:30 (1630 GMT) this
afternoon. They were coming in to land, practicing arrival
maneuvers when this happened,'' said Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon.
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred near Moody Air Force Base, where the Blue
Angels were scheduled to perform this weekend during the base's
Community Appreciation Day.
</P>
<P>
The stunt team has six F/A-18 jets and is based at the
Pensacola Naval Air Station.
</P>
<P>
The Blue Angels have performed in air shows since 1946. An
estimated 10 to 15 million people watch the spectacle team each
year. The aircraft typically are piloted by one Navy pilot and one
Marine corps pilot.
</P>
<P>
Each of the plane costs about 28 million U.S. dollars, plus the
cost of weapons-related equipment, which can significantly
increase its total price.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's fatalities brought to 23 the number of pilots killed
in air shows or training since the group was formed in 1946. The
last fatality was on July 13, 1985, when a pilot died after a
mid-air collision.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Peace, Harmony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Thursday called on the Arabians and Israelis to turn swords
into plowers and live peacefully and harmoniously on the basis of
mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with King Mohammed VI of Morocco, Jiang
pointed out that the Middle East is a multination region and for a
long time was one of the centers of the world civilization, thanks
to the outstanding contribution by each Middle East nation.
</P>
<P>
But this century has seen deep sufferings of wars and turmoils
by the Middle East people, and four wars between Arabs and
Israelis, which had severely hindered the regional peace and
development as well as the historical cause of civilization and
progress.
</P>
<P>
The rise and fall as well as the war and peace of the Middle
East have since long been the focus of world attention, Jiang
said, adding that China especially cares for the situation and the
peace process in the Middle East because of a long history of
exchanges, similar experiences and sufferings, special feelings
toward each other and ties between China and peoples of all
nations in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He noted that peoples of the Middle East countries who have
paid high price in seeking and defending peace have deeply
recognized the value of peace. China is pleased to see that the
Middle East peace is progressing, relations between Arabians and
Israelis are changing and political settlement of regional
disputes has become a general trend, he said.
</P>
<P>
As always, China supports the Middle East peace process, calls
for political resolution of regional disputes, and hopes Arabians
and Israelis to turn swords into plowers, establish mutual trust
and achieve a peaceful and harmonious living together, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spelled out four points of China's position on the Middle
East as follows:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, China advocates peace instead of resorting to
violence, cooperation instead of confrontation and inclusion
instead of exclusion.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, China maintains that broad respect should be given
to the territorial integrity and sovereign independence of each
Middle East country, its security be ensured, the legitimate
national rights of the Palestinian people be restored and
respected, and people of all nations should live in peace and
harmony.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, China supports relevant parties of the Middle East to
take as their strategic choice the peaceful settlement of disputes
through negotiations. China also hopes that they will carry out
without reservation the relevant United Nations resolutions,
adhere to the principle of "land for peace" and insist in
implementing the existing agreements.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, China hopes that the international community will
increase its efforts of promoting peace. China will as always
work for the realization of a comprehensive, just and lasting
peace in the Middle East together with the international community.
</P>
<P>
Jiang spoke highly of the Moroccan government and people, the
late King Hassan II in particular, for their positive efforts and
contribution to facilitating Arab-Israeli reconciliation and
advancing the cause of the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that while some positive elements occur in the
Middle East peace process, it requires joint efforts of the
international community and especially the wisdom and courage of
leaders of countries in the region to nurture the elements into
the realization of just and lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It is the solemn obligation bestowed by history that leaders
and statesmen across the century should proceed from a historical
perspective to create a peaceful and tranquil environment of
living and development for future generations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed his conviction that although
the Middle East question is complicated and tough, the mankind is
able to solve such problems. As history always moves forward, the
future of the Middle East is bright, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Official Confident in Coffee Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Coffee Board of Kenya
Thursday expressed its optimism about the coffee sector which is
struggling with poor production, falling prices and internecine
violence.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the industry will overcome the current
challenges, and we shall do all we can to avoid disintegration of
this important industry,'' said Isaac Kiragu, General Manager of
the board, pledging to pay all the money owed to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Kiragu said in a statement that the government will support the
farmers by continuing to make all payments outstanding and all
loans in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed official called on farmers to increase
production and avoid disruptive action that has threatened to wipe
out the sector.
</P>
<P>
The board had estimated production would increase to 70,000
tons this year after a dismal 47,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
But analysts say drought and the violent disputes among rival
groups of small-scale farmers in the rich Central Province is
likely to undermine that projection.
</P>
<P>
Low production has seen auction volumes decline substantially
in the past two months, forcing the Nairobi Coffee Exchange to
hold bi-weekly auctions instead of weekly.
</P>
<P>
The coffee sector is the major economic pillar and foreign
currency earner in Kenya.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mulls to Arm Asian Nations with Nuclear Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- the United States considered
to arm India and other Asian countries with nuclear weapons in the
mid-1960s as a means to offset power of China and the Soviet
Union, according to a new book.
</P>
<P>
The book, "India's Nuclear bomb" by George Perkovich due out
next month, provides the most detailed glimpse yet of high level
U.S. debate on such "nuclear sharing" to counter the two nuclear
powers.
</P>
<P>
Perkovich cited declassified U.S. records and interviews with
Indian scientists and government officials, saying Washington was
persistent in proposing to help India acquire a nuclear
capability.
</P>
<P>
"The basic idea was to make arrangements for friendly Asian
countries to receive and militarily deliver low-yield tactical
nuclear weapons that the United States would provide to them in
the event of Chinese aggression," wrote Perkovich, director of the
Secure World Program for the W. Alton Jones Foundation,
</P>
<P>
A Declassified 1964 U.S. Defense Department study, suggested
the possibility of making nuclear weapons available to India,
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Pakistan,
Thailand, South Korea and Kuomintang-occupied Chinese territory of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
But the study, forwarded to Secretary of State Dean Rusk on
Dec. 4, 1964, paid special attention to India, said by its author
to be capable of producing and testing a nuclear device in one to
three years.
</P>
<P>
Perkovich said the United States had two goals at the time. One
was to head off an independent Indian nuclear weapons program in a
foreshadowing of current U.S. non-proliferation concerns.
</P>
<P>
The second was to give Washington the option of "controlled use
of nuclear weapons" against Beijing because it has a communist
government.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department study envisaged helping modify India's
bomber fleet, training flight crews, providing dummy weapons for
drills and passing on "weapon effect date for planning and
necessary target date to support the feasibility and desirability
of weapon use," according to Perkovich's book.
</P>
<P>
Washington would have provided parallel treatment to Pakistan,
India's traditional rival, partly to head off any backlash from
Islamabad, the book said.
</P>
<P>
The book said the nuclear-sharing proposal -- eventually
rejected at the highest levels of U.S. government as too
problematic -- called for developing facilities in partner states
"to handle weapons if and and when they were needed."
</P>
<P>
The proposal to equip others to deliver U.S. atomic bombs lived
on for another two years. According to a 1966 study prepared for
President Lyndon Johnson by the State Department, British
officials were briefed and "indicated they wished to participate."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Issues New Regulations on Plane Fuel Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) Thursday unveiled new proposals to ensure
that airplane fuel tanks are less susceptible to fires and
explosions.
</P>
<P>
In a special regulation, the FAA is ordering that aircraft
makers develop a new maintenance program for fuel tanks within 12
months of the adoption of the rule.
</P>
<P>
The FAA called for a top-to-bottom review of existing tank
systems and a higher standard for new plane designs to prevent a
repeat of accidents like the explosion of TWA jumbo jet near New
York in 1996 which killed all 230 people on board.
</P>
<P>
The programs must assume that the tanks always contain an
explosive mixture during all maintenance, ground and in-flight
operation.
</P>
<P>
Once that program is developed, aircraft operators will have
six months to adopt maintenance programs that incorporate the
tasks identified by aircraft builders.
</P>
<P>
The special rule also states that new planes -- both those
being designed and those on the assembly line -- must contain fuel
systems that minimize the development of flammable vapors or
provide a means to prevent catastrophic damage to an aircraft if
ignition occurs.
</P>
<P>
If adopted, the rule would cover 6,000 existing U.S.-registered
aircraft, representing 36 models of turbine-powered planes with 30
or more seats made by 12 manufacturers including Boeing Co. and
Airbus Industrie.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Appeals for Debt Relief by Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said Thursday that Kenya would appreciate any debt relief by
Germany as the east African country spends most of its money
servicing foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks in Berlin where he had separate
discussions with German leaders, the Kenyan President Press
Service said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Moi met with President of the German Parliament, Wolfgang
Thierse, Foreign Affairs Minister Joschka Fischer, and Joachim
Tappe, head of parliamentary group for relations with east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president also asked for support from Germany during
the on- going negotiations between Kenya and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank for the resumption of the
IFM loans suspended in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Moi told the German leaders that Kenya would present to Germany
a detailed proposal regarding urgent areas of development when the
officials of both countries meet at the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Kenya had for the past eight years been carrying
out reforms aimed at promoting economic growth, good governance
and transparency.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government is committed to stamping out
corruption with the establishment of the Anti-Corruption
Authority.
</P>
<P>
President Moi left Nairobi Sunday on an official visit to three
European nations, Luxembourg, Belgium and Germany.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit to European countries was to seek development
 cooperation and assistance especially in the health and
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Treasury Bill Rate Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's 91-day treasury bill
rate Thursday fell for the first time in three months.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark rate at the weekly auction was 17.74 percent
compared with 17.79 last week after the government accepted just
2.995 billion shillings (about 40 million U.S. dollars) from total
bids worth 5.598 billion shillings (75 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the 182-day treasury bill remained firm, rising 38 basis
points to 17.25 percent from last Thursday's 16.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The market expectation is that this rate should go down and it
could also be because of the reduced amount the government has
requested this week,'' said a senior official of the Central Bank
of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's treasury bill rates have risen by over seven percentage
points since May as the government's appetite for funds grew.
</P>
<P>
The 12-week moving average on the 91-day bill yield rose to
16.34 percent from 16.09 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it would offer seven billion shillings
(about 93 million dollars) in treasury bills for sale at the next
auction on November 4.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Plans to Complete Privatization Drive by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Public
Business Sector Mokhtar Khatab said on Thursday that Egypt has
planned to complete the privatization process by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight public enterprises will be tendered for sale by the
end of this year, Khatab was quoted by the country's Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will further privatize 94 public sector companies in 2000
and another 45 in 2001, he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt kicked off the economic reform program featuring
privatization in June 1991. It chose 314 public companies for the
process.
</P>
<P>
The country has so far sold 127 public enterprises in the
privatization drive, Khatab said, adding that the selling has
yielded a revenue of 11.1 billion Egyptian pounds (3.26 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The state has cashed in over 10 billion pounds (2.94 billion
dollars) of the value, he said, adding that the rest are to be
paid on instalments by investors.
</P>
<P>
Of the revenue, the government allocated 3.61 billion pounds
(1.1 billion dollars) to settle the debts of the companies and
1.93 billion pounds (567.65 million dollars) for the early
retirement compensation scheme. More than 4 billion pounds (1.18
billion dollars) were transferred to the state coffers.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's economic reform has been praised as a model of the
developing world by world economic and financial organizations. It
has promoted the growth of the country's gross domestic product to
over 5 percent, reduced the inflation to less than 4 percent and
increased the foreign currency reserves to about 20 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Start Military Training of Iraqi Opponents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
start direct military training of Iraqi opponents at a Florida
Air Force base next week, in preparation of overthrowing Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, U.S. defense officials said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The defense officials confirmed a New York Times report that
four Iraqis, including two defected military officers, will
attend a regular Air Force training course for officers from
Arab and Central Asian countries at Hurlburt Field near
Pensacola.
</P>
<P>
They said it was part of a U.S. plan to help prepare for an
eventual overthrow of Saddam.
</P>
<P>
The move comes ahead of a big meeting of Iraqi opposition
groups in New York from Friday. Washington hopes that the
meeting would forge an unified front against Saddam.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times also reported on Thursday that the Clinton
administration had approved its first contribution of surplus
Pentagon equipment, offering the main Iraqi opposition groups 2
million U.S. dollars worth of office supplies.
</P>
<P>
The training and equipment, which the Times said includes
computers, fax machines and file cabinets, represent the first
portion of nearly 100 million U.S. dollars in aid authorized by
Congress last year.

UNITED NATIONS, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Four United Nations
agencies decided to join forces to fight maternal mortality in
order to reduce the number of women who will die from pregnancy
and childbirth, a joint statement said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was issued by the World Health Organization

services, and the choice by women as to when to be pregnant.
</P>
<P>
"Each year close to 600,000 women -- more than one woman every

childbirth," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Low social status of women in developing countries is an
important factor underlying maternal mortality," the statement
said. "Low social status limits women's access to economic
resources and basic education, impeding their ability to make
informed decisions on childbearing, health and nutrition."
</P>
<P>
At present, only 53 percent of deliveries in developing
countries are attended by a health professional, and only 40
percent take place in a hospital or health center. Some 15 percent
of women who become pregnant experience life-threatening
complications that require emergency care. Some 40 percent
pregnant women need professional care for a pregnancy-related
complication.
</P>
<P>
"Safe motherhood can be advanced through respecting exiting
human rights, through empowering women to make choices in their
reproductive lives with the support of their families and
communities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The access to and quality of maternal health services need to
be improved," it said. "all deliveries should be overseen by
skilled attendants and essential care should be available when
obstetric complications arise."
</P>
<P>
"Women need to be able to choose if and when to become
pregnant, through ensured access to voluntary family planning
information and services," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement, which builds on 12 years of experience in
implementing safe motherhood activities and research on the
effectiveness of measures to reduce maternal deaths, presents the
causes of maternal mortality and the priority actions governments
and societies need to take to reduce mother and infant deaths over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"This statement reflects the consensus between four key
international bodies on the seriousness and extent of maternal
mortality, as well as the best ways to reduce it," said Dr, Gro
Harlem Brundtland, director-general of WHO. "It will result in
greater synergy in our work at the country level, and in the end
save more lives."

WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that there was no breakthrough of talks with
Afghanistan's Taliban movement over the expulsion of Saudi-born
Osama bin Laden as Washington had demanded.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban has offered us ideas on how these concerns can be
met. Our discussions haven't resulted in any resolution of the
matter. We are prepared to continue them," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to reports in the Gulf and Pakistan, which said
that the Taliban and the United States had reached agreement under
which bin Laden would be deported to a country where he could be
tried.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban spokesman also said in Afghanistan that the reports
of a handover agreement were "totally baseless."

<HEADLINE> Use of Toxic Agricultural Chemical Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- An expert said Thursday that
"parathium", insecticide that caused the death of 24 boys in a
Peruvian school, is made by German multinational "Bayer" and is
prohibited in 25 countries.
</P>
<P>
The director of Net of Action and Alternatives to the use of
Agro-Chemical products (RAAA), Luis Gamero, attributed the tragedy
to mercantilism and negligence.
</P>
<P>
Gazmero described as immoral the sale of highly toxic and
forbidden products in developing countries like Peru.
</P>
<P>
In Peru, of 800 authorized pesticides, 25 are highly toxic and
have restricted use, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that another factor contributing to the tragedy at
Tacamarca locality, Cuzco department, was that indications for the
correct usage of parathium were written in Spanish when dwellers
there speak only Indian Quechua language.
</P>
<P>
The boys were poisoned last week when they took milk and other
food contaminated with parathium in a Catamarca school.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and France signed here
Friday two cooperation documents, one for a project on modernizing
vocational training and the other for a water project in Vung Tau
city in southern Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The two documents were signed during a two-day visit to Vietnam
by French Minister of Economics, Finance and Industry Dominique
Strausse-Kahn who arrived in Hanoi on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Vietnamese Finance Ministry and the
Hanoi-based Agence France Development signed an agreement, under
which France would lend Vietnam 12.8 million euros (13.7 million
U.S. dollars) to implement a project of technical and vocational
training. The project will be executed from now till 2005.
</P>
<P>
Strausse-Kahn and the Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and
Investment Thursday also signed a financial protocol, under which
France will provide 16 million euros (17.2 million dollars) aid to
Vietnam for collecting, treating and draining waste water in Vung
Tau city in Vietnam's southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing of the two documents, Strausse-Kahn held
talks with Vietnamese Finance Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers discussed issues relating to investment,
trade and finance as well as cooperation between the two
ministries in expertise exchange and personnel training regarding
research and management of finance, insurance and taxation.
</P>
<P>
Strausse-Kahn said French business people believed in Vietnam's
potential for development and wished to strengthen cooperation
with its businesses.
</P>
<P>
France is willing to assist Vietnam in perfecting a legal
framework on taxation so that French-invested projects could be
executed on a longer-term basis in Vietnam, he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Needs Restructuring in Economic Transition, Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 29 (Xinhua) - Singapore has to restructure
itself in key economic areas despite its past success in order to
prepare for the transition to a knowledge-based economy, said Lim
Hng Kiang, minister for health and second minister for finance, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lim made the point at a press conference at the end of a
three-day meeting of the Singapore Economic Development Board's
(EDB) International Advisory Council (IAC), which was set up in
1995 to advise the board on its international and regional
strategies.
</P>
<P>
"This is a challenging period for Singapore," said Lim. "We
have done well in the past 30 years, but as we look forward, all
of us recognize that we have to restructure and change."
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore will continue to rely on manufacturing as one
of the two important engines of growth and only sectors within it
will be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
He said the EDB will try to achieve the goal of a 40-percent
gross domestic product (GDP) contribution coming from its two main
sectors, that is, 25 percent from manufacturing and 15 percent
from exportable services.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the IAC members discussed the various plans
that Singapore has put in place to develop itself into a
knowledge-based economy and other strategic issues facing the
Singapore economy.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views with Singapore's cabinet ministers
and other high-ranking individuals from public and private sectors
and from the region.
</P>
<P>
In a speech summarizing up the conclusions of the meeting,
Richard Sykes, chairman of Glaxo Wellcome Plc., said that as a
large percentage of the work force in Singapore still lacks the
sufficient expertise to help Singapore transit immediately to a
knowledge-based economy, manufacturing has to remain a very
important issue for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said the IAC believes that the Singapore government's target
of 40-percent GDP coming from knowledge-driven manufacturing and
exportable services is an achievable goal.
</P>
<P>
Singapore will have to focus on a number of areas, particularly
 petrochemical, pharmaceutical and biochemical industries and
communications and information technology services, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Fall Sharply in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes fell a
steep 12.8 percent in September to the lowest level in almost two
years as mortgage rates climbed and Hurricane Floyd raked the East
Coast, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department said that sales of new single-family homes
decreased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 811,000 units
last month. That was the lowest level since December 1997, when an
annual rate of 791,000 units were sold.
</P>
<P>
September's performance followed a revised August sales pace of
930,000 units, which was much lower than the 983,000 units the
government previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
The monthly average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in
September was 7.82 percent, up from 6.72 percent a year earlier,
but lower than August's 7.94 percent average rate, according to
Freddie Mac, the mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
A report released Monday showed Americans bought fewer existing
homes in September, deterred by higher mortgage rates and the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
Even though sales of existing homes fell 2.1 percent in
September, the third straight monthly decline, such sales are
still heading toward a banner year. That's because low
unemployment, tame inflation and stock and bond market gains
continue to make Americans feel wealthy and comfortable about
making purchases, economists say.
</P>
<P>
The government reported Thursday that the country's home
ownership rate climbed to an all-time high of 67 percent in the
third quarter as a record number of minorities bought houses. The
ownership rate was 66.6 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
By region, the West took the biggest hit, posting a 14.8
decline to an annual rate of 213,000 units in September. In the
Midwest, new-home sales fell 14.2 percent to an annual rate of
175,000 units. New-home sales in the South dropped by 11.3 percent
to an annual rate of 345,000 units and sales in the Northeast
declined by 8.1 percent to an annual rate of 79,000 units.
</P>
<P>
While new-home sales were down in all parts of the country, the
average new-home price hit an all-time high last month.
</P>
<P>
The average price for a a new home sold in September set a
record of 196,900 U.S. dollars, up from 192,400 dollars in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the median price for a new home, meaning half of all
homes sold in September sold for less and half for more, was
160,000 dollars, up from August's median price of 153,900 dollars.
September's median home price tied a record set in April.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends More Number of U.N. Police in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has recommended that the Security Council increase the
strength of the United Nations civilian police force in Kosovo, a
Yugoslav province, by more than 1,600 officers, U.N. officials
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following recommendation by his Special Representative for
Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner of France, to significantly increase the
force size now set at a total of 3,110 officers, Annan suggested
that the force be expanded to 4,718.
</P>
<P>
This increase is intended to ensure that the U.N. Interim
Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has a fully functioned
international police service to both established and maintain
civil law and order throughout the territory, Annan said in a
report, which is being circulated here.
</P>
<P>
The enhanced UNMIK police force would provide a broad spectrum
of basic law enforcement services, including patrolling, crime
prevention, border police functions and security for at-risk
populations, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are more than 1,700 UNMIK police in Kosovo,
with U.N. police units already responsible for full police
functions in Pristina, capital of the Serbian province, and the
Prizren region.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Respected in China's Detention House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Prison inmates in the Changzhou
Detention House in Jiangsu Province, east China, can drink hot,
purified water whenever they want, and those who are well-behaved
are granted a home leave.
</P>
<P>
"Different policies should be adopted in dealing with crime and
in reforming criminals," said Ge Shuming, deputy director of the
Changzhou Public Security Bureau, who believes that a humane
environment should be provided to prisoners to protect their
legitimate rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The detention house is not only a place to incarcerate
criminals, it also is an important government tool for
rehabilitating convicts through education, he explained.
</P>
<P>
"Prisons should keep pace with social and economic development,
" the official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the municipal government of Changzhou spent 36 million
yuan (4.3 million U.S. dollars) to update the detention house,
which is located on the outskirts of the city and boasts a villa-
like atmosphere of green lawns and tree-lined avenues.
</P>
<P>
Covering more than 20,000 square meters, the detention house
has 120 cells that can house 1,400 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"Police officers here treat us as their friends and relatives.
I'm moved by their sincerity and ready to be a law-abiding citizen,
" said Hu Keyu, a convicted thief from southwest China's Guizhou
Province.
</P>
<P>
Guards are strictly forbidden to beat, physically intimidate,
or curse at prisoners, and their rights to appeal to higher
authorities or speak on their own behalf are respected, according
to Wu Jianguo, an official in charge of the detention house.
</P>
<P>
Three carved granite keys, as tall as seven meters, stand in
front of the gate of the detention house. Wu explained their
symbolic meaning: "One serves to open the door leading to the
twisted souls of criminals, another to open the door of the law
for them, and the last to open the door to a brand-new life after
they return to society."

</P>
<P>
In a speech entitled "Towards A Stronger Financial System"
delivered at Hong Kong Society of Accountants' Annual Dinner 1999,
Yam said Hong Kong is now steadily recovering from a painful, 18-
month recession.
</P>
<P>
He said currency stability, under the linked exchange rate
system, was also forcing the structural adjustments necessary to
maintain and improve Hong Kong's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"We need to ensure that we come out of the crisis stronger
rather than weaker. We need to identify structural defects, if any,
and address ways of correcting them, not necessarily limiting
ourselves to our own systems, given the globalization of financial
markets," said Yam.
</P>
<P>
He identified the areas to be considered for the building of a
stronger financial system as prudent management of the
international financial architecture, international reform in
financial disclosure and regulation and regional monetary
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Osama Reportedly Ready to Leave Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Friday said Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden had expressed
"conditional readiness" to leave Afghanistan, a report by the
Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Muhammad Tayyab, a spokesman for the
Taliban's supreme leader Mulla Omar, as saying in the southwestern
Afghan province of Kandahar that Osama had asked the Taliban
authorities to help him move to whatever place he wants.
</P>
<P>
Osama also reported to have said he would tell his destination
only to "one or two persons" from the Taliban militia and they
should not disclose this secret.
</P>
<P>
Tayyab said Mulla Omar received a letter from the Saudi
dissident and would respond to it in a few days after holding
consultations.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's newly appointed Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad
Mutawakkil Thursday denied reports from Moscow that the Taliban
have agreed to extradite Osama, wanted by the United States, to a
third country.
</P>
<P>
"No, there has been no such agreement," Mutawakkil told AIP.
</P>
<P>
Mutawakkil said the Taliban had made two offers to the United
States to negotiate the Osama issue, or let Islamic scholars from
Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and a third Islamic country decide the
issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 British veterans
who took part in the war against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1991
have been tested for Gulf War syndrome, the government said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Defense minister John Spellar said 3,128 soldiers had been
referred to the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Program.
</P>
<P>
In a written answer to a parliamentary question, Spellar said
that the program's main purpose was "to investigate patients'
medical complaints, make a diagnosis as far as possible and
recommend appropriate management or provide reassurance if no
illness if found."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of British and U.S. Gulf War veterans complain they
suffer from the syndrome, with symptoms ranging from flu to
chronic fatigue and asthma, because they were administered drugs
to combat chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The syndrome has been dismissed by many experts. Some experts
said it is all in the mind, while researchers in the United States
said it could be due to a genetic deficiency.

</P>
<P>
Grooms too averaged at 33.5 in 1997, two years older compared

one-third of mothers are waiting until they are 30 years of age or
older to have their first child.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Friday that he is eyeing talks with Catholic Church
leaders to address the issue of population growth which stands at
2.3 percent or an increase of more than 1 million each year.
</P>
<P>
The president told the Foreign Correspondents Association of
the Philippines in a meeting that his biggest worry now is to find
funds for projects to meet the needs of a growing population.
</P>
<P>
"Eventually I think in the very near future we'll be able to
solve that. We'll have a discussion with the bishops and the
cardinals," he said when asked about his administration's strategy
in dealing with the population issue.
</P>
<P>
He added that he wants to make the solution acceptable to
Catholic Church leaders who are against any family planning
project.
</P>
<P>
Estrada pointed out that he himself is a Catholic and that over
80 percent of the Philippine population adhere to the same faith.
</P>
<P>
He said the growing population has prompted the government to
look for additional sources of funding for housing, agricultural
modernization, food security and other programs aimed at uplifting
the lives of the masses.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, has become his biggest worry as president.

<HEADLINE> China Taps Huge New Energy Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up efforts to
develop various new and renewable forms of energy, focusing on
hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal and tidal sources.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Energy Research Society (CERS), these as
yet untapped forms will be the main sources of energy in the next
century, and are expected to account for five to ten percent in
the world's total energy demands by 2025, or even 50 percent by
2050.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in new and renewable energy sources, said CERS
experts. Statistics show that China has recoverable wind energy
sources of 160 million kw, geothermal sources of 3.5 million kw
and tidal energy sources of more than 20 million kw.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country's vast rural areas have nearly 300
million tons of biological materials for developing methane gas.
</P>
<P>
In China currently, various new and renewable forms of energy
being used annually are estimated at an equivalent of 300 million
tons of standard coal.
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 small windmills are used by people in mountainous
areas, remote countryside and islands. And the country has
imported medium-sized and large windmills from Denmark, the
Netherlands, and the US to equip over 20 wind power plants.
</P>
<P>
According to the CERS experts, more than 7,000 small hydropower
stations have been set up nationwide with a total installed
capacity of 20 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 percent of the rural households in China use energy-
saving stoves, with annual methane gas production topping 1.5
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
China is also rich in tidal energy, 90 percent of which located
in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. So far, a dozen tidal power
stations have been set up with a total installed capacity of 20,
000 kw.

The main objective of the bill is to prevent laundering of

proportions, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Left party members objected to the introduction of the
bill, saying some of its provisions would enable the foreign

<HEADLINE> No Timetable for Democracy Restoration Received: Axworthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A four-member Commonwealth
delegation received certain benchmarks but not a specific time
frame for the restoration of democracy in Pakistan, head of the
delegation Lloyd Axworthy said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while addressing a press conference along
with Foreign Minister of Ghana Victor Gbeho, Deputy Prime Minister
of Barbados Billie A. Miller and Special Envoy of the Malaysian
Prime Minister Tan Sri Dato Musa bin Hitam at the end of their
two-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
On his meeting with Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervaiz
Musharraf, Axworthy said the latter did not commit himself to a
specific time frame for the restoration of democracy.
</P>
<P>
"We did receive a commitment from him to achieving certain
benchmarks of progress, including the reform of electoral
processes and the establishment of a fully independent electoral
commission and, as an immediate priority, the creation of
functioning and elected structures of local governments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth delegation arrived here late Wednesday night
to assess the political situation after the change of government
here on October 12.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said they were leaving Pakistan "with deeper
understanding of recent events and of the hopes and aspirations of
the people of Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
"We have made certain assessment, we will take its findings
back," he said.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Axworthy said that after having strings
of meetings with both the opposition and a cross-section of the
people, their sense was that "all asked for restoration of
democracy."
</P>
<P>
"We sense that there is a strongly-felt desire for change in
Pakistan," he said, adding, "We have found no wish for another
protracted period of military rule, rather a resolve to lay the
foundations of genuine participatory democracy, embracing all the
peoples and regions of Pakistan."

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi beat Andrei Pavel 6-
2, 6-1 Friday to enter the semifinals of the Eurocard Open in
Stuttgart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked American used only 54 minutes for the match and
declared himself to be in the shape of his career.
</P>
<P>
Pavel, a wild card entry from Romania who is ranked No. 50 in
the world, never had a chance against Agassi, who used the full
range of his shots to gain a quick victory.
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing some of the best tennis of my career right now,"
Agassi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Agassi has been having the season of his life. He won two Grand
Slam titles, at Roland Garros and at the U.S. Open. His French
Open victory made him only the fifth player in history to win all
four Grand Slam events.
</P>
<P>
He also reached the Wimbledon final and won two other
tournaments, catapulting back to No. 1 in the world after falling
as low as No. 141.
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf, who began dating Agassi after his victory at the U.
S. Open last month, again watched the match alongside Agassi's
coach Brad Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the romance was having any influence on his tennis,
Agassi replied: "I'm at a point in my life where tennis has no
influence on my private life and vice versa."
</P>
<P>
Agassi's semifinal opponent in the indoor event will be the
winner of the quarterfinal pitting Marcelo Rios against Thomas
Enqvist.

<HEADLINE> Outstanding Women Gather In Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 government and
business leaders from around the world gathered here Friday to
exchange views on how women in business can make an important
difference in their work environment and society at large.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the participants of the conference, jointly
organized by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham)
and the International Women's Forum (IWF), Hong Kong, were women,
with only a few men.
</P>
<P>
During the half-day conference entitled "Women in Leadership:
Building Tomorrow's Leaders," the participants discussed the
challenges and opportunities for growth for women and their
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Making a keynote speech at the conference, IWF member Barbara
Franklin, who was a former U.S. secretary of commerce and now
president and chief executive officer of Barbara Franklin
Enterprises, said women in business have changed the traditional
management style of "command and control."
</P>
<P>
"Women do have some special qualities to offer to leadership:
caring, sympathy, intuition, creativity of getting around
obstacles," Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
Women can help inspire people who work with them and that means
everybody's happy and becomes more productive, she added.
</P>
<P>
During her speech entitled "Women as Leaders: Leadership Styles
and Opportunities for the New Millennium," Franklin said that in
the last 25 years, there have been more women in positions of
leadership in the areas of arts, education, television, sports and
government and they have proved their capability.

"In the area of business we need the perspectives of both
genders to make the best possible decision," she said.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest obstacles women may meet is that some men
don't see women as capable of being leaders, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers at the conference included Amy Chan, executive
director of the Hong Kong Tourist Association; Ann On, film
director; and Priscilla Chung, director of the Equal Opportunities
Commission of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two men speakers at the conference were Charles Dull, head
of the Hong Kong International School and Stephen Tsui, managing
director of Nortel Networks.
</P>
<P>
Laura Cha, deputy chairman and executive director of the Hong
Kong Securities and Futures Commission, who is also a member of
IWF, delivered a luncheon address.
</P>
<P>
She said the major challenges to be met by women leaders
include how to balance their families and their careers, how to be
accepted by their male colleagues and how to motivate their male
subordinates.
</P>
<P>
The IWF, founded in 1982 in the United States, is an
organization of preeminent women of significant and diverse
achievement.
</P>
<P>
The IWF Hong Kong, with a current membership of 40, was
established in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to C. C. Wan, president of the IWF HK, members are
invited to the organization according to some standard, which
basically is that the candidates have to be the top leaders of
their areas and well-recognized.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's Administrative
Secretary Anson Chan is a member of the IWF Hong Kong and is very
supportive to the organization, Wan said. Other members include
entrepreneurs, designers, professors, lawyers, bankers and artists.
They often gather together to exchange experience and views as a
way to support and encourage one another.

<HEADLINE> HK Exchange Fund Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (KHMA) announced Friday that the total assets of the
Exchange Fund amounted to 945.4 billion HK dollars (121.2 billion
U.S. dollars) as at September 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
This was 7.6 billion HK dollars (974.36 million U.S. dollars)
lower than at end-August 1999. Foreign currency assets increased
by 12.5 billion HK dollars (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) while Hong
Kong dollar assets decreased by 20.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.
57 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decrease in Hong Kong dollar assets was due largely to the
change in the market value of Hong Kong equities held by the
Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
Figures in the Currency Board Account show that the Monetary
Base at end-September was 200.8 billion Hong Kong dollars (25.7
billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 4.2 billion Hong Kong
dollars (538.5 million U.S. dollars), or 2.14 percent, from end-
August 1999. The increase was primarily due to an increase in
Certificates of Indebtedness.
</P>
<P>
The backing assets increased by 4.7 billion Hong Kong dollars (
602.56 million U.S. dollars), or 2.16 percent, to 222.2 billion
Hong Kong dollars (28.5 billion U.S. dollars). The slightly larger
increase in backing assets over that of the Monetary Base was
mainly attributable to income from investment and revaluation
gains.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economic Rate Sure to Top 7 Percent, Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China's economic growth rate
will top seven percent year, judging from the favorable domestic
and international factors, said Chinese economist Hu Biliang.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's gross domestic product for the first
three quarters rose 7.4 percent, a slight drop from the same
period last year, but in a crucial year of readjustment in
economic structures, the rate is commendable.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that this year's annual growth rate could reach 7.2
percent, citing the current status of the economic performance and
the sound implementation of policies during the nine months.
</P>
<P>
The economy has kept developing at a high speed because of a
number of stimulating forces, which include raising salaries and
welfare handouts, as well as charging tax on savings interest.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, the appreciation of the Japanese yen, the
recovery of the economy of Japan and the whole Asia will benefit
China's export, he said.
</P>
<P>
The acceleration of the European economy and the improvement of
the Sino-U.S. relationship will also attract more overseas
investors to China, Hu said.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Courts Play Bigger Role in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The popularity of the
Islamic courts has rocketed in chaotic Somalia following crackdown
on bandits and illegal roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
Large demonstrations were held Friday in port town of Merca,
120 Km south of the capital, in support for the islamic courts.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Dahir Hassan Gutaleh, deputy chairman of the Sharia
implementation council, told the crowd that they had no political
agenda, but just to create a safe environment for the common
people to conduct their usual businesses.
</P>
<P>
A eyewitness in the town said he felt that there's nothing
worse than lawlessness. According to eyewitnesses in Merca
town, hundreds of militiamen from the Islamic courts, all in green
uniforms and tarnished scarves round their neck and head,
strengthened their positions around the port and the police
station of the town.
</P>
<P>
The Islamist militiamen have further spread their influence and
power to some of the neighboring districts and villages so as to
consolidate their presence in Lower Shabelle region where over 36
illegal roadblocks which hindered the business activities have
been washed away.
</P>
<P>
While the Islamic courts in South Mogadishu are effectively
dealing with the insecurity along the roads between Mogadishu and
the southern regions, the sixth Islamic court in South Mogadishu
was founded by the Sheikhal clan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than six battle wagons and 90 trained militiamen have been
donated to the new Islamic institution by its sympathizers as the
first round of contribution.
</P>
<P>
During its inauguration attended by more than 600 guests from
the other Islamic courts, Sheikh Nur Ali Osman, its chairman, said
his men would apply the security building measures taken by the
sister courts in both sides of the capital.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Dismisses Rumors of Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada dismissed Friday rumors that his reported drop in
popularity may trigger massive unrest and pave the way for a coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
The president and commander-in-chief said he has faith in the
professionalism of the police and the military. He stressed that
the economy is now on the path to recovery, hence there is no
reason for soldiers to attempt to grab power.
</P>
<P>
"I still have confidence in our military and they are taken
care of. I believe in the professionalism of our police and
military officers," he said in a forum sponsored by the Foreign
Correspondents Association of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also dismissed speculations that there would be a
situation similar to Armenia, where gunmen killed eight top
government officials, including the prime minister, because of
their alleged dissatisfaction with the government.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the Philippine economy has been
showing positive signs of growth despite the financial burdens he
inherited when he assumed office on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
It is finding sources of additional funds for pro-poor projects
and not fears of a coup that remains his biggest worry, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Reports of the president's falling popularity in the past weeks
have triggered reports that a coup may be hatched against him.
</P>
<P>
For his part, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said
the two elements of a coup, deep dissatisfaction by the military
and "real" socio-political instability, are not present under
President Estrada's watch.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Aguirre said the police and military are
very professional now while the Philippines is a politically
stable country.

<HEADLINE> China's New SOE Policy Will Pay Off: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Herbert L. W. Hui, a Hong Kong
investment analyst with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Co.,
Ltd (HKSB) said recently in Shanghai that China's newly announced
vigorous policies on the reform of state-owned enterprises (SOE)
will further enliven the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
He said that measures such as offering financial support to
SOEs and establishing new distribution systems for SOE operators
will pay off in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Hui, who is in charge of HKSB business in China, is optimistic
about the revival of China's SOEs in many fields. The areas of
communications and hi-tech are welcomed by investors, said the
expert, and SOEs getting into these fields will have good
opportunities for development.
</P>
<P>
He also said that when reforms are carried out to encourage the
participation of enterprises, the fields of infrastructure
construction and public utility also have room for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Hui believes that China's real estate market also has a bright
future. He said HKSB has helped a Hong Kong company assemble 1.4
billion U.S. dollars for investment in the real estate in the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Talking of China's enterprises facing the world's capital
market, he suggested that SOEs should first become recognized in
China's capital market. He believes that if an enterprise is not
welcomed in its local market then it will hardly be welcomed
internationally. "Almost any Chinese or Asian company can find an
investor in China or Asia, but few can find one in other parts of
the world," Hui said.

JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel deported 11 American
Christians Friday in a stepped-up campaign against foreign
Christian apocalyptic sects which are said to create violence in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The 11 Americans were expelled on an overnight flight to New
York, hours after two Britons were put on a flight for London
Thursday, the police said.
</P>
<P>
The 13 deportees were among the 21 people rounded up by Israeli
police Monday in their quarters on Jerusalem's Mount of
Olives. They were members of two Christian groups, the "Temple
Group" and "House of Prayer."
</P>
<P>
Police suspected these people of making preparations for
apocalyptic groups to come to Mount of Olives, where tradition
says Jesus will first arrive in the Second Coming, and planning
provocative acts to facilitate the Coming.
</P>
<P>
Eleven of those detained had appealed their deportation to the
Interior Ministry, but Interior Minister Natan Sharansky rejected
the appeals after consulting with the police and other involved
parties.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli police has information that the deportees pose a
threat to public order," said the Interior Ministry in a statement
issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time in a year that Israel deported
Christian doomsday groups suspected of planning violence or mass
suicide in Jerusalem, the city holy to Christians as well as to
Jews and Muslims, in order to hasten the Second Coming.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, Israel expelled 14 members of a
Denver-based doomsday cult, the Concerned Christians. Earlier this
month, 25 Irish and Romanian members of another Christian group,
which Israeli police called "an extreme Christian cult," were
deported.

<HEADLINE> New Center In Southern China To Help Cosmetics Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A cosmetics and jewelry center
is scheduled to open in May of next year in the southern city of
Guangzhou and is expected to give overseas investors greater
access to the promising Chinese cosmetic market.
</P>
<P>
The Chong-yue International Cosmetics and Ornaments Commerce
Center was approved by the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce, with backing from Chong-yue International Cosmetics and
Ornaments Commerce Trade Center Co. Ltd., a State-level enterprise.
</P>
<P>
It will have 27,000 sq.m. of floor space and a 8,587 sq.m.
business area with 540 booths. It is designed to be a distribution
and information center for the Chinese cosmetics industry.
</P>
<P>
Overseas cosmetics companies have made tentative efforts to
enter the Chinese market in recent years, but their Chinese
operations are still less than 15 percent of their investments
elsewhere, according to Huang Shudong, the general manager of the
company.
</P>
<P>
With improvements in the standard of living, Chinese consumer
demand for cosmetics has increased 25 to 30 percent annually in
recent years. It is estimated that total sales of cosmetics in
China will reach 30 billion yuan (3.6 billion U.S. dollars) next
year and, by 2010, the figure is expected to reach 80 billion yuan,
making China the world's third largest market after the U.S. and
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Future Legislature to Ensure Sound Work in Macao SAR (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The president of the First
Legislative Council of the future Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) said here Friday that the future legislature will not
confront the SAR government because both are obliged to serve
local residents.
</P>
<P>
"Difference does not always lead to confrontation, for both the
legislature and government of the Macao SAR have the
responsibility of working for the overall interests of the Macao
people," said Susana Chou, who was chosen president of the SAR's
legislature half a month ago.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks on the occasion of the 50-day countdown to
Macao's return to the motherland on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Chou noted that it is the right and responsibility of the
Legislative Council to oversee the work of the SAR government.
However, "both will be supervised by the masses of the people and
personal views must be based on public opinion," she said.
</P>
<P>
It is important that the two make concerted efforts to ensure
the smooth implementation of the Macao Basic Law and the principle
of "one country, two systems," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the differences between the current Legislative
Assembly of Macao now under Portuguese rule and the First
Legislative Council of the Macao SAR, Chou said the two
legislatures operate on different bases.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the current legislature is based on the
Organizational Constitution of Macao worked out according to the
Constitution of Portugal, but the work of the SAR legislature will
conform with the Macao Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the First Legislative Council of the Macao SAR
will be the only organ in the SAR to enact laws. The chief
executive of the SAR can only issue decrees and administrative
regulations.

<TEXT>
<P>
At present, both the governor of Macao and the Legislative
Assembly have the power of legislation.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the Macao SAR drawing near, the First
Legislative Council has to make necessary legal preparations, said
Chou, who has been a legislator in Macao for nearly 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"I can say that I'm familiar with legislative matters, but I
shall not rest on my past experience. Every lawmaker of the SAR
should understand that he or she is inexperienced in the Macao SAR
which will be ruled by the Macao Basic Law," she said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Legislative Council held a plenary meeting to
work out a regulation on the rules of procedure of the legislative
body. Chou used the native Cantonese (the local Chinese dialect)
to preside over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It marks a new era in the history of Macao, and bears great
significance, as 97 percent of local residents are Chinese," she
said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Chou noted that legislation in Chinese will be
one of the major tasks of the future Legislative Council. Almost
all laws passed by the current Legislative Assembly was drafted in
Portuguese and the Chinese versions are usually rather poor.
</P>
<P>
"The Legislative Council will strive to work out laws in both
Chinese and Portuguese and some original laws shall be translated
more fluently so that ordinary residents can read and understand
them," the veteran lawmaker said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Tables Special Finance Scheme For Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Friday announced a
proposal to double the ceiling of the guarantee granted under the
Special Finance Scheme for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to
5 billion HK dollars (641 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Despite the much improved liquidity position of the banks,
many SMEs still face great difficulty in obtaining financing," a
Trade and Industry Bureau spokesman said, adding that doubling of
the guarantee ceiling will help more SMEs in obtaining loans from
lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the underlying principles and the main
features of the scheme would remain. For example, the maximum
government guarantee for each SME will remain at 2 million HK
dollars (256,000 million U.S. dollars) and the maximum risk that
the government will bear in a loan will continue to be 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the increase in the total guarantee amount, the
spokesman said, there will be a corresponding increase in the
guarantee ceiling for individual participating lending
institutions from 200 million HK dollars (25.6 million U.S.
dollars) to 400 million HK dollars (51.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government will also revoke the deposit option, under which
licensed banks may demand an amount of deposit equivalent to that
of the guarantee, since the liquidity problem of banks has much
improved and the demand for deposit has remained at a very low
level.
</P>
<P>
"The scheme is only a short-term measure," the spokesman
explained, adding that "for the longer term, taking into account
relevant factors such as the recovery of the economy and SMEs'
financing situation in general, the government intends to
terminate the scheme when circumstances permit."
</P>
<P>
The government intends to seek the approval of the Finance
Committee of the Legislative Council for the revisions as soon as
possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
The special finance scheme was one of the economic relief
measures announced in June 1998, with a view to easing the then
liquidity crunch faced by SMEs.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah, Chief
Executive-designate of the Macao Special Administrative Region (
SAR), pledged Friday that Macao will cement economic and trade
ties with the mainland after its return to China in 52 days.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a group of journalists from China's national and local
media, Ho said the Macao SAR will make optimal use of its
traditional ties with Portugal as well as the entire Europe to
serve as a bridge between China and European countries.
</P>
<P>
Answering a reporter's question, Ho said Macao has great
potentials in developing cooperation with Beijing in the areas
such as economic and trade, cultural exchange, tourism and
education.
</P>
<P>
As a city which blends Chinese and western cultures, Macao will
expand cooperation with the rest of China so that it can work for
expanding connections between the Chinese mainland and western
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the future SAR government will take advantage
of its return to China from Portuguese rule to boost its economic
development, with the focus on tourism.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the local people's high expectation of a marked
improvement in Macao's economic performance after its return to
the motherland on December 20, the chief executive-designate said
Macao has seen sluggish economic development for a few successive
years. The future SAR government will surely strive for a better
economic performance. "But no government can bring about a drastic
change to Macao's economy overnight," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Embassy Crisis Strains Thai-Myanmar Ties (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Thai-Myanmar relations have
been strained since five Myanmar gunmen took over the Myanmar
Embassy in Bangkok early this month.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, five Myanmar gunmen stormed their country's
embassy in Bangkok and held 89 people hostage for 25 hours.
</P>
<P>
The siege ended peacefully with the gunmen flown by the Thai
side to the border and allowed to go free.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Myanmar government was not happy about
the way the hostage-takers were treated and was annoyed by a
senior Thai official's description of the gunmen as fighters for
democracy rather than terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar then closed its border with Thailand and suspended the
fishing rights of Thai fishing vessels in Myanmar waters.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to foreign news agencies, the Myanmar government
said it was still concerned about the future safety of its
diplomats and diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
"Other radical or even non-radical groups may get the wrong
message that such kind of terrorist activities can be conveniently
carried out under the banner of freedom, democracy and human
rights," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar ambassador to Thailand said on October 13 after
meeting with Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan that the
reopening of the border and the normalization of bilateral
relations depended on the arrest and prosecution of the five
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988 some 2,700 anti-government Myanmar students have
exiled themselves to Thailand and about 1,000 of them are living
in the Maneeloy camp 140 kilometers east of Bangkok. The issue of
the exiled students has thus become a sore in the Thai-Myanmar
ties.
</P>
<P>
Last week Thailand said it planned to move an additional 1,700
Myanmar students to the camp while looking for help from third
countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States which
have expressed willingness to accept them.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been unhappy about the way Thailand has been
handling Myanmar's ethnic minority groups and refugees and alleged
that Thailand supports and assists these ethnic groups in opposing
the Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
But these allegations have always been denied by the Thai
government and military.

... denied by the Thai government and military.
</P>
<P>
Thailand said it has always adopted a "constructive engagement
policy" toward Myanmar and rendered strong support for Myanmar's
membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai blocked a trip to Yangon by
General Chetta Thanajaro who planned to ask Myanmar leaders to
reopen the border and lift the ban on Thai trawlers.
</P>
<P>
Chuan told the general to wait for some positive signs from the
Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the prime minister actually wanted the
problem with Myanmar to be handled through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has also been unhappy about some things on the Myanmar
side.
</P>
<P>
Thailand believes that Myanmar is the origin of the influx of
millions of methamphetamine pills and heroin, which is regarded as
threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
It also claims that there are hundreds of thousands of illegal
Myanmar immigrants in Thailand, who represent a heavy social and
economic burden on the country.
</P>
<P>
Besides drug trafficking, territorial disputes are also a
factor which has strained Thai-Myanmar relations.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that more than 5,000 landmines have been laid
along the border by both Myanmar troops and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 300 of these mines have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The Thai prime minister said that there has been no critical
change in the general policies in either country and that it was
normal for the two sides to face some problems sometimes.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share 2,180 kilometers of border and border
trade between them is estimated at tens of billions of baht (one
dollar equals 39 baht) a year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar states along the northern border depend on Thailand for
fuel, construction material, food and other products while Myanmar
waters have for decades been regarded as a goldmine for Thai
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The strained Thai-Myanmar relations have already made the
people of both countries suffer a lot.
</P>
<P>
Thai fishermen claim they are losing about 1 million U.S.
dollars a day as a result of the Myanmar ban and the prices of
daily necessities in the Myanmar border states have been
skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government will surely reopen its border and waters
sooner or later, but it may take a long time and require great
efforts for both sides to remove all the obstacles that hinder the
development of the two countries' relations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator Calls For Management of GM Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese lawmaker today
called for legislation to better supervise genetically-modified (
GM) food, saying that food safety should be guaranteed by law once
the high-tech food makes its appearance in China's marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
"Whether imported or domestically-produced, GM food should be
regulated before it is put into the market and on people's dinner
tables," said Wang Tao, member of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
She suggested that legal measures may include requiring store
owners to register with authorities before selling the food, and
labeling all varieties of GM food.
</P>
<P>
"Since the question of whether the GM food is safe or harmful
to human health remains controversial in the world, we should
strengthen management of the product through law. Legislation
should be a prevention measure," she told a panel of lawmakers who
reviewed a draft of the revised Product Quality Law.
</P>
<P>
Through transferring certain kinds of laboratory-enhanced genes
into a plant or animal, scientists are able to genetically alter
the gene recipient's characteristics, making it more resistant to
disease, able to produce higher crop yields, and containing better
nutritional value.
</P>
<P>
However, worldwide concern, even strong opposition campaigns
have been raised since scientific studies so far cannot assure
that GM technology is safe enough for human health and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Interest in GM food in China has been relatively low-key, even
though the country has reportedly done research in the field since
the 1980s, and some products have been put into commercial
production.
</P>
<P>
In addition to lawmakers, some researchers have publicly called
for timely legislation and strict measures to ensure the safety of
GM food.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Cuts Key Overnight Rate for 21st Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines decided Friday to cut the overnight borrowing rate to
8.75 percent from 9 percent, for the 21st time this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in a statement that the cut will take
effect next Wednesday because of the public holidays next Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the overnight lending rate will
remain at 11 percent "because there was still excess liquidity in
the monetary system."
</P>
<P>
The cut in the borrowing rate is expected to induce banks to
participate more actively in the auction of treasury bills, the
statement said, adding that "with limited volume access in
treasury bills, banks would be prompted to lend to invest excess
liquid funds."
</P>
<P>
Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the central bank, said the cut
would not undermine the country's inflation target since there was
still excess industrial capacity.
</P>
<P>
He also said the cut in the overnight borrowing rate should
have no impact on the peso-dollar rates as treasury bills are good
investment options.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura said earlier that the new overnight rate will most
likely stay until next year, despite a possible hike in the U.S.
interest rates toward the end of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua)-- A new project financed by the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to help strengthen China
's legal aid system was launched here today.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP is scheduled to provide 320,000 U.S. dollars to the
project in an effort to assist the Chinese government in a two-
year training program for legal aid workers at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Leitner, resident representative of UNDP, said at today
's signing ceremony that the Criminal Procedure Law of China
adopted in 1996 stipulates the courts will appoint legal aid
lawyers to defendants who cannot afford the fees of defense
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
Since the law went into effect, legal aid has flourished in
China, she said, noting that there were just 500 legal aid centers
in China six months ago, but now there are more than 800 centers
and 3,000 lawyers are involved in the work.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to attract donations from the
international community and the Chinese government to develop more
pilot legal aid centers, the UNDP official said.
</P>
<P>
Other activities in the project include a series of ten
training workshops over a two-year period, publication of a legal
aid handbook, and creation of a comprehensive, interactive legal
aid website.

<HEADLINE> Overused Bill Causes Infections in Nigeria: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Scientists have
announced that the widespread circulation of overused currency
notes in the country is one of the major sources of infections,
the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Over 86 percent of the currency notes of all denominations have
been found with significant bacteria growth, said a group of
microbiologists and parasitologists from the Lagos University
Teaching Hospital (LUTH) at the second yearly scientific
conference of the Nigerian Infection Control Association (NICA)
being held here.
</P>
<P>
Investigation shows that more than 50 percent of the currency
notes in circulation were contaminated with a single
microorganism, they said, adding that about 33 percent of the
naira notes showed two or more bacteria while only 13.75 percent
were free of microbial contamination.
</P>
<P>
The naira, Nigeria's currency, has become a major transmission
and dissemination "vehicle" for germs including staphylococcus
feacalis, escherichia coli, kle bisella species, pseudomonas
aeruginosa and candida albicans, one of the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
These are germs that could cause various infections such as
food poisoning, boil, diarrhoea, respiratory problem, urinary
tract infection and pneumonia, he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Aquatic Products Output Expected to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite the continuous negative
growth of ocean fishing, China's total aquatic products output
this year is projected to increase some 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Fishery Bureau of the Ministry of
Agriculture predicts that the annual output of aquatic products
will hit about 40 million tons.
</P>
<P>
He said that ocean fishing will basically achieve the goal of "
zero growth" set early this year, or even lower, while the output
of seawater and freshwater aquatic products is expected to rise 7
percent and 5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's statistics indicate that in the first eight months
of the year, the output of aquatic products in the country's major
producing provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions reached
more than 18 million tons, up 5.35 percent over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Of this total, the output of ocean fishing was 7.42 million
tons, dropping 3.28 percent, but the output of seawater and
freshwater aquatic products grew 17.2 percent and 8.4 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
This year, China implemented a "zero growth" plan for its
marine fishing for the first time while expanding the summer
fishing ban to South China Sea, which indicates that the country
no longer simply pursues numerical growth in the aquatic industry.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China will continue to stick to its
strategic goal of "zero growth" in marine fishing to protect
fishery resources and sustain the development of the industry.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Launch National Rebirth Campaign Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will launch its on-going
National Rebirth Campaign abroad as part of its strategies to
shore up the country's image, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
said Thursday through his representative.
</P>
<P>
The president, represented by Onyema Ugochukwu, one of his
senior assistants, said that taking the campaign abroad was
necessary to further encourage growing confidence and respect for
the country and its nationals by individuals and foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Friday quoted
Ugochukwu as saying that Nigeria's image has suffered a series of
damages especially in the last decade due to massive corruption.
</P>
<P>
Rampant corruption and human rights abuses which characterized
the regime of the late General Sani Abacha once resulted in the
ostracizing of the country from international community, according
to Ugochukwu.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the present government has started well in its
task of righting the wrongs of the past.
</P>
<P>
The Obasanjo administration seeks to promote moral values such
as honesty, probity, accountability and industry among the
populace, he said.
</P>
<P>
The special assistant, however, remarked that Nigerians should
not leave the job to the government alone as "we all have a stake
in this democracy, people should make contributions and shun
making exclusive demands to the detriment of the society."
</P>
<P>
He urged Nigerians to support the campaign which, according to
him, was aimed at ushering in a new culture for Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The National Rebirth Campaign was launched several weeks ago by
the Obasanjo administration, the first civil government after
decades of military misrule, with an aim to rid the corruptive
culture out of the West African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance firms have
show strong interest in buying into securities investment fund, a
new investment tool granted to them by the government earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
An announcement today by the Tongsheng Securities Investment
Fund said that 11 insurance firms bought 900 million units of the
fund, out of a total of three billion units.
</P>
<P>
The China Life Insurance Corporation and the Ping'an Insurance
Corporation bought 300 million units each, and the China
Reinsurance Corporation 100 million units. The remaining 200
million units were shared by the New China Life Insurance
Corporation and seven others.
</P>
<P>
Tongsheng is the first securities investment fund to be
invested in by insurance firms after it formally went on offer
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Along with buying into newly issued securities investment funds,
insurance firms also got the green light to buy into such funds on
the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that allowing insurers to invest in the
securities market is of great significance, as it can provide
insurers a new investment channel at a time when the interest rate
is very low.
</P>
<P>
This move will also increase the capital supply in China's
securities market, which needs more institutional investors such
as insurance firms to keep it stable and growing.

<HEADLINE> Location of First Chinese Imperial Capital Determined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese archeologists in
the field have concluded that they have discovered the location of
the capital of China's first dynasty, the Xia (about 2100 B.C.-
1600 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
They believe that the Erlitou Ruins in central China's Henan
Province was the capital of the Xia Dynasty .
</P>
<P>
Du Jinpeng, a research fellow of the Archeological Institute
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said today that he
expected this conclusion to put an end to a 40-year-old
controversy among Chinese archeologists about the location of the
capital of Xia.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the lack of records, much of the history of the first
few Chinese dynasties remains unclear, and a major project has
been launched to try and discover this "missing part" of the
history.
</P>
<P>
The Erlitou Ruins, where the oldest bronze sacrificial vessel
in the world and the oldest imperial palaces in China were
unearthed, was discovered 40 years ago by Chinese archeologist Xu
Xuesheng.
</P>
<P>
Although the ruins is only six km from the Yanshi Ruins, which
has been determined to have been the first capital of the
succeeding Shang Dynasty (about 1600 B.C.-1100 B.C.), they clearly
belong to different cultures.
</P>
<P>
Du said the latest discovery shows that relics of the earliest
Shang Dynasty culture unearthed in the Yanshi Ruins dovetail with
those of the later Xia culture discovered in the Erlitou ruins.
</P>
<P>
In the past four decades, the remains of two imperial
structures, more than 300 tombs, pottery kilns, bronze smelting
furnaces, and bone workshops have been unearthed in Erlitou
village over an area of nine sq km.
</P>
<P>
Based on this discovery, archeologists concluded that China
became a slave society as early as 1900 B.C.
</P>
<P>
Xu Hong, head of the Erlitou task force under the
archaeological institute, said much work needs to be done on the
structure and layout of these relics, since only two percent of it
has been unearthed.
</P>
<P>
"An underground treasure house has yet to be unearthed," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Hails Germany-China Partnership (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A German-China association of industry and commerce will be
established meantime, he said, to promote greater access to the
Chinese market for German small and medium-sized businesses, which
he described as "the very essence of the German economy."
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Schroeder will also address such issues as improving
China's methods of attracting investment, and making joint-
investments aimed at long-term returns, added the ambassador,
stressing that Germany is one of China's largest European trade
and investment partners.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation has seen enormous progress in the areas
of finance, science, technology, education, vocational training,
academic exchanges and environment protection, said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have had frequent exchanges of high-level
visits this year, with a one-day working visit to China by
Chancellor Schroeder in May, and Chinese leaders meeting former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl two months ago in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Friendly and close links between the two countries were
established in 1972, when they forged diplomatic ties, and have
been enhanced since then, reflecting the continuity of the German
government's policy, said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Germany's stance on China's WTO entry, he said,
"Germany sincerely hopes that China will enter the global trade
system at an early date."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Sedan Bodyguards to East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A team of 40 South African
 bodyguards will set off for the East Timorese capital of Dili to
protect independence activist Jose Gusmao, Mail &AMP; Guardian
newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper said the team has been assembled by two
Durban-based security companies -- Empower Loss Control Services
and KZN Security.
</P>
<P>
It said the briefing to the companies apparently came directly
from high- ranking officials in the office of President Thabo
Mbeki after Gusmao approached Mbeki's office for help to protect
himself.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper quoted a senior source inside the
president's office as saying that the approach, which came from
Gusmao's Fretelin movement, was not made to the presidency but to
the African National Congress (ANC) as a fraternal liberation
movement.
</P>
<P>
The source added that individuals who facilitated the process
did so as ANC members rather than as representatives of the South
African government.
</P>
<P>
The source was quoted as saying that Gusmao had taken the
unusual step of approaching his South African comrades for help
because he felt he could not trust bodyguards the Indonesians
might provide, and his own guerrillas lack the necessary
specialist training in VIP protection techniques.
</P>
<P>
The South African contingent is being trained at the Colt
Shooting Range in northern KwaZulu-Natal, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
ANC spokesman Smuts Ngonyama denied any knowledge of the
party's involvement in procuring bodyguards, but did not rule out
the possibility that individual ANC members could have been
involved, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao first met former South African president Nelson Mandela
in 1997 and since then the two have been in regular contact. Also
in 1997, Mandela was given a special mandate to act on behalf of
the UN to seek solutions to the East Timorese crisis.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao, who was captured in 1992 and sentenced to 20 years in
jail for his fight against the Indonesian occupation of East Timor
in 1975, was released after the independence referendum on August
30.
</P>
<P>
East Timor had been a Portuguese colony before 1975.

Christian Uebershaeer said here today that Germany regards China
as one of its most important partners, and is willing to develop a
partnership oriented toward the new century.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made during an interview highlighting German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's upcoming official visit to China,
his second since assuming office in October 1998.

<P>
Germany and China share a wide range of areas for potential
cooperation, including disarmament, non-proliferation, and solving
regional conflicts, said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China plays
an important role in shaping world order, and the two countries
should seek to expand cooperation in a creative spirit," he said.

<HEADLINE> Innovation Project Promotes System Reform in CAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The pilot work of the state
knowledge innovation project has produced good results in the
structural reform in the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of pilot work for the knowledge
innovation project in June 1998, the structural reform of the CAS
has involved 53 research institutes, 36 of which have undergone
inter-institute adjustment.
</P>
<P>
The CAS has combined mathematics, life sciences and other basic
science institutes into larger organizations to reduce
administrative work and strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In the field of high technology, the CAS has united institutes
and enterprises to form innovation centers for promoting the
industrialization of scientific findings.
</P>
<P>
In the field of resources and the environment, the CAS has
created three innovation centers in Beijing, southwest China and
northwest China, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The academy encourages researchers to establish companies with
their scientific inventions or designates them as leaders of high-
tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The CAS also helped some of the institutes become enterprises
or intermediaries between research organizations and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Software Engineering Center, the Chengdu Institute
of Computing Technology, and the Guangzhou Institute of
Electronics have been listed for this system reform.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Offers Incentives to Explore New Export Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Exports have been a major
concern for Thailand when its economy is clawing back from abyss
of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the cyclical changes in the world electronic market
and weak global consumption demand had led to a slowdown of export
growth in East Asia. Thailand showed a flat growth that year.
</P>
<P>
Even the nearly 40 percent currency devaluation as a result of
the financial crisis failed to prompt an export rise in Thailand
in 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1999, the country's exports recorded a
disappointing performance of about four percent contraction from
the same period last year. A planned export-prompted economic
recovery is apparently in danger.
</P>
<P>
In wake of this, the Thai government introduced measures to
tackle the problem. The so-called Emerging Market Export Promotion
Scheme is one of the most Important measures taken by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the scheme is to encourage Thai exporters
to venture into new markets where the government believed to have
great potential.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commerce Minister Goanpot Asvinvichit said that in the
past 10 years, the ratio of the export to the so-called "old
market," such as Japan, the United States, the European Union to
the export to "new markets," such as the Middle East, the East
Europe and Latin America, is surprisingly unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"This phenomena causes an unhealthy situation to our export,
since its performance will rely mostly on those existing markets,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, Thai exporters who venture into new potential
markets will receive financial, market and tax incentives from the
government.
</P>
<P>
For financial incentives, the International Trade Promotion
Fund Committee has approved a 750-million-baht (19.2 million U.S.
dollars) fund to speed up and expand exports in the new potential
markets within the five years starting from 1999.
</P>
<P>
The approved fund of 150 million baht (3.8 million dollars)
annually will be provided to the Export-Import Bank of Thailand to
reimburse five percent of the loan's interest to the exporters who
can increase their exports to the selected new markets or export
to these new market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
As for the market measure, the Commerce Ministry has
established the Export Promotion Center to assist exporters to
access new markets and to support them with some expenses such as
accommodation, sample shipping, non-English interpreter hiring,
local transportation and booth renting.
</P>
<P>
The center will also provide information concerning how to
access the new markets.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Export Credit Cooperation Center has also been
established to cooperate with other concerned authorities such as
the Bank of Thailand, the EXIM Bank, the Ministry of Finance to
solve liquidity problem for Thai exporters, especially small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
For the tax incentives, the Finance Ministry has agreed in
principle that the expense incurred from the export promotion
activities in the new markets will be allowed for double deduction
from the revenue tax payment.
</P>
<P>
Goanpot said that in the three months since the launching of
the scheme in March, 216 companies had applied for the marketing
expense incentives, and 93 projects of 70 companies had been
approved.
</P>
<P>
Most of the approved projects are targeted for the Middle East
and neighboring countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the scheme not only serves as a short-term
incentive to boost the country exports in order to achieve a quick
economic recovery, but also is important to the long-term
readjustment of the structure of Thailand's exports.
</P>
<P>
The diversification of export markets may reduce the country's
dependence on certain economies, such as Japan and the United
States, thus making Thailand safer from the risks that may incur
from the turbulence in those countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the export-stimulating scheme and other measures such
as  the tax reduction of import duty of raw materials under the
government's August 10 stimulus package, the country's exports
have shown strong signals of recovery.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline in the first quarter, Thailand's exports
reached 42.34 billion U.S. dollars in the first nine months of
this year, or a 6.5 percent increase from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
To achieve a four-percent growth target to 56.6 billion
dollars, the country needs to export 14.26 billion dollars in the
last quarter or about 4.7 billion dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
With the seasonal order at the end of the year and a weaker
baht, Thailand's export reached 4.9 billion dollars on average
each month in the fourth quarter of this year, making the
14.26-billion-dollar export target well within the "achievable
range," Goanpot said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows Not to Grant Independence to Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Friday that there is no way the Philippine government
will grant independence to Muslim Mindanao just as Muslim
Indonesia did with Christian-dominated East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told a meeting that there is no comparison between
Indonesia's East Timor and the Philippines' Mindanao, adding that
the histories of the two areas are entirely different.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that unlike East Timor, which was a Portuguese
colony before the Indonesians came in, Mindanao has always been a
part of the Philippines even when the country was occupied by the
Japanese and the Americans.
</P>
<P>
"I would say it is not comparable. East Timor was never a part
of Indonesia and Mindanao is always part of the Philippines," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada stressed that the government has undertaken all efforts
to forge peace with separatist groups in Mindanao, which he wants
transformed into the country's food basket and regional economic
hub.
</P>
<P>
On October 25, the government opened peace negotiations with
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and has expressed hope
for the success of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has called the MILF to lay down their arms and work
hand in hand instead with the government in pursuing lasting peace
and development in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said total peace in the south is necessary to accelerate its
economic development, which has been stalled by peace and order
problems and decades of official neglect by previous
administrations.
</P>
<P>
The government forged a peace agreement in September 1996 with
the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front headed by its
chairman, Nur Misuari, now governor of the Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians
will begin their substantive final status negotiations on November
7, the two sides announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The date was set during the first meeting between the two
negotiators, Palestinian National Authority Information Minister
Yasser Abed Rabbo and Israel's Oded Eran.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing Zoo Denies Video Course Helps Mother Chimps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Zoo today denied
that it has successfully coached a chimp mother on how to feed her
baby by showing video tapes of active chimps in the wild, contrary
to a report that has widely circulated in some domestic and
overseas media.
</P>
<P>
Yao Wenqiong, an official in charge of the zoo's information
office, said the zoo indeed conducted such an experiment in the
spring but "the result was not good and the effort was soon
stopped."
</P>
<P>
The zoo has four chimps, one male, Fifi from Japan, and three
females, Jasmine from Japan, and Anita and Anaker from the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wenlong, who cares for the chimps, said that Jasmine has
had four babies but never fed her children, and neither did Anaker,
who even attacked her baby after delivery.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that in their anxiety to find a way for the chimps to
mother their offspring properly, the zoo decided to show videos of
chimps in the wild.
</P>
<P>
The video was shown for two weeks in April, when Jasmine gave
birth to her baby. But Jasmine still didn't seem to have a clue
how to treat her baby, let alone feed it or caress it.
</P>
<P>
"Jasmine watched the video attentively like a human but after
five or six minutes, she lost her interest and walked away," said
Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Jasmine was born of parents who themselves had lived in
captivity and never experienced the natural gregarious life of
chimps," said Wang. "Nurturing is an instinct but the technical
part has to be learned later in actual life. (We have to admit
that) Jasmine also has maternal love by instinct but she simply
cannot hold her baby in the proper way."
</P>
<P>
Anita had a gregarious life in the Netherlands and takes care
of her own child perfectly. She once virtually stole Anaker's
child two years ago, and held it so tightly that the zoo workers
had to use an anesthetic to free the baby.
</P>
<P>
Both Jasmine and Anaker's babies were eventually fed by the zoo
workers. They had to made milk with milk powder to hand-feed the
babies, which is rather complicated, said Wang.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Open Power Sector to Private Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will
allow private firms to generate power in three cities in the
country as part of its efforts to privatize the National Electric
Power Authority (NEPA), Minister of State for Power and Steel
Alhaji Goje said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Friday quoted Goje
as saying that Mobil Nigeria Unlimited, a private firm, will be
allowed to generate power in Bonny in the Rivers State, Enron in
Lagos and ABB near the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The government would continue to encourage other independent
power producers to generate electricity with gas and other sources
of energy, the minister said when making a tour of NEPA
installations on Wednesday,
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Drops to 4.6 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's unemployment fell to 4.6
percent in September from 4.7 percent in August, marking the first
time in three and half years that the jobless rate dropped for two
consecutive months, the government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate eased to 4.7 percent
in August after staying at a record high 4.9 percent in June and
July.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployment in September stood at 3.17 million,
up 220,000 from September last year but down 30,000 from this past
August, the Management and Coordination Agency said.
</P>
<P>
In September, the unemployment rate for men dropped by 0.1
percent from the preceding month to 4.6 percent, while the
corresponding rate for women increased by 0.1 percent to 4.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The men's rate rose largely because those who were forced out
of jobs as a result of restructuring declined, while the women's
percentage increased mainly because more people left jobs to seek
better positions, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Ministry also announced Friday that the ratio of job
offers to job seekers improved a marginal 0.01 point to 0.47 in
September, meaning that 47 job offers were available for every 100
job seekers.
</P>
<P>
A sign of improvement is appearing in some part of the
employment situation, but as a whole, the employment situation is
still severe as private companies' restructuring programs are
expected to continue, a ministry official said.

<P>
The agreement was reached by South Korean Defense Ministry
official Cha Young-koo and visiting U.S. Army Inspector Michael
Ackerman at their first meeting held here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and South Korean fact-finding teams will collect
information from the U.S. National Archives and Records
Administration, testimonies from witnesses, Korean War veterans
and on-site surveys of the killing ground.
</P>
<P>
They will also evaluate progress of the investigation from time
to time and exchange information and data which are newly obtained
via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the eight-member team headed by Ackerman
went to Nogun-ri in Yongdong County, North Chungchong Province of
South Korea to meet survivors and victims' relatives.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Associated Press, citing declassified U.S.
documents as well as testimonies from U.S. veterans who witnessed
or participated in the killings and from South Korean survivors,
reported that U.S. troops shot dead some 400 South Koreans,
including women and children in 1950 in Nogun-ri as a safeguard
against disguised enemy soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Gardens Should Be Promoted Everywhere: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- With its simple and elegant
style, Chinese gardens should be promoted worldwide to provide a
unique experience to today's modern civilization.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wentao, head of the Suzhou Gardens Bureau in east China's
Jiangsu Province, made this suggestion today at the '99 World
Horticulture Exposition here, which closes in two days.
</P>
<P>
His suggestion echoed the amazement of many foreign experts and
visitors to the classical Chinese gardens on display at the expo.
</P>
<P>
" A fairyland indeed," an official of UNECSO said after
visiting the gardens, " they reflect Chinese wisdom, which
surprises many Europeans."
</P>
<P>
Nancy Peres, general director of Tropiflora of Cuba, said she
wants to invite Chinese gardeners to Cuba to design a large garden
for her country.
</P>
<P>
With a history of 3,000 years, Chinese classical gardens
featuring trees, flowers, ponds and artificial hills present the
harmonious coexistence of man and nature, which experts say is
complementary to Western scientific rationalism.
</P>
<P>
In fact, many Western countries including the United States and
Australia have created Chinese gardens in their parks, drawing
streams of visitors every day.
</P>
<P>
China has contributed to gardening throughout history. Flowers
such as chrysanthemums, peonies, roses and rose bushes all
originated in China and were later introduced to other countries.
</P>
<P>
China also has contributed more than 300 varieties of plum
blossoms and over 3,000 varieties of peonies to the world.
</P>
<P>
Otto Koch, president of the International Association of
Horticulture Producers, said Chinese gardens can provide valuable
inspiration and ideas to Western urban planners.

<HEADLINE> Global Cooperation Needed to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign
participants at the '99 Kunming International Horticulture
Exposition in Yunnan, which closes on Sunday, called for global
cooperation to protect the deteriorating world environment and the
diversity of biological resources.
</P>
<P>
By next year, 50,000 to 60,000 varieties of plants worldwide
will be in danger of extinction, and 4,000 among China's 30,000
varieties will become extinct if no effective measures are taken
to improve the world's environment, warned Lin Wenlan, director of
the Yunnan provincial scientific committee.
</P>
<P>
A visitor from Zimbabwe said the global environment will
further deteriorate if developed countries do not give huge
support to developing countries in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Joyce Stauffer of Denmark noted that protecting nature is the
common responsibility of mankind, and there are no national
boundaries in this task.
</P>
<P>
Ole Phillipso, president of the International Expositions
Bureau, said that although the expo, which opened on May 1, was
unable to help solve all the world's environmental problems, it
did offer some solutions for the coordinated development of nature
and the human race in the future.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's largest developing country, will play an
important role in protecting the global environment in the next
century.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Anti-corruption
Authority which was launched more than half a year ago is now
ready to work, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aaron Ringera, director of the organization, was quoted as
saying that he has been establishing structures in the institution
since he was appointed to head the authority in April.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five investigators and prosecutors including
accountants, auditors and police officers have been hired from the
private and public sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's anti-corruption efforts have been seen as a major step
to meet the International Monetary Fund's conditions for resuming
the suspended 205 million U.S. dollar loans.
</P>
<P>
Ringera revealed that a report by seven of the investigators on
corrupt deals had been submitted to the authority and those found
guilty would be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
"Grand corruption has an effect on our economy. If we expect to
create jobs, then we have to tackle this type of corruption
seriously," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ringera said that the authority would investigate into systems
instead of individuals for what causes rampant corruption.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Deficit Budge for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia announced Friday
the year 2000 Budget which shows a deficit of 12.97 billion
ringgit (about 3.413 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for 4.4
percent of the gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
The budge presented in Parliament by First Finance Minister
Daim Zainuddin totaled 78.03 billion ringgit (about 20.534 billion
dollars), a 19 percent increase over the original estimate for
this year.
</P>
<P>
Out of this, 53.35 billion ringgit (about 14.039 billion
dollars) is for operating expenditure and 24.67 billion ringgit
(about 6.492 billion dollars) for development.
</P>
<P>
Though the 2000 Budget is in deficit, but the deficit is
smaller than the deficit of 16.6 billion ringgit (about 4.368
billion dollars) or about 6 percent of the GNP this year.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budge, Daim said the 2000 budget strategies are
to sustain recovery and accelerate growth, to strengthen
resilience and competitiveness, to utilize the services sector to
stimulate growth, to strengthen the agricultural sector, human
resource development, especially skills and knowledge, and to
continue the social agenda and preserve the environment.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will set up a think tank to formulate
long-term strategies
</P>
<P>
Daim announced a number of incentives benefiting the public
that include: personal income tax to be reduced by one percentage
point, basic salary increase for government employees by 10
percent from January, 2000, government employees to receive one
month's bonus with a minimum of 1,000 ringgit (about 260 U.S.
dollars), housing allowance for lower income government servants
up 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other incentives also include: import duties reduced on 305
products to between 0-20 percent from 5-30 percent, unit trusts
sponsored by the federal and state governments to be given company
income tax exemption for years of assessment 2000 and 2001,
government to set up 300 million ringgit (about 78.947 million
dollars) in entrepreneur rehabilitation fund II to assist small
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Under the budge, 5.33 billion ringgit (about 1.4 billion
dollars) will be spent on infrastructure development with priority
given to construction, upgrading and improvement of roads and
highways.
</P>
<P>
Poverty level is expected to decline to 5.5 percent or 276,000
families by the year 2000 from credit assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to set up community colleges in every
parliamentary constituency where it is feasible to provide more
opportunities for post-secondary education.
</P>
<P>
Daim said Malaysia is poised to reach greater heights into the
new millennium judging from the economic recovery which is
increasingly evident.
</P>
<P>
"We are more confident that we can achieve even greater
success," he said, adding however, against the backdrop of an
improving economy and sustainable growth expected next year, the
nation must be vigilant and be prepared to face challenges from
within and externally.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy was forecast to grow by 4.3 percent this
year and 5.0 percent in 2000 against a contraction of 7.5 percent
last year.

JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's budget
deficit is expected to fall below 2.8 percent, a substantial drop
from 3.5 percent projected earlier this year, Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
This drop, plus higher-than-expected revenues, means that the

and beyond, he said while addressing the parliament.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Official Warns Against Land Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Uncontrolled drilling of
boreholes in Kenya's Indian Ocean port Mombasa could easily lead
to parts of the city sinking, a provincial official has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation Friday quoted Coast Provincial Water Officer
Lojomoa Biwott as saying that although government regulations
stipulate boreholes be drilled 800 meters apart, some Mombasa
residents have dug with a density of a borehole per 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
He said though there was no evidence that sinking would occur
soon, the awareness campaign is imperative and urgent.
</P>
<P>
Biwott noted that some parts of the Philippines and the United
States had sunk as a result of overuse of water and this would
happen in Mombasa if the trend went unchecked.
</P>
<P>
Official records showed that there were only 49 boreholes but a
survey revealed that there were at least 266 in the port city,
according to Biwott.
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, Mombasa can afford to have only 65
boreholes,
</P>
<P>
but many people have resorted to drilling more boreholes because
of an acute water shortage over the years.
</P>
<P>
Mombasa was getting a supply of about 120 million liters of
water daily, but the demand was nearly 200 million liters a day,
Biwott said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy to Grow 4.3 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy was
expected to grow 4.3 percent this year, confirming its strong
recovery from the deep 1997-1998 recession, the Treasury said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The economy has been strengthening since the beginning of this
year and real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was expected to
accelerate to an average annual growth rate of 7.2 percent in the
second half of 1999 against a 1.4 percent growth in the first half
of the year, according to the 1999/2000 Economic Report released
here Friday by the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The report said that price stability would continue to be the
hallmark of the economy with the consumer price index (CPI) for
both this year and next estimated at 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in the current account position of the balance of
payment (BOP) was estimated at 42.0 billion ringgit (about 11.052
billion U.S. dollars) against 36.8 billion ringgit (about 9.684
billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The low inflation rate and the large surplus resource position
would allow further demand stimulus measures to be taken to
sustain the recovery process, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the employment opportunities should continue to
improve, with the number of people employed increasing by 2.1
percent to 8.92 million.
</P>
<P>
On a sectoral basis, manufacturing, after a 13.7 percent
contraction in 1998, will be able to sustain a growth of 8.9
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector, which contracted by 23 percent last
year, was forecast to continue to contract by 3.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture output was expected to grow at 4.6 percent this
year after contracting by 4.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Public sector expenditure was expected to record a substantial
increase of 13.1 percent this year, while public sector
consumption of goods and services was estimated to increase by
16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, public investment was forecast to increase by 9.9
percent in 1999 to 35.075 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Economy Forecast to Grow 5.0 Pct in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's strong recovery
from the 1997-1998 recession was expected to push its economic
growth to as high as 5.0 percent in the year 2000 after recording
an estimated 4.3 percent growth this year against a contraction of
7.5 percent last year, according to an economic report Friday.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, the growth engine of Malaysia's
economy, which was expected to grow 8.9 percent this year after a
13.7 percent contraction in 1998, will be able to sustain a growth
of 8.0 percent in 2000, the 1999/2000 Economic Report released by
the Treasury here Friday said.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector, which was forecast to have a
contraction of 3.6 percent in 1999 against a contraction of 23
percent last year, is poised to recover to a commendable 5.0
percent growth next year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture output, expected to grow at 4.6 percent this year
after contracting by 4.5 percent in 1998, was forecast to grow at
3.8 percent next year due mainly to a sharp deceleration in the
output growth of the oil palm industry to 4.5 percent from 19.4
percent in 1999, as well as a further 2.0 percent decline in
rubber output, it said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand for goods and services is projected to expand
by a rate of 9.2 percent in 2000 to 251.8 billion ringgit (about
66.263 billion U.S. dollars) in current prices due to the
anticipated turnaround in private sector expenditure, with an
increase of 11.8 percent to 181.4 billion ringgit (about 47.736
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Private consumption was envisaged to increase by 12.6 percent
to 143.5 billion ringgit (about 37.763 billion dollars),
reflecting strengthening of consumer confidence as employment
prospects and disposable income improve, it said.
</P>
<P>
Public sector expenditure was expected to increase further but
at a slower rate of 3.0 percent to 70.4 billion ringgit (about
18.526 billion dollars) after an expected substantial increase of
13.1 percent in 1999, it said.
</P>
<P>
Public sector consumption of goods and services was forecast to
increase by 0.8 percent to 33.5 billion ringgit (about 8.815
billion dollars) after an increase of 16.7 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Public investment was also forecast to increase at a slower
rate of 5.0 percent to 36.9 billion ringgit (about 9.71 billion
dollars) against an estimated increase of 9.9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The price stability would continue to be the hallmark of the
economy with the consumer price index (CPI) for 2000 estimated at
3.0 percent, the same for this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in the current account of the balance of payment
(BOP) was projected to be smaller in 2000 amounting to 35.8
billion ringgit (about 9.421 billion dollars) or 12.1 percent of
gross national product (GNP) against the estimated surplus of 42.0
billion ringgit (about 11.052 billion dollars) for 1999.
</P>
<P>
A further piece of good news on the horizon is that employment
opportunities should continue to improve, it said, adding "given
that the size of the labor force is expected to expand by 2.0
percent to 9.194 million workers, the unemployment rate in 2000 is
forecast at 3.0 percent."
</P>
<P>
It said another encouraging note is that the nation is now more
resilient to potential external shocks and systemic risks
following the recent policy measures initiated by the National
Economic Action Council (NEAC) to strengthen Malaysia's external
reserves position, financial system and the corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
The report said macroeconomic policy would continue to stress
on promoting growth while enhancing the resilience and
competitiveness of the economy but cautioned against downside
risks associated with external developments.

<P>
GENEVA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Organization

increase the overall pace and effectiveness of the return
operation from West Timor to East Timor.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Spokesman on Future of Thai Troops in E.Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The mission of Thai troops in
East Timor as part of the International Peacekeeping Force
(INTERFET) will end on January 15, 2000, a spokesman from the
Supreme Command of Thai Armed Forces said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The termination of the mission of Thai troops in East Timor is
in accordance with the United Nations decision, Major General
Banchon Chavansin, director general of Directorate of Joint Civil
Affairs of the Supreme Command said at a press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
The role of the Thai troops in the territory after East Timor
becomes a transitional government under the United Nations and the
INTERFET moves to become a U.N. peace-keeping force will be
decided after Thailand's consultation with the United Nations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The general, who is also spokesman for Thai troops in East
Timor, said the purpose of the mission is not to fight but to help
the East Timorese people rebuild their homeland.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Thai troops have not fired a single shot in East
Timor and they have been warmly welcomed by local people since
they moved into the former Portuguese territory, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Indonesia's former defense minister and armed
forces chief General Wiranto urged Thailand to join the U.N.
peace-keeping mission in East Timor during his one-day farewell
visit to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, now coordinating minister for political and security
affairs under the newly-elected government of President
Abdurrahman Wahid, said that Indonesia hopes Thai troops would
continue their contribution to the peace and stability in East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who is also defense
minister, said Thailand must consult with the U.N. before making
any decision.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the second largest contributor to the INTERFET. So
far, the multi-national force numbers 10,897, among them 5,554 are
Australians and 1,555 are Thais.

<HEADLINE> Qingdao Striving to Become Int'l Shipping Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The major port city of Qingdao
in east China's Shandong Province aspires to become one of the two
largest international shipping centers in China in the next six
years, along with Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, the port will have gained an annual handling
capacity of 106 million tons, including 3.8 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, the city plans to build nine more
container berths and increase its annual container handling
capacity by one million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
Measures will also be taken to improve other facilities and
promote the growth of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious program will cost at least 1.8 billion yuan, two-
thirds of which will be provided by the State in the form of loans.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao Mayor Wang Jiarui said his city has a rare semi-
enclosed bay with about 70 sq km of deep waters, meeting the
requirements for an international shipping center.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that Qingdao has economic as well as natural
geographic advantages for creating an international shipping
center.
</P>
<P>
Located between the Yangtze River Delta and the Bohai Rim, two
of China's booming economic regions, and near the eastern terminal
of the New Eurasia Continental Bridge, Qingdao has been a major
foreign trade port for all of Asia, especially central, Southeast
and northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The port has ties with more than 450 ports in some 150
countries and regions worldwide, while maintaining business ties
with all major domestic cities.
</P>
<P>
It also has an efficient trans-shipping network, with easy
access to transport arteries such as the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-
Guangzhou and Beijing-Kowloon railway lines.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the port, consisting of 14 docks and 70 berths, has
opened 38 overseas shipping routes, and its annual freight volume
has grown by an average of 30 percent over the past few years to
over 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
It is now the largest ore depot in north China, as well as the
nation's major crude oil depot, and second-largest container
shipping port and fifth-largest coal port.

<HEADLINE> ITC Sees Strong Chances for Food Export from Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Organic food sales could jump
from one percent to over 10 percent of total retail food sales in
major markets over the next few years, said the International
Trade Center (ITC here Friday.
</P>
<P>
World markets for organic food and beverages will offer
developing countries good export opportunities, said the ITC in
its latest study.
</P>
<P>
It said that developing countries produce a wide range of
organic products and many are exporting them successfully. However,
the challenges for suppliers are certification, technical know-how
and market intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Certification is a major issue for all suppliers, no matter
where they are located. Importers, food manufacturers, retail
organizations and consumers need a guarantee of organic origin.
</P>
<P>
Challenges specific to developing countries are lack of
technical know-how, such as on organic farming and production
methods and lack of market information, such as information on
which products to grow, which markets and distribution channels to
choose, competitors, market access and financing possibilities.
</P>
<P>
According to the ITC study, retail sales of organic food and
beverages amounted to 13 billion U.S. dollars in West Europe, the
United States and Japan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Most major markets offer good prospects for suppliers of
organic products that are not produced domestically, such as
coffee, tea, spices, tropical fruits and vegetables and citrus
fruits. These opportunities stem from the simple fact that rapidly
growing demand in most markets cannot be met by local supply, at
least in the short and medium term.

<HEADLINE> 700 Sierra Leonean Rebels Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 700 former fighters of the
rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone have
voluntarily turned in their weapons under the on-going
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament of fighters under the Lome Peace Agreement
signed between the government and rebels in July this year is
being received positively by the ex-combatants, Lieutenant Col.
Chris Olukolade, spokesman for a West African Peace-keeping force
(ECOMOG), was quoted as saying by the Post Express Friday.
</P>
<P>
Olukolade, chief military information officer of the ECOMOG,
told the paper that considering the pace at which the former
fighters are responding to the program, "We may likely conclude
this program within the 60 days period which was stipulated in the
agreement."
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the agreement on disarmament commenced on
October 18 with a ceremony in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone,
and 100 ex- combatants surrendered to the ECOMOG at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman quoted President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah as saying
that former rebel leaders, ECOMOG troops and U.N. observers in
Sierra Leone are actively involved in sensitizing the
ex-combatants towards participating in the program.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "seriousness of those who undertook the
process had been in line with the arrangement by the sub-region to
make the proceedings of the disarmament meeting public."
</P>
<P>
The president urged all combatants still at the rebel
strongholds in the hinterland to take the advantage of the
disarmament program to surrender their arms at the nearest ECOMOG
location in Freetown.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Discuss Chechnya, Karabakh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott met here
Friday to discuss the situation in Russia's Chechnya and joint
efforts to solve the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held inside the Russian Foreign Ministry behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
Talbott told reporters after the meeting that he had conveyed
Washington's concerns over Chechnya, where Russian federal troops
are fighting Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The federal assault on the breakaway republic came after
Chechen rebels twice infiltrated neighboring Dagestan and a series
of terrorist bombings in Moscow and two other Russian cities that
killed some 300 people. Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev and
Khattab, a Jordanian native known only by his last name, have been
accused of masterminding the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said the United States realizes that Russia faces a
very dangerous threat in the form of extremism and terrorism and
that it has the right and duty to protect the state and its
citizens, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Talbott said, Washington hopes that Russia will find
a way to overcome the serious challenge that keeps civilian
casualties to a minimum, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Moscow will use political levers in
its strategy as soon as possible to guarantee stability in the
North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
On Nagorno-Karabakh, Talbott said the shootout Wednesday inside
the Armenian parliament building that killed the country's prime
minister, parliament speaker and several others might harm the
talks on the settlement.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan, has
strained relations between the two former Soviet republics for
about a decade.
</P>
<P>
Both Washington and Moscow agreed that the Karabakh settlement
process must continue, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Chechnya and Karabakh, Ivanov and Talbott, who arrived
in Moscow Thursday evening, also discussed arms control issues
such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Talbott is scheduled to fly to Yerevan later Friday to mourn
the deaths of Armenian Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisyan, Parliament
Speaker Karen Demirchyan and other senior officials, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov did not meet with the press following his talks with
Talbott, but he told a seminar later that Russia is deeply
concerned by some countries' attempts to alter the basic elements
of international law.
</P>
<P>
He said that suggestions about limited sovereignty and
interventions on humanitarian grounds would result in power
politics in international affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami Friday called on the United States to engage in dialogue
with others and abandon "the logic of force and domination."
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the general assembly of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),
Khatami said that the world needs a "radical and profound change"
and a "concrete practice of political morality."
</P>
<P>
"To those who, relying on their economic and military power,
act with arrogance and choose the logic of force and dominance to
achieve their goals, we should advise them to choose the road of
wisdom by engaging in dialogue," said Khatami.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the United States, but refrained
from naming it.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Influence S. Korean Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign stock investors have been
exercising increasing influence over South Korean stock market,
said the Bank of Korea Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a report analyzing stock prices in the past five years from
July 1994 to June 1999, the South Korean central bank found that a
10-percent rise in net inflow of foreign investment fund led to a
2.2 percent hike in price index in four months.
</P>
<P>
A price increase of only 1.1 percent resulted from the 10-
percent net inflow from 1992 when the country opened its stock
market to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
However, records showed that the influence of foreign investors
gradually gained momentum, especially since the nation suffered a
financial crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, net inflow of foreign investment
registered at 1.18 billion U.S. dollars and the benchmark price
index at the Seoul stock market gained 73 points. And in April
this year when net inflow hit 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, the index
jumped 135 points.
</P>
<P>
When foreign investments registered a rise in net outflow in
August this year, the Seoul stock market began to drop.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Vows to Boost Further Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Friday pledged to further promote the growth of Japan's
economy, which is showing signs of improvement, by continuing
flexible fiscal and financial policies.
</P>
<P>
"The economy still remains in a severe situation, but is
continuing to show moderate improvement," Obuchi said in a policy
speech at the opening of the 146th extraordinary Diet (parliament)
session.
</P>
<P>
"What is important now is to guide the economy onto a full-
fledged recovery track, establish a new foundation for development
in the 21st century and achieve a rebirth of the economy," Obuchi
said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi, who has pledged to achieve a 0.5 percent growth in the
fiscal year ending March 31, said his government will work to
boost the economy by compiling a comprehensive stimulus package
totaling more than 10 trillion yen (95.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
As the centerpiece of the package, the Japanese government
plans to submit a second supplementary budget for fiscal 1999 to
the parliament in late November.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Obuchi also apologized for controversial remarks
on nuclear armament made by dismissed Parliamentary Vice Defense
Minister Shingo Nishimura, which drew fire from the ruling and
opposition camps and upset Japan's Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"I apologize from my heart to the people of the nation as one
who appointed him to the post," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nishimura resigned October 20 after coming under heavy
criticism for suggesting that Japan should consider arming itself
with nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi reaffirmed Japan's three non-nuclear principles of not
producing, possessing or allowing nuclear weapons into the country.
"There is no change whatsoever in our policy to adhere to the
three non-nuclear principles," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, the Japanese prime minister underscored his plan
to push bills aimed at creating a safe society during the 48-day
extra session, including those for preventing nuclear disasters
and controlling activities of the AUM Shinrikyo religious cult.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also vowed to make next year's Group of Eight (G-8)
summit in Okinawa Prefecture a success, saying he hopes to issue
at the summit "a strong message that can make people confident
that the 21st century will be a better era for the human race and
the earth."

smuggling campaign in July 1998, the number of smuggled cars
seized by customs offices throughout China dropped from 9,395 in
March to 54 November.
</P>
<P>
Rampant car smuggling in recent years has dealt a severe blow
to China's growing car industry. Between 1984 and 1998, the
country's customs offices seized 27,943 smuggled cars valued at 10
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In September this year a total of 280 cars were imported
through the Customs Office in Shanghai in September, a 237 percent
increase from the same period last year. The customs office
collected 33 million yuan in taxes from the imports of cars.

<HEADLINE> SOE Signs Debt-to-Equity Swaps Agreements with AMCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the first time a state-owned firm signed such
agreements with several debtors. The AMCs and the State
Development Bank will sign similar agreements in the near future
with other qualified firms, noted a government official.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of the agreements was 720 million yuan,
including nearly 500 million of debts being transferred by the
Oriental Assets Management Corporation, 120 million by the State
Development Bank, 88 million by Cinda and 18 million by Huarong.
</P>
<P>
After the swaps, the AMCs and the bank will hold 70 percent of
shares of the firm while the debt ratio of the firm decreases to
45 percent from former 94.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The local government also provided preferential policies for
the firm to strip off non-operational assets and lay off workers.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the firm to earn money this year through
improving efficiency and easing debt burden.
</P>
<P>
The four AMCs were set up this year to deal with bad loans from
the state-owned commercial banks. Through measures such as "debt-
to-equity" swaps, they took the responsibility of protecting state
financial assets from loss.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Oriental noted that the swaps will be
conducive to SOEs and banks as it may promote SOE reform and
improve the quality of bank assets.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Confiscates Contraband Cloves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's special
anti-smuggling unit (KMKM) in Zanzibar Thursday confiscated 123
bags of cloves intended to be smuggled out, the Daily News
newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Bakari Akida, KMKM commander in the Pemba
zone, as saying the netted cloves worth over 30 million Tanzanian
shillings (about 37,500 U.S. dollars) were hidden in thickets near
the seashore, ready to be transported to a neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
The KMKM enhanced its patrols after it was tipped off and
seized the cloves in three separate operations, the commander
said, adding that three suspects in connection with the contraband
were detained.
</P>
<P>
Cloves fetch attractive prices of between 1,500 Tanzanian
shillings (about 1.88 dollars) and 2,000 Tanzanian shillings
(about 2.5 dollars) per kilogram in a neighboring country while
the first grade crop sells at the official price of 600 Tanzanian
shillings (about 0.75 dollar) in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
It is noticed that the clove price at the world commodity
market has sharply increased to 3,000 U.S. dollars per ton from
1,000 U.S. dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar State Trading Corporation (ZSTC) officials said
the dramatic increase of export prices has been caused by low
production worldwide in this season.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar is expected to harvest 10,000 tons of cloves this
season. More than 85 percent of the island's foreign exchange
earnings is derived from this industry.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Shifts Y2K Focus on Helping Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is shifting its
focus of Y2K efforts on making the public ready for possible Y2K
impact on their homes and daily lives by launching a Y2K Home
Guide to be delivered to every home next month.
</P>
<P>
While launching the Y2K Home Guide published by the National
computer Board, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology Alan Chan told a press
conference Friday that the Guide will be mailed to 950,000 homes
in Singapore in November to help residents have a better
understanding of how the Y2K problem will impact the homes and
everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
The Guide is a four-page brochure containing simple,
easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions to help home-owners
check on Y2K-related problems in home appliances and personal
computers (PCs).
</P>
<P>
Besides helping the public conduct self-tests on their home
appliances and PCs, the Guide also aims to answer common public
queries about how they should prepare themselves for the
millennium by presenting important do's and don'ts with regard to
money, travel, utilities and healthcare matters, and things like
when making purchase.
</P>
<P>
Chan noted that "all the essential services that have wide
public usage are well taken care of by the government and they
have been ready since the middle of 1999."
</P>
<P>
"It is important for the public to have access to factual,
accurate and reliable information about Y2K and the launch of the
Singapore Y2K Home Guide is a key activity in the national Y2K
public communication effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chan added that "We believe that most individuals would not be
highly affected by the Y2K problem. In many cases, if the date
feature in a home appliance such as the VCD fails to work, it may
just cause minor inconvenience or frustration to the user."
</P>
<P>
He assured the public that Singapore is Y2K ready and
well-prepared and asked the public "not to let any undue concern
over the Y2K problem get in the way of enjoying themselves during
the historic moment."

<HEADLINE> World-Bank Financed Project At Chinese Nature Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A bio-diversity protection
project with financing from the World Bank's Global Environment
Facility has begun successfully at the Shennongjia State Nature
Reserve in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to build an effective protection
mechanism to protect bio-diversity by getting people living in the
nature reserve involved in the protection scheme. Xie Dengfeng, a
reserve official, says he believes the project, which began three
years ago, has been successful in getting residents to participate.
</P>
<P>
His nature reserve has a set of textbooks to teach science and
practical techniques to local farmers that accord with their
energy needs and it has helped them grow cash crops and build
efficient power facilities to balance production and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
The reserve has a database for bio-diversity information and
clear territorial demarcation and researchers have started
studying the habitat of the golden monkey, which is under state
protection.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Shennongjia, the Environment Facility has funded
bio-diversity protection efforts on the Qinling Mountain Range in
the Northwest, Mount Wuyi in Fujian Province, Poyang Lake in
Jiangxi Province, and Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province. It has
spent a total of 23 million U.S. dollars in China, 18 million
dollars of that in donations. In the Shennongjia Nature Reserve
its spending is estimated at 1.7 million U.S. dollars, 1.3 million
dollars of that in donations. Chinese organizations have raised
about 380,000 U.S. dollars for the project.
</P>
<P>
Shennongjia covers a 70,000-hectare area and is central China's
only primitive forest zone, with 42 types of plants and 70 animal
species under state protection. In 1990, it was included by UNESCO
in the world biosphere preservation zones.

BEIRUT, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed Thursday night in south
Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The militia-man was killed by a roadside bomb when a SLA convoy
was driving on a road near Kafar Hune village inside the Israeli
occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
So far no group has claimed responsibility for the blast, which
raised the number of the SLA members killed in south Lebanon to 20
since the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
to oust Israeli troops and its ally SLA out of the

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Launches Program to Curb Infant Mortality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has launched a national
program to reduce infant mortality, the Daily Star newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The program, jointly sponsored by the Lebanese government and
the U.N. Children's Fund, will conduct a scientific study, the
first of its kind in the Arab world, to provide the necessary data
to forge a national health policy covering childbirth and pre- and
post-natal care.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Health Minister Karam Karam said Thursday at a news
conference that around 3,000 questionnaires will be distributed to
mothers, doctors, nurses and midwives during a 15-day campaign in
November.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of this questionnaire is to determine the health
status of both mother and child, the efficiency of the health-care
system throughout late pregnancy, and relevant social
factors,"Karam said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, also a doctor, said 76 percent of infant deaths
occur within one month after birth, while 46 percent take place
within the first week.
</P>
<P>
He noted that infant mortality rates have dropped from 35
deaths per 1,000 cases in 1990 to 28 deaths per 1,000 cases in
1999.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the infant mortality rate in Lebanon will be
reduced to 2 percent by 2005.

SHIJIAZHUANG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The two-month excavation
of a capital city of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) founded by
Mongolians has scored great breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Expand Victoria Falls International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will invest 52 million
U.S. dollars in expanding the Victoria Falls International Airport
to enable it to accommodate larger aircraft, improve passenger
handling facilities and boost the tourism industry of the area.
</P>
<P>
The work on the project, which represents the single largest
investment in recent years, began Thursday with a ground-breaking
ceremony conducted by Minister of Transport and Energy Enos
Chikowore, the daily Herald reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to construct a four-kilometer long runway
capable of accommodating large aircraft such as Boeing 747-400,
extend and upgrade the existing short runway into a taxi-way,
build a much larger apron to cater for more aircraft and install a
new airfield ground lighting system matched with related
instrument landing systems.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 500,000 passengers use the small international
airport annually, which can accommodate aircraft of the size of a
Boeing 727 or smaller.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed that Victoria Falls should become a tourist
hub for southern Africa. The town has one of the seven natural
wonders of the world, which is the envy of many, the world over,"
Chikowore said.
</P>
<P>
"All we need to do is to provide the requisite facilities and
services at the airport in addition to the hotels and safari
lodges in the area and thus let travellers experience a truly
wonderful experience when they visit the mighty Victoria Falls,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to complete in less than two years.

<P>
HANGZHOU, October 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
reported a year-on-year 10.1 percent rise in its gross domestic
product (GDP) to 352.9 billion yuan during the first three
quarters of the year, according to a news conference held today in
Hangzhou, capital of the province.

<P>
This increase is believed to be due to the favorable
performance of the local industrial sector, with exports keeping

pre-tax profits growing faster than sales.

In 1998, the province ranked fourth in the country with a GDP
of 498 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the 1979-1998 period, Zhejiang saw an annual 13.5
percent rise in its GDP, the largest growth rate in the country.

<HEADLINE> Magic Re-Sign General Manager Gabriel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Orlando Magic general
manager John Gabriel, who helped build the team that reached the
1995 NBA Finals, today was given a four-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel, who has been a member of the Magic organization since
the franchise's inception for the 1989-90 season, was named the
team's general manager in April 1996 after serving as vice
president of basketball operations for over two years.
</P>
<P>
Penny Hardaway was traded to the Phoenix Suns during the
offseason, leaving the Magic without a star and an attraction to
draw fans to Orlando Arena.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway, a four-time All-Star, had three years left on his
contract with Orlando before exercising a clause that made him a
free agent, forcing the sign-and-trade deal. All the Magic
received were forwards Danny Manning, who has been hampered by
injuries during his career, and Pat Garrity, plus a pair of first-
round picks.
</P>
<P>
It was Hardaway and Shaquille O'Neal, who bolted via free
agency to join the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996, who led the Magic
to the Eastern Conference championship four seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway's play during the abbreviated 1999 season allowed the
Magic to finish tied for the best record in the East at 33-17.
However, the Magic were knocked out in the first round of the
playoffs by the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel made several offseason deals en route to stockpiling
nine first-round draft selections over the next five years while
aslo greatly reducing the Magic's payroll, allowing for greater
flexibility in the upcoming season.

WUHAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Golden monkey (rhinopithecus

The breeding center was recently approved by the State Forestry
Administration and construction work has begun in the Shennongjia
Nature Reserve in the western part of Hubei.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhenlin, who does research on the monkeys and has been
studying them for nearly 20 years, says that the center will help

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Asks Ministers to Work Hardly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid called on new ministers and commander of the
Military (TNI) to have a modest and honest attitude, and be able
to do their jobs, know what they have to do, and be acceptable to
the people.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to maintain the trust granted by the local,
foreign, and business sectors," the president said before them
after the swearing-in ceremony at the State Palace here Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cabinet should be maintained until 2004.
</P>
<P>
"Your tasks are hard, as on one side you have to maintain unity
and integrity, and on the other hand you have to follow the rapid
development of economics in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He ordered them to adapt themselves to developments,
particularly because the people want democracy to be the sign of
Indonesian life in the future.
</P>
<P>
Especially to the Attorney General Marzuki Darusman, the head
of state said: "You have to investigate all (involved in some
scandals). Don't be halfhearted (in doing so)."
</P>
<P>
The president called on the ministers and commander of the TNI
to resign from their posts before being processed by the attorney
general if they are found to have acted unfairly.
</P>
<P>
"I remind the ministers and TNI commander that if any of them
is processed by law by the attorney general, it's better for them
to resign," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet consists of three coordinating ministers, 16
ministers leading departments, 13 state ministers, and three
ranking officials whose position is equal to that of ministers.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri swore in the newly
appointed ministers in the National Unity Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in ceremony of the newly appointed State Secretary
Ali Rahman, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman and Commander of the
TNI Adm. Widodo were carried out separately after the ministers.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the swearing in was carried out by the vice
president, Wahid mention two reasons.
</P>
<P>
"First, I can not read. Secondly, to show that the cabinet was
set up collectively by her (Vice President Megawati), I myself,
Chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly Amien Rais, Speaker
of the House Akbar Tandjung, and the then Indonesian Military
Commander Gen. Wiranto," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Urges Restraint on Protesting Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chuan, returned from a visit to Japan early Thursday morning,
said this after learning that police turned their dogs on tapioca
planters Wednesday who tried to break the riot police line
guarding Government House, leaving 14 protesters bitten and 16
police injured.
</P>
<P>
Tapioca farmers demanded the government guarantee the minimum
price for tapioca at 1.2 baht (0.03 U.S. dollar) per kilogram,
much higher than the price of 0.85 baht (0.02 dollar) per kilogram
as proposed by the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the government was tackling the
farmers' problem "realistically", and called on them to be
patient.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said he had tried to promote Thai tapioca during his
visit to Japan. But he added the prices of tapioca products depend
on world market demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has asked Chart Pattana, a coalition
partner, to help negotiate with protesting tapioca farmer amid
suspicion they have the party's backing.
</P>
<P>
Sanan Kachornprasart, the interior minister, said Thursday that
he had sought help from Korn Dabbaransi, the Chart Pattana leader,
because the protest leaders came from Nakhon Ratchasima province,
which is Chart Pattana's strong hold.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the two coalition parties had turned
a little sour after Chart Pattana called on Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda to go public to defend the government's
handling of a bank scandal.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account Surplus to Exceed Original Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
surplus is expected to reach 23 billion U.S. dollars this year, a
revision of its original prediction of 20 billion, the Bank of
Korea said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The country registered a current account surplus of 19.16
billion dollars in the first nine months of this year, which means
that the account surplus target of 20 billion dollars has almost
been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The surplus hit 2.43 billion dollars in September, compared
with 1.41 billion in the preceding month.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank sees that a total current account surplus of
23 billion U.S. dollars is now possible for the year 1999. We
have raised the target by another three billion U.S. dollars,"
said a bank spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the increased surplus to rising exports.
</P>
<P>
"Exports have been rising at a fast pace in recent months,
contributing to the nation's current account surplus," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports reached 11.96 billion dollars in
September, up one billion from August, while imports stood at 9.73
billion dollars, no change from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The level of the current account surplus is largely determined
by the pace of import and export growth. The central bank expects
that the current account gain will remain in a similar range for
the rest of the year.

Thailand would consult the United Nations before making any

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set Up New Lab to Test Processed Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has decided to set up
a new laboratory in six months to test and certify processed food
is free of genetically-modified (GM) organisms, the Bangkok Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new lab, to be established by the Department of Medical
Sciences, will only monitor processed food, while the National
Biotechnological Center laboratory focused on plants and seeds.
</P>
<P>
The plan was in response to increasing calls from food
producers from GM-free certification.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of Department of Medical Sciences Pakdee
Pothisiri said the move will enhance the country's capacity to
protect the consumers.
</P>
<P>
He said only two to three million baht (51,282 to 76,923 U.S.
dollars) will be needed to buy more advanced apparatus for
checking GM contamination since the department was already
equipped and experienced in the testing of vaccines and allergies.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the department would concentrate on testing GM corn,
or maize, as they were major imports.
</P>
<P>
Although there had been no reports of people being allergic to
GM products, with the exception of nut protein, testing for
allergies would be a precautionary priority, Pakdee said.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that there was a need for rationality when
considering the information about the dangers of
genetically-altered organisms.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Security Act to Cause Grave Consequences: Chinese Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Chinese diplomat
warned here Thursday that the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,
which is under deliberations in the U.S. Congress, will cause
serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
"This legislation will bring grave damages to China-U.S.
relations, to regional security, and to the fundamental interests
of the United States," said Liu Xiaoming, minister of the Chinese
Embassy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Liu, in a speech at the University of Maryland, noted that the
act calls for providing advanced offensive weapons to Taiwan as
well as enhancing military-to-military relations between Taiwan
and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, it advocates the restoration of U.S.-
Taiwan military relations to the level of pre-1979," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the act were passed, it would cause serious
damage to China-U.S. relations by undermining the basis of the
relationship and discarding the "One China" policy.
</P>
<P>
"If the act were passed, the United States will no longer treat
Taiwan as part of China but as an American military alliance,"
said Liu. "Furthermore, it would lead China and the United States
to confrontation."
</P>
<P>
It would cause great uncertainty and destabilization in the
region by triggering an arms race and increasing chances of a
military confrontation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese diplomat said the act would also undermine peaceful
efforts for the reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's recalcitrant separatist forces will be further
emboldened by the quantum leap in U.S. arms transfers, and will
become more intransigent and reckless in challenging the One China
principle and moving along a dangerous road," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The act will also make the restoration of cross-strait
relations even more difficult, if not impossible, he warned.

<HEADLINE> NBA Japan Games Features Wolves, Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- For the fifth time this
decade, the NBA will stage regular season games in Japan when the
Minnesota Timberwolves and Sacramento Kings play two games at the
Tokyo Dome on November 6 and November 7.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the NBA became the first American professional sports
league to present regular season games outside of North America
when the Phoenix Suns and the Utah Jazz opened the 1990-91
campaign with two games at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gym.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the NBA has forged a commitment to play in Japan
every two years. Last year's lockout prohibited the NBA from
making its scheduled visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The NBA Japan Games have become a highlight in our calendar,"
said NBA Commissioner David Stern. "Our Japanese fans are among
the most enthusiastic, and we are pleased to continue our
tradition of playing at the Tokyo Dome."
</P>
<P>
The games will be televised globally in over 150 countries and
regions. In Japan, both games will be broadcast nationwide by TBS.

<HEADLINE> China Sends Rescue Team to Help Stranded Korean Climbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua)-- Two experienced alpinists from
China are expected to arrive today in Kada County of the Tibet
Autonomous Region with advanced communication equipment to help
the 18 stranded South Korean mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean mountaineers struggling their way to the
summit of Mt Qomolangma have been stranded in a base camp for
eight days at an altitude of 5,400 meters due to heavy snow,
according to China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Mountaineering Association(CMA) sent an eight-
member rescue team to Tibet shortly after being notified of the
situation by the South Korean Embassy in China on October 20.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers will attempt to reach the Korean climbers before
their fuel and food reserve are exhausted, said Li Zhixin,
president of the CMA.
</P>
<P>
Two of the stranded mountaineers are ill and another victim is
suffering from numbness in the lower body because of a serious
tumble. All three need urgent medical treatment, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The rescue team left for Kada County, the nearest location to
the base camp, on October 23. It usually takes one week to travel
from Kada County, which is at an altitude of about 4,000 meters,
to the base camp.
</P>
<P>
The snow at the base camp is 1.2 meters deep, but fortunately
the snow has stopped and the weather conditions become better, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The ages of the stranded mountaineers range from 24 to 60, and
all are experienced mountain climbers, according to In Jeong-lee,
vice-chairman of the Korean Alpine Club.

BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua)-- China sold 25.32 billion yuan
worth of railway tickets during the first nine months of this year,
up 14.3 percent over the same period last year, according to the
Ministry of Railways.

with special trains for migrant laborers, football fans and
tourists to specifically target various markets. The railways also

QUITO, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Tungurahua Volcano has
been erupting steams, ashes, sulfur and incandescent rocks since
Thursday morning, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The Geophysical Institute of the National Polytechnic Institute

kilometers south of the capital city Quito, in the central
province of Tungurahua, is intense and the emission becomes more

The first explosion came at midnight Wednesday. Rocks, like
tongues of fire, came out of the volcano's mouth after a silence

This phenomenon has attracted many people in Tungurahua
Province to come and watch the scene.

Experts from GINPI, who reported that the energy level of the
volcano has increased, confirmed the possibility of a big eruption.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Badminton Stars to Hang up Rackets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Olympic gold
medalists Susi Susanti and Alan Budikusuma will play on Saturday a
farewell match at the Senayan Tennis Indoor Stadium here.
</P>
<P>
Susi was the Olympics singles gold medalist and 1996 Olympics
bronze medalist in an illustrious career. Her husband Alan won the
men's singles gold in Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Susi said that she decided to say goodbye to badminton, which
has brought her fame and welfare, due to her responsibilities of
her new baby which was born in April.
</P>
<P>
"Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) chairman Subagyo
Hadisiswoyo called me in July asking me about my commitment to
remain as a shuttler or retire. I have considered that I must
retire due to my physical condition and my age," she said.
</P>
<P>
"However, I won't totally turn my back on badminton. I'll still
help PBSI by becoming a consultant or share my experiences with my
younger sisters at the Indonesian Badminton Center in Cipayung,
East Jakarta," she said.
</P>
<P>
Susi is currently coaching five students once a week at a
private hall near her residence in East Jakarta, while Alan is
involved in a family food distribution business.
</P>
<P>
The PBSI official in charge of athlete development M.F. Siregar
acknowledged that none of the current crop of Indonesian players
showed the skills of longtime champion Susi.
</P>
<P>
"I have yet to see any newcomers who have Susi's outstanding
talent. PBSI needs to work harder to search for talented players,"
he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said Susi's retirement should be the wake-up call for
Indonesian sports to seek new talent.
</P>
<P>
"With Susi's farewell match on Saturday, we hope the sports
community will be motivated to develop more champions. Otherwise
our sports world will collapse. Other countries are becoming more
advanced in developing their sports. If we remain indifferent to
our development, we will crash," he said.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said Susi was a true professional in her complete
dedication to her sport.
</P>
<P>
"She became a champion because she wanted to. Her personality,
character and way of life reflected what we call the real
Indonesian sportswoman. If she receives rewards for her world
class achievements, then it's only because she deserves them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
At the farewell party, Susi and Alan will play mixed doubles
against Hermawan Susanto, the Olympics bronze medalist, and his
wife Sarwendah Kusumawardhani, both now retired.
</P>
<P>
Susi and Alan will also auction their rackets to raise funds
for refugees in strife-hit areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Susi carved herself a formidable record during her heyday,
winning the All England four times, the World Cup six times, the
World Championship once, and Grand Prix tournaments six times. Her
peak came at the Olympics in Barcelona, in which she and Alan
contributed unprecedented gold medals for Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka, France Sign Air Traffic Control Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka and France Wednesday
signed an agreement which will facilitate and upgrade Sri Lanka's
air traffic control system, media sources here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the automatic dependence surveillance system,
considered an integral part of the global concept of air traffic
control, will be introduced into Sri Lanka, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sri Lankan Air Traffic Controllers
Association, the Controller-Pilot data link program, a part of air
traffic control, will also be established in the country.
</P>
<P>
These changes will enable Sri Lanka to be in front of modern
air traffic control technology, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At present Sri Lankan air traffic controllers lack
sophisticated equipment to manage Sri Lanka's air space.
</P>
<P>
The modern automation to be introduced here will minimize
controller's verbal communication and help handle positively the
congested and busy air space, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The air traffic controllers regretted that Sri Lanka had not
touched the aviation services in its economic planning. It
regretted more that the Sri Lankan Central Bank had also
restricted its coverage on aviation's contribution to the national
economy, the sources added.

<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged environmental departments at all levels to take effective
measures to ensure the fulfillment of State plans for the
environmental protection sectors.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, minister of the State Environmental Protection
Administration, stressed that the release of pollutants from
industrial enterprises should reach State-set standards across
China by the end of the year, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Heavy-polluting enterprises and those that exceeded State-
determined levels would not get permission to operate next year,
Xie warned.
</P>
<P>
Now only 67 percent of the polluting industrial enterprises
have reached target levels in a recent examination.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the task, legal enforcement should be put on the top
of the agenda, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Xie also called for efforts to improve the public awareness
and participation in environmental protection.

<HEADLINE> Houghton Comes to Crunch Moment in his Chinese Spell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Englishman Bobby Houghton's
coaching career in China came to a critical phase here tonight
when his under-23 charges face off long-time arch rivals South
Korea with a Sydney Olympics berth and his position as the
national manager at stake.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Olympic side will have to sweep away a South Korean
jinx tormenting the country for over a decade to have any hopes of
making next year's Olympic soccer finals as one of the three top
finishers in the Asian zone qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
A historic win--which would be the first one over their
regional old nemesis since a 2-1 victory in an international
friendly in 1986--at the Shanghai Stadium Friday night would put
Houghton back to ground from walking the tightrope since their
opening match loss to South Korea more than twenty days ago, while
any other results could well send him packing after a 22-month
spell in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Football Association (CAF) hired the former
Nottingham Forest manager as head coach of the national and
Olympic sides in January 1998 with a mandate to qualify for the
Olympics and the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
But the Seoul failure on October 3 severely dented the Chinese
qualifying chances and left an open question on Houghton's
capability to guide the senior team to their first ever World Cup
entry.
</P>
<P>
The country's ultra-critical soccer press has begun an earnest
campaign to bring down the Englishman who they accused of being
too much defensively-minded and excessively rigid with his
tactical system and selection policy.
</P>
<P>
"Houghton will have to pay heavily for his stubbornness," the
Chinese Soccer Weekly screamed in its headline.
</P>
<P>
Mass-circulation newspaper Sports Weekly hinted in its front
page article that Houghton's job hinges on the crunch Shanghai
match and only an emphatic triumph would come to his rescue.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, he should be acting like a gentleman and offer his
resignation," it insisted.
</P>
<P>
The CAF seemed to have been satisfied with their Briton choice
whose only talkable achievement with China so far was a bronze
medal in last year's Asian Games until recently, when they became
silent and parried off any questions on this sensitive subject.
</P>
<P>
Houghton himself, at least apparantly, remains high-spirited as
ever, and even called tonight's make-or-break battle as "an
interesting game".
</P>
<P>
"It will be exciting," he said. "We're looking forward to it
with full confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite positive about the result and it's a very good
opportunity for us to top the group."
</P>
<P>
Houghton took over the Chinese side after Qi Wusheng was sacked
following China's failure to reach the World Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
He is the second foreigner to coach the Chinese team. Germany's
Klaus Schlappner was fired in 1993 after the national side failed
to make the World Cup finals in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympics Boss Apologises for Ticket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Olympics Minister
Michael Knight Friday in Sydney issued an extraordinary public
apology in the wake of the Sydney Olympic ticketing crisis,
admitting the organising committee got it wrong.
</P>
<P>
Knight, who is also president of the Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) said consumers would be
able to get a full refund for their third-choice tickets.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG's acting chief executive Jim Sloman said about 26,000
people were issued with third preference tickets on their multiple
order forms and would be entitled to refunds if they asked for
them.
</P>
<P>
Also, anyone who didn't get any of the tickets they wanted but
was charged 15 Australian dollars (9.9 U.S. dollars) for the
commemorative program could get their money back.
</P>
<P>
"I'm here today personally and on behalf of the board to say
sorry and to give a commitment to try to rebuild the confidence
that the community has lost in SOCOG," Knight told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"There were some things done with the ticket offer that were
done poorly," he added.
</P>
<P>
Knight said he was sorry the public had not been informed
sooner about premium ticket packages which have been directed
towards some of Australia's richest people.
</P>
<P>
He said he regretted the SOCOG had not told the public before
they ordered their tickets how many seats were available at each
sporting session.
</P>
<P>
But he denied the SOCOG had ever intentionally set out to
mislead the public.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission (ACCC) Thursday, SOCOG has also agreed to set up a
complaints handling mechanism led by an independent person to
ensure the refund processes proceeds smoothly.
</P>
<P>
ACCC head Allan Fels said he was pleased with the resolution
and that in some cases SOCOG had gone even further than he
recommended to try and regain public confidence.

<HEADLINE> China Boosts Community Service For Aged People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 29 (Xinhua)-- Community service for the aged
is developing steadily in China, providing the elderly and their
families with convenient services at a reasonable rate, an
official with the Association for the Aged said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics released by the association,
China has established more than 160,000 community-run facilities
for senior citizens, including 11,000 day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
This allows a great number of older people to be taken good
care of at the centers during the day when their children are busy
working.
</P>
<P>
"This new service helps the aged enjoy both the best of care
and family happiness, while adding no burden to the government,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has some 300 million households,
nearly one-third of which have elderly members. As estimated 75
percent of the elderly live with their children, and family
support is still the number one way of providing for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
However, with speedy social development, the role of community
service will become more and more important in China, and part of
children's supporting obligations are expected to be taken on by
communities, many experts believe.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Criminal cases involving
violent deaths in Guatemala went down by half in the past four
years, said a Guatemalan government report reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Rodolfo Mendoza said in the report that the
average rate of violent deaths dropped from 32.7 for every 100,000
residents in 1996 to 16.4 in 1999.

1996, which put an end to more than three decades of internal war.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Elliott Banned for One Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Leicester's Scottish defender
Matt Elliott was given a one-match ban by the FA for a "clumsy"
foul on Michael Owen six weeks ago - even though Owen wrote to the
FA defending him.
</P>
<P>
And Leicester manager Martin O'Neill voiced his concern that
the FA had set a dangerous precedent for themselves by bringing
the case to court.
</P>
<P>
Elliott was landed with a misconduct charge after the FA
watched video evidence of his hefty challenge on 19-year-old Owen
during a Premiership game at Filbert Street on September 18.
</P>
<P>
Elliott was not booked for the challenge by referee Uriah
Rennie, who was also given the opportunity to review the incident
on television but refused to acknowledge any mistake on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
And even Owen wrote to the FA in support of his alleged
assailant.
</P>
<P>
Even so Elliott was handed a one-match suspension and ordered
to pay part-costs of a personal hearing and a clearly bewildered O
'Neill said: "I was not sure what to expect. It is a very
interesting case.
</P>
<P>
"But whatever the case it sets some sort of precedent because
there have been four or five previous incidents like this to my
knowledge without players being charged on video evidence.
</P>
<P>
"I have to say that Michael Owen has done well for Matt by
writing to the FA. We appreciate that because it was just what
Neil Lennon did when Alan Shearer was accused of kicking Neil in
the head last season," he said.

LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal midfielder Patrick
Vieira has been handed a six-match ban and a 45,000 fine for his
outburst after his sending off against West Ham.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the harshest penalties handed out by the Football
Association.
</P>
<P>
The punishment was split into two; a four-match suspension and
30,000 for spitting at Hammers defender Neil Ruddock and a two-
match ban and 15,000 fine for abusing a policeman in the players'
tunnel after he left the pitch.
</P>
<P>
The volatile French international, who has been sent of four
times since he arrived at Highbury, was found guilty of two counts
of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The FA studied video evidence of the incidents on October 3 and
also took into account a police report.

Vieira apologized after the incident and Arsenal manager Arsene

Wednesday, said the penalty was too tough.
</P>
<P>
"I think the punishment is very severe and very high
considering there was a lot of provocation and he apologized,"
Wenger said.
</P>
<P>
"We just have to live with the decision and try to get on with
it. It is difficult to avoid this kind of behaviour when you are
sometimes pushed to react, and Patrick is sorry about what he did.
"
</P>
<P>
Wenger said the FA's rules of punishment should "prevail for
everyone" and described Vieira as being "very down."
</P>
<P>
"Patrick is very disappointed. If you consider the financial
side it is the biggest ever punishment in this country." Wenger
said.
</P>
<P>
The record for a single individual fine in English soccer is
the 32,000 pounds penalty imposed on Liverpool's Robbie Fowler in
April for his cocaine-sniffing imitation on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
Vieira's suspension officially starts on November 11, but there
are no matches on Saturday November 13 because of the Euro 2000
play-off tie between Scotland and England.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan King Holds State Banquet for Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Moroccan King Mohammed VI held a
lavish state banquet at the royal palace here Thursday night to
welcome visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
When Jiang arrived at the palace, he was greeted at the
entrance by the King and his brother Prince Moulay Rachid.
</P>
<P>
The King said in his toast that China, which has long history
and nurtured splendid culture, has made remarkable contribution to
the civilization of mankind. Chinese culture and Arabic and
Islamic culture have kept continuous and positive exchange
generation after generation.
</P>
<P>
Peoples of Morocco and China respect and admire each other and
this feeling has been deepened along with time, said the
King. Every Moroccan holds the feeling of gratitude toward
Chinese people for the support they provided when Moroccans
fought for independence and freedom.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made high comment in his toast on Morocco for its
contributions in strengthening South-South cooperation,
establishing just and reasonable new international economic order,
promoting the proper settlement of the issue of the Middle East
and safeguarding the world and regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that when mankind is walking into the new century,
peace and development are still the theme of our times. To realize
lasting peace and prosperity requires the common efforts of people
of all countries.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese government has always advocated that new international
political and economic order should be built on the basis of the
five principles of peaceful co-existence and other international
norms which have been widely accepted by the international
community," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
International relationship should be democratic, Jiang
said. All countries have the right to participate in international
affairs no matter they are big or small, strong or weak, rich or
poor, he added.
</P>
<P>
Countries should respect the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of each other, with non-aggression and non-interference,
Jiang said. The right of the people of every country in choosing
the social system and road of development according to their
national reality should be fully respected, he added.
</P>
<P>
"No country has the right to interfere in other's domestic
affairs under any excuse," Jiang stressed, adding that dialogue
and negotiation should be adopted to seek peaceful settlement for
international conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, accompanied by the King, inspected the royal guards of
honor after the banquet, and national anthems of the two countries
were played. Jiang and the King said farewell to each other
afterward.

<HEADLINE> China Need to Break South Korean Jinx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Englishman Bobby Houghton's
Chinese Olympic side will have to break a South Korean jinx
cursing the country for over a decade to stay in the hunt for a
berth in next year's Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
The regional powerhouse South Korea registered an amazing
record over their east Asian neighbours, running out victors from
20-odd matches for the last 13 years to inflict a serious damage
on the country's collective soccer psyche which has been known as
"South Korea Fear Symptoms" in the Chinese media.
</P>
<P>
The last time China tasted victory had to date back to January
23, 1986 when they etched out a 2-1 win over a largely depleted
South Korean army in an international friendly in India, and the
intention to get it right is real and earnest.
</P>
<P>
An overdue triumph from tonight's Asian Group B second leg
qualifier would be still good enough to address the national
obsession as well as keep alive any hopes of making the Olympic
soccer finals only for the second time in history.
</P>
<P>
In a qualifying programme where only top finishers from the
three groups can advance as the Asian representatives, China, now
on three points and with two matches remaining--the other one
being the away fixture with Bahrain on Nov.5--against South Korea'
s six points and a favourable schedule which sees them playing the
same opponents a week later on home soil, are facing a make-or-
break situation.
</P>
<P>
A decent win with at least two goals difference would turn
around the tide and put China from fringe back to the center of
the picture, while defeat or even draw would ring the end of the
game.
</P>
<P>
Despite taking some statistic advantages -- having shots on
goal twice as many as opponents and three scoring chances against
one--over their old nemesis, the Chinese under-23 eleven failed to
pull off what might be a historic win over South Korea in their
first encounter in Seoul on October 3.
</P>
<P>
To be exact, they lost 0-1 by a second-half controversial
strike hitting the goalline and then bouncing off which Houghton
claimed "very doubtful".
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely close game," Houghton said yesterday at a
news conference. "In fact if we had had reasonable amount of
fortune, we would have beaten them."
</P>
<P>
The Briton was not to have such an easy excuse if China would
flounder Friday night at the Shanghai Stadium, a "Lucky Land" even
reckoned by himself where his men maintain an unbeaten record.
</P>
<P>
It could be that China win tomorrow's battle but still lose the
campaign, but it would be all the same significant since a much-
needed victory over feared South Korea can help exorcise a demon
of self-doubtness lingering over the Chinese soccer for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
"A Shanghai triumph would bear far-reaching significances, " a
mass-circulation newspaper Sports Weekly declared. "It would cure
us of South Korea Fear Symptoms which has come close to smothering
the game in the country for the last two decades."
</P>
<P>
But an ever positive Houghton doesn't seem to think his side
harbour any underdog complex.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any mental problems," he said. "We're looking
forward to it (today's game) with full confidence."
</P>
<P>
Star striker Li Jinyu, responsible for both goals in China's 2-
1 victory over Bahrain 18 days ago, talked the same.
</P>
<P>
"We can kill the game if we're up to 80 percent of ourselves;
that's for sure," the former player with the French first division
side Nancy said. "We haven't lost here and (we're) brimming with
self-believe in this lucky arena."

<P>
HAVANA, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Cuban government described as
brave the recent visit of Illinois Governor of the United States
George Ryan to the island.
</P>
<P>
Cuba shared with Ryan the impression that the visit created an
excellent opportunity for a fruitful and respectful exchange
between Illinois state and the island, Forein Ministry's spokesman
Alejandor Gonzalez said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a brave visit that progressed in a cordial climate and
we appreciated the Governor's statements regarding the need to
lift the embargo and progress over ideological differences toward
a situation of normality between both countries", said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Ryan ended Wednesday a five-day visit to Cuba, the first of a
U.S. governor since the victory of Cuba Revolution in 1959.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Ryan met for six hours Cuban President Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman confirmed that Cuban authorities didn't impose on
Ryan any conditions for the visit.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and United States don't keep diplomatic relations and
their ties are limited to respective Interest Offices in
Washington and Havana.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Sharply On Low Labor Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
sharply Thursday as investors believed that inflation is under
control after the government reported the low labor costs in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 227.64 or 2.2
percent at 10,622.53, adding to the gain of 92 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 45.73 at 1,342.42 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 72.70 at 2,875.22.
</P>
<P>
The market moved higher after the U.S. Labor Department
reported that the employment cost index rose by 0.8 percent
in the third quarter, lower than the 0.9 percent increase in
expectations. The report made investors believe that inflation
is under control despite the strong growth in the U.S. economy
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department today reported the strong
economic growth at the annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third
quarter. But the low labor costs balanced the investors' sentment
on the hot economy that jolted stocks in the past few months for
fears of the rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors seemed ready to accept the higher
rates as they believed that the low employment cost index would
not deter the Federal Reserve from raising the moderate rates for
the third time this year to cool off the economy when its Open
Market Committee meets on November 16.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 20.01 at 618.15 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 7.24 at 793.55. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 6.04 at 422.81.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declineers by a 12-to-5 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,190 up, 904 down and 456
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.12 billion shares from 894.40
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Falls Sharply to below 22 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices slid five
percent on Thursday in a sharp technical reversal of last week's
gains aggravated by poor refinery profit margins in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent crude tumbled 1.17 U.S. dollars on the London
futures market to settle at 21.42 U.S. dollars a barrel. Brent has
traded between 21 and 24 U.S. dollars since this year's unrivalled
rally peaked four weeks ago at 24.30 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Market sentiment was damaged by a hefty 3.4 million barrel rise
in crude stocks in the world's largest energy market reported this
week by the Washington-based American Petroleum Institute (API)
industry group. Meanwhile, non-OPEC oil production is set to rise
sharply in the fourth quarter, pushed higher by North Sea
developments.
</P>
<P>
Non-OPEC sources will add a whopping 800,000 bpd during this
period, almost all of which will come from the Atlantic Basin, and
from the North Sea in particular, Reuters quoted a monthly report
of the Petroleum Finance.
</P>
<P>
Also, some OPEC leakage above official output quotas is now
widely accepted and most market observers expect compliance with
output limits to weaken rather than strengthen.

<HEADLINE> Disruptive Changes in U.S. Health System Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Consumerism, e-business and
genetic mapping will bring about disruptive changes in the way
U.S. healthcare is provided and paid for in the 21st century,
according to a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dynamic forces will threaten the status quo of U.S. healthcare
providers, insurers and the government, but also will create
opportunities for improved quality of care, greater efficiencies
and e-business, said the report from Pricewaterhouse Coopers, a
world's leading professional services organization. To compile the
report the organization interviewed and surveyed 400 thought
leaders and healthcare executives in the United States, Europe,
Canada and Pacific Rim to determine the factors shaping the future
of healthcare.
</P>
<P>
The penetrating impact of the Internet will recast the
distribution, financing, speed and production of traditional
medical products and services as well as create increased
competition for capital investment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Internet gives the advantage of speed over size and
bureaucratic healthcare organizations could fail in this race to
smaller, adaptive entrepreneurial ventures, said the report,
foreseeing new types of business models such as virtual medical
records warehousing or insurance products through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Many of those surveyed thought that by 2010 individuals would
store their electronic medical records on a source that is not
part of the current healthcare system. Others thought the source
would be an Internet portal site and that individuals would use
non-healthcare third-party businesses. Another way in which
e-business will change the healthcare system is interaction
between providers and patients. In-office visits may decrease if
physicians routinely offer Web-based consulting tools.
</P>
<P>
With the impact of the Internet and increasing levels of
education, the report said, consumers in the next decade will
understand more about healthcare issues and make more decisions
about their own treatments. This knowledge thirst will intensify
as out-of-pocket spending (the amount consumers spend on health
insurance premiums, deductibles and co-pays) increases in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the biggest change in the next decade
will be the type of screening and diagnostic tests that stem from
the completely mapped human genome. In the U.S., third-party
genetic mapping businesses will spring up and become the primary
source for an individual's genetic map.
</P>
<P>
Healthcare financing trends are converging in the industrial
world as the U.S. becomes more governmental and privatization
efforts increase in Europe and Canada, the report said. In
addition, increasing costs and consumerism are likely to spur
insurance changes. For instance, most U.S. employers will offer
employees the option of medical savings accounts by 2010. Also,
defined contribution programs, which have been popular among
corporate retirement plans, would transition to health benefits.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for More Efforts to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RABAT, October 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said Thursday that China and Morocco should make concerted
efforts to explore new means and ways of bilateral cooperation
catering to the situation so as to constantly widen and deepen
economic and trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane
Youssoufi, Jiang said that he feels deeply the friendly affection
of Moroccan people for China and that the warm welcome extended to
him by the Moroccan people is a symbol of friendship between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Youssoufi spoke highly of the enormous success scored in the
recent years by China in economic and social development, and
emphasized China's important role on the current international
stage. He also expressed the hope for better cooperation between
China and Morocco in all fields of endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan prime minister said that his country highly
appreciated China's stand on the questions of the Middle East and
Iraq. He reiterated Morocco's firm support to China's cause of
reunification.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that the state visit by President
Jiang will raise the Moroccan-Chinese relationship to a new high.

President Jiang said that he had just held good talks with King
Mohammed VI during which they exchanged views on bilateral
relations as well as regional and international issues of common
concern. The two sides have identical or similar views, he said.

geographic position, enjoying high prestige in the Arab world and
among Northern African countries and that the contacts between
China and Morocco date back to ancient times.
</P>

As China and Morocco are developing countries faced with the
common task of economic development, both sides should make

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises Debt Forgiveness for Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Thursday called on international leaders to east Nigeria's debt
and on the Senate to loosen trade restrictions with the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
"As Nigeria undertakes its reforms I will support generous debt
rescheduling through the Paris Club and encourage other countries
to take further steps," Clinton said at a news conference with
Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
"Barriers to trade are barriers to opportunity for Africans
working hard to catch up in a global economy and for Americans who
want to work with them," Clinton said. "That's why it is vital
that the Senate approve the African Growth and Opportunity Act
which is now pending."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian officials had said ahead of obasanjo's visit to
Washington that the country's foreign debt, amounting to more than
$30 billion, would be high on the agenda when the two presidents
meets.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo told Clinton during their meeting at the White House
that "a crushing debt burden" was making it hard for developing
countries to "get on their feet" economically.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he would work to ease Nigeria's heavy debt
because it was "neither morally rite nor economically sound" to
force Nigerians to choose between paying their debts or educating
their children.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was also seeking to help Obasanjo turn his nation into
a stabilizing force for the rest of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria is a pivot point on which the future of all Africa and
much of the world will turn. I am very glad it is in the hands of
this leader today," he said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that it was "very much in America's interest
that Nigeria succeed and therefore we should assist them in their
success."

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Parties Struggle With Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ulster Unionist Party
leader, David Trimble, said Thursday that the Northern Ireland
peace process will succeed -- sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at Stormont, Belfast, during an afternoon break
in the talks chaired by former U.S. senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said that while the central issues of decommissioning
and establishment of an executive had not yet been agreed, the
Good Friday Agreement would not fail.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is on the last lap of a drive aimed at getting a
compromise between the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Sinn Fein
on the thorny issues of guerrilla disarmament and creation of new
political structures in the British province.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said all sides were seriously tackling a long-standing
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
The Good Friday accord, signed in April last year, aims to seal
an end to violence between Protestants and Catholics by creating
shared political structures and getting guerrilla groups to hand
in weapons.
</P>
<P>
The UUP refuses to sit with Sinn Fein in a coalition government
until its guerrilla ally, the Irish Republican Army, disarms. Sinn
Fein says it cannot force the IRA to hand over arms used in its
war against British rule.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Mitchell had a series of meetings with Protestant
and Catholic parties and the talks could go on until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is expected to put forward his own blueprint for
reviving the accord if Unionist and Sinn Fein leaders are unable
to do a deal.

Peng, NPC chairman, said that Morocco is a country of long history
and cultural tradition and also one of the first African countries
that have established diplomatic ties with China.

The long-term friendly contact between the two countries has
demonstrated that countries, even though with different social
systems, can have sound and smooth development of relationship so
long as they abide by the basic international norms and insist on
the five principles of peaceful co-existence, said Jiang.

The Chinese President pointed out that this world is big and
colorful, and that countries of it will naturally choose social
systems that accord with their tradition, culture, history and

countries should devote their efforts to the establishment of a
just and reasonable international political and economic order and
make the new century into one of peace, stability, prosperity and
cooperation," he added.

<P>

unremitting efforts to promote the bilateral relationship between
the two countries.

with Morocco and the two countries are both developing ones with
similar experience and goals, and both are making efforts for the
establishment of a new international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Radi stressed that the world in the 21st century should not be
single-polared and that every country has the right of choosing
the road of development and social system for itself. Morocco is
willing to make positive efforts, together with China, to boost
the process of the world multi-polarization, he added.
