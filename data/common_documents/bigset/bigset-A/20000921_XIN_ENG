<HEADLINE> S. African Govt Urged to Emphasize Product Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's lack of
uniform regulations on product standards will pose an increasingly
negative impact upon its competitiveness in international trade,
an expert cautioned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Randall Carolissen, an official with the South African Bureau
of Standards, told a committee of the National Assembly that the
successful admission of a country's products into international
market is closely linked with their compliance with standards.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some nations were also utilizing the
complexity of the standards, and related activities like product
accreditation and conformity assessments to set up "invisible"
trade barriers, under the new circumstances of free trade.
</P>
<P>
South African businessmen's inadequate understanding of the
latest rules of the World Trade Organization in this area was of
great concern, he said.
</P>
<P>
Carolissen called for new legislation to govern South Africa's
regulatory regime and improve awareness on standards among trading
partners.

<HEADLINE> S. African Parliament Urged to Ratify African Economic Community Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 ( Xinhua) -- South Africa's
parliament was urged on Wednesday to ratify as soon as possible a
treaty on establishing the African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Briefing some of the National Assembly's committees, Welile
Nhlapo, deputy director-general of the Department of Foreign
Affairs, said the Abuja Treaty, adopted in June 1991, would lay
the foundation for an African common market.
</P>
<P>
The treaty still needs to be ratified by nine member states of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU), including South Africa,
before coming into effect, said Nhlapo.
</P>
<P>
At last year's OAU extraordinary summit in Libya, the heads of
state in Africa called for an accelerated implementation of the
treaty, and the quickened steps to set up relevant institutions of
integration such as the African Central Bank, African Monetary
Union, African Court of Justice and the Pan-African Parliament.
</P>
<P>
South Africa could not continue to play its leading role on the
continent, if it remained outside the treaty, said the official.

<HEADLINE> Iran Tests First Solid-Liquid Fuel Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's military on Thursday
successfully tested a new type of Shahab-3 missile, its first that
used both solid and liquid fuel, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The missile, however, will not be used for military purposes,
Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani was quoted by the agency as saying.
But he did not say how much the missile has been improved.
</P>
<P>
He said the missile will be used for launching information and
communication satellites, and Thursday's test was a show of Iran's
technology in this field.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister added that Iran's defense industries do not
aim at manufacturing offensive weapons, and that its products do
not pose any threat to any other country.
</P>
<P>
In July, Iran successfully test-fired an upgraded Shahab-3
missile with a range of 1,300 kilometers, large enough for it to
strike Israel and U.S. targets in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Israel also has successfully tested the anti-missile Arrow
system, which was developed in part as a defense against Iran's
Shahab-3 missile.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami
Thursday said that Israel did not rule out a partial peace deal
with the Palestinians that excludes a solution on the most
difficult issue of the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, the dovish minister said for
the first time that Israel never rejected such a proposal. But such
a deal would depend on a clause in which the Palestinians will
declare the end of the conflict with the Jews, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue is the bottleneck in the Palestinian-Israeli
peace process and it had been the deal-breaker at July Camp David
summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and United States President Bill Clinton.

RIYADH, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain and Syria agreed on
Thursday to form a supreme joint committee, under the chairmanship
of the prime ministers of the two countries, to boost bilateral
cooperation in the economic, media, cultural and tourism fields.
</P>
<P>
The agreements in this regard were signed in Manama after
Bahraini Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa Bin Sulman Al-Khalifa and
his visiting Syrian counterpart Mohammed Mustafa Miro held talks
there.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also affirmed the importance of restoring the Arab

solidarity to support the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed the latest developments in the Middle
East peace process and stressed that a just and comprehensive peace
is not attainable without the complete implementation of all
international resolutions, particularly, Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338 which call for the full Israeli withdrawal

from occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain voiced full support to the Syrian unwavering stance
based on the full Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan
Heights which were seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Both countries also affirmed support to all rights of the
Palestinian people to return to their homelands, determine their
future and establish their independent state with Jerusalem as a
capital in accordance with the respective U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's 1.2 Billion Dollar Smelter Commissioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Thursday commissioned an aluminum smelter, the largest
factory ever built in the Southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The factory, with an actual investment of some 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars, is expected to double the country's export volume and add
about 7 percent to Mozambican Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the smelter was an example of the country's
commitment to the development and prosperity of Mozambique and the
southern African sub-region at large, said Chissano on the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
Four foreign heads of state, including Thabo Mbeki of South
Africa, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Festus Mogae of Botswana, and
Bakili Maluzi of Malawi, attended the opening ceremony of the
smelter, located at Beluluane on the outskirts of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The smelter, to be in full capacity production by next January,
will turn out 250,000 tons of aluminum ingots a year.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the smelter took only 25 months, setting a
world record in the aluminum industry, and saved around 100
million dollars from the original 1.3 billion dollar investment.
</P>
<P>
The smelter is a joint venture of Mozambique, South Africa, and
Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
After the two-day state visit to Kenya by Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni at the invitation of his Kenyan counterpart Daniel
arap Moi, the two leaders issued the communique, saying they
pledged to work closely to expand cooperation in the fields of
trade, tourism, transport and communications, and energy.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to set up a Committee of Ministers of Finance and
Trade to ease trade between Kenya and Uganda, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya undertook to purchase additional hydroelectric power from
Uganda as the latter's generation capacity increases, and the two
sides also agreed to complete negotiations by the end of October
this year on Uganda's additional supplies of power to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reviewed progress made in efforts to forge
closer cooperation among the three east African countries of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania, within the framework of the East African
Community.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated the need to expand membership of the community
and underscored the importance of regional economic integration
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Moi and Museveni also exchanged views on recent political
development in the region and emphasized the need for concerted
regional efforts towards the attainment of durable peace,
stability and development in the Great Lakes Region.
</P>
<P>
Museveni arrived in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Wednesday. On
that day, he attended the Burundi peace talks here and witnessed

<HEADLINE> UK MI6 Intelligence HQ Hit by Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain's MI6 intelligence
headquarters in central London was hit by a small missile believed
to have been fired from a rocket launcher on Wednesday night.
Police said renegade Irish guerrillas opposed to the peace process
in Northern Ireland might be the main suspects.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of casualties but commuters faced morning
rush hour chaos as police sealed off the area.
</P>
<P>
The search included nearby railway lines running into Waterloo
station prompting speculation the missile could have been fired
from the tracks.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, which was
felt by those in underground stations and in nearby cars, shaken
by the force of the blast at Vauxhall Cross, just before 22:00
local time (2100 GMT) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The missile shattered an eighth floor window on the southern
side of the building, home of the Foreign Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
Despite travel chaos on Thursday morning, rail services and
roads around the area on the south bank of the Thames were
beginning to run again.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, head of Scotland Yard's
Anti-Terrorist Branch, said the device was fired at the building
from a range of between 200 to 500 meters.
</P>
<P>
He said he was "keeping in mind" dissident Irish republican
groups, but was not ruling out other possible perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
The device used to launch the attack was "possibly a rocket
launcher", he said.
</P>
<P>
A series of bombs planted in London earlier this year have been
blamed on Northern Irish republican splinter guerrilla groups
opposed to the province's fragile peace process. In July, the Real
IRA (Irish Republican Army) was understood to have been
responsible for a bomb in Ealing, west London, and in June,
Hammersmith Bridge was closed after a device was planted on one of
the supports.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Concerned at Growing Number of Holds in Iraq Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annan has been following the progress in the efforts to reduce
the number and value of holds, said Benon V. Sevan, executive
director of the Iraq program.
</P>
<P>
The total value of contracts on hold in all sectors had grown
to 1.982 billion U.S. dollars as of September 18 from May 31 when
it stood at 1.6 billion dollars, Sevan told the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The level of holds remains unacceptably high in the transport
and telecommunications sector and the electricity and education
sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Presenting Annan's 90-day report on the implementation of the
program to the council, Sevan said that without necessary
industrial suppliers Iraq cannot sustain its current level of oil
production and exports.
</P>
<P>
The spare parts and equipment which are the minimum
requirements of Iraq's oil industry have been facing serious
obstacles in the Security Council Sanctions Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the "oil for food" program, launched in 1996 and now in
its eighth phase, Iraq is allowed to sell a limited amount of oil
in every six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods for its 22 million people reeling under the stringent U.N.
sanctions imposed since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"I should like to appeal to all concerned to redouble their
efforts in expediting the approval of applications and to further
review all holds placed on applications," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Liberal Democrats Ends Annual Party Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Liberal
Democratic Party leader Charles Kennedy wound up his party's
annual conference Thursday with an appeal to disaffected
Conservatives to join the Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the southern seaside city of Bournemouth,
Kennedy appealed directly to Conservative voters, telling them
that he shared many of their values.
</P>
<P>
He also rounded on Labor, accusing the Labor government of
having "a poverty of ambition" and saying that the Liberal
Democrats were not to the right or left of Labor, but ahead of it.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy defended Liberal Democrats' policy to raise income tax,
arguing that voters would trust a party that was honest with them.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I want to address the millions of previous Conservative
voters who feel that William Hague's party offers them nothing. I
share many of the values, the beliefs, the concerns of the people
who used to be called one-nation Conservatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the Liberal Democrats were "ahead of Labor", not
to the left or right of it.
</P>
<P>
He also defended his party's new plans to raise the top rate of
income tax to 50 percent for those earning over 100,000 pounds (
about 144,000 U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to scrap tuition fees for higher education - already
achieved by Liberal Democrats in the devolved Scottish parliament -
and to re-introduce free eye and dental check-ups on the National
Health Service.
</P>
<P>
In his only reference to the recent fuel crisis in Britain in
which farmers and hauliers nearly brought the country to a
standstill over duty on fuel, Kennedy said the Liberal Democrats
were "honest" on fuel taxes, which should be used to improve the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy concluded: "I have great pride in our party, in what we
stand for. Pride in our principles. And I have pride in Britain -
in what it can be. This is what we will deliver: a truly modern,
truly free 21st century Britain. A Liberal Democrat Britain."

<HEADLINE> China, Brazil to Cooperate on New Satellite Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA. September 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan and his Brazilian counterpart, Luis Felipe Lampreia,
signed here Thursday a protocol to continue bilateral cooperation
in space technology and development of new land resource
satellites.
</P>
<P>
China and Brazil launched successfully the first Sino-Brazilian
Satellite of Land Resources (CBERS) on October 14, 1999. A second
satellite of the same model is in its final assemblage stage and
will be launched next year.
</P>
<P>
Owing to substantial successes achieved by the two countries in
this area, both parties decided to continue to cooperate in the
sense of developing a second generation of CBERS satellites,
denominated CBERS 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
The investment values required by the cooperation will be, by
principle, shared equally between both parties.
</P>
<P>
Besides satellites of land resources, the two countries want to
deepen cooperation in space technology and will determine joint
development viability of a weather geostationary satellite and of
telecommunications, according to the same protocol.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Brazilian diplomats agreed that bilateral
cooperation in the area of utilization of outer space, the first
of its kind between both developing countries, is important for
promoting the social, economic and cultural development of both
countries.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Calls for Promotion of Math Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said here on Thursday that math and
science education in schools should be a national priority.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, in a testimony before the House Education and
Workforce Committee, said that boosting math and science education
was "crucial for the future" of the United States in an
increasingly technological society.
</P>
<P>
"The pressures we face today are not unlike those of a century
ago, when our education system successfully responded to the
multiplying needs brought about by a marked acceleration in
technological innovation," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Today's workers must be prepared to use ever-changing high-
technology devices such as computers and the Internet, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 100 years ago, only about 1 in 10 workers was in
a professional or technical job, but by 1970 the number had
doubled and today those jobs account for nearly one-third of the
workforce.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Reduces Sentences of Convicted Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian appeals court in the
southern city of Shiraz has commuted the sentences of 10 Jews
previously found guilty by a lower court of spying for Israel, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All 10 of the Iranian Jews, who were sentenced to four to 13
years in July, have had their prison terms reduced to between two
and nine years, according to the new ruling on Thursday, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The two main defendants, Hamid Tefeleen and Asher Zadmehr, were
originally sentenced to 13 years in prison, but now their terms
have been reduced to nine and seven years respectively.
</P>
<P>
The other eight defendants also saw their prison terms reduced
by two to four years.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 13 Jews, along with some Muslims, were arrested in
Fars provincial capital Shiraz in the first half of last year, and
the trial started in April.
</P>
<P>
Three Jews and two Muslims were acquitted under the July 1
ruling in a Shiraz court, but 10 Jews and two other Muslim were
convicted of cooperating with the Israeli security service and
sentenced to prison terms.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers for the Jews had protested the ruling and
appealed to the provincial court, which resulted in Thursday's new
ruling after delays.
</P>
<P>
The arrest and trial of the Iranian Jews sparked protests from
Israel and Western countries who demanded their immediate release.
</P>
<P>
Iran insisted, however, that the case had nothing to do with
religious beliefs and no foreign country should interfere in its
domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iran has a Jewish community of about 25,000 people, the largest
in the Middle East outside Israel.

<HEADLINE> Syria's Military Presence in Lebanon Legal and Temporary: Lahoud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
said on Thursday that Syria's military presence in Lebanon "is
legal and temporary." National News Agency (NNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrian existence accords with Lebanon's strategic interest
because the Israeli enemy refuses the just and comprehensive peace
and they are trying to settle Palestinian refugees in Lebanon," the
president added.
</P>
<P>
Syrian, Lebanon's main power broker, stations about 35,000
troops in the country and influences almost every major decision
made by Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Syrian troops entered into Lebanon at the invitation of some
Muslim factions during the civil war that ended in 1990. The Taif
agreement, which played an important role in bringing about a
ceasefire, justified the Syrian military existence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The president said that it was not reasonable to blame Syria and
ignore Israel's crimes to the Lebanese. "The crimes that caused
victims and damages in our country still affect our projects of
absorbing foreign investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud urged Lebanese people not to put all responsibilities on
others in every time. "Among those wars in Lebanon in several
decades, we can see that many facilities and aims were from our
factional clash," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"We should know the country has not done any thing wrong for
you. On the contrary we have committed many crimes on her and on
ourselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
And he stressed that "we have to depend on the legal and
systematic way to realize our aim."
</P>
<P>
Most Christians oppose Syria's role in Lebanon and there have
been many demonstrations in Beirut asking for Syria's withdrawal
since Israeli pullout from south Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Christian Maronite bishops demanded on Wednesday Syria's
withdrawal and denounced claims that Damascus's role was needed to
avoid another civil war.

<HEADLINE> 25 Brotherhood Members Arrested in Egypt This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five Muslim Brotherhood
members were arrested in Egypt this week on charges of undermining
social and political stability, the Middle East News Agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood members were arrested on Tuesday and Wednesday
in the governorates of Ismailia, Menoufia, Sharqiya and Kafr el-
Sheikh in the Nile Delta, and in Giza and Qalyubiya governorates
around the capital Cairo, it quoted police officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
They were accused of distributing anti-government pamphlets and
developing a plot to sabotage the parliamentary elections due in
October and November by making propaganda against the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The state security prosecution on Thursday prosecution also
extended for another 15 days the detention of 19 Brotherhood
members who were arrested on August 25 in Menoufia. Among them are
teachers, doctors, and engineers.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Interior Minister Habib el-Adli said on Wednesday that
the Brotherhood members would have no role in the upcoming
legislative elections because they belong to an illegal group which
is rejected by the people.
</P>
<P>
But members of the group have said they will stand for
parliament at the elections as independents.
</P>
<P>
The three-stage elections are due to start on October 18 and end
on November 15.
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood was founded in 1929 but banned in 1954. The
movement is accused of encouraging violence although it says
publicly it is using peaceful means to establish an Islamic state.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is
considering whether or not to impose a ban on livestock product
imports from South Africa, after a breakout of the foot and month
disease at a South African pig farm last month, reports available
here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An EU technical committee had been studying relevant test
results of outbreak provided by relevant South African authorities
before making its decision, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
A possible ban of the EU may give a heavy blow upon South
Africa's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Namibia, Botswana, Mauritius and Singapore have already imposed
such bans.
</P>
<P>
Foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious, and therefore
internationally trade sensitive one.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after last week's outbreak, the South African
government established a 10-kilometer radius quarantine zone
around the problem farm, and sent soldiers to help seal up the
area.

<HEADLINE> EU not to Freeze Aid To Zimbabwe: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting head of the European
Commission delegation Asger Pilegaard said here Thursday the
European Union is in the process of funding projects worth about
100 million U.S. dollars in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
These projects covered the health, education, mine clearance,
decentralization, capacity building and agricultural sectors,
Pilegaard told the Zimbabwe News Agency while quashing rumors that
the union has frozen aid to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said the union is determined to continue support in these
areas, adding: "We are not freezing aid to Zimbabwe. Even in
these very difficult circumstances, we want to do what we can in
the social sectors."
</P>
<P>
Pilegaard stressed the EU did not interfere with a host
government's policies.
</P>
<P>
But, he said: "We are concerned about the cost of the war in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), about the failure to
implement the rule of law and good governance. We hope to see
action being taken to ensure the rule of law, respect of the
judiciary and determination to fight corruption."
</P>
<P>
Right from the start, he said, the EU had supported land reform
in Zimbabwe for political and social reasons and for reasons of
justice and fairness.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in the EU and other donors doubt the need for land
reform." But as it was agreed in 1998, such a reform must be
lawful, respect human rights and be transparent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and most donors suspended crucial aid to Zimbabwe
because of the foreign currency crisis, its government's failure
to meet agreed economic targets under IMF-backed reforms and its
costly intervention in the DRC which has so far cost about 200
million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Staff Conducting March for Increased Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 U.N.
staff on Thursday conducted a silent march at the U.N.
headquarters in New York, commemorating their colleagues who have
been killed in the line of duty and drawing attention to the need
for strengthening their security.
</P>
<P>
The march came after the death of three staff members from the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
in West Timor of Indonesia and the murder of another UNHCR staff
in Guinea this month.
</P>
<P>
Holding slogans "When will it end;" "It has to end;" and "How
many more will be killed," the U.N. staff marched silently around
the fountain at the front of the U.N. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
They sent a petition to the United Nations Security Council,
seeking a special session of the council to consider measures to
improve their security and safety around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, there were 198 civilian deaths
between January 1, 1992 and September 18, 2000. The figures
reflect only civilian personnel and not peace-keepers.
</P>
<P>
Of these 198 deaths, 50 were internationally recruited and 148
were locally recruited staff.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said between January 1 and December 31, 1999, there
were 292 reported violent incidents involving United Nations staff
throughout the world, including inter alia robberies with violence,
physical assault, rape and vehicle hijacking.
</P>
<P>
A memorial service for Mensah Kpognon, who was shot and killed
at his residence during an attack on Macenta village in Guinea on
September 17, was held Thursday in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the memorial service, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said failure to protect the lives of innocent and
unarmed humanitarian workers is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. and its partners are working urgently to improve
measures for staff protection," Annan said. "And measures, however,
will be inadequate if governments do not commit themselves
wholeheartedly, in principle and in practice, to protect those who
venture into danger to relieve the suffering of others."
</P>
<P>
"We must strengthen the protection of all humanitarian staff,
local and international. We must ensure that the 1994 Convention
of the Safety and Security of U.N. Personnel is extended to
humanitarian staff. We must translate words into deeds," the U.N.
chief added.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Population declines in Last Ten Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This demographic decline, the daily considers, is generated by
the changes in Romanian society after 1989.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the population's shrinking after 1989 is caused
by migration abroad and one third by natural causes -- the balance
between the dead and born.
</P>
<P>
The mass migration in 1990 and 1991 with 97,000 and 44,000
respectively explains this ratio, but it should be emphasized that
the share of the natural component has been growing in recent
years, concomitant with the relative stabilization of the number
of migrants, especially thanks to ever more restrictive and
selective immigration policies endorsed by the developed countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Voices Confidence in Effective Peacekeeping Mission in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here
that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has received "a significant
" number of offers of troops but none yet have made a final
commitment.
</P>
<P>
"There was good momentum before the Indians announced their
withdrawal and that gives us 3,000 more to recruit and makes the
job a little harder but we still think it is doable," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
India, the backbone of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra
Leone with more than 3,000 troops, announced that it was pulling
out its contingents at a time when the United Nations was
attempting to increase its peacekeepers from 13,000 to 20,500 in
the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to replace the Indian commander of the U.N.
force, known as UNAMSIL, Major General Vijay Jetley, as early as
next week, along with his Nigerian and Kenyan deputies, U.N.
officials said here.
</P>
<P>
"We expect a decision to be announced by the end of this month,
" Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
UNAMSIL, which currently is the United Nations' biggest
peacekeeping operation, has made little progress in halting Sierra
Leone's civil war, in which rebels are trying to hold the war-torn
country's lucrative diamond mines and seize power in Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Instead, UNAMSIL has suffered repeated embarrassment. In May,
the rebels took 500 peacekeepers hostage only days after their
arrival. This month, Sierra Leoneans said U.N. troops were failing
to prevent attacks and looting by armed gangs even on main roads
that they nominally patrol, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that Jordan, which fields 1,825 troops in
Sierra Leone, was also considering the withdrawal of its soldiers
unless a NATO country joined the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Indian Mission to the United Nations said
Wednesday that the withdrawal was "part of a routine rotation out
of the mission so as to give other member states a chance to
participate."
</P>
<P>
However, he denied the move was related to criticism of the
mission or disputes between Jetley and his Nigerian subordinates.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday voted unanimously to extend
the mandate of UNAMSIL for just over three months while it
considers a recommendation to increase the peacekeeping force by 7,
500 troops.
</P>
<P>
Instead of increasing the troops for UNAMSIL as recommended by
Annan, the Security Council renewed the mandate until December 31
at the same 13,000 troop level.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urges Iran to Release Jews in Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Ministry on
Thursday voiced concern about the fate of the Iranian Jews
convicted of spying for Israel and urged Tehran to release them as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Israel expresses its profound concern following the decision of
an Iranian Appeals Court in the southern city of Shiraz to cut the
prison terms of the 10 Iranian Jews earlier Thursday, the ministry
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Iran said the Appeals Court in Shiraz
reduced their sentences from between four and 13 years to between
two and nine years.
</P>
<P>
All of the men were found guilty of spying for Israel and
sentenced to prison terms in July. Israeli government has denied
any connection with the Iranian Jews in the spy case.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli statement said the "cosmetic changes" in the
prisoners' sentences do not alter the basic fact that these are
innocent people who have been rotting away in prison for more than
a year, when they have done no wrong.
</P>
<P>
"Israel calls upon the international community and every
civilized person to severely condemn these harsh sentences and to
continue working with Israel to achieve the immediate release of
the prisoners," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will not rest until all the prisoners are released," it
added.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Sign Agreement on Gaza Seaport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority have signed an agreement for the construction of
a seaport in the Palestinian self-rule Gaza Strip, Israeli Prime
Minister's Office announced Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Israeli negotiator Oded Eran and his
Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erekat during their talks Wednesday
night, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Israel had already agreed in principle to the construction of
the seaport in the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum signed by Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat one
year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, two outstanding problems, namely the security
arrangement of the port and the environmental effect of the
building, had held back the opening of the seaport since then.
After several weeks' tough negotiations recently, the two sides
finally reach an agreement Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office said the Palestinians intended to begin
construction immediacy following the agreement signing and the
seaport will become ready within one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The funds for the construction, about 120 million U.S. dollars,
will be donated by France and Holland, who will send their
respective construction companies to build the port.
</P>
<P>
The deal is widely regarded as a positive signal while the two
sides are waiting for the bridging proposals for a final peace
accord being prepared by the United States and to be presented to
them in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The sides hope the proposals will break the peace deadlock since
the Camp David summit between Barak, Arafat and U.S. President Bill
Clinton failed to reach any agreement in July.
</P>
<P>
During Wednesday night's talks, Eran and Erekat also discussed
establishing a free trade zone between them after they reached a
permanent deal and the Palestinians declared independence.
</P>
<P>
Eran said Wednesday that the two sides had already agreed in
principle to the creation of such a free trade area.

<HEADLINE> Khatami: Iran to Build its Might to Maintain Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- President Mohammad Khatami
stressed here on Thursday that Iran is determined to build its
defense, scientific and economic might in order to safeguard and
maintain peace.
</P>
<P>
"We have not sought war, nor do we intend to do it now," Khatami
said at a parade of the armed forces to mark the outbreak of the
1980-1988 war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran is now defending peace in the world based on its foreign
policy of detente, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that Iran must try to strengthen its
military, scientific and economic power in order to realize peace
and safeguard it.
</P>
<P>
There are still dangers and threats in the world, and some
countries have based their foreign relations on force and bullying,
Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, in order to realize peace based on justice
and restoration of national rights, Iran must speak from positions
of power and might, he added.
</P>
<P>
"A nation deprived of the power to defend itself will not be
able to defend its freedom, independence and restoration of its own
rights," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Khatami underlined the importance of the armed forces in
ensuring peace, tranquility and progress of the country.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces are the main backing for the power of the
nation, leadership and the Islamic republic system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Following his remarks, the president reviewed the military
parade with other government officials and foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters showered flowers on the square where the ceremony
was held, and army parachutists made free falls in the air. Similar
ceremonies were held in other cities throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year war with Iraq, which started in September 1980,
cost some 1 million lives on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Twelve years have passed since the end of the war, but many
differences are still blocking the two countries from normalizing
their relations.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reaches Tax Cut Agreement With Egypt, Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq reached a tax cut
agreement with Egypt and Libya recently to promote its trade
relations with the two Arab countries, local media reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hameed Shukur Mahmoud, director general of the Iraqi Customs
Committee, said that it has been agreed to cut 40 percent of the
taxes levied on imported goods among the three Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Such a move is expected to promote the trade volume among the
three countries by a large margin and help improve the humanitarian
situation of Iraq, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under decade-old United Nations sanctions ever
since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, but a U.N. oil-for-food program
allows Iraq to sell oil to finance vital imports of food, medicine
and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been giving priority in developing trade relations with
Arab and Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's trade with Egypt and Libya has been steadily increasing.
Egypt, for example, secured contracts more than 300 million U.S.
dollars during the last phase of the U.N. oil-for-food accord,
which was launched in late 1996 and now in its eighth phase.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian firms have signed contracts worth 1 billion dollars
with Iraq so far.

<HEADLINE> Leader of Egypt's Islamist Party Probed for Links With Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's state security
prosecutors resumed probing the leader of the country's sole
Islamist-oriented political party Thursday on charges of having
links with Muslim fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors started probing Ibrahim Shukri, chairman of the
Labor Party, on Wednesday when he was questioned for five hours on
accusations that his party has links with the banned Muslim
Brotherhood and cooperates with members of extremist Islamic
groups, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The government Parties Affairs Committee suspended the Labor
Party in May because of its power struggle, and later urged the
courts to dissolve the party completely.
</P>
<P>
The charges, drawn up on July 19, also accused the party of
failing to disclose some of its fund sources and of receiving
unauthorized funds.
</P>
<P>
Shukri's party was also accused of violating political parties
laws by adding a religious character in opposition to the national
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party started out as a socialist-oriented movement
when it was founded in 1979, but allied itself with the Muslim
Brotherhood for the 1987 parliamentary elections and formally
adopted an Islamist line at its general congress in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Revenue Increases Thanks to Parastatal Reform  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government collected more revenue than expected in July, due to
progress in reforming the parastatal enterprises in the country,
according to the latest report of the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The government collected a total revenue of 71.1 billion
shillings (about 88.9 million U.S. dollars), surpassing the month'
s target of 64.1 billion shillings (about 80.1 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under Tanzanian government's privatization program, more than
275 of the countries' 425 parastatal corporations have been
privatized. The rest are also in different stages of privatization.
</P>
<P>
The parastatals, formerly a huge drain to the country's wealth,
paid back to the government dividends worth some 2 billion
shillings (about 2.5 million U.S. dollars) in July, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the impressive performance of parastatals, the
enhanced efficiency of tax collection by the Tanzania Revenue
Authority also added to the enlarged revenue for the government in
July, said the document.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has been
urged to sign and ratify the Rome Statute for an international
Criminal Court which includes provisions that make it a war crime
to attack personnel involved in humanitarian assistance or
peacekeeping mission, and to ratify and renew its commitment to
fully implement the 1994 Convention on Safety of United Nations
and associated personnel.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) staff
members observed a protest against attack on humanitarian workers
in Lusaka on Thursday, like in elsewhere. UNHCR Representative in
Zambia Oluseyi Bajulaiye said on the occasion that the agency's
staff members are deeply concerned about the alarming increase in
violent attacks including murder, rape, kidnap, and physical
assault which are deliberately directed against the UN and its
associated personnel as well as humanitarian personnel in the line
of duty.
</P>
<P>
Four of UNHCR staff members have been murdered in September
alone. In the last eight years, 200 UN civilian staff have been
murdered and 228 others taken hostage or kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
Bajulaiye called on the Zambian government, and particularly
President Frederick Chiluba, as a member state of the UN to help
strengthen respect for the safety of UN staff by taking determined
measures to ensure their physical security while they are on this
country's territory.
</P>
<P>
Commending the Zambian people for maintaining peace, the UNHCR
official assured that UNHCR staff members would continue to count
on the government to ensure their safety and security in Zambia.

JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Officials from diamond
producing and trading countries on Thursday proposed to introduce
an international certification system to stem flow of gems from
the wrong hands into the world market.
</P>
<P>
The decision came at the conclusion of a two-day ministerial
level conference in Pretoria, South Africa, aimed at halting the
diamond trade being used to fund African civil wars.
</P>
<P>
The participating nations also agreed to set up an inter-
governmental body empowered to monitor diamond traders' compliance
with the international certification system.
</P>
<P>
Peter Hain, British Minister of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, told a press conference on Thursday that
these proposals would be submitted to the United Nations for
discussion and adoption.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting expressed their hope that an
international treaty concerning the diamond tradewould be signed
by next year.
</P>
<P>
The treaty would ensure that no country could duck its
responsibility to curb the flow of "conflict diamonds", Hain said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Angola, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Namibia, Botswana, Belgium, United States, Zambia, United
Kingdom and Russia took part in the meeting starting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Diamond trade in countries like Angola, Sierra Leone and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo has long been playing a role in
funding civil wars on African continent. The Western countries led
by Britain and the U.S. recently accused Liberia of helping
channeling out diamonds produced in region controlled by Sierra
Leone's rebels, thus prolonging the conflict in the west African
country.

<HEADLINE> GFMS Forecasts Gold Price for the Rest of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Update 1 forecasts that mine production will be unchanged year-
on-year in 2000, while fabrication is expected to recover from its
first half decline, to leave full-year demand unchanged from 1999'
s level.
</P>
<P>
Although central bank sales will remain at a high level in the
second half, they are predicted to be lower both year-on-year and
on the first half's very high total, unless large non-European
sellers were unexpectedly to emerge, it says.
</P>
<P>
GFMS believes that the "paper markets" will not have a much
increased role in price determination in the second half, as only
a modest rise in producer hedging is probable after the decline in
outstanding positions in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the report highlights that producer hedging and
fund short selling are the areas of greatest uncertainty when it
comes to forecasting the price over the remainder of this year.
</P>
<P>
If producers or funds were to return to the level of activity
seen in the first eight months of 1999, then the price would
almost certainly break through the lower end of the expected
trading range, the report notes.

The appeal came as Abdalas Al-Ashtal, permanent representative
of Yemen to the United Nations, took the floor at the two-week
general debate of the 55th General Assembly session, which is
scheduled to conclude here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Our world has become like a single village, in which events
interact globally and there is no room for isolationism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The merging of the economies of states is the most prominent
feature of mutual dependency and, consequently, shared
responsibility with the aim of creating an environment -- at the
national and global levels alike -- which is conducive to
development and to the elimination of poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that good governance "must not just exist
within each country individually, for there must also be good
governance at the international level, based on law and on
transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems."
</P>
<P>
The September 6-8 Millennium Summit, the largest ever gathering
of world leaders in the history of the United Nations, also
underlined the importance of good governance in the United Nations
Millennium Declaration.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, this requires the advanced industrialized
countries to fulfill their commitments to provide official
development assistance to the developing countries to address the
special needs of the least developed countries, to provide debt
relief for the poor countries and to agree to cancel all official
bilateral debts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries are blaming most of the industrialized
countries for their failure to keep the promised official
development assistance (ODA) at the agreed share of 0.7 percent of
their gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
"The removal of all barriers to the access to world markets of
the exports of developing countries also falls within this context,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Reaffirms Stand Against Outer Space Arms Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Space will become the
battlefield of NMD once the system currently under development is
deployed, a Chinese diplomat said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing meeting of the 2000-year session of the
Conference on Disarmament (CD), Chinese Ambassador Hu Xiaodi again
called on the international community to negotiate now an
international treaty to prevent the weaponization of and an arms
race in outer space.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the argument that the development and deployment of
NMD is to defend against the so-called missile threat from certain
"countries of concern," Hu said that those countries are simply
not in a position to pose any military threat in the foreseeable
future to the militarily most powerful country in the world, given
their military capacity and technology, or their overall national
strength.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the Chinese ambassador said, there is no
motive for any small country to attack or threaten to attack, with
intercontinental missiles that carry weapons of mass destruction (
WMD), the militarily most powerful country in the world, unless it
decided to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
"Providing such a reason for the NMD plan is not convincing at
all. It is only a poorly designed excuse," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, Russian Ambassador Vasily S. Sidorov urged
the United States to preserve and comply with the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We are strongly convinced that the ABM treaty remains the
cornerstone of strategic stability and that it continues to serve
as a basis to ensure further reductions in strategic offensive
arms," Sidorov said. "We believe that this connection will be
further enhanced in the overseeable future."
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador warned that the collapse of the ABM
treaty would in effect disrupt the entire range of disarmament
agreements created over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that there is an increasing threat of erosion of the
regimes of non-proliferation of WMD and their delivery means,
Sidorov said, "The creation and development of the U.S. NMD would
give a strong impetus to the proliferation of missiles and missile
technologies. There will be a shift in the positions of many
countries on nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Responding to arguments of those who favor amending the ABM
treaty and who justify their plans by changed strategic situation
and increased missile threats, the Russian ambassador said that "
we consider that references to such a threat have no serious
foundation."
</P>
<P>
"Deployment of NMD is motivated by the necessity to counter
strategic ballistic missiles of some countries. Meanwhile the
proliferation of such ballistic missiles is not foreseen neither
today, nor in the nearest future," he noted. "Changes in strategic
situation, which the proponents of amending the ABM treaty are
citing, can be in no way compared to those changes in strategic
situation that could occur in the event if this treaty is
undermined and the process of disarmament is destructed."

<HEADLINE> EU Defense Ministers to Meet in France on Common European Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The defense ministers of 15
European Union (EU) countries will meet Friday near Paris to
examine the military capacities of Europe and determine the
contributions by each member to a future European rapid reaction
force, French Defense Ministry officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be held in the Chateau d'Ecouen northwest of
Paris, will provide proposals to a conference of general affairs
of EU to be convened on November 20 and 21 in Brussels and the EU
summit to be convened on December 7 and 8 in Nice, France.
</P>
<P>
EU countries are expected to give their final greenlight at the
Nice summit to the creation of a European rapid reaction force
between 2001 and 2003 with a political and military commanding
organ.
</P>
<P>
Such a force will have 15 brigades with 60,000 men and should
be deployable in 60 days in a zone of crisis and be capable of
maintaining peace there for at least one year.
</P>
<P>
The mission of such a force will include staging humanitarian
operations, re-establishing and maintaining peace, launching civil
defense operations in EU countries and evacuating Europeans from
overseas territories where the situation have become dangerous.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Monde published on Thursday,
French Defense Minister Alain Richard noted that the 15 EU
countries have reached a consensus on the analysis of the
situation of security faced by Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said "an atmosphere of confidence is growing between NATO
and EU" on the necessity for Europe to build its own reaction
force.
</P>
<P>
Richard also said the project of European defense is "a factor
of dynamism" for NATO and that the idea of a stronger European
defense is now "very widely shared" by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Court Rejects CIA Evidence Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rejection cleared the way for a key witness to testify in
court that had to be adjourned for three weeks until Thursday for
the defense team to study documents from the United States secret
service agency CIA.
</P>
<P>
The court re-opened on Thursday only to reject the request from
the defense to ask again for more CIA documents.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the defense and the prosecution about CIA
documents and their disputes caused the court to adjourn twice and
to postpone the appearance in court of a defected former Libyan
secret agent stationed in Malta.
</P>
<P>
The informant, identified as Abdul Majid Giaka, is now expected
to appear in court next week and to provide evidence against the
two Libyans accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 off the sky over
Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people on board and on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan defector was scheduled to appear in court to testify
behind a screen with his voice disguised about what he knows about
the December 21, 1988 bombing.
</P>
<P>
The court had so far delayed the testimony by Giaka by
altogether a month and the judges said Thursday that during this
time dozens more telecommunication cables between CIA agents in
Malta and Washington were studied.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers, however, challenged that some evidence was
being covered up by the CIA and asked the agency to disclose
evidence on Palestinian terrorists and factions alleged by the
defense to have involved in the mid-air bombing.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution told the court that apart from the 25 cables
released earlier, it got another 36 cables and asked the court
proceedings to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial, which took almost 12 years to investigate
and prepare, finally went underway on May 3 this year and is
expected to last up to a year.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution accused the two Libyans of placing a suitcase
bomb onto a Frankfurt-bound plane from Malta and it was at
Frankfurt that the suitcase bomb was transferred onto the Pan Am
flight.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Prime Minister Vows to Make Japan Top-Notch IT Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori pledged Thursday to make Japan the world's most advanced
country in the area of information technology (IT) in the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
"Within five years I shall make Japan a nation that stands at
the forefront of information and communications," Mori said in an
opening speech at a 72-day extraordinary Diet (parliament) session.
</P>
<P>
"The realization of a 'Japanese IT society' will be key to
ensuring prosperous lives for the Japanese people befitting the
21st century and strengthening Japan's competitiveness," Mori
stressed.
</P>
<P>
To achieve that goal, Mori said his government will draw up a
national IT strategy, called the "e-Japan" plan, as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The government will create an advanced online network in Japan
to lower the costs of the country's Internet service, and take
steps to help the average citizen acquire IT skills, Mori said.
</P>
<P>
The government will submit to the current Diet session a bill
outlining Japan's basic policy on information technology, as well
as a set of bills for scrapping or easing government regulations
that hinder the spread of e-commerce in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that achieving full recovery remains his priority in
economic policy, Mori said, adding that his government will
compile a supplementary budget for fiscal 2000 involving direct
fiscal spending of about 4.0 trillion yen (37.3 billion U.S.
dollars) to reach that goal.
</P>
<P>
Mori also touched on another pet project in his speech,
revamping Japan's education system.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister said he plans to carry out wide-
ranging reforms of the system based on a report to be drawn up by
an advisory panel by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Mori also expounded his policies on security and diplomacy,
vowing to make all-out efforts to resolve a long-standing
territorial dispute with Russia and improve its relations with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Ruling Party Promises Peace in Election Manifesto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's ruling People's
Alliance (PA) on Thursday promised to end the long-running ethnic
conflict in the country in its new released election manifesto
titled "Our Vision for 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
Releasing the manifesto, Prime Minister Ratnasiri
Wickremanayake said the PA hoped to have a "national government"
after the October 10 general elections, but there would be no
place in it for the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE).
</P>
<P>
"We are clearly having two problems. One is terrorism of the
LTTE which we must wipe out completely. Then we have the question
of minority rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting a 17-year war against majority
Sinhalese-dominated government in a bid to carve out a separate
state for minority Tamils in the country's north and east. More
than 60,000 people have been killed in the ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the PA's draft constitution which
failed to go through the parliament in August now stands invalid
with the dissolution of the parliament on August 18, but the party
would revive a modified devolution plan.
</P>
<P>
The PA of President Chandrika Kumaratunga presented the draft
before the parliament on August 3 in a bid to turn the country
into a de facto federal state in exchange for ethnic peace.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have rejected the draft, saying it failed to
provide a basis for a settlement while the influential Buddhist
clergy argued that too many concessions were being offered to
minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
According to the manifesto, the government's main task will be
to enlist the support of all political parties, religious
denominations and numerous other social groups to install a
national government and introduce a new constitution with
provisions for abolishing the executive presidency and devolving
power to the periphery.
</P>
<P>
"In the implementation of these programs we are committed to
pursue a policy of planned, open economy whilst preserving our
national heritage, values and democracy," the manifesto says. "
Through our vision we hope to build Sri Lanka as a peaceful,
developed and united Sri Lanka."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Red Cross Donates for Flood Victims in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Red Cross Thursday
donated 20,000 U.S. dollars to the Bangladesh Red Crescent for the
2,500 people in 13 districts of the country affected by monsoon-
related flooding and river erosion.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are showing much concern over
the deteriorating flood situation in Bangladesh, hoping that the
Bangladeshi people could overcome all the difficulties in a short
time, Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Hu Qianwen said on behalf
of the Chinese Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Red Crescent Chairman Sheikh Kabir Hossain thanked
the Chinese government for the donation, saying it would further
strengthen the traditional friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen districts in Bangladesh are seriously affected by the
monsoon-related flooding and river erosion this year and 2,500
people have lost their homes and their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Chinese donation, the International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent started distribution of 312 metric tons
of food in hard-hit areas on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This first phase is just a start," said Bob McKerrow, head of
the federation's delegation for Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"We need further financial support to purchase relief goods to
help thousands of people affected by monsoon-related disaster," he
added.

A rescue vessel has been called from a nearby district and it
may take five to seven hours for the vessel to reach the spot.

<HEADLINE> India to Take Hard Decision to Deal With High Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee said Thursday that "hard decisions" would have to
be taken to deal with surging international crude oil prices,
indicating that domestic oil price hike is on the cards.
</P>
<P>
"People have to be prepared for had decision, in view of the
prevailing international situation even though we don't want to
raise the price of oil," he told party workers in his residence
here.
</P>
<P>
"There was strike in entire Europe over the hike in price of
crude thus affecting even developed countries. We are still not
self-sufficient in crude and it would take some time," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the government does not want to raise the price of
crude, "but the people have to see the prevailing international
situation and be prepared for hard decisions."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet is likely to meet on Saturday to review
the situation arising out of the surge in crude prices which have
touched 37 U.S. dollars a barrel, leading to a steep increase in
the oil import bill.

"I have in mind the historic inter-Korean summit that has
played a crucial role for building trust and confidence between
them," he said. "This and other recent developments may well
positively impact on the situation in northeast Asia as a whole."
</P>
<P>
"Due to its historical and geopolitical realities, northeast
Asia is probably the only sub-region that lacks a mechanism at the
governmental level where security issues of concern could be
discussed collectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Various ideas and proposals to this effect have been floating
around for some time, but no serious discussion of this issue has
taken place," he said. "The time may have come to start thinking
about the possibility of engaging in a dialogue starting from a
free exchange of views on the framework of these discussions."

<HEADLINE> Relations between CPC and FSP to be Promoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Henri Nallet, national
secretary in charge of international affairs of the French
Socialist Party (FSP), said here today that the relationship
between the FSP and the Communist Party of China (CPC) will be
promoted in the new century.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Nallet said both the FSP and the
CPC are ruling parties and both shoulder the responsibility of
developing their domestic economy.
</P>

said, adding that the frequent exchange of visits improve the Sino-
French comprehensive partnership and mutual trust and
understanding.

future for cooperation, adding that his visit is to promote the
existing friendly cooperation between the two parties.

<P>
He also suggested that the exchange of visits among party
leaders and local officials should increase, and that experts from
the two countries should exchange views on party theories.

<HEADLINE> Western Control of Chinese Churches Never Returns: Protestant Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Gone are the days when
Chinese churches, under the control of foreign missionaries, were
used for imperialist invasion and Chinese churches have been
independent from them for some 50 years, Chinese Protestant
leaders said today.
</P>
<P>
These religious leaders made remarks at a press conference held
today to celebrate the initiation of the Chinese Christian Three-
Self Patriotic Movement.
</P>
<P>
Luo Guanzong, chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement
Committee of the Protestant Churches of China (TSPMCPCC), said
that during the time from the Opium War of 1840 to 1949 when the
People's Republic of China was founded, the imperialists had
continuously used Christianity and preaching done by missionaries
to serve their evil purposes.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, Y.T. Wu and about 40 Christian leaders started the
Three-Self Movement to fight the imperialistic conspiracy of using
Christianity for sabotage. The religious organization upholds the
"Three-Self" principles, namely, self-administration, self-support
and self-propagation, which has received enthusiastic response
from Christians all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Han Wenzao, president of the China Christian Council, said the
movement has turned the once so-called "foreign religion" into an
independent church for Christians in China.
</P>
<P>
The population of Christian believers has increased from 700,
000 in 1949 to the current 10 million, which explicitly manifests
the great success of the movement, added Priest Cao Shenjie, vice-
president of the China Christian Council.
</P>
<P>
As for the role of Western missionaries, Priest Deng Fucun,
vice-chairman of the TSPMCPCC, has his own understanding of it.
</P>
<P>
"Although some Western missionaries made contribution to the
cultural exchange between China and the Western world, in modern
history, however, evangelistic campaigns did parallel with
imperialism and colonial expansionism. Some Christian missionaries
participated in the opium trade, drafting of unequal treaties,
invasion and war," Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Deng cited a letter from Morrison, the first Protestant
missionary to preach in China, which reads that he often risked
his life participating in the opium trade for the notorious
Eastern India Company.
</P>
<P>
Deng also pointed out some Western missionaries had
participated in negotiations and drafting of the Nanjing Treaty,
the first unequal treaty that brought humiliation to the Chinese
people for over 100 years. Some missionaries served as
intelligence agents or guides for foreign invaders.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Protestant Church will stick to the 'Three-Self'
principles to facilitate the healthy development of the church,
according to the religious leaders.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Urges UN Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win
Aung has called for added impetus to the reform of the U.N.
Security Council to meet the need of the new millennium,stressing
the need to identify areas of possible agreement among member
countries.
</P>
<P>
In his statement at the 55th Session of the U.N. General
Assembly on Wednesday and officially released here on Thursday, U
Win Aung expressed dismay that some major international issues
persist to defy the collective creativity and attempts to solve
them.
</P>
<P>
He warned against letting these setbacks cast a shadow over the
credibility and effectiveness of the organization.
</P>
<P>
On the cardinal principles of the U.N. Charter which deal with
sovereignty, sovereign equality, respect for territorial integrity
and non-intervention in internal affairs, U Win Aung also
expressed great dismay at the recent tendency in some quarters,
which he said cast doubt on the continued soundness of these basic
principles.
</P>
<P>
He charged that some people are bent on compromising these
principles of international relations and support interference in
other countries' internal affairs on various grounds. He warned
that this is a dangerous trend which will have implications for
the peace and stability of the international system.
</P>
<P>
With regard to global narcotic drug problems, he emphasized
that national efforts should be supported by international
assistance and cooperation, complaining that Myanmar is combating
the global problem mainly through its own resources with the
exception of the assistance provided by the U.N. Drug Control
Program.
</P>
<P>
He also said Myanmar has been a target of unfair criticisms and
censures despite its efforts which have brought down opium
cultivation and production in the country, acknowledged by the
International Narcotics Control Board.
</P>
<P>
On the international order, he called for the respect of the
right of every nation to adopt the political, economic and social
systems which best suit its domestic context.
</P>
<P>
He warned that hegemonic tendencies and power politics would
undermine the basis of international relations and jeopardize the
system of collective security.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Pledges to Consolidate National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has chosen a path most
suitable to the country, its people and its historical
peculiarities,and is making efforts to solve the most fundamental
problem of the country, the consolidation of national unity,
Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his statement at the current session of the U.N. General
Assembly which was released here on Thursday, U Win Aung warned
that without satisfactorily resolving this basic question, the
objectives of democracy, peace, prosperity and stability will not
be realized.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that all sorts of superficial and unsubstantiated
charges are being made against Myanmar, placing every obstacle in
the country's chosen path to democracy.
</P>
<P>
He warned against giving rise to unnecessary delay in Myanmar's
current democratization process.
</P>
<P>
He argued that it was a situation of "chaos and anarchy" which
had threatened the country's survival as a state that led the
Tatmadaw (armed forces) in taking over the state power in late
1988.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that although the present government is a military
one, the country is not governed by martial law but an independent
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
Politically, he said, 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups
have returned to the legal fold. Economically, the country's gross
domestic product continues to grow year after year and its economy
registered a 10.9-percent growth last year.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the country's inflation was effectively
under control.
</P>
<P>
The minister pledged that his country will redouble efforts to
bring about peace and stability domestically.

</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- British superbike idol Carl
Fogarty announced his retirement on Thursday, five months after he
shattered his left shoulder in an accident in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Fogarty, who won a record fourth world title last season, said
in a joint statement with Ducati he had decided to retire because
he could no longer be competitive.
</P>
<P>
"The time has now come to have the strength to leave racing. I
knew that it would come sooner or later. I want to do it now and
leave everyone with the memory of a victorious Foggy with number 1
on my Ducati."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that 34-year-old Fogarty took the decision
after testing his physical condition aboard a Ducati 996 at the
Mugello circuit in Italy at the start of the week.
</P>
<P>
Fogarty won his first world title in 1994 and also took the
championship in 1995, 1998 and 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Legislator Stresses Development of Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China must adopt a new
market system for making better use of environmental protection
facilities and boosting the development of the environmental
protection industry, said Zou Jiahua, vice-chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zou made the remarks during an investigative trip, September 14-
20, concerning environmental protection in northeast China's
Liaoning Province. He visited an ecological agriculture zone and
some local enterprises that deal with sewage treatment, pollution
control, and high technologies.
</P>
<P>
Zou said Liaoning, a traditional industrial base in China, has
made considerable contributions to the country economic
development. But the province is still facing a difficult task in
environmental protection and pollution control.
</P>
<P>
"It's a common sense that we have only one earth," he said. "
Pollution will cause a direct threat to the existence of human
beings."
</P>
<P>
While developing the economy, attention must be paid to
environmental protection and pollution control, Zou pointed out.
</P>
<P>
For a long time in China, investment in urban sewage treatment
facilities mainly comes from the government. This government-
sponsored activity must be transferred to a system of commercial
management and market operation.
</P>
<P>
The scale of sewage treatment plants should adjust to local
practical situations, and the plants can sell the treated water at
reasonable price to make a profit, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
He also called government departments concerned to intensify
their efforts to make laws on environmental protection better
known to the general public while doing their best in law
enforcement.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Journalists from more than
100 Chinese media organizations today began a three-month coverage
of the law enforcement activities of China's procurators at the
grass-roots level in a bid to promote legal supervision of the
procuration system.
</P>
<P>
They will also expose incidents of malpractice that occur
inside the judiciary, according to sources at a ceremony to launch
the campaign, which is jointly sponsored by China's Supreme People
's Procuratorate (SPP) and the All-China Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
According to the SPP, the journalists are expected to report
how the procurators maintain justice and cases of judicial
corruption caused by local protectionism.
</P>
<P>
When addressing the journalists, Liang Guoqing, deputy
procurator-general of the SPP, said progress has been made in
strengthening legal supervision and safeguarding justice even at
the grass-roots level of the procuration system.
</P>
<P>
However, some unfavorable factors still stand in the way of
pursuing justice, he said, adding that it is a long-term and
arduous task to improve procurators' work at the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
An official from the All-China Journalists Association said
that the Chinese government has made consecutive efforts to combat
corruption.
</P>
<P>
He cited the execution of Hu Changqing, former deputy governor
of Jiangxi Province, and Cheng Kejie, former vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, as examples
of China's intensified crackdown on corruption.
</P>
<P>
"The procuratorial bodies have played a significant role in
bringing them down, and the media should be encouraged to play a
greater role in helping promote justice in law enforcement through
supervision," he said.

<HEADLINE> Top Think Tank Gives Advice to Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China's top think tank, the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), on Thursday explored
the way for a rapid and efficient development in western areas.
</P>
<P>
A group of economists with the CASS provided suggestions to
Bijie Prefecture, in southwest Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
As the only prefecture in the country which has regular links
with the think tank, Bijie has asked the national research body
for well-advised suggestions for six years.
</P>
<P>
Wei Houkai, a research professor with the CASS Westward
Development Research Center, said that Bijie and other poverty-
ridden areas must enhance ecological agriculture and other sun-
rising industries.
</P>
<P>
Considering the rich reserve of herbs in Bijie, Wei suggested
the area develop pharmaceutical manufacturing in the traditional
Chinese medicines. He urged instant cooperation between the area
abundant with natural resources and high-tech companies and
research bodies in big cities.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Gangming, a research professor with the CASS Under-
developed Areas Research Center, said that the westward
development should be keep in tandem with ecological protection in
local areas.
</P>
<P>
Qian Jin, an associate professor with the CASS Institute of
Economics and chief economic consultant for Bijie, suggested that
the highest academy should scheme an overall economic and social
development plan for the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Bai Gengsheng, also a CASS research professor, underscored the
importance of preservation of ethnic features in Guizhou, which is
heavily populated with ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Because of natural and historical reasons, Bijie greatly lags
behind other areas in China. Guizhou provincial government
initiated a pilot zone in 1988 in Bijie for exploring ways of
economic enhancement in poverty-hit areas.

<HEADLINE> Israel Not Rules out Deal Without Jerusalem Solution: Ben-Ami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli acting Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami Thursday said that Israel did not rule out
a partial peace deal with the Palestinians that excludes a solution
on the most difficult issue of the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, the dovish minister said for
the first time that Israel never rejected such a proposal. But such
a deal would depend on a clause in which the Palestinians will
declare the end of the conflict with the Jews, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue is the bottleneck in the Palestinian-Israeli
peace process and it had been the deal-breaker at July Camp David
summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and United States President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed the holy city as its "eternal and undivided"
capital, while the Palestinians want East Jerusalem Israel occupied
in the 1967 Mideast war as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
During and after the Camp David summit, various proposals on
Jerusalem, including "a deal minus Jerusalem," had been raised by
Egyptian, American and European officials. However, none have been
agreed upon by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly rejected a deal without the solution to
Jerusalem for fear that such an omission will lead to future
problems and will not guarantee the "end of conflict" clause in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak backtracked Wednesday night in a meeting of his
One Israel coalition activists and said that he is prepared to
consider "partial" solutions if it would move the peace process
forward.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are now waiting for a bridging proposal from the
United States, which will be presented to them at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Ben-Ami had begun their high-level consultation
meetings on the American proposals at the Defense Ministry in Tel
Aviv Thursday afternoon, according to Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Israel Foreign Ministry confirmed Wednesday that the acting
foreign minister had spoken twice by telephone with U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright Wednesday, obviously discussing the
proposal package.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat had expressed his doubt about the American proposals,
saying Thursday that they will only be "Israeli ideas on American
paper."

stages and nothing could be said with certainty. But there are
much expectations that fact will come to light as the process goes
ahead.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the movement of Kashmiri people got momentum
in 1990, incidents of bomb blasts have increased particularly in
the areas close to the Indian borders. Unfortunately the situation
indicates involvement of the neighboring country in such anti-
human activities, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP),
a Hindu outfit from India has claimed responsibility for the
Islamabad blast which killed 20 persons on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources in the Pakistan High Commission at New Delhi,
the report said an anonymous caller who introduced himself as
secretary general of an unknown group, Hindu Sena Rashtriya Sangh
Party, has claimed responsibility for the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
The caller further threatened that his organization would
conduct 50 similar blasts in the future in various places of
Pakistan, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Works Out Development Plan for Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 21 (Xinhua) --The Nigerian government has
worked out a far-reaching four-year blueprint for the country's
development of telecommunications, local media reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's cabinet, the Federal Executive Council, approved at
its weekly meeting in the capital Abuja on Wednesday a staggering
one trillion naira (about 10 billion U.S. dollar) budget for a
four-year corporate development plan for Nigerian
Telecommunications (NITEL), said the report.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Gana, Minister of Information and National Orientation,
was quoted as saying that the plan had been split into two major
phases, short-term between 2000 to 2002 and medium-term from 2002
to 2004.
</P>
<P>
According to Gana, projects that would be carried out under the
short-term program include the rehabilitation of NITEL's
deteriorating underground cables, provision of 40,000 digital
lines to Abuja and seven other state capitals.
</P>
<P>
The short-term program also includes the partial implementation
of the national optic fibber wide band transmission network,
completion of NITEL headquarters building in Abuja and the
implementation of various programs aimed at preparing NITEL for
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Under the medium-term plan, said Gana, the focus would be on
the completion of the national optic fibber backbone project,
upgrading of digital links, expansion of the digital and mobile
network, as well as the increase of lines to two million and the
expansion of internet facilities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the publication and implementation of a revised
telecommunication policy for Nigeria, the Minister of
Communications Alhaji Mohammed Arzika explained that the
government has approved the revision of the policy with the aim of
opening up markets and creating investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
Arzika also noted that Nigeria's first telecommunication policy,
launched in October last year, needs to be revised because of the
inadequacies found in it along with complaints from foreign
investors, who claimed they lacked confidence in the policy.

SEOUL, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
expressed its support for the first inter-Korean defense
ministerial meeting scheduled for next Monday in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In a 16-point joint communique released after the 32nd South

<HEADLINE> One of World's Fastest-growing Economies in 21st Century ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China is brewing another
round of economic wonder in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
There are several indications to show that China will attain
such aspirations, as the Chinese economy has already shown major
improvement at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures on the Chinese economy, announced by Qiu Xiaohua,
deputy director of the National Bureau of Statistics at the
ongoing conference of Overseas Chinese Worldwide 2000, are
positive.
</P>
<P>
The figures show a growth rate of 8.2 percent for the entire
Chinese economy in the first half of the year and for the first
eight months, industrial output rose by 11.6 percent, export
volume by 34.6 percent. China's foreign exchange reserve is now
approaching 160 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that the Chinese economy is very likely to end a
relatively tumultuous time since 1993, especially since the
outbreak of the Asian financial crisis," Qiu said. He said that "
China is capable of seeking faster and better development in the
new century."
</P>
<P>
According to a blueprint mapped out by the central government,
China will realize an annual growth rate of over seven percent in
the coming decade, and by the year 2010, will have doubled the
gross domestic output for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
If so, China will become one of the fastest-growing economies
worldwide in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Professor Fang Sheng, an economist with the Chinese People's
University, echoed the remarks.
</P>
<P>
China has quadrupled its Gross Domestic Product over the past
two decades, which has helped reduced the distance from
industrialized nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China is increasingly merging itself into the
global economy, is carrying out strategically important economic
restructuring, is speeding up the development of information
technology and is exploring the west, has paved the way for fast
economic development, said Fang.

<TEXT>
<P>
Furthermore, China's accession into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) is drawing near. Further opening-up of China
and its reforms will in turn accelerate economic development.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimates that China's WTO accession will result
in 116 billion U.S. dollars in profit for China and four million
job opportunities annually.
</P>
<P>
In another development, China's reform of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), widely viewed as essential to China's success,
is progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The marginal profit increase in the SOEs during the first eight
months of this year signaled that China is able to lift the SOEs
out of the red by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The information industry is also leaping forward in China,
maintaining a growth rate of 20 percent throughout the past decade.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has the world's second largest fixed phone
network and the third largest mobile phone network. The number of
China's Internet users has reached 16.9 million, which doubled the
number at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The international society comments that "China's Internet
economy used three years to achieve what takes other countries a
decade to achieve."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China is drafting a blueprint for the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that China will continue its current momentum. The
investment in fixed assets will increase by 10 percent annually
and the total trade volume for the coming decade will exceed two
trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Many CEOs in the world's major corporations agree that China's
huge market potential is becoming a reality to the investors.

<HEADLINE> Health of Young and Middle-Aged Workers Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- More attention must be paid
to the health of young and middle-age workers, said deputy
Minister of Health Peng Yu at today's opening ceremony of
Healthcare Campaign for Young and Middle-Aged Workers.
</P>
<P>
"As the backbone of the country's construction and family,
young and middle-aged workers should pay more attention to their
own health," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
However, a recent survey conducted by the Pfizer
Pharmaceuticals Limited shows that the health condition of young
and middle-aged workers in China needs more attention.
</P>
<P>
After testing 10,000 patients in eight regions, the survey
showed that young and middle-aged workers paid less attention to
high blood pressure than elderly people did, which directly
affects the treatment and control of the disease.
</P>
<P>
To capture the attention of the whole society about this
problem, the Ministry of Health and All-China Federation of Trade
Unions jointly organized the "Healthcare Campaign for Young and
Middle-Aged Workers."
</P>
<P>
During National Hypertension Day on October 8, local trade
unions, public health departments and infirmaries will help
measure blood pressure, grant health condition monitoring cards
and carry out health education lessons for young and middle-aged
workers.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Elderly Korean Man Wants to Help Chinese Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dongyun Education
Foundation of the Republic of Korea (ROK) is planning to set up a
special fellowship for Chinese students from poor families to
accomplish their university study.
</P>
<P>
"We are contacting the Chinese on the issue and the fellowship
is expected to be set up soon," said Lee-Seung Kyu, legal
representative of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 73, is a long-time lover of Chinese culture. "My interest
in Chinese culture began as early as 50 years ago," Lee said,
adding that the two countries are deeply linked in history and
culture.
</P>
<P>
Lee's "China Dream" came to true in 1995, when he made his
first tour to China, three years after the two countries
established diplomatic ties. Since then, Lee began to study the
Chinese language in a local university in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a Chinese girl, Lu Aihui, caught the attention
of Lee and many ROK people who are interested in the Chinese
culture. Lu beat 300 others to win first place in a lecturing
contest performed in the Korean language in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lee wrote a letter to the Chinese girl. "I never thought that
an old Korean man could write such a beautiful handwriting,"
recalled Lu.
</P>
<P>
They became pen-friends. Last July, with the help of Lee and
other ROK friends, Lu paid a month-long visit to the neighboring
country. "During my stay in ROK, I could always feel the Korean
people's friendly feelings toward the Chinese people," she wrote
in an article after the trip.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Lee and Han-Zuil, the 78-year old founder of the
foundation, came to Beijing to attend the graduation ceremony of
their "Chinese granddaughter".
</P>
<P>
Lee plans to study in the Beijing Languages and Culture
University next year, if it is possible for his health. Meanwhile,
his Chinese "granddaughter" also plans to continue her study of
Korean language in Seoul.

<HEADLINE> Family Planning Helps Promote Development of Chinese Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The family planning policy
has helped to improve people's living standards and the health of
women and children in China since it was started more than 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
China has already become a country with low population growth
rate due to the success of its family planning policy, said Chen
Shengli, director of the Department of Publicity and Education of
the State Family Planning Commission (SFPC).
</P>
<P>
If there was no family planning policy in China, 250 million
more children would have been born to 350 million families in the
country over the past 20 years, and would have cost each family an
average of 14,000 yuan (about 1,690 US dollars) to bring up these
children, according to the results of a survey which was published
by the SFPC today.
</P>
<P>
The survey which was supported by the Chinese Social Science
Fund shows that there was an average of 4.5 family members for
each Chinese family in 1980, but now there is only an average of 3.
6 people in Chinese family. Meanwhile, the percentage of small
families in China has also increased.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that fewer people in a family usually means
higher per capital income for family members.
</P>
<P>
Family planning has also reduced the cases of early marriage,
early pregnancy and reduced the number of children a woman has and
provides them with safe contraceptive measures. These have all
helped to improve the health of women and their children, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
He said family planning has enabled women to devote more time
to work, social activities, their children's education,
entertainment and rest instead of household work, and in turn, has
helped to improve women's social status.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that women in families which do not practice
family planning have to use 38 percent of their time doing
housework while women in family planning households only use 20
percent of their time for the same purpose.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
urged to further recognize the importance and urgency of
preventing and reducing juvenile crimes by educating young people.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, a member of both the Political Bureau and Secretariat
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the
remark today at a conference on the exchange of experience on the
issue, which was held in Chengdu, the capital of southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
A high proportion of Chinese criminals are young people, the
official said, stressing that the problem is still acute.
</P>
<P>
The official said that schools, families and the society are
all responsible for the education of young people. He urged all
the circles should join forces in eliminating evil social
phenomena to reduce negative impacts on youngsters.
</P>
<P>
Many of the young criminals are school dropouts, jobless people,
excessive labor from rural areas, or ex-inmates, according to the
official.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Establish Women Empowerment Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will establish
the Women Initiative Development Fund soon as a measure to improve
women's living conditions in the country, a senior official has
announced.
</P>
<P>
Tadelech Hailemichael, minister in charge of women's affairs in
the Prime Minister's Office, said Wednesday 7 million U.S. dollars
from the World Bank and the Italian government, and 18 million
birr (about 2.1 million U.S. dollars) from the Ethiopian
government have been allocated to assist the launching of the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching of State of World Population Report
2000, Hailemichael said Ethiopian women are facing a deep-rooted
attitudinal problem by the society in the form of harmful
traditional practices on women and girls.
</P>
<P>
She stressed the need for individual commitment to fighting the
challenges still making the lives of women in the country
intolerably miserable.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office has designed a big national program
to protect rights and interests of women, she said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Peace Talks Resume in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government and
the rebel movement in southern Sudan Thursday resumed their peace
talks in Baringo District, 250 kilometers north of Kenya's capital
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the current negotiations between the government
and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) will be on the
issues of separation of state and religion, autonomy for the south
and the right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government delegation, which arrived here
Wednesday, is headed by Ahmed Ibrahim et-Tahir, advisor to
Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir on peace affairs, according to
Dirdiri Ahmed, Deputy Head of the Sudanese Mission to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks are scheduled to last two weeks, Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the SPLA team is led by Nhial Deng Nhial,
the movement's secretary for foreign affairs and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development
established a sub-committee chaired by Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi in July 1997 to solve the conflict in southern Sudan, the
two sides had held three rounds of peace talks in Kenya, but no
agreement had been reached.

<HEADLINE> Some 900 Civilians Escape Rebel Control in Central Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 900 civilians have
recently escaped from areas occupied by the Angolan rebels and
arrived in a city under the government's control, the official
newspaper Jornal de Angola reported here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The exodus took place in the last 15 days in Angola's central
province of Bie, where some areas are under the control of the
rebels led by Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The escapees, who fled from the districts of Kayera, Belo,
Horizonte, Gamba and Walombo, have been resettled in Kuito, the
capital city of the Bie province.
</P>
<P>
With malnourished appearances, the escapees said they had fled
their hometowns due to the unbearable hunger and ill-treatment
inflicted by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
A recent wave of violence with kidnapping and assassinations
perpetrated by the Savimbists has reportedly increased the number
of displaced people in the Bie province, which is considered as
one of the provinces that has suffered the most serious loss in 25
years of civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some regions in the central and eastern parts of
Angola are tensely disputed by the Angolan government troops and
the rebel soldiers. Due to the inferior position, the Savimbist
rebels turned to small-scale attacks on some villages and towns,
killing residents and kidnapping young able-bodied men to
reinforce their forces.

<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>

building, the headquarters of Britain's foreign intelligence

rocket attack.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Two U.S. telecommunication groups set to introduce high-
speed internet access in Britain have abandoned their plans amid
mounting criticism of the government regulator.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- British farmers were braced Wednesday night for more attacks

cleared of criminal damage despite admitting destroying six acres
of GM maize.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:

<HEADLINE> Italian Police Probe Finds Udinese Trio Have False Passports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Three Udinese players have been
found to hold false passports following a police investigation,
Italian newspapers said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The chief constable of Udine, Giuseppe De Donna, led an
investigation into the travel documents of Brazilians Warley and
Alberto, accused of holding false passports by Polish authorities
and confirmed their Portuguese passports were false.
</P>
<P>
The duo were held at the Polish border ahead of a UEFA Cup tie
with Polonia Warsaw on September 14.
</P>
<P>
The chief constable's probe also found a third Udinese player,
18-year-old Paraguayan Alejandro Da Silva, had entered Italy with
a false Portuguese passport.
</P>
<P>
Possession of false documents can carry a jail sentence of up
to two years in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"The passports of Warley and Alberto are false," De Donna was
quoted as saying by Italian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"Also the passport of Da Salva was found to be irregular as it
was signed by the same mysterious official who signed Warley's and
Alberto's documents".
</P>
<P>
Italian soccer rules limit teams to five non-European Union (EU)
players on their squad of whom only three may be on the field at
anyone time.
</P>
<P>
However many south Americans play in Italy as "EU players"
after gaining dual nationality on the basis of family ancestry.
</P>
<P>
Udinese informed the Italian Football League that Alberto and
Warley should be counted as "non-EU" players this season.
</P>
<P>
Since returning from Poland Warley has left Udinese to join
Brazilian club Gremio on loan for one year while Alberto has also
returned to Brazil where he is attempting to gain a visa to return
to Italy.

<HEADLINE> Day-6 Roundup: Two Swimmers Double in Golds, Frenchwoman Perec Disappear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- American Lenny Krayzelburg and
Dutchwoman Inge de Bruijn both won their second swimming gold
medals as the Millennium Olympics concluded its six-day
competitions on Thursday, with a lone world record created by the
South Korean women archers in the team final.
</P>
<P>
Treble world record holder Krayzelburg, who won the 100m
backstroke on Monday, triumphed again in the 200m backstroke in an
Olympic record of one minute 56.76 seconds, becoming the third
American to sweep the Olympic backstrokes after Rick Carey in 1984
and John Naber in 1976.
</P>
<P>
De Bruijn won the 100m freestyle, denying Americans Jenny
Thompson and Dara Torres in their final attempts for an individual
gold, by touching the pad in 53.83 seconds to go with her gold in
the 100m butterfly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With another bronze, Thompson snatched her ninth Olympic medal,
beating Dawn Fraser, Kornelia Ender and Shirley Babashoff on the
all-time list in her third Olympic Games. Seven of Thompson's
medals are gold, but all of those have come in relays.
</P>
<P>
Italian Massimiliano Rosolino set an Olympic record of 1:58.98
for first place in the men's 200m individual medley, knocking
American Tom Dolan out of a medley double.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Agnes Kovacs, the 100-200m breaststroke European
champion in 1997 and 1999, walked away with the women's 200m
breaststroke title, while Qi Hui placed fourth, the best finishing
by any Chinese in the Games.
</P>
<P>
For Azerbaijan, Thursday proved to be a memorable moment as
Zemfira Meftakhetdinova awarded her country its first Olympic gold
medal in the inaugural women's skeet.
</P>
<P>
Meftakhetdinova, the 1995 world champion and 1993 European
champion, shot a perfect 25 in the final for a total of 98 hits,
which was just one short of the world record of 99.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt a series of
preferential policies for luring both domestic and foreign funds
to speed up the development of biological resources in Yunnan
Province, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiating, governor of Yunnan, disclosed that the General
Office of the State Council, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation and the Ministry of Agriculture have agreed,
in principle, that Yunnan will establish a flower export

Yunnan also plans to set up a high-tech Venture Investment
Company, to attract enterprises and financial institutions to
participate in the development of local biological resources. It
will also establish a wild plant resource base to promote the
development of local biological resources.
</P>
<P>
In the next 15 years, the governor said, Yunnan will focus on
the development of 10 industries including modern medicine,
organic and health foods, flower and the afforestation industry,
the cane sugar industry, and bio-chemicals.

<HEADLINE> China to Have Trains Capable of 186 MPH </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Changchun Passenger Railway
Car Plant, the largest plant of its kind in China, is capable of
producing high-speed trains that can reach speeds of 300
kilometers per hour (approximately 186 miles per hour).
</P>
<P>
Ma Shukun, head of the plant, said that China is developing
railway trains capable of travelling faster. His plant has grasped
the core technology of bogie, which will make it possible to
increase the speed of trains to 300 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
China's first high-speed train driven by alternating current
came off the production line at the passenger railway car plant
located in Changchun, capital city of northeast China's Jilin
Province today.
</P>
<P>
The experimental speed of the train reached 230 kilometers per
hour. The train, consisting of one locomotive and five cars, is
expected to run at a speed of 200 kilometers per hour on the
railway between Guangzhou, capital city of south China's Guangdong
Province, and Shenzhen, also in Guandong Province, in early
November.
</P>
<P>
Electric powered locomotives are considered safe, convenient,
pollution free and ideal for shuttle services between cities and
within downtown and suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
The development of high speed trains is a key state scientific
and technological project which is an essential part of the Ninth
Five Year (1996-2000) Plan.
</P>
<P>
Railway transport in China has long lagged behind the pace of
economic growth in recent years. The Ministry of Railways has been
making efforts to make trains run faster.

HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Three more Hong Kong fuel
companies have raised the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
by 11 percent, reports Hong Kong's English newspaper "iMail"
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mobil Oil, Esso and China Resources Gas increased the LPG price
in cylinders from 8.60 HK dollars (1.10 U.S. dollars) to 9.58 HK
dollars (1.23 U.S. dollars) per kilogram, following similar moves
by Caltex and Shell.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 households were estimated to have been affected by
the LPG price increase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the transport industry, one of the hardest hit by
the oil crisis, has called on the government to consider cutting
fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
Urban Taxi Drivers Association Joint Committee Chairman Kwok
Chi-piu hoped the government could reduce the fuel duty by between
30-50 HK cents (3.8-6.4 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
Drivers had been forced to pay additional 10 HK dollars (1.28 U.
S. dollars) for fuel per shift since petrol firms dropped fuel
discounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although it doesn't sound too bad, our business is actually
shrinking. We are very worried whether we can take it if fuel
prices continue to rise," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Aviation experts of Hong
Kong stressed the need to strengthen aircrew's training when they
briefed the press Thursday on the Hong Kong Aviation Conference
2000 held on September 19-20.
</P>
<P>
"The expansion of aviation industry demands steady supply of
well trained professionals in various important fields, including
aircraft maintenance, air traffic control, airport management,
aviation laws and regulatory control," said Fung Kee-ying,
professor of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University's Department of
Mechanical Engineering.
</P>
<P>
Fung's views were shared by Hogan Loh, chairman of Far East
Flying and Technical School Ltd and Ted Pryor, founding member and
immediate past chairman of the Hong Kong Historical Aircraft
Association.
</P>
<P>
The conference, organized by the university, focused on new
career opportunities for Hong Kong and attracted around 80
representatives from the aviation industry, government departments
and educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
The conference delegates endorsed the setting up of a
tripartite Aviation Development Council by the end of 2000, said
Fung.
</P>
<P>
Taking urgent steps to expand training and recruitment programs
to guarantee the safety of air services to the highest possible
standards call for the adoption of proactive policies and
institutional initiatives with close cross-sectoral cooperation
between the aviation industry, government agencies and academic
bodies, said Fung.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the International Airport of Hong Kong ranks first in
international cargo throughput, and fifth in international
passenger throughput. The facility handled 32 million passengers
and 2.2 million tons of cargo in the past 12 months with a
diversified carrier base of 65 airlines serving 130 destinations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Human Rights Articles in PNTR Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The differences between
China and the U.S. on human rights issues should be resolved
through dialogue and cooperation rather than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yuxi, spokesman from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, made the
remarks here this afternoon at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the passing of China's Permanent Normal Trade
Relations (PNTR) bill by the U.S. Senate, he noted that the
articles concerning human rights in the bill have nothing to do
with permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Sun stressed that China is resolutely opposed to the articles
concerning human rights in the bill.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the passing of the bill is in the fundamental
interests of the people of the two countries and is of great
significance to the healthy development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation for those Americans who had made
a contribution to the passage of the PNTR bill.
</P>
<P>
The human rights issue falls within the internal affairs of
each state, said Sun, adding that now the human rights conditions
in China are at the best stage in its history.
</P>
<P>
China can never accept any intervention in its internal affairs,
Sun emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China will continue to protect and
improve the people's human rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remarks at
a regular press conference today, in response to a question
requesting comments on the U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen's
proposal of increasing military exercises with countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Sun noted that the overall situation in the Asia-Pacific region
is developing towards relaxation, adding that seeking peace,
development, and cooperation has become the main policy choice by
the majority of countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, Sun said, countries in the region
should abandon the "Cold War" mentality and adopt a new security
concept based on mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and
cooperation, in order to join efforts for the peace and
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Cohen's visit to several Asian countries will be
beneficial to the peace and stability in the region", Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that "enhancing military alliances and
increasing military exercises will not be helpful to the peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
Instead, countries in the region should strengthen cooperation
and promote mutual understanding and trust, Sun said.

BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met with a U.S. Chamber of Commerce delegation led by its
President and CEO Thomas Donohue in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate passed the bill of granting China Permanent
Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status yesterday. Jiang said that it
is a major issue as well as a good thing.
</P>
<P>
He said granting China the PNTR status at an earlier date
conforms to the interest of both China and the U.S. and also
benefits global economic and trade development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for the efforts made by
President Bill Clinton and the U.S. chamber of commerce in helping
China achieve the PNTR status as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that we should deal with Sino-U.S. relations
with a long-term perspective. At the turn of the century and the
beginning of the new millennium, Jiang hopes that China and the U.
S. would take into consideration the fundamental interests of the
people of the two countries and the rest of the world, and promote
the Sino-U.S. bilateral and economic and trade relations to a new
height.
</P>
<P>
Donohue said that the passing of the bill by the U.S. Senate
with an overwhelming majority gives more room for Sino-U.S.
economic and trade cooperation. He added that the U.S. commerce
chambers will further improve the cooperation of the two countries
in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Donohue and his party are visiting China at the invitation of
the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Medicine Reduces Risk of Osteoporosis in Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conclusion is the result of a 15-day space experiment
jointly sponsored by Chinese and French researchers last year.
</P>
<P>
Li Yinghui, a researcher with the National Institute of Space
Medicine, said six laboratory boxes of bone cells were placed in a
French-made cell-fostering facilities on a recoverable satellite
owned by the Europe Space Agency (ESA) on a 15-day space flight
last October.
</P>
<P>
She told Xinhua initial results have shown that the traditional
Chinese medical compound did promote the generation of bone cells
in space.
</P>
<P>
"However, it needs additional research to determine whether the
traditional Chinese medicine works if taken by astronauts," she
added, declining to disclose its main ingredients.
</P>
<P>
The loss of bone substances is a long-term, sustained process,
which eventually leads to osteoporosis, and poses obstacles for
astronauts adapting to gravity.
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese medicine has long been effective in curing
bone injuries, said the researcher.
</P>
<P>
She said the national institute and ESA will continue to
conduct the research.
</P>
<P>
In addition, other traditional Chinese medicine will be tested
under conditions of simulated zero gravity.

<HEADLINE> China's Protestant Churches to Adhere to "Three-Self" Principles (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Protestant churches
will adhere to their "Three-Self" principles of self-
administration, self-support and self-propagation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the churches are undertaking theological studies in
order for the development of Christian churches to be compliant
with the country's socialist society.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Ding Guangxun, honorary chairman of
The Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant
Churches of China, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The 85-year old Chinese bishop, who is also vice chairman of
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the honorary chairman of the
Christian Council of China, has been in Beijing attending a
memorial conference to mark the 50th anniversary of the launching
of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement in China.
</P>
<P>
The theological studies of Chinese churches are not aimed at
changing the basic belief of Christianity but allowing new
interpretation for the basic belief and creed of the religion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, local priests are preaching in a way similar to
foreign missionaries in the 19th century and part of their
preaching is not suitable for socialist society, according to the
bishop.
</P>
<P>
As an example, he noted, local priests are insisting on the
contradiction between believers and non-believers by stressing
that the believers will ascend to Heaven but the others will
descend to Hell.

<TEXT>
<P>
This kind of preaching has made many Chinese believers very
sorrowful, as family members that do not believe in God will not
ascend to Heaven, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
In reality, there are many truthful, kind and good people who
are not Christians, he said, questioning, "Are all of these people
going to descend to the Hell?" As a result, many local priests
hope to have a reasonable explanation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant
Churches of China has set up a special group to promote the
theological studies across the country, the bishop said. The work
of the group has been warmly supported by all local believers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The group now is dealing with the issue of publication by local
Christian churches, as local Christian publishers are still
publishing articles that are not compliant with the Chinese
society, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting President Jiang Zemin as saying that religions should
be actively made compliant to the socialist society, Ding said it
is not a matter of lip service and must be done in the true sense.
</P>
<P>
"I always recall the past five decades with a thankful heart,"
said the bishop, "the Three-Self Patriotic Movement launched 50
years ago has cut off the ties of Chinese Christian churches with
imperialistic invaders and helped them get rid of the control by
foreign missionaries, which has enabled local Christians to take
the patriotic and self-reliant road."
</P>
<P>
The current theological studies in China is an inevitable
result of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement and the continued
efforts by local Christian churches to adapt to the development of
the Chinese society, he stressed.

Zhang Wenbin, director of the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage (SACH), said that while carrying out westward development
projects, the western areas must pay great attention to sustained
development and cultural relics preservation.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is strongly opposed to rampant promotion of tourism near
heritage sites at the expense of damaging relics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he underscored the protection of architecture and
traditional villages with ethnic features in the western areas,
which are heavily populated with ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, the SACH plans to complete giant
restoration projects in 15 historical sites, including the Potala
Palace, Thousand Buddhas Cave in Kizil, the Kumutula Grottos,
Temple of White Pagoda, the Great Wall Ruins during the Han
Dynasty (206 B.C. - 220 A.D.) and the Sanxingdui Ruins.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SACH will pour special funds into key academic
institutes, such as the China Relics Research Institute, Northwest
Relics Protection Center, Dunhuang Academy and Northwest
University.
</P>
<P>
Keeping abreast of infrastructure construction in coming years,
the relics organizations should focus on archaeological field work
near construction sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
The General Office of the State Council recently issued a
notice, emphasizing relics protection during westward economic
development.

<HEADLINE> China to Import 40 Million Tons of Crude, Refined Oil in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- As a major oil consumer in
the region, China is to import 40 million tons of crude and
refined products this year, Senior Vice President of the World
Petroleum Congress (WPC) Wang Tao said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is both a major oil producer and consumer
and as of the end of 1999, it was ranked the world 10th and 5th in
terms of its proven oil reserves and annual oil production of 162
million tons (3.24 million barrels per day).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Second Annual International Business Forum for
the Asia Pacific and Indonesian Oil, Gas and Energy Sectors, Wang
said that the domestic crude oil production could not satisfy the
increasing demand for the long sustainable growth since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"China has become a net oil importer. It is expected that China
will import 40 million tons of crude and refined products in 2000,
" he said, adding that the country still boasts of great potential
of hydrocarbon resources.
</P>
<P>
Wang said "As estimated in the coming 20 years, China will see
continuos increase of oil production and reserves as well as the
dramatic increase of natural gas."
</P>
<P>
Wang added that China's peak annual oil production will hit 200
million tons, representing 1.3 percent average increasing rate.
The country's demand for crude oil will be increased about 4
percent in average if the GDP grows at 7 percent supposed rate. "
It is very clear that domestic supply alone is not sufficient and
imports should be added."

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Bank Announces 25-Year Debt Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's
infrastructure investment bank -- Bank Pembangunan &AMP;
Infrastructure Malaysia Bhd(BPIMB) Thursday announced a program to
issue Infrastructure Notes of five billion ringgit (1.31 billion U.
S. dollars) with a maturity of 25 years to support its lending
activities.
</P>
<P>
The BPIMB's five billion ringgit (1.31 billion U.S. dollars)
debt program is the longest duration benchmark issuance in the
local bond market and the largest non-restructuring program in
Malaysia to date and it is the BPIMB's maiden fund-raising program.
</P>
<P>
The bank is expected to launch its debut issue in the near
future and it will be available to foreign and domestic investors
alike.
</P>
<P>
"According to our plan, the program is just one of a series to
be carried out," because this is not enough as a total of 26 new
infrastructure projects involving a total loan requirement of 10
billion ringgit (2.63 billion U.S. dollars) has been earmarked
under the second phase of the bank's financing plan for such
ventures in 2000 and 2001, the bank's Executive Chairman Aris
Othman told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank expected its infrastructure loan portfolio to
grow to 30 billion ringgit (7.89 billion U.S. dollars) by the year
2005 against 2.8 billion ringgit (0.73 billion U.S. dollars) at
the end of August 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the first phase of its infrastructure project financing
program, a total of 12 projects carrying a combined value of five
billion ringgit (1.31 billion U.S. dollars) were financed in such
areas as port, rail, highway and regional development.
</P>
<P>
The funding for the first phase projects came from two sources,
through loans from the Employees Provident Fund and the Japan Bank
of International Cooperation worth 4.5 billion ringgit (1.18
billion U.S. dollars) fully guaranteed by the Malaysian government,
and through an increase in the bank's paid-up capital from 105.5
million ringgit (27.76 million U.S. dollars) to one billion
ringgit (0.26 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Aris added that in BPIMB's fund sourcing plan, it would
progressively reduce its reliance on the government.

<HEADLINE> Trade Relation Between Vietnam, China Develops: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Economic and trade relation
between Vietnam and China has seen significant development with
the two way trade volume standing at 1.345 billion U.S. dollars in
the first seven months of 2000, Vietnamese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Thanh said that the two countries are
striving hard to increase the two way trade to two billion U.S.
dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, she said, China including Hong Kong has had 375
investment projects with a total investment volume of 3.35 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Concerning Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai's upcoming
working visit to China, the spokeswoman said that the main purpose
of the visit is to review trade and economic cooperation between
the two countries during the past year since the official visit to
Vietnam by Chinese Prime Minister in December 1999; discuss
directions and measures to further promote bilateral trade and
economic relations in the coming time.
</P>
<P>
While answering a question on Vietnam's reaction to the fact
that the U.S. Senate has approved the permanent normal trading
relation (PNTR) status for China, Thanh said that the U.S. Senate
has made a right decision.
</P>
<P>
This serves the interests of both the United State and China,
she noted, adding that Vietnam hopes that China and the United
States as two big economies will contribute more positively to the
world economy as well as to peace, stability and development in
the region and the world over.

<HEADLINE> World Disarmament Conference Ends, Key Divisions Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The 2000 session of the
Conference on Disarmament (CD) ended here Thursday with members
divided over key issues like nuclear disarmament and the
prevention of an arms race in outer space.
</P>
<P>
"My consultations so far have confirmed that we are still short
of a compromise on a program of work for the CD," said the
president of the current session, Ambassador Celso Amorim of
Brazil, in his closing remarks.
</P>
<P>
"There are two (issues) -- nuclear disarmament and the
prevention of an arms race in outer space -- that have still to be
tackled further."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Amorim said, there have also been some "
promising signs" in the CD since the session resumed on August 7.
He believed that out of the two outstanding issues on the CD's
draft program of work, the one on nuclear disarmament seems to be
a little closer to convergence of positions now than it was about
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The CD president also thanked all members for their "positive
attitude" in preparing the CD Annual Report to the United Nations
General Assembly and their goodwill for overcoming the hurdles
that the conference is facing.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the open, pragmatic and cooperative
consultations would go on to prepare a good beginning for the 2001
session.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 session was divided into three parts. The first part
was from January 17 to March 24 and the second from May 22 to July
7.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Wins Battle of Olympic Champions in Men's Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazil convincingly won the
matchup of the two previous gold medalists in the Olympic men's
volleyball on Thursday when they snuffed out the Dutch challenge
in three straight sets 25-20, 25-17 and 27-25.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians' performance illustrated the versatility of
their players, and the potential of the team to make a serious run
at the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Brazil was on fire form the start of the first set, racing to a
4-1 lead behind two huge blocks by Gustavo Endres, and they
maintained the lead with great hitting from Dante Amaral.
</P>
<P>
The Ducth steadied, but could never reduce the early lead of
the Brazilians, with their huge block failing to have an impact.
The South Americans finished the set with five blocks to a single
Dutch one.
</P>
<P>
The second set opened with the Brazilian team in full fight.
Libero player Gilmar Teixeira made spectacular saves and precise
service reception. With his receives handling the Dutch serves
easily, Brazilian setter Mauricio Lima utilised all his teams
attacking options.
</P>
<P>
The South Americans established a commanding 14-8 lead behind
Dutch errors and two Amaral jump serve aces. A frustrated and
disorganised Dutch team changed ends two sets down.
</P>
<P>
A combination of Dutch blocking and Brazilian distraction saw
the Netherlands race away to a 9-4 lead in the third set.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian captain Nalbert Bitencourt in particular was guilty
of several uncharacteristic unforced errors. Brazil closed the
gap but the Dutch needed only to sideout to win the set at 24-23,
but Bitencourt produced a spectacular solo stuff block to redeem
his earlier errors and keep his team alive.
</P>
<P>
Two points later, it was Bitencourt who produced another huge
block for 27-25 to end the match.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's youngest player Amaral finished the match with 19
spike winners from 30 attempts and added three jump serve aces and
two blocks to his contribution.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians now look a class above the rest of Pool A as
they prepare for their next game against Spain, while the
Netherlands go on to meet Egypt on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Takes Measures to Save Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government has put
forward an energy-saving plan as the crude oil costs are soaring,
local media reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a part of the plan, the Commerce Ministry announced Wednesday
that the street lamps across the island are to be fitted with
fluorescent bulbs, which use 75 percent less energy than standard
bulbs. By this, it is expected to save about 1 million Cyprus
pounds (1.5 million U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, households are also asked to use the energy-saving
fluorescent variety.
</P>
<P>
The Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) is to offer its
customers two fluorescent bulbs at the price of one.
</P>
<P>
Households and businesses that manage to cut their electricity
consumption by 15 percent between November and February, compared
to the same period last year, will be given free fluorescent bulbs
by the EAC.
</P>
<P>
Another measure will be to get EAC experts to assess energy use
in all government offices in an effort to minimize wastage.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Commerce Ministry has also announced plans to look into
extending its subsidy system for renewable energy projects. The
ministry currently pays 30 percent of the cost of installing solar
or wind power installations in the farming, tourism and industrial
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Another energy saving way eyed by the Commerce Ministry is the
strict enforcement of road speed limits, because "vehicle fuel
consumption rises meteorically at speeds of over 90 km/hour".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus also plans to promote greater use of public transport by
students and the public in general. The possibility of busing to
and from the airports is also being studies.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil imports are expected to cost the island 300 million
pounds (450 million dollars) this year, compared to 150 million
pounds (225 million dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Petrol pump prices in Cyprus, now linked to the price of crude
on international markets, have already gone up and are expected to
rise further.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Take Energy-Saving Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government, fearing
that the current energy shortage will render the coming winter cold
and dark, decided to convene Thursday to take energy-saving
measures in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Some officials worried that this winter will be a nightmare when
heating requirements and long nights will make energy demand, which
increases 8.5 percent per year, even higher and exceed existing
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting will discuss measures to prevent any
possible electricity shortage in the winter and mitigate the
pressure imposed on the country by rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Cumhur Ersumer has
proposed an energy-saving package, including changing working hours
and decreasing electricity usage in advertisement billboards on the
streets and business places, Turkish Daily News reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting, energy officials will inform ministers
of the urgency of the problem in the energy sector in a bid to seek
help from the chambers of commerce, industry and profession in
implementing such measures.
</P>
<P>
The government will also import 45 million cubic meters of
supplementary natural gas from Russia, and increase the purchase of
electricity from Russia, Georgia and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Some officials blamed the energy crisis on a long period of
insufficient investment by the government in the power sector,
urging the government to complete power projects under discussion
or under way as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Move on in Combating Rampant Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
will push forward its drive to combat rampant corruption, a '
cancer' that has taken root in the society, Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international business forum here, Darusman said,
"The attorney general office (AGO) has a direct role to contribute
to this (combating corruption)."
</P>
<P>
"We are progressing well in investigating cases concerning KKN
(a local acronym for corruption, collusion, and nepotistic
practices) which involved former president Soeharto and cronies,
errant bankers, recalcitrant debtors and corrupt public officials,
" Darusman said, adding that the trial process of former President
Soeharto would be a symbol of the supremacy of law in the country.
</P>
<P>
"But we are facing with an existing archaic legal system that
can not fully respond to the offenses that have taken place during
the past three decades of neglect in the rule of law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The judicial system is in desperate need of a total overhaul
if confidence in the judicial system is to be restored," he said.
</P>
<P>
Darusman said that corruption is not limited to the judiciary.
But it is endemic in the society and reinforced by the Soeharto's
government and its KKN practices in the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
"We should not continue to tolerate corruption,"' Darusman said,
adding that "The recent high profile cases of senior party
officials in China being sentenced to death for corruption must be
a grim reminder that we must act decisively to remove this malaise
(corruption from our society."
</P>
<P>
Darusman also said that an anti-corruption strategy and an
action program are being developed that will deal with this issue
in a comprehensive manner. "We plan to present a 'White paper' on
corruption to parliament early next year outlining the state of
corruption and offer a strategy and an action program that can
help to eliminate over time, this 'cancer' that has taken root in
our society.

MOSCOW, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen took a
number of people hostage Thursday in a hotel in southern Russia,
demanding 30 million U.S. dollars in ransom and the release of all
ethnic Chechens in Russian prisons, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The police said the gunmen were Chechen extremists, according
to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
Special police forces have occupied the first floor of the
building in the Lazarevskoye village, 60 kilometers away from
Sochi, a famous resort off the Black Sea, and exchanged fire with
the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
There is contradictory information about the number of hostages.
While the Ministry for Civil Defense and Emergencies said that
seven people had been taken hostage, the Krasnodar police said
that more than 30 people were kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
The Krasnodar Territory is located west of Russia's breakaway
republic of Chechnya, where federal troops launched a campaign a
year ago to root out rebels.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Might Face New Economic Crisis: Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of Korean
Industries (FKI) Thursday warned that South Korea could suffer a
second economic crisis due to economic instability caused by
soaring oil prices, a declining stock market, financial turmoil
and other economic problems.
</P>
<P>
In a press release after an emergency meeting on pending
economic issues at the FKI council Thursday, the FKI urged
nationwide cooperation to overcome current economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
It defined eight initiatives in this respect, asking all firms
to return to their vigilant posture taken immediately after the
financial crisis triggered by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans
of financial institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The FKI appealed to the government to complete its corporate
restructuring by the end of this year while urging the National
Assembly to enact 32 pending import economic bills, including the
financial holding company law, special tax treatment control law,
restructuring investment corporation law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it called on the government to sell financially
troubled Daewoo Auto as quickly and openly as possible in
accordance with market principles.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it said, all South Korean companies have to make
efforts to obtain an accurate assessment of their enterprise from
individual investors as the real value of many of them seem to be
currently devalued despite the positive results from the
reconstruction work over the past two and half years.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung voiced his
concerns over the economic situation at a weekly cabinet meeting
as "there are external forces we can do little about such as the
high oil prices, the U.S. stock market, the Daewoo case and the
fall in semiconductor prices."
</P>
<P>
However, the president said his government would put first
priority to stabilizing financial markets as financial flow is
important for the South Korean economy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Men's Weighlifters May Return Home Empty-Handed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese men's weightlifters
could return home from the Sydney Olympic Games without a single
gold medal, Chinese team headcoach Yang Hanxiong said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China remains only one lifter to compete in Friday's men's 77
kilograms category, where Zhan Xugang who won a gold medal in the
70-kg category four years ago in Atlanta will be China's last
chance to take a gold in the men's event.
</P>
<P>
"He is ready but could not guarantee the gold medal," Yang told
Xinhua. "Zhan injured his back last year and recovered very well
but I think he will be difficult for the gold."
</P>
<P>
Zhan placed fourth with a total of 365 kilograms in the last
year's world championships that could make him rank second in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Zlatan Vanev tops the world rankings with a combined 372.5
kilograms. The Bulgaria was the former world champion and in 1998
and European champion this year.
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian will be Zhan's arch-rival and Zhan has to face a
hard-fought competition tomorrow," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Following the hot favourite Vanev, Badr Saelem of Qatar, Victor
Mitrou of Greece and Khalatur Kyapanaktshyan of Armenia are also
aiming at winning the Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
"It's possible for China not to take even single gold here. We
must admit that we are weaker than four years ago when we won two
gold medals," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Before the Games China pins the gold medal hope on the men's 62-
kg class, but with Shi Zhiyong's quit because of his injury in
wrists which he suffered him for nearly two months, Le Maosheng
didn't perform well in the class and took only fifth.  China also
sent four other men's lifters in Sydney. In the men's 56-kg class,
Wu Wengxiong won the silver and Zhang Xiangxiang took bronze.
While Zhang Guozheng finished fourth in the 69-kg.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women's lifter Ding Meiyuan will face the challenge
from Wrobel Agata of Poland, who set world record for the jerk in
the over-75 kilograms category last April.
</P>
<P>
If Ding wins the title China will be the country to sweep all
the golds allowed to take part in the women's weightlifting
competition.
</P>
<P>
"It counts 50 percent for Ding to take this gold medal in the
over-75," Chinese women's head coach Zhang Wenxi said.

<HEADLINE> Krayzelburg Becomes Third American to Win Backstroke Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Lenny Krayzelburg dominated
the 200m backstroke from start to finish to pick up his second
Olympic backstroke gold in an Olympic record of 1:56.76 at the
Olympic Games here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Krayzelburg, the world record holder, is the third American to
win both dorsal events in an Olympic Games. John Naber managed
the double win in 1976, and Richard Carey won both in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Krayzelburg's time was 0.51 seconds faster than his own Olympic
record, which he set in the semifinals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited but really exhausted," said Krayzelburg, "
It's a very emotional experience."
</P>
<P>
Teammate Aaron Peirsol took the silver in 1:57.35, over a
second behind the leader. At 17, Peirsol was the youngest swimmer
in the field, and is the youngest male ever to swim the 200m
backstroke under two minutes.
</P>
<P>
"It's such a relief it's over," said Peirsol, "I got the silver,
but I still get to get up there for the U.S. national anthem."
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm getting to a point where over time I'm becoming
more of a threat to him (Krayzelburg) and I think he knows that."
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to Matt Welsh of Australia with a
personal best of 1:57.59.
</P>
<P>
Welsh said that "It's pretty amazing. Coming out of the last
turn, I knew exactly where everyone was, and I knew it would come
down to Aaron and I touching. I am rapped for a medal, and I
expected to go well, but not that well."

<P>
SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China defeated Cuba 7-0
Thursday to stay in the front-running to beat gold medal favorites
the United States into the bottom half of the medal ranking
countback for the Olympic Games women's softball play-offs.
</P>
<P>
China took full advantage of poor pitching by Yamila Degrase of
Cuba who gave up eight hits, including single homeruns to Deng
Xiaoling and Yan Fang.
</P>
<P>
China scored five of their seven runs in the third inning when
Yamila Degrase loaded the bases before walking in a run and
allowing another on a wild pitch before three consecutive hits.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Cuban relief pitcher Estela Milanes, who only
entered the game in the fifth inning, recorded five strikeouts
from six batters faced.
</P>
<P>
China's pitcher Qin Xuejing was consistent and did not allow
any hits. An error by third base player Tao Hua was the only
blemish in an otherwise perfect game for China.
</P>
<P>
China will try to maintain its polished performance against
Australia Friday and captain Wang Ying said that won't be a
problem.
</P>
<P>
"We feel confident because we beat the United States last night.
It shouldn't be too hard to beat Australia," said Wang after the
match.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official: Chinese Economy Starts Turning for The Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has survived
the most difficult period since the Asian financial crisis and is
heading upward, as shown through every economic indicator, a
senior Chinese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, deputy director of the State Statistics Bureau,
told the ongoing Overseas Chinese Worldwide 2000 Conference that
the "Chinese economy has shown a major turn for the better."
</P>
<P>
China's economy registered a growth rate of 8.2 percent during
the first half of this year, and in the first eight months, the
industrial output value increased by 11.1 percent, sales volume by
9.9 percent, export volume by 34.6, and financial revenues by 10.9
percent, according to Qiu.
</P>
<P>
The performance of industrial enterprises has improved and
state-owned enterprises (SOE) have reported a marginal increase in
profit, which signaled that "China can accomplish its target of
getting SOEs out of red within three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiu attributed the favorable signs to correct macro-adjustment
policies as well as the improvement in global economy.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, China has maintained a growth rate
of no less than eight percent, and the framework for a socialist
market economy has been initially established, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiu believed that the Chinese economy will be able to maintain
sustained, rapid, healthy development in the new century so long
as China handles some key issues properly like the relationship
between investment and consumption, and the relationship between
the government and the market.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Inspects Fire Fighting System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A positive result has been
reported for an inspection of the fire fighting system of major
shopping centers and hotels in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The inspection, which started last night, was aimed at dozens
of key units, such as the Palace Museum, Beijing Hotel and the
Wangfujing business district in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The inspected units attached great importance to fire fighting,
as overnight patrol and supervision were strengthened. All fire
fighting equipment and alarm systems were reported as being
effective.
</P>
<P>
The inspection was conducted before Beijing celebrates the 51st
anniversary of the founding of new China on October 1. Two more
such inspections will be done in the following week.
</P>
<P>
Du Zhaogang, vice head of the fire fighting department, said
that fire fighting responsibilities will be tough for firemen
because the National Day vacation lasts seven days and Beijing
will receive a large number of tourists during this period.
Beijing is also scheduled to host a series of international events
before the National Day.
</P>
<P>
Shopping malls, furniture stores, busy streets, parks, scenic
spots, enterprises producing explosives and places for mass
amusement have been listed as the key units for the inspections
next week.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has reported 308 fire accidents in August alone, an
increase of 94 cases over the same period last year. The fires
caused 506,000 yuan (60,964 U.S. dollars) worth of economic losses.
Three leading causes for these fires were electric faults,
inadvertent use of fire and illegal operation.

<P>
ANKARA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- In Senir Village of Turkish southern Isparta province, the
parents of high school students started a campaign for dismissal of
blind philosophy teacher Ibrahim Er from the village school.
</P>
<P>
Isparta Governor Ibrahim Dasoz condemned those who started the
campaign, saying that "the teacher will remain in the school, he is
very successful. Maybe he is disabled, but those who fight with him
are more blind than him."
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- According to a recent poll by Milliyet, the ratio of those
who do not want Turkey to join the European Union is only 9.9
percent while most people agree that Turkey should join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- The research carried out in Marmara by the French ship "Le
Suroit" showed that the Marmara fault line has two parts. In a
possible quake, this fault will probably be broken in two pieces or
one piece.
</P>
<P>
Seismologists said that if it is broken in two pieces, the
magnitude of the earthquake will be less than 7.0 on the Richter
scale. But if it is broken in one piece, its magnitude can be 7.6
on the Richer scale.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Ministry of Energy will bring onto agenda in
Thursday's cabinet meeting the package of measures for electricity
savings.
</P>
<P>
Some people blamed the current energy shortage to the dependence
of the government on the private sector and lack of enough
investment in the public sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Blood donation of those
possibly exposed to mad cow disease between 1980 and 1996 is
banned in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The indefinite ban was announced Thursday under which people
who have lived in the United Kingdom for six months during the
height of the "mad cow" disease epidemic, between 1980 and 1996,
would be stopped from donating blood, according to the Australian
Associated Press (AAP).
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a British medical research showed that mad cow disease
can be transmitted in sheep by blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
The ban will be phased in over the next three months and could
affect up to 30,000 people and would result in a 5.3 percent drop
in blood donations, AAP reported.

<HEADLINE> American Hostage Calls for Ceasefire in Sulu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- American hostage Jeffrey
Schilling held by the Abu Sayyaf group in the southern Philippine
island province of Sulu appealed to President Joseph Estrada for
ceasefire to secure his immediate release from the bandits, a TV
report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The voice of Schilling, who earlier was reported dead two days
after President Estrada announced the military assault, was
recorded by a radio station in the nearby city of Zamboanga
calling for ceasefire, the ABS-CBN TV station said.
</P>
<P>
The American captive asked Estrada to talk with the United
States government and resume negotiation for his release and halt
the military operations in Jolo, Sulu, the ABS-CBN added.
</P>
<P>
Despite earlier denials by military officials, Schilling
insisted that many innocent civilians have been trapped and
affected at the start of the military assault against the Abu
Sayyaf group.
</P>
<P>
Schilling was abducted by the bandit group on August 28 and

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Pledges to Deal With East Timor Issue Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 21 (Xinhua) - Indonesian Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman here Thursday said that the government will deal
with the difficult issue on East Timor quickly and decisively in a
bid to continue its efforts to restore international confidence.
</P>
<P>
"To restore international confidence, we have to deal with the
difficult issue on East Timor quickly and decisively. The East
Timor problem has been our 'Achilles heel' since the early 1970s,"
he said at an international business forum here.
</P>
<P>
Darusman said the international publicity on the recent murder
of U.N. workers and East Timorese living in refugee camps in West
Timor, has sustained international attention and passionate
calling for early resolution of the problems with the new nation.
</P>
<P>
"The government has committed publicly to deal with East Timor
and the refugee problems equitably and respect international
concerns," Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been facing with possible international sanction
due to "its disappointing response" to the bloody incident in
Atambua, West Timor, in which three U.N. staff members were killed
by East Timorese militias.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. passed a resolution which urges the Indonesia
government to disarm and disband all militia elements.
</P>
<P>
United States Secretary of Defense William Cohen who visited
Indonesia last week also indicated that the failure of the
Indonesian government in dealing with the East Timorese problem as
well as prosecuting those responsible in the Atambua's incident
will have consequences for Jakarta's relations with the
international community and could jeopardize continued financial
assistance to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Darusman also said that the Attorney General Office
has to bring to trial those who were responsible for the violence
in East Timor following its independence elections, adding that
the Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) has identified the
responsible persons and parties involved.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that those responsible for the murder and
destruction in East Timor should be held accountable and
appropriately dealt with under the law," Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
This is an important signal to the international community that
Indonesia is trying to restore the supremacy of law, he added.
</P>
<P>
In connection with the killers of international workers in
Atambua, Darusman disclosed that the police have identified as
many as 13 suspects who were allegedly responsible for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
"We will prosecute them as soon as we can," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
An early and successful resolution to the East Timor problem
will help restore international confidence and allow all parties
to move ahead and focus on assistance to help East Timor in
realizing its goals, he said.

<HEADLINE> Most Ugandans Support Movement System: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide survey has shown
that 84 percent of adult Ugandans support the retention of the
Movement system while 37 percent want a simultaneous adoption of a
multiparty system, the New Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Respondents gave President Yoweri Museveni a performance rating
of 93 percent and the parliament 52 percent, according to the
survey report released here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The findings also show that Ugandans trust the National
Resistance Movement more than political parties.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 72 percent of respondents are still
willing to give the present political system "more time to solve
inherited problems" but 22 percent of them think that "if our
system of government can't produce results soon, we should try
another system."
</P>
<P>
About half of men and two-thirds of women surveyed think that a
woman ought to be able to become President of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The donor-funded survey was conducted shortly before the June
29 referendum. The survey team leader is Michael Bratton, a
political science professor at Michigan State University in the

NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has hailed  relations between Kenya and neighboring Uganda as
cordial and called for further strengthening of the ties.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda enjoys a very special place in our hearts and in our
history. You will, of course, need no reminding that our two
countries share a common colonial past -- and a border,
arbitrarily drawn, which divided our people," Moi said here
Wednesday night when addressing a state banquet in honor of
visiting Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that over the years "relations between Kenya and
Uganda have strengthened considerably".
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president also said his country has highly valued
Uganda as a key trade and investment partner.
</P>
<P>
Museveni arrived in the Kenya capital Nairobi for the Burundi
peace talks Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
In early 1990s, the relations between Kenya and Uganda were
once strained due to the alleged harboring of Kenya's anti-
government groups in Uganda but the two countries reconciled soon
in mid-1990s.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people have died
and several others admitted in health units in western Ugandan
following an escalation of malaria and cholera cases last week,
the New Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The most affected areas were the camps for the displaced in
Bundibugyo district, health workers said, attributing the
persistence of malaria to the abundance of water in the camps
which provides a breeding place for mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
A health worker seeking anonymity said at least two people die
every day of either malaria or cholera.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to arrest the situation but we are still
overwhelmed by the numbers of people in the camps," the worker
said, adding that all they are doing now is to minimize the number
of deaths in the camps.
</P>
<P>
Lina Milner, head of the Bundibugyo office of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, said the organization is supplying
medicine to over 15 health units in the district to fight the

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Give Kenya Army 5.2 Million U.S. Dollars for Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States will give
Kenyan army 5.2 million U.S. dollars for training during the next
12 months in order to make them more responsive to the continent's
numerous crises, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The money will be distributed under the umbrella of the U.S.-
sponsored African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI), which is
designed to improve the professionalism of African troops and
promote regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"People know their neighborhood best," said a U.S. official
here on condition of anonymity, noting that "we had two problems
in Somalia. One, we didn't know the neighborhood and the other is
logistical."
</P>
<P>
In 1993, 18 American soldiers were killed in Somalia following
U.S. intervention in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Since ACRI was set up in July 1997 as what the U.S. State
Department termed "the U.S. president's training initiative", the
United States has spent 77 million dollars on the program. For the

financial year 2001, 20 million dollars has been budgeted.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. State Department, ACRI's long-term
objective is to train 12,000 African soldiers to carry out
peacekeeping and humanitarian mission on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Countries which have signed up to the initiative are Uganda,
Senegal, Malawi, Mali, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Benin.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Benefit from Global Vaccine Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and 12 other countries
will be the first group of beneficiaries from the Global Fund for
Children's Vaccines, the government-run newspaper Kenya Times
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Global Fund will give more than 150 million U.S. dollars
worth of vaccines over five years to improve immunization programs
in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the 13 countries will be able to immunize 4
million children against hepatitis B by the end of 2001 and over
600,000 children who have never received any immunization will now
be protected.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 10 percent increase in basic immunization
coverage in these countries, and more than 100,000 lives will be
saved every year due to the initial grants.
</P>
<P>
The Global Fund award process is designed to efficiently
channel resources to developing countries' health systems and
around 98 percent of the current Fund resources will go directly
to national immunization programs.
</P>
<P>
The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization estimates
that at present, vaccines save about 3 million children every year,
but another 3 million die of lack of immunization.
</P>
<P>
Measles, virtually unseen in rich countries today, still kills
1 million children in the developing world every year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Provides Money to Buy Grain From Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
given the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) 5.4 billion Zimbabwean
dollars (over 100 million U.S. dollars) to help the parastatal
raise money to buy 1 million tons of grain from local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Minister Joseph Made
told reporters in Harare on Wednesday that the money would enable
the financially troubled company to issue grain bills and raise
the required money on the market.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiations going between his ministry and the
Finance and Economic Development Ministry were completed on
Wednesday, making it possible for the GMB to buy maize as a
residual buyer and for its strategic grain reserve.
</P>
<P>
"It is important because grain in communal areas is not
protected from weevils and other pests and we can not delay any
longer in acquiring the grain," he said.
</P>
<P>
Calling upon farmers to immediately deliver the crop, Made said
the GMB must quickly put in place mechanisms to receive all the
grain that would be supplied.
</P>
<P>
He said farmers have been impatient with the GMB because it
does not have money to buy their crops and that their efforts and
patience must be complemented.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, he is going to meet the GMB board
and senior management to improve the parastatal's effectiveness so
as to ensure that the mistake of failing to buy maize, especially
from communal farmers, is not repeated.
</P>
<P>
The country is also considering exporting maize to Mozambique,
East Africa and other drought hit areas in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Serious financial problems have forced the GMB to suspend the
buying of maize, which resulted in 1.6 million tons of maize lying
idle in communal areas under threat from rain and pests.

Communication issues were generally lower, while the three
banks -- Fuji Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Industrial Bank of
Japan, which will launch the Mizuho Financial Group on September
29, attracted a lot of buying before their delisting Friday from
the stock exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
expressed its support for the first inter-Korean defense
ministerial meeting scheduled for Monday in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a 16-point joint
communique with his South Korean counterpart, Cho Sung-tae, that
he hoped the forthcoming inter-Korean defense ministerial meeting
will discuss substantial measures to build military confidence
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The document was released Thursday after the 32nd South Korean-
U.S. Security Consultative Meeting between Cohen and Cho.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Cohen and Cho assessed the positive development
on the Korean Peninsula since the historic inter-Korean summit in
Pyongyang on June 13-15.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expected that active implementation of the South-
North Joint Declaration signed by South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung and Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim
Jong Il will bring about broad cooperation and a fundamental
reduction of tensions on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides said that the DPRK's alleged chemical,
biological, nuclear and long-range missile programs continue to
pose a threat to regional security. They agreed that the South
Korean-U.S. military alliance should be maintained on the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit and has met
with South Korean President Kim, said that Kim wants U.S. troops
to stay in South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate Down After Olympic Games Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Games in Sydney
has brought down the crime rate, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the number of crimes reported in the city
center is down 20 per cent on the same time a year ago despite the
daily influx of hundreds of thousands of people. "It's incredible,
"the spokesman said, praising orderly and fun-loving Olympic fans.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the huge number of policemen deployed
at the Olympic Park spend most of their time sitting around. Some
2,000 police officers are on hand to keep order at the games.
</P>
<P>
Fans are in great spirits, and no one makes trouble, according
to the spokesman. He speculated that Australia's good performance
at the games might have something to do with this.
</P>
<P>
But the goodwill of the Olympics does not mean that greater
Sydney has turned into a crime-free zone. Earlier this week,
leading jeweller Jim Kouts was relieved of a handful of diamonds
by con artists posing as rich Games visitors.
</P>
<P>
The assailants, who Kouts said claimed they were from"the royal
family of Dubai", made off with diamonds worth 150,000 Australian
dollars (82,500 U.S. dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Jun and Gao Ling of
China staged a brave comeback to beat their Indonesian rivals for
the mixed doulbes badminton title at the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pair collected just one point in the first set of
the match against Tri Kusharyanto and Minarti Timur. But they
never gave up and fought back to take the second and third sets 15-
13, 15-11.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians had beaten their Chinese opponents twice this
year. But Zhang and Gao were a different proposition in the
second, playing much more aggressively and took the set 15-13.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese combination continued their run by building a 4-0
lead in the decider, but the Indonesians narrowed the gap to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
At the crucial point, Zhang was reaching incredible heights to
rain down fierce smashes at Timur took seven points in a row to 11-
3.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians fought back to trail 11-13.
</P>
<P>
But a net cord took the Chinese to the brink and an overhit
Kusharyanto return made them Olympic champions.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Face New Challenges, Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China's township
enterprises must speed up establishment of modern enterprise
system and upgrade the overall quality to meet future challenges.
</P>
<P>
Qi Jingfa, Chinese vice-minister of Agriculture, said that the
pro-active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy that China has
adopted for many years will directly or indirectly stimulate
development of the township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The country's massive "go-west movement" will create many new
business opportunities for these farmer-managed enterprises, said
Qi at an economic and trade fair held recently in central China's
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Qi said that research institutes, colleges and universities
have becoming more swift in turning their research achievements
into products. That will provide more chances for township
enterprises to upgrade their products with advanced technologies
provided by these research organizations.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises will become more competitive in the field
of labor-intensive industries since the labor cost is relatively
low in China's rural areas. This will serve as an edge of the
township enterprises over other enterprises once China enters the
WTO, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's township enterprises chalked up profits of 272.4
billion yuan during the first half of this year, up 14 percent
over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
They have exported goods valued at 342.6 billion yuan, a 16
percent increase over the same 1999 period.
</P>
<P>
Many provinces have created industrial zones to accommodate
township enterprises, helping the rural firms establish an
efficient organizational structure.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen Mayor Yu Youjun is
dedicated to attracting more overseas investors to Shenzhen in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
While addressing a function Wednesday to showcase the
development of foreign businesses in the past two decades, Mayor
Yu set the city's goal of attracting 20 billion U.S. dollars worth
of overseas investment in the next five years, equivalent to the
total overseas investment into the southern city since it became a
special economic zone on August 26, 1980.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that they would speed up the development of
information infrastructure, improve urban civil works, perfect the
legal environment, transform governmental functions by perfecting
working style and improve work efficiency and service quality.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, Shenzhen had been home to 12,000 overseas-financed
businesses. Last year, the industrial output value created by
overseas manufacturing enterprises in Shenzhen accounted for 78.2
percent of the city's total and their exports made up 53.6 percent
of the city's total.

<HEADLINE> Increased Productive Forces Leaves Room for Agricultural Restructuring in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About three million hectares of farmland will be turned into
forest and pasture to protect environment in western China.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government recalled the policy of purchasing
agricultural products of low quality at protective prices.
</P>
<P>
More attention should be paid to improving agricultural
restructuring and rural economy structure and to developing
quality and high-efficient agriculture, at a time when there is
enough grain storage, experts suggest.
</P>
<P>
During the first four years of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), China produced 504.85 million tons of grain annually.
The composite agricultural productive forces have remained stable
above 500 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Xiaoqing, an official of State Development
Planning Commission, 480 million tons of grain can meet domestic
demand. Agricultural products' supply and demand have moved from
insufficiency into a new phase of balance and surplus.
</P>
<P>
To adapt to the market change, the government began to
restructure the nation's agriculture. As a result, the ratio of
grain acreage to crops area dropped from 73 percent in 1995, the
last year of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, to 72 percent in 1999,
while area sown to cash crops and forage increased considerably.
</P>
<P>
Crop production except cotton dropped during the Ninth Five-
Year period, and the annual production of grain, oil, sugar, meat,
aquaculture products has increased compared with that in the
Eighth Five-Year period, according to latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile per capita farm produce has been on the rise, with
grain growing from 387 kilograms in 1995 to 406 kilograms in 1999,
and consumption of meat, eggs and aquaculture products climbing
above the world's average level.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, during the Ninth Five-Year period,
China's agriculture and rural economy have remained healthy
despite difficulties and challenges.
</P>
<P>
In the first four years, the primary industry contributed 1,420.
5 billion yuan in added value annually to GDP.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the achievements to the Ninth Five-Year
plan, which places top importance on agriculture, and increased
investment for infrastructure to push forward agricultural reform.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Presiding Judges Selected through Public Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- After one month of public
competition and open assessments, the first group of 47 "presiding
judges" have been appointed to the various specialized courts of
the Supreme People's Court (SPC), a SPC spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The new system of selecting presiding judges through public
competition has been a major reform taken by the SPC to reform
China's judicial system, he said.
</P>
<P>
These judges will be entitled to preside over collegiate
benches in court hearings and sign court papers according to legal
procedures, thus altering the long-time practice that court
verdicts are subject to approval by high-ranking officials who may
not necessarily attend the hearings, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, 87 judges have applied for the new
positions just created, and 67 of them were recommended to
undertake examinations, which the 47 passed.
</P>
<P>
The list of candidates was publicized for further comments in
the Supreme Court and later approved by the Judicial Committee of
the SPC as "presiding judges."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that all 47 presiding judges are experienced
senior judges, and half of them are under 45, and 14 hold masters
or doctorate degrees of law.
</P>
<P>
The creation of presiding judges will bring the role of
collegiate benches into full play, enhance the work efficiency of
courts and help improve fair judgment of lawsuits, the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> More Polluting Industrial Enterprises Meet Environmental Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 92 percent of
China's industrial polluters have met state environmental
standards, up two percent on July's statistics, according to the
State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
An environmental protection decision made by the State Council
stipulates that all the Chinese industrial polluters and 46 key
cities for environmental protection must meet the related national
or regional standards by the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
So far, 21,900 polluting enterprises have met the standards,
accounting for 91.9 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that China's industrial polluters have been
improving steadily, but gaps between different regions exist, said
Wang Jirong, deputy director of the SEPA.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of the polluting industrial enterprises in 15
cities and provinces have met the standards. More than 95 percent
of the industrial polluters in Tianjin, Jiangsu, Shandong, Beijing
and Shanghai passed the required standard.
</P>
<P>
However, in western regions, only 75.9 percent of polluting
enterprises have reached the standards, lagging far behind the
national average.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA official said that the key cities for environmental
protection are still slow in meeting the standards in terms of air
and water quality and are facing difficulties in meeting the
environmental goals.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, only 39.1 percent of the 46 key cities have reached
the environmental standards. Great efforts need to be devoted to
upgrade the water quality in 13 cities and air quality in 26
cities respectively, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that key cities should further upgrade their state-
owned enterprises to meet the environmental goals in the
forthcoming three months.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is miffed by the chief
rabbis' withdrawal of support for the dissolution of the Religious
Affairs Ministry, but is determined to move ahead, a source close
to him said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Barak is also not ruling out a halt to the legislative
process concerning the Tal bill, which stipulates terms for
granting military exemptions to religious students.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking source in Barak's office said that freezing the
legislation is "a possibility," in light of the demands of the
secular Meretz, Shinui, and the Democratic Choice - Knesset
factions Barak has repeatedly referred to as "natural partners"
with which he wishes to form a coalition to advance his civil
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has been trying in recent days to wrest
consent from Israel and the Palestinians to a non-comprehensive
agreement, which would exclude final-status arrangements in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Americans believe that the prospects of convincing
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to concede full Palestinian
sovereignty over Jerusalem's Temple Mount are virtually nil. This
American view was underscored this week in diplomatic contacts
involving American, European and Egyptian officials.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Barak refuses to compromise on his demand that an
agreement with the Palestinians contain a clause declaring the "end
of the conflict." Such a clause cannot be incorporated in a peace
deal in the absence of an agreement mandating a solution to the
Jerusalem impasse.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and the Palestinians are both waiting for the American
bridging proposal on a final-status agreement, which will
apparently be completed this weekend. The American document is
meant to be a basis for intensive negotiations between the two
sides over the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration is working on finalizing the proposal,
but on Wednesday it was still examining the various ideas that will
be presented to President Bill Clinton. On the question of
Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, for instance, the administration is
examining six or seven ideas for resolving the issue of
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the negotiations, the American
proposal will be presented in the form of "principles for a
framework agreement," and will detail the compromise positions that
the United States is recommending on all of the key issues.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The West Nile virus has officially reached epidemic
proportions, Israel's Health Ministry announced Wednesday. Over the
last few days, some 15 new cases have been reported daily.
</P>
<P>
According to data released by the Health Ministry Wednesday, 161
people have been diagnosed with West Nile virus from mid-July to
the present. However, the ministry believes this figure represents
only "the tip of the iceberg."
</P>
<P>
Of the know victims, 129 have been hospitalized and 13 have
died.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sees Biggest Export Increase in 8 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand merchandise
exports grew by 13.4 percent to 24.7 billion NZ dollars (10
billion U.S. dollars) in the year from July 1999 to June 2000, the
biggest annual increase in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Jack Stephens, spokesperson of Trade New Zealand, said in a
press release here Thursday that the figure does not include
exports of services, which are expected to add at least another
eight billion NZ dollars (3.25 billion U.S. dollars) to that
figure.
</P>
<P>
He noted the strong export growth was helped by the competitive
exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar, but was also the result
of increases in export volumes to New Zealand's main overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
All major product groups showed increases during the year, with
food and beverage exports up 7 percent to 11.7 billion NZ dollars
(4.7 billion U.S. dollars), manufactured products up 7 percent to
5.9 billion NZ dollars (2.4 billion U.S. dollars), primary
products up 20 percent to 3.9 billion NZ dollars (1.6 billion U.S.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Philippine Peso's Depreciation May Continue By Chen Zhanjie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso hit a new
all-time low closing rate of 45.91 pesos against the U.S. dollar
on Wednesday, raising concerns it could easily breach the 46 pesos
to one dollar level soon.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of this year, the peso has lost more than 12
percent of its value from 40.313 pesos to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the depreciation was due to the strong U.S.
economy, the weakness of regional currencies as well as some
domestic political and economic concerns.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corp. treasurer John Mc Gowan said
the dominant U.S. economy had continued to put pressure on the
world currencies, including the peso.
</P>
<P>
"The movement of currencies would depend on where the U.S.
economy will go. If the U.S. economy will remain strong which is
more likely, the euro, Sterling and other currencies including the
peso will continue to depreciate," said Mc Gowan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the peso normally tracks the direction of
the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah, which both posted weakness in
Wednesday's session.
</P>
<P>
The Thai baht was quoted between 42.50 and 42.60 to the U.S.
dollar from 41 in the previous weeks, while the Indonesian rupiah
neared the 9,000 to one dollar level.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson, former governor of the Central Bank of the
Philippines, said the country's fiscal deficit, the lingering
crisis in Mindanao and the poor performance of the local bourse
have not helped revive the peso.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, the government had incurred a budget
deficit of 69.787 billion pesos (1.55 billion dollars), exceeding
by 7.29 billion pesos (162 million dollars) the full-year target
of 62.5 billion pesos (1.39 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked the government
to keep its deficit target intact, otherwise it might withhold the
release of the last batch of loans to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Achieving the deficit target was one of the country's
commitments to the IMF before it could exit from a three-year loan
program ending in December this year.
</P>
<P>
The country's stocks have also fallen nearly 30 percent since
the start of this year mainly due to pull-out of sizable amounts
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singson estimated that at least seventy percent of the local
stock market was foreign investment four years ago, but now "much
of that (investment has left the country."
</P>
<P>
In its updated Asian Development Outlook 2000, the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) predicted the Philippines' gross domestic
product to grow by 3.8 percent this year, lower than most of the
country's Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said the Philippine economy continued to be weighed
down by the weakness in bank credit to the private sector, a large
budget deficit, the high rate of non-performing loans of the
banking sector, the slow pace of key economic reform and the
hostage crisis in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Joseph Estrada ordered a massive military
operation against the Abu Sayyaf while working hard to deal with
other rebels groups, including the 1,000-strong secessionist Moro
Islamic Liberation Front and the 9,000-strong leftist New People's
Army, in a hope to boost investor confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the peso from dipping further, the government has
also taken some measures mainly through the Central Bank of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
On September 14, the central bank decided to increase overnight
lending and borrowing rates by one percentage point, consequently
increasing government's borrowing and banks' lending rates.
</P>
<P>
Before that rate hike, the central bank had kept overnight
lending and borrowing rates at the relatively low level of 1225
percent and 10 percent respectively since May 19.
</P>
<P>
Aside from raising interest rate, the central bank also sold
its dollar reserves to the local foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the peso would have easily breached the 46-to-
dollar support level without the intervention of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the central bank, said
Wednesday that the central bank was closely monitoring the peso
movement and would be ready in case speculations against the peso
occur.
</P>
<P>
To protect the peso, the governor said the central bank would
consider raising interest rates; increasing the bank's reserve
requirements; and intervening directly in the spot market.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said the intervention of the central bank
might not be strong enough to stop the peso's depreciating trend,
adding that the peso might drop further in the near future, unless
political and economic conditions in the local front improve.

<HEADLINE> Sulu Evacuees Total 2,565 Families Amid Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Evacuees in the fighting
between the Philippine government forces and Abu Sayyaf terrorists
in the southern island province of Sulu have swelled to 2,565
families as of Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) said.
</P>
<P>
Office Director Melgabal Capistrano told reporters that the
evacuees came from the towns of Indanan, Talipao and Patikul in
Sulu where the fighting erupted since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government has established 30 evacuation centers in Patikul,
Indanan Talipao, Parang, Panamao and Jolo, all in Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
"The local disaster coordinating councils are presently
extending the necessary relief assistance to the evacuees,"
Capistrano said.
</P>
<P>
According to Capistrano, the office has authorized the release
of 500 sacks of rice from the local warehouse of the National Food
Authority in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Navy ships, Capistrano added, started transporting
more rice from the nearby city of Zamboanga to the war-torn towns,
together with 15 boxes of sardines, four boxes of noodles, 49
boxes and sacks of assorted used clothing.
</P>
<P>
The military operations against the Abu Sayyaf entered the
sixth day Thursday with no signs of letup.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the government announced the successful escape of
the two French journalists out of the control of the Abu Sayyaf as
President Joseph Estrada asked the government troops to intensify
their military attack on the bandit group.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Not to Allow Angola to Fight Rebels in Its Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
said it would not allow the Angolan army to fight the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola rebels inside its
territory, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While Zambia supports Angola's efforts to handle its side of
the common border, its troops will firmly defend the integrity of
the country from being violated, Zambian Army commander Geojago
Musengule was quoted as saying at a news conference in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Musengule, who arrived in Luanda on Tuesday, is on a three-day
visit at the invitation of his Angolan counterpart Joao De Matos.
</P>
<P>
According to Musengule, because of the on-going fighting
between the Angolan government troops and the UNITA rebels, the
military situation at the common border of the two countries is
not stable.
</P>
<P>
Zambia will have its border "very well" looked after, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said many Angolan citizens are crossing the common border
and it is difficult for the Zambian authorities to identify
whether they come from the rebel group or the government
controlled areas.

<HEADLINE> Sub-Saharan Africa With Lowest Number of Educated Women: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa is among
the regions with the lowest number of educated women, a U.N.
Population Fund report launched here on Wednesday has said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted the report, titled "
Lives Together, Worlds Apart: Men and Women in a Time of Change",
as saying the region, together with South Asia, have fewer than 40
percent of female students in secondary school.
</P>
<P>
The gender gap in schooling is closing in most of the world,
but it remains large in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the
report said, blaming the boy/girl disparity in education and other
social opportunities to gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a recent study in Kenya, showing that
educating more women would enhance their capacity in social and
economic programs, and giving women farmers the same support as
men could increase yields by more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Governments should facilitate gender equality by removing legal
barriers, changing laws that encourage discrimination, drawing up
conducive policies and initiating programs to uplift the status of
women, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Population Growth Slows Down: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's population growth
is slowing down because of declining fertility and increasing
mortality, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has said.
</P>
<P>
In a report launched in Harare on Wednesday, the UNFPA said
fertility has been declining due to widespread adoption of modern
contraception and changing fertility preferences in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Fertility fell from more than six children per woman in the
1980s to 4.39 in 1994 and about 3.8 last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, HIV/AIDS is another factor leading to the downward
population growth rate, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The HIV/AIDS epidemic is reversing the gains in life
expectancy, which had been realized in the last decade," the
report said, adding that "despite the fall in the growth rate, the
size of the population continues to grow as a result of population
momentum."
</P>
<P>
The spread of HIV/AIDS has become a serious threat to the
development in the country, which has the highest prevalence rate -
- 25.84 percent among adults -- in the world comparable only to
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy in Zimbabwe is now about 44 years because of
the pandemic. More than 1,200 economically active people die each
week.
</P>
<P>
The deaths affect agricultural and other economic sectors and
caring for AIDS orphans is increasing the economic burden for
households, communities and the nation, the UNFPA said.
</P>
<P>
Other consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are strains on the
health delivery system, human suffering and facilitation of the
spread of other diseases like tuberculosis.

<HEADLINE> New Study Suggests Prostate Screening Test for Younger Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A new study released
Wednesday indicates that a popular blood test used to screen men
over age 50 for prostate cancer may be just as valuable for
younger men.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at John Hopkins School of Medicine said they had
used computer modeling to predict the effectiveness of using the
prostate-specific antigen blood test to screen men for cancer
every two years beginning at age 40.
</P>
<P>
Based in part on the study's findings, and on other such data,
the American Cancer Society (ACS) is adjusting its recommendations
to say that men at high risk for the disease should be screened
yearly beginning at age 45.
</P>
<P>
Those at high risk include people who have had close family
members diagnosed with prostate cancer, and African-American men.
</P>
<P>
Blacks "have twice the rates of prostate cancer death as
Caucasian men," said Harmon Eyre, the ACS chief medical officer. "
For reasons we don't know, it also starts at a younger age in
African-American men."
</P>
<P>
"There's increasing ... data that says if men get early
detection for prostate cancer, the death rate in that population
goes down."
</P>
<P>
Prostate cancer is second only to skin cancer as the most
common cause of cancer diagnosis in men in the United States. It
is men's second leading cause of cancer death.
</P>
<P>
One in every 10 American men will be diagnosed with prostate
cancer during their lifetime, most after age 65.
</P>
<P>
Between 1973 and 1993, the rate of new prostate cancer cases
rose by 173 percent in the United States, partly because U.S.
population is aging.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that prostate cancer risk begins to increase
after age 50 for white men who have no family history of the
disease, and after age 40 for blacks and those who have close
relatives who were diagnosed with the cancer.

SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian beauty Sveltlana
Khorkina is set to lead the battle for the women's gymnastics all-

</P>
<P>
Khorkina, the 1996 Olympic champion on the uneven bars, 1997

SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Zemfira Meftakhetdinova of
Azerbaijan won her country's first Olympic gold medal as she led
all the way in the inaugural women's skeet on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meftakhetdinova, the 1995 world champion and 1993 European
champion, shot a perfect 25 in the final for a total of 98 hits,
which was just one short of the world record of 99.
</P>
<P>
"I can't comprehend that I've won," said the 37-year-old woman
athlete. "It's the point of being an athlete in the Olympic Games.
I would've been happy for any medal but this is the main thing in
life for an athlete."
</P>
<P>
Russian Svetlana Demina took silver with 95 hits, while Diana
Igaly of Hungary beat Australian Tash Lonsdale in a shootoff to

China's Zhang Shan, winner in the open skeet competition at the
1992 Barcelona Olympics, was a favorite going into the competition,

Meftakhetdinova's gold medal was Azerbaijan's first gold and

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Intensify Eviction of Illegal Settlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
intensify the eviction of illegal settlers from commercial farms
until all people who occupied such properties after the launch of
the fast-track resettlement program are removed, The Herald
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Raids on illegal farm occupiers are being carried out following
a cabinet decision to end corruption and violence in the land
redistribution process, said Minister of Home Affairs John Nkomo
on Wednesday while briefing reporters in Masvingo of south
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear and straight-forward position. We will not
tolerate anyone who entered a farm after Vice President Joseph
Msika launched the fast-track resettlement program two months ago,
" he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "there are too many criminals now on the farms
who are inviting people in and selling land to them. Our stance is
that no one, except central government, has power to allocate land.
"
</P>
<P>
"We are not going back on that one. We need order in land
redistribution," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Those who invaded farms before the fast-track program, Nkomo
said, must stay out and "do nothing to interfere with farming
activities until the government allocates them land".
</P>
<P>
He said when war veterans occupied farms, the government
understood that they were genuinely exerting pressure to speed up
land redistribution, and the government has now moved quickly.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean police recently started evicting people occupying
farms around such cities as Harare, Chitungwiza and Kadoma.
</P>
<P>
The action comes after reports of increased criminal activities
on occupied farms. Occupiers who are reportedly not genuine war
veterans are said to be disrupting farming operations.

would be increasingly characterized by advanced technology in all

<HEADLINE> U.S., Mexican Authorities Detain Hundreds Of Iraqis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-eight Iraqis were
held Wednesday by U.S. authorities at the U.S.-Mexican border near
San Diego after small groups of them tried to walk into the United
States without visas, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
They were awaiting interpreters Wednesday at the San Ysidro
Port of Entry, which links San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, so they
could explain their case to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least 150 others were being detained at a nearby
hotel in downtown Tijuana, guarded by Mexican police officers.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-based Iraqis who had come to Mexico to see relatives in
the group said the refugees had been there for two to four months
trying to get visas.
</P>
<P>
"They are tired of waiting," said Romil Gewarges, a Phoenix
resident visiting his sister-in-law and her family.
</P>
<P>
Gewarges said he didn't know how the group got to Tijuana, but
he said living conditions in Iraq prompted them to leave. "There's
no food, no medicine, basically they're starving," he said.
</P>
<P>
Louis Semon, a spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service, said
that it is unusual for such a large group of foreign citizens to
attempt to enter together at San Ysidro, the world's busiest
border crossing, into the United States.

SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korean women archers
proved their dominance in the sport when they won their fourth
consecutive Olympic gold medal in the team event on Thursday,
overcoming Ukraine 251-239 in the final.
</P>
<P>
Germany, silver medallist at Atlanta, took the bronze medal,
beating Turkey 240-234 in the play-off.
</P>
<P>
Boasting the trio - Yun Mi-Jin, Kim Nam-Soon and Kim Soo-Nyung -
who took gold, silver and bronze respectively in the individual
contest the red-hot favorites were pushed hard in opening
exchanges by the unfancied Ukrainian threesome - Olena Sadovnycha,
Kateryna Serdyuk and Nataliya Burdeyna.
</P>
<P>
After the first end they led by the narrowest of margins, 85-84,
but they began to pull away in the second end, establishing a 167-
163 lead after 18 of the 27 arrows.
</P>
<P>
Kim Nam-Soon fired two maximum 10-pointers in her next three
arrows to strech the gap to five points and as the Ukrainians
wilted in the hot afternoon sun they lost ground in the final
stages.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, who set a new Olympic record of 252 in the quarter-
finals, have never lost an Olympic match in this event since its
introduction at Seoul 12 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodian Government Focuses Its Effort on Flood Relief  By Li Chaobi  Yan Ming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Government of
Cambodia, headed by Prime Minister Hun Sen, has mobilized all
sources to help its people fight against the flood, relieve the
sufferings of the flood affected people and reconstruct their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen ordered all executive departments of the
cabinet to cancel all unnecessary meetings, seminars and
discussions, in order to go down to the affected villages and
communes to offer emergency assistance to the people.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk returned to Cambodia from Beijing earlier
in order to fight against the flood together with his countrymen,
he told Prime Minister Hun Sen upon his arrival at the Phnom Penh
Pochendong International Airport on September 16. And the King and
Queen Monineath Sihanouk donated 300 tons of rice to the flood
affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen personally surveyed the flood areas in many provinces
of the country following his return from the UN Millennium Summit
on September 12. Everywhere he went, he comforted the affected
people, distributed relief supplies to them, encouraged them to
overcome difficulties caused by flooding and reconstruct home by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also highly praised the people for their
traditional spirit of helping each other, namely " Khmer people
help Khmer people".
</P>
<P>
Inspecting the flood affected villages in Peamro district, Prey
Veng province, eastern Cambodia on September 15, Hun Sen said to
the villagers that although the flood was much more serious than
that of 1996, so long as the Cambodian people unite and help each
other, they can conquer the disaster.
</P>
<P>
He asked the people to stay calm when the water level of the
Bassac River continued rising and threatened to inundate the
capital city of Phnom Penh. He, meanwhile, asked the municipal
governor Chea Sophara to watch closely the changes of the flood
and prepare practical measures to deal with possible dangerous
situation.
</P>
<P>
President of the Senate Chea Sim and his Madame on September 18
went to the disaster areas in Prey Veng province to distribute
relief materials to the people there. And he also advised people
to pay more attention to dietetic hygiene so as to prevent
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen out of twenty four provinces and cities are affected
by the flood, and four provinces located along the Mekong River,
namely Kompong Cham, Kandal, Prey Veng and Takeo suffered the most.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has appealed to the government, police and military
officials to take immediate actions to help the flood victims. He
asked them to go to the flood front and do practical deeds for the
people.
</P>
<P>
Kratie Governor Loy Sophat, Stung Treng Governor Ourn Bora, the
Second Deputy Governor of Kompong Cham province Mao Phirum, and
other provincial chiefs and senior officials all went to the flood
front to personally direct the effort to evacuate the affected
people to safe places, fortify the river banks, deliver food and
clothing to the people and give other necessary aid to the victims.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of military police and policemen have been
reinforcing the banks of the Mekong River and the Bassac River
which is flowing through Phnom Penh. About 40,000 sandbags were
filled to prevent flood waters from inundating the capital city of
Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh Governor Chea Sophara, together with other municipal
officials, inspected the situation of the flooding nearly every
day and night during the period of water rising in the Bassac
River.
</P>
<P>
He made proper arrangement for almost 300 families living on
the banks of the Bassac River and helped them move to higher
places.
</P>
<P>
Madame Bun Rany Hun Sen, president of the Cambodian Red Cross,
on September 19 met several domestic and foreign officials, and
received four donations although she was seriously ill on that day.
On Tuesday, she, together with other members of the Red Cross,
went to Kompong Chhlang province to inspect the disaster and give
emergency supplies to the people.
</P>
<P>
A report from the National Committee for Disaster Management
said that until September 20, one hundred and thirty one people
died while hundreds of thousands of hectares of rice fields were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The organization estimated that the damage caused by the flood
cost at least 60 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has appealed to foreign governments and the
international community to provide emergency aid for the flood
victims in the country.
</P>
<P>
So far the British government has donated 375,000 U.S. dollars
to aid the affected people, Australia has pledged to give 146,000
U.S. dollars in assistance, the French government has announced a
grant of 20,000 U.S. dollars, the American government has given 25,
000 U.S. dollars and Japan has donated 187,000 U.S. dollars for
facilities and another 100,000 U.S. dollars in cash for emergency
aid.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Red Cross has provided 30,000 U.S. dollars in cash
to the Cambodian Red Cross for relieving the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Up to Wednesday, the water level in upstream of the Mekong
River began receding while the water level at Phnom Penh still
remained at 11.19 meters which is close to the warning level of
inundation.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Treat Filipinos as War Refugees: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will treat
Filipinos fleeing to the country to escape attacks by Philippine
military forces in the southern part of that country as war
refugees, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If they come, we will treat them like we treated the
Vietnamese (refugees) previously," Mahathir told reporters after
officiating the International Media Convention on the Role of the
Media in Non-Aligned Countries in Shah Alam near here.
</P>
<P>
He said "We can no longer accept them as illegal immigrants but
as war refugees to be put in a special place."
</P>
<P>
They would not be allowed to leave the place except if they
were willing to return home, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Armed Forces and the Royal Malaysia Police have
stationed their personnel on several islands off Sabah, East
Malaysia, to ensure that the rebels did not enter Malaysian waters
to seek refuge.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine military launched the attacks on the rebel
strongholds in the southern Philippines last Saturday in an effort
to free hostages including three Malaysians reportedly held by
gunmen in Jolo in the southern Philippines.

YANGON -- Foreign investment in Myanmar totaled 74.125 million
U.S. dollars in the first six months of this year, increasing by
526.9 percent from the same period of 1999 when it registered at
11.823 million dollars, according to the latest figures issued by
the country's Central Statistical Organization (CSO).

million dollars. Total investment made by South Korea during the
half-year period stood the leading position with 31.71 million
dollars in four projects. (Myanmar-Investment)

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Senate on Tuesday afternoon passed a
bill on permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China by a
vote of 83-15 after a heated debate.
</P>
<P>
Once the legislation is signed into law by President Bill
Clinton, the United States will terminate its practice of
reviewing China's "most-favored-nation (MFN)" status on an annual
basis according to the relevant articles of the 1974 Trade Act and
establish permanent normal trade relations with China after the
latter joins the World Trade Organization (WTO). (US-China-PNTR)

<HEADLINE> Nepali Leftist Activists Arrested in Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of left-wing
activists were arrested Wednesday night across Nepal while they
were attempting to stage torch-lit rallies denying the government'
s recent ban on such rally, according to reports reaching here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The arrest came on the eve of a national strike called by the
nine left parties to protest what they term "state-sponsored
terrorism" and the controversial citizenship bill passed recently
by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Those arrested included leaders of the Communist Party of Nepal-
Marxist and Leninist (CPN-ML) Bam Dev Gautam and Siddhi Lal
Shrestha and leaders of United People's Front Amik Sherchan and
Dil Bahadur Shrestha, when they were addressing a rally to defy
the government's ban on torch-lit rallies, said a press release by
CPN-ML, received Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The release said Gautam and many others "have suffered serious
injuries", and 27 of them, including Gautam and Sherchan, were
released soon after they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
But the release claimed that several central leaders of the
party are still in police custody.
</P>
<P>
Police officials admitted they had arrested leftist party
activists in several major cities across the country, said The
Kathmandu Post, an English daily.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a bomb went off Wednesday night in downtown Patan, a
municipality 5 km south of Kathmandu, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Leftist parties have been staging torch-lit rallies on the eve
of almost every national strike they call. The Home Ministry
announced a ban on torch-lit rallies early this week.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Plane Crash Survivors Brought to U.S. Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Coast Guard said
on Wednesday that it is transferring the nine Cuban survivors of a
plane crash in the Gulf of Mexico to Florida of the United States
for medical evaluation.
</P>
<P>
"The Coast Guard has decided to go ahead and medically evacuate
the remaining eight Cuban migrants," said Scott Carr, the
spokesman of the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
The nine survivors, including three children, were rescued by a
freighter Tuesday when a small plane from Cuba crashed in the
southern Gulf of Mexico, killing one people. The U.S. Coast Guard
said the plane was heading west toward Mexico when it went down.
</P>
<P>
In response to a request for help from Cuba, the U.S. Coast
Guard dispatched a plane, a cutter and several helicopters in
search of the plane.
</P>
<P>
"We made the recommendation that all the people would be
brought in to the hospital so they could be checked out medically,
" Carr said.
</P>
<P>
A ninth survivor was already being treated Wednesday in Key
West of Florida for head and neck injuries. Doctors said that
Rodolfo Fuentes, 36, was in stable condition and doing well.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban survivors will be interviewed by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation to determine whether the plane was hijacked or
flown from Cuba voluntarily, and then U.S. immigration officials
will decide if they should qualify for asylum in the United States,
U.S. officials said.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan navy has been
mobilized to evacuate about 12,000 persons marooned in the
southern part of the country due to heavy monsoon rains and floods
during the past few days, press reports said Thursday.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Pakistani English newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The Nation:
</P>
<P>
-- Frontier Constabulary militiamen have been deployed in and
around foreign missions and at all sensitive buildings in the
Pakistani capital of Islamabad in the wake of Tuesday morning's
bomb attack. The dead toll in the bomb blast of the fruit and
vegetable market has reached 19.
</P>
<P>
The News:
</P>
<P>
-- The State Bank of Pakistan sold dollars in the inter-bank
market on Wednesday to stem the free fall of rupee. On Wednesday,
the rupee touched a new low of 58.75 rupees to a dollar, which
forced the central bank to respond by selling 10-12 million
dollars to infuse some stability in the market.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- At least 14 Indian soldiers were killed and more than eight
injured when Pakistani troops repulsed another Indian attack
Tuesday night on the same post on the Line of Control in Leepa
sector, Kashmir, where Indian troops were beaten back on wee hours
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Frontier Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The "honor-killing" in Pakistan is on the rise and in 1999

<HEADLINE> S'pore Firms Welcome Lift of SINO-US Trade Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's electronics
manufacturers cheered the latest news that trade barriers between
the United States and China would soon be lifted, saying that the
development would raise demand for their electronic components,
the local Business Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. senators voted overwhelmingly to give China
permanent access to U.S. market. The legislation will come into
effect once China becomes a member of the World Trade Organization,
expected within a few months.
</P>
<P>
Particularly upbeat are Singapore-based contract manufacturers -
- companies that provide electronics manufacturing services.
</P>
<P>
They noted that demand for their products should rise as major
U.S. electronics brand names use their components in a wide range
of products.
</P>
<P>
They said more trade flow is expected between U.S.A. and China
from now on -- meaning increasing demand for goods and more
business from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Gay Chee Cheong, group executive director at listed contract
manufacturer JIT Holdings, said companies with a presence in China
should benefit as Americans become more aware of trade
opportunities in China.
</P>
<P>
"Trade between the world's technology leader and the world's
most populous country must be good for any company based in China,
" Gay said.
</P>
<P>
"China is becoming a very attractive manufacturing base not
only for MNCs in China but also for customers in the U.S.A. and
Europe. They're able to get the quality they want but at much
lower costs," Gay said.
</P>
<P>
Chester Lin, chief executive at listed NatSteel Electronics (
NEL), echoed a similar view. "When they open up the China market,
everybody can compete there. The China market is going to grow,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But electronics manufacturers are not the only ones which stand
to gain.
</P>
<P>
Lam Pang Chuang, managing director of textile trader Ban Joo &AMP;
Company, said its new Shanghai office will help the firm double
turnover in the next five to eight years once China joins the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He said Ban Joo's sales of fabrics to U.S. customers have been
constrained by trade quotas. Once these are lifted, its sales of
products like raw fabric, yarn and grey cloth (used for printing
and dyeing) to the U.S. should rise.

<HEADLINE> Small Missile Fired at London intelligence Headquarters EDS-Update with More details  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- British police said on early
Thursday morning that a "small missile" was fired at the
headquarters of the MI6 foreign intelligence service in central
London on Wednesday night but caused only "minimal" damage.
</P>
<P>
Alan Fry, head of the police's anti-terrorist branch, told
reporters at the scene of the explosion early on Thursday that the
missile had hit the upper part of the high-security building.
</P>
<P>
The area had been sealed off and there was also no report of
any human casualties.
</P>
<P>
And Fry was unable to say who had fired the missile.
</P>
<P>
"An examination of the exterior of the building would show some
form of small missile hit the building at around the eighth floor.
It caused minimal damage," Fry said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly I have to keep in mind the capability of dissident
Irish groups, but at this stage I would not be ruling out any
other group who might see the secret intelligence service as a
potential target," said the police officer.
</P>
<P>
"The sheer nature of work of the secret intelligence service
must mean that there are other terrorist groups throughout the
world who might see their premises as a potential target. We all
need to be vigilant. We have a general threat of terrorism in
London," Fry said.
</P>
<P>
He said no warning of the attack had been given and no group
had claimed responsibility. But he said he did not believe the
building had been hit by a mortar, as this would have caused more
damage.
</P>
<P>
"I've been unable to undertake any direct examination of the
scene," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
He said a forensic examination of the surrounding area would
mean that the Paris-London rail link as well as local train
services and traffic would be disrupted during Thursday's morning
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
Standing less than a mile from the Big Ben, the parliament
building and the main government offices in Whitehall, the
futuristic MI6 building on the south bank of the River Thames is
regarded as one of the most secure and closely guarded compounds
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The building, a high-profile symbol of the British
establishment, is already famous for having featured in the last
James Bond film "The World is not Enough", where it exploded in
the opening scene.
</P>
<P>
MI6, which deals with foreign intelligence, is the
responsibility of the Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
But the Foreign Office refused to make any comment on the
attack.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the police to complete their investigation.
Until they do we can't speculate," a Foreign Office spokesman told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Secretary Robin Cook is personally involved and is
being kept up to date with all developments." he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian horse rider Roberto
Macedo was rushed to hospital with a suspected pelvic injury on
Thursday after his mount Fricote crashed down on him in a heavy
fall on the Olympic cross country course, organisers said.
</P>
<P>
Fricote pitched over one of the fences and landed straight down
on Macedo in the incident.
</P>
<P>
It was one of a string of falls that marked the start of the
individual cross country event.
</P>
<P>
The Bermudan horse Bermuda's Gold, ridden by Mary-Jane
Tumbridge, landed heavily over the second fence and fractured a
cannon bone. The horse was taken for veterinary treatment and put
in a splint.
</P>
<P>
New Zealander Mark Todd, having his last Olympic ride before
retiring, was twice stopped on the course by the falls of other
riders who had gone before him at five-minute intervals.
</P>
<P>
Ten deaths of riders over the past year have cast a shadow over
the sport of eventing which launched a major probe into safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Six were killed in Britain, two in Australia, one in
Switzerland and one in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the Olympic team event on Monday two Belgian riders were
involved in falls but escaped with minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Conduct Counter Trade With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is
planning to conduct counter trade with Russia to boost two-way
trade, and to exchange Russia's rice debt with Thailand with
products and equipment from the country, the Thai News Agency (TNA)
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Economic Ministers approved the plan, proposed
by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, at its meeting
early this week, and instructed the ministries of agriculture and
cooperatives and commerce to study ways to implement the plan,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Based on the project, Thailand wants capital goods from Russia,
namely tools and machines to assist local farmers in their
cultivation, aircraft for rainmaking operations and extinguishment
of forest fires, in exchange for exports of Thai key commodities.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-Russian trade is believed to benefit parties concerned
of both countries, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> Unified Yugoslavia Conforms With Montenegrins' Interests: Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said on Wednesday that it is in the interests of the
Montenegrins to maintain Montenegro's unification with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the remark in his first public speech in the
Republic of Montenegro, where he attended an election rally of
more than 100,000 Montenegrins in Berane, a northeastern town of
the republic.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning for the September 24 presidential election, the
Yugoslav president stressed that only when the Montenegrins and
the Serbians live together can chances of a stable life succeed
and external pressure be better resisted.
</P>
<P>
He called on the people of Montenegro themselves to decide on
what kind of life accords with their own interests.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Yugoslavia has faced cruel and harsh pressure
regarding the state of the economy, the military, public opinion
and politics, Milosevic stated that whether or not the country
could hold on, and how long it could hold on, depended on the
determination of the two peoples of Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
If the two peoples intended to live together, nobody in the
world could separate them, Milosevic affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics of
Yugoslavia, has increased in recent years because Montenegrin
President Milo Djukanovic advocates independence with the support
of the West.
</P>
<P>
His government pledged to boycott Yugoslavia's September 24
presidential and parliamentary elections, and urged the people to
follow suit.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Forestry Industry Endangered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean forestry
industry will face a difficult situation in the coming years, a
local expert predicted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Letamendi, the president of the Wood Corporation (Corma), Chile
's main forestry products industry association, said that only
wood pulp exports of the country will continue to increase in
coming years, the other exports were expected to stall due to
delays in the approval of projects worth some 4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the corporation held that the exports in the sector
will expand to a value of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars this year,
prospects were not optimistic due to a 43 percent drop in log
exports and a 5 percent fall in finished lumber in the first half
of this year, compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Letamendi said he was concerned about forestry industry
expansion in competing with other countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, for example, only 30,000 hectares of exploitable
forests were planted in the country, while in Argentina, the
figure was 160,000 and it will reach 200,000 hectares this year.
And forestation in Uruguay has expanded at an annual rate of 35,
000 hectares since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The situation has made the country's main forestry companies,
such as Celarauco (Copec), CMPC and Masisa to divert their
investments to other more profitable fields.
</P>
<P>
To change the trend, businessmen and government are working
together on projects such as the Native Forest and Institutions
Law and reviewing the Forestry Promotion Law, he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Paraguay to Fight Cigarette Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister
Luiz Felipe Lampreia and his Paraguayan counterpart Juan Aguirre
Martinez signed Wednesday here a bilateral agreement aimed at
combating the smuggling of cigarettes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement states that all commodities to arrive in Brazil
in transit to Paraguay through the Customs, can be subjected to
inspection by the Brazilian Federal Tax Revenue Direction, and
also to import quotas.
</P>
<P>
If the amount of the product imported by Paraguay was more than
the estimated internal consuming capability of that country, the
Brazilian government, together with its Paraguayan counterpart,
can decree the reduction of the entry of the product.
</P>
<P>
And besides, if the commodity in transit for Paraguay does not
correspond to the import documents, the Federal Tax Revenue
Direction will send the product back to its country of origin.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also foresees that the Brazilian Federal Tax
Revenue Direction can inspect its cigarettes sector together with
the Paraguayan inspectors in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Tax Revenue Direction estimates that Brazil loses
555 million U.S. dollars every year because of tax evasion with
the cigarette smuggling. About 15 percent of the Brazilian
cigarette market is clandestine and the cigarette comes from
Paraguay.

SYDNEY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee has begun to probe allegations that some teams sold
tickets to scalpers but it said illegal sales might have happened
without the direct knowledge of member committees.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Independent Medical Team to Check Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- An independent medical team
would thoroughly examine Indonesia's former president Soeharto
before the next session of his corruption trial on September 28,
according to Attorney General's Office spokesman Yushar Yahya.
</P>
<P>
He said the 24-member team planned to examine Soeharto at Cipto
Mangunkusumo General Hospital for two days.
</P>
<P>
"The medical team has made an examination schedule, but they
refuse to reveal the exact dates, fearing public disorder," Yahya
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, a prosecutor who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the examination would be held on September 23 and 24.
</P>
<P>
The new medical team, established by the decree of South
Jakarta Prosecutor Office chief on September 18, comprises
neurologists, psychiatrists, geriatricians, internists,
cardiovascular experts, radiologists, clinical pathologists and
medical rehabilitation experts.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who is charged with corruption committed during his
32 years in power, has failed to appear at the opening two
sessions of his trial -- on August 31 and September 14 -- because
of what his lawyers claim as brain damage, memory loss, high blood
pressure and other ailments.
</P>
<P>
Public prosecutors in the Soeharto case have rejected the
lawyers' argument and urged the panel of judges to establish an
independent team to re-examine Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto is scheduled to appear at court on September 28.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- More violence struck Aceh,
Indonesia, on Wednesday, with troops shooting dead five youths,
while nine other people were injured.
</P>
<P>
The five were killed during a 20 minutes exchange of fire
between a joint military and police patrol and a group of armed
men in Blang Nibong village in north Aceh, the Indonesian Observer
Thursday quoted North Aceh Police Chief Superintendent Abadan
Bangko as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bangko said the shots were fired after the patrol met some 20
youths in Blang Nibong.
</P>
<P>
"The minute they saw them, they fled and the personnel then
fired shots into the air as a warning to halt them," Bangko said,
adding the youths reacted by throwing a hand grenade at the patrol,
prompting them to shoot back.
</P>
<P>
Armed clashes were also reported in Kabu and Teumpun Pereulak
villages in East Aceh, leaving four civilians injured, four others
missing and eight houses torched, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The violence was the latest in decades of unrest in Aceh, where
separatist rebels have been fighting for an independent state for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, talks will resume between rebel and government
representatives in Switzerland on extending the violence-marred
three-month truce in Aceh which ended September 2.
</P>
<P>
The truce, which reduced but did not halt the violence in the
resource-rich province on the northern tip of Sumatra, has been
temporarily extended.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta has said it will not tolerate an independent Aceh, and
has offered autonomy instead.
</P>
<P>
The rebels say that despite entering the truce, they will not
abandon their goal of independence.

but that figure is still below the 1.358 million bpd as its OPEC
quota.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia will not immediately produce as much as its
allocated quota level under OPEC's latest production pact.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia needs three to six months to boost crude oil output
by the additional 41,600 barrels a day allocated to it at the
September 10 OPEC meeting," he was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Some of our marginal fields can raise output in three to six
months but most of our new discoveries haven't been developed yet -
- they'll take at least one to two years for oil to flow from the
fields with proven reserves," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's increase is part of the 800,000 barrel-per-day
group expansion agreed with effect from October 1 to reduce crude
oil prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government said
Wednesday that it has demanded the rebel National Liberation Army
(ELN) release 50 hostages.
</P>
<P>
High Commissioner for Peace Camilo Gomez, who contacted the ELN,
refrained from providing details of his dialogue with the
insurgent group.
</P>
<P>
"I have had some communication with them and we expect them to
release, hopefully, all the kidnapped people," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Gomez admitted that although the situation was "difficult," it
would not disrupt the peace talks with the ELN, which have been
going on since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The National Industrialists Association (ANDI) Chairman Luis
Carlos Villegas demanded Tuesday that the government end contacts
with the ELN if they would not release all of their captives.
</P>
<P>
The ELN perpetrated two mass kidnappings in 1999 and forced the
government to establish a 4,700-square-kilometer neutral zone in
the northwest of the country.

<HEADLINE> EU to Seek WTO Arbitration Panel In Swordfish Dispute With Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chile has prohibited Spanish vessels from using its ports for
processing swordfish catches since 1991, a decision that the EU
considers to be in violation of WTO norms.
</P>
<P>
According to the news issued by local economic newspaper "
estrategia" on Wednesday, Chile is expected to reject the EU's
request for a panel, thus delaying any formal action by the WTO
for at least another month.
</P>
<P>
This will buy time for Chile in its effort to seek resolution
to the conflict via the legal action it has filed in Hamburg,
Germany at the High Seas Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Chile is also looking for international allies in its effort
to fight the EU legal action at the WTO. The Spanish maritime
fleet has also had problems with Argentina, Canada and the
Marruecos , countries which now support Chile's legal initiative.

<HEADLINE> Indian Troops to Leave U.N. Peacekeeping Mission in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- India, whose military
officer heads the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone,
intends to pull its 3,059 troops out of the West African country,
prompting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to find a new
commander shortly, Indian and U.N. officials said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan may replace Major-General Vijay Jetley as commander of
the peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, known as UNAMSIL, as early
as next week, while India plans to scale down its forces at the
very time the United Nations wants to beef up its military
presence in the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Mission to the United Nations has conveyed to the U.
N. secretariat that its government would withdraw the Indian
soldiers gradually from Sierra Leone in order to give the United
Nations time to make other arrangements, reports said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard confirmed the report saying that
India had "indicated to the secretary-general its intention to
withdraw its troops it has contributed to the UNAMSIL."
</P>
<P>
"The Indian government has also indicated that, since its
troops are leaving, it would no longer expect to retain the
position of force commander," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-general is in contact with several potential
troops contributing countries, to ascertain their willingness to
participate in UNAMSIL," he said.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said earlier that Annan hoped to make some decision by
the end of the month and was as well aware of problems within the
leadership of the mission.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday unanimously voted to extend
UNAMSIL's mandate until December 31, and begin discussions on a
more robust mandate and expansion of the force by the end of
October after a Security Council mission visits the region on
October 7-14.
</P>
<P>
The council is considering a British-drafted resolution to
raise this figure to 205,000 but postponed authorizing that number
because of problems Annan has had in finding more troops to go to
the war-torn country.

provide more space for the private sector in the process of
economic recovery.

with the IMF, must not surpass 3.4 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP); in 2001 it must be less than 2.5 percent; and in
2002 it must drop to 1.5 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Become "Cyber City" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A "cybernation" project,
initiated by Beijing, has turned Internet vocabulary, such as ".
com," "website," and "e-mail" into an indispensable part of its
residents' daily life.
</P>
<P>
The trend of cybernation is sweeping Beijing, said Beijing
Mayor Liu Qi, adding that the launching of the project aims to
turn the Chinese capital into an international metropolis.
</P>
<P>
The mayor proposed the concept of "cybernation" earlier this
year. The project started at Zhongguancun, an area in northwestern
part of Beijing known as China's "Silicon Valley".
</P>
<P>
Beijing municipal government decided to invest 30 million yuan
(3.6 million U.S. dollars) this year on this project.
</P>
<P>
Lin Wenyi, vice mayor of Beijing, said that the project mainly
involves the construction of the information infrastructure and a
wider application of the information industry.
</P>
<P>
She said that broadcasting and television sectors will support
a common information platform. And hi-tech will be applied to
achieve the e-administration, e-business, scientific information
network, and on-line education.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 governmental departments in Beijing have opened
websites to attain the goal of e-administration.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will also open a website of social community services
this year. The social security information system will be put into
pilot operation among two million people. The public
transportation sector will carry out on-line management.
</P>
<P>
Urban planning expert Wang Xu said that the "cybernation" is
especially suitable for populous cities with complicated
architectures such as Beijing, where almost every citizen can
benefit from accessing information quickly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing tops other cities in China on the
number of Internet users and websites.

the State Economic and Trade Commission decided to impose a 6 to
62 percent anti-dumping tax on the cold rolled silicon steel
produced in Russia and exported to China within five years since
December 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
An official source said that it is the second anti-dumping case
in China, and the first in China's metallurgy industry.

The scandal was highlighted after the release of a video last
weekend in which a presidential advisor and head of the National
Intelligence Service (SIN) Vladimiro Montesisnos was seen giving a
15,000 U.S.-dollar bribe to an opposition congressman to defect to
the government's ranks.
</P>
<P>
The polling firm said there is at this time a great distrust of
agencies in charge of the country's electoral processes because of
their dubious role in the last general elections, when President
Alberto Fujimori was elected in the middle of serious
denunciations of fraud and irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The poll also revealed that most of the electors agree that the
chief of the Peruvian state must not take part again as a
presidential candidate in the new election process, because his
reputation is now tainted by the charges.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine percent of those polled demanded that a new
election be conducted as soon as possible to prevent the
lengthening of political uncertainty and a paralysis in the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The date set for the new elections ranges from three to six
months at the most. Six percent of those interviewed expressed no
position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Peru's government outlined plans Tuesday for national elections
in March.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Economy Seen to Grow 2.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to grow 2.5 percent this year and 3
percent in 2001, said the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation is estimated to stand at 17 percent by
the year-end and slip to 16 percent in 2001, compared to 35.8
percent in 1998 and 23.6 percent in 1999, predicted the IMF in its
annual report on the world economic outlook. The report was
published Wednesday in Prague, capital of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela will receive 210 million U.S. dollars out-of-the-
budget earnings due to an increase in the oil output agreed on
September 11 during the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) ministerial meeting, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
However, it warned that Venezuela's increasing public spending
is neutralizing the fiscal benefits obtained by the country from a
surge in global oil prices.

<HEADLINE> S. African Deaf Swimmer Wins Olympic Silver medal in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's deaf
swimming sensation Terence Parkin is just a regular guy at home,
his 14-year-old younger sister Lara said after the "silent torpedo
" cruised to an Olympic silver medal in the men's 200 meters
breaststroke in Sydney on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"To me, he's not deaf, I'm not aware of it. We communicate
very well. We are very close, but sometimes we do fight," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"We often joke around at home," said Lara. "Once he put on a
scary mask. And he snuck up on our dad, who was sitting in the
lounge, and gave him a fight. My dad nearly fell off the chair."
</P>
<P>
While Parkin's handicap goes unnoticed at home, it has turned
him into one of the world's strongest swimmers, mentally and
physically.
</P>
<P>
For a start, Parkin never hears the roar of the crowd when he
steps on to the pool deck nor when he climbs on to the podium to
collect his medal.
</P>
<P>
"The occasion just doesn't get to him," says Parkin's coach
Graham Hill. "He doesn't get intimidated."
</P>
<P>
While 20-year-old Parkin has been able to take most meets in
his stride, he admits that competing in the Olympics is something
different.
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous before the race. But I like being nervous
because it makes me stronger," he said.
</P>
<P>
Parkin easily laughs at his deafness and his swimming teammates
always join in.
</P>
<P>
The trademark scars down the right side of Parkin's chin bear a
frightening reminder to an accident that nearly killed him at the
age of eight.
</P>
<P>
He fell off the back of a moving four-by-four jeep on the beach
and landed under a wheel, suffering a broken jaw and plenty of
mauled flesh.
</P>
<P>
To this day, most of his chin is numb.
</P>
<P>
But it didn't prevent Parkin from flashing one of the biggest
smiles in the world when he went up to the Olympic podium.
</P>
<P>
Parkin's incredible fighting spirit, encapsulated by his swim
when he fought back from second last after the first lap, had his
colleagues, family and even some journalists shedding tears.
</P>
<P>
"I cried," admits Lara. "I'm so proud of him."
</P>
<P>
Coach Hill had little to say immediately after the swim, most
probably because he had a massive lump in the throat.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Gaza Faces Uncertain Future by Zhong Cuihua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- When a convoy of journalists
approached the road leading to Netzarim Jewish settlement at the
heart of Gaza Strip Wednesday, they were asked by a guiding Israeli
officers to change to armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"If incidents start and if there is gunfire, stay in the car.
The armored trucks will absorb the bullets. We have the capability
to cope with that," said Pini Levy, deputy commander of Israeli
Defense Forces in Gaza Strip instructed.
</P>
<P>
Levy's security concerns were not without foundation, as
Netzarim has been one of the hottest flashpoints of violent clashes
between Israeli soldiers and the Palestinians, who were frustrated
by the lack of progress in the peace process and continued Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Nothing happened this time. A major block of settlements in the
Gaza Strip, Netzarim houses 60 families and 200 people, most of
whom religious Jews who justify their right to live on the land
with the biblical story that their ancestor Abraham lived there
thousands of years ago.
</P>
<P>
Shlomit Siv, a 30-year-old woman representative of Netzarim
settlers, told reporters that since the signing of the Oslo accord
between Israel and the Palestinians in September 1993 stipulating
Palestinian autonomous rule in Gaza and the West Bank city of
Jerico, life has become much harder for the settlers.
</P>
<P>
She said their daily life depends heavily on their cooperation
with the army who escort them wherever they are to provide security
protection.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they are prepared for possible evacuation once a
peace deal is hammered out between Israel and Palestinians, Siv, a
high school teacher and a mother of six children, was determined
not to move.
</P>
<P>
Siv said that since they moved there, they had invested a lot of
money and energy in the settlements, and when the time comes that
they have to leave, "Torah (The Jewish Bible) will tell us how to
act."
</P>
<P>
Gaza is a strip of coastal land along the Mediterranean sea to
the south of Israel and north Sinai peninsular of Egypt, with an
area of 365 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War and handed over to
the Palestinian National Authority on May 18, 1994, the strip now
holds about 1.1 million Palestinians and about 7,000 Jewish
settlers in 19 settlements.
</P>
<P>
The future of Jewish settlements is one of the core final status
issues that Israel and the Palestinians are trying to settle in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli officers there refused to comment on the report that
Prime Minister Ehud Barak agreed at the July Camp David Summit to
hand over all of Gaza to the Palestinians with no settlements to be
preserved.
</P>
<P>
Asked how long it will take the Israelis to quit Gaza if needed,
a young soldier said it is rather a political question than a
military one. "As you see, we got out of Lebanon almost at one
night," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel withdrew its troops from south Lebanon in May in a
dramatic move, ending 22-year occupation there in a matter of days.
Of course, the soldier pointed out, Gaza is not Lebanon, where
Israeli troops had been under great security threats by the
resistance guerilla group Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
As the road to build mutual trust seems to be long, the Israelis
and Palestinians have grown more interdependent economically.
</P>
<P>
Through the Karni passage at the southern part of Gaza, cargo
trucks from both sides gather at the passway to deliver goods to
the other side.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Palestinian annual imports from Israel
stand at 1.6 billion U.S. dollars while Palestinian exports to
Israel 600 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
There are 120,000 Palestinians working in Israel every day, an
important source of cheap labor for Israel, which in turn provides
the Palestinians with a source of bread.
</P>
<P>
At the Eretz checkpoint which was designed specifically as
passway for people, strings of Palestinian workers who got up as
early as 2 a.m. in the morning to head for jobs in Israel returned
from a day's work, exhausted, possibly with tens of shekels in
their pocket.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the economic link as a crucial factor in the peace
process, Levy, the deputy commander, said that it is important for
the two sides to have some common interests. "We do not have
choices. We live here and the only choice is for us to cooperate,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Israelis and Palestinians have pledged to step up peace
efforts in a bid to clinch a deal in weeks to end century-old
conflict and settle all the issues in dispute, including the status
of Jerusalem, border, water resources, the future of Jewish
settlements and Palestinian refugees. However, no breakthrough has
been ensured.
</P>
<P>
With the talks between Israel and the Palestinians in deadlock,
Gaza, like the peace process itself, faces an uncertain future.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Officials in Nairobi Protest Killing of Colleagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Some Nairobi-based U.N.
employees Thursday launched a protest against killings of four of
their U.N. colleagues in West Timor and Guinea this month.
</P>
<P>
Wearing white armbands, and holding white flowers, the U.N.
officials walked through some streets in the capital of the east
African nation.
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked at their deaths... we cannot work in this
growing climate of fear," said Daniel Tshitungi, representative
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were holding placards with words like "Enough is
enough" and "Protect the protectors". They laid a wreath around
the Peace Pole in the U.N. compound in Nairobi, on which "May
Peace Prevail on Earth" is inscribed.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, about 200 U.N. workers have been killed, and a
roughly equal number taken hostages.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
launched a new investment incentive package, allowing fertilizer
and farm machinery to enter the country duty free, while giving a
five-year tax break for the new agriculture related ventures.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
Development told a visiting American delegation that the tax break
for the new investments in agricultural production and processing
was granted in line with the government's resolve to revitalize
its agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials for the manufacture of livestock feed would also
be allowed to enter the country duty free, said the minister's
representative.
</P>
<P>
The American delegation is currently visiting Nigeria to
develop a framework for future Nigeria-U.S. cooperation in
agriculture and rural development.

<HEADLINE> Report Says Racism Still Problem in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Racism remains a stubborn
problem in the United States despite the existence of laws on
eliminating racism, said a government report released here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"While the scourge of officially sanctioned segregation has
been eliminated, de facto segregation and persistent racial
discrimination continue to exist," the State Department report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Recent surveys indicate that, while most whites do not believe
there is much discrimination today in American society, most
minorities see the opposite in their life experiences," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The 100-page report is the first-ever analysis of U.S.
compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Citing examples of racial discrimination in the country, the
report recalled the 1991 police beating of black motorist Rodney
King, the shooting death of African immigrant Amadou Diallo by
police in New York, the burning of synagogues, mosques and black
churches, the dragging death of black man James Byrd in Texas, and
the shootings at a Jewish cultural center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted a disproportionately high incidence of
imprisonment and execution of blacks over whites.
</P>
<P>
About 47 percent of state prison inmates were blacks and
Hispanics made up 16 percent of the prison population, it said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1977 and 1998, when blacks made up 10-12 percent of the
population, 5,709 people were sentenced to death, 41 percent of
them black. Of the 500 people executed, 178 people were black, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the endurance of racism to several causes,
including persistent attitudes of individual Americans, poor
enforcement of anti-discrimination laws and rollbacks in
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
Shift in the racial and ethnic composition of the country is an
exacerbating factor for racial discrimination, the report said.
</P>
<P>
While whites are falling from 75.7 percent in 1991 to 71.9
percent today, the country's Asian population increased by 46
percent, to 10.9 million, and the Hispanic population increased by
40 percent, to 31.4 million.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, American Indians increased by 16
percent to 2.4 million and the number of blacks rose by 14 percent
to 34.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Gore Urges Clinton to Release Strategic Oil Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore urged President Bill Clinton
Thursday to release the country's strategic oil reserve to help
stabilize the oil prices in the country.
</P>
<P>
Gore also called on Congress to provide 400 million dollars in
additional energy assistance for low income families and tax
credits to oil distributors.
</P>
<P>
"We need aggressive action right now," Vice President Gore said
in a speech at an oil distributor in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"It's time for OPEC to get serious about the supply and price
of oil," Gore said, urging foreign producers to increase oil
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Gore asked President Clinton to release about 5 million barrels
of oil initially before the Energy Department makes additional
releases.
</P>
<P>
"We will start with several releases of 5 million barrels each
and, assuming that is successful, we should continue with these
swaps in an effort to stabilize the price of oil at lower levels,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Under Gore's plan, nearly 600 million barrels of Strategic
Petroleum Reserve would be made available to the market through
bids. The oil would be returned to the government at a later date
when prices had dipped.
</P>
<P>
Oil has become a key campaign issue in the U.S. as the
presidential election draws near.
</P>
<P>
Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush immediately
slammed Gore's proposal, saying the strategic reserve is only for
national security rather than "for short-term political gain."
</P>
<P>
Bush urged the Clinton Administration to use its "strong hand
in the diplomatic circles" to persuade oil-producing countries to
increase production.
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told lawmakers Wednesday that
"all options remain on the table."
</P>
<P>
The White House said President Clinton had not made a final
decision on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve yet.

<HEADLINE> Common Approach Vital to Settling Afghan Conflict: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.N. chief expressed his disappointment at no significant
shift in the positions of those countries that have interests in
and influence on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his latest report on Afghanistan to the Security
Council and the General Assembly, Annan said the recent incursions
by Islamic militants into the territory of Central Asian countries
highlight once again the danger of further spread of the conflict,
and the need for a comprehensive rather than a piecemeal approach
to the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that any gains on the battlefield by warring
factions in the country will not bring about an end to the
conflict which cries out for a comprehensive political solution in
keeping with the aspirations of the Afghan people and the
legitimate concerns of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the humanitarian area, Annan said the current
drought, the worst in over 30 years, is having a devastating
effect on Afghans, particularly those in the rural area. He
appealed to the donor community to respond generously to requests
for support.

WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday

<HEADLINE> British Labor Government Attacked on Pensioner Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The British Labor government's
record on pensioners came under attack Thursday after an official
report revealed that the number of senior citizens living in
poverty had risen by 100,000 between 1997 and March last year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Conservative Party's Social Security spokesman
David Willetts branded the rise as "devastating" and said it
showed the Labor government had not been listening to the concerns
of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
But the ruling Labor Party's Social Security Secretary Alistair
Darling launched a stout defense of the government's record,
saying the figures failed to take in account extra help given to
pensioners as part of the minimum income guarantee (MIG) and other
measures.
</P>
<P>
Darling also pointed to progress in other areas of poverty,
including a fall of a quarter of a million in the number of
children living in homes where no one is in work.
</P>
<P>
Darling said the annual report on poverty highlighted the steps
taken and the progress made in the 12 months since the government
launched its program to combat poverty.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that a total of 1.2 million children would have been
taken out of poverty by the end of this parliament.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Rebound While Tech Shares Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Blue chip stocks rebounded
Thursday while technology shares fell amid persistent worries
about corporate earnings and high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
77.60 at 10,765.52 points, ending the recent downward momentum.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 68.57 at 3,828.87 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 2.29 at 1,449.05.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index rose as investors shifted to the industrial
sector for bargain-hunting. The blue chips fell sharply in the
previous six sessions in a row.
</P>
<P>
Higher prices of the Hertz stocks also helped boost the Dow
index. Hertz rose sharply on news that Ford wants to purchase all
of the car rental company's remaining stocks.
</P>
<P>
Most other indexes fell despite bullish comments on the U.S.
economy from one of Wall Street's most prominent analysts.
Ericsson Telephone and Sprint PCS on the Nasdaq index fell.
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs analyst Abby Joseph Cohen reiterated that U.S.
economic conditions remain quite favorable, particularly in the
areas of improved productivity and monetary policy. She also said
high oil prices, the weak euro and corporate profit concerns will
be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
Investors' concerns about weakening corporate profits and
rising oil prices have hit the market for most of September. The
price of light sweet crude lowered to 36.33 U.S. dollars on the
New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday after trading as high as 37.
80 dollars per barrel, but still at levels not seen in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.39 at 654.23. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 9.02 at 927.75 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 7.08 at 514.35.

<HEADLINE> OECD Warns Steep Oil Prices Dampen GDP Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Sky-high oil prices coupled with
a steadily sinking European currency could crush expectations for
a bullish 2001 GDP growth, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to OECD chief economist Ignazio Visco, a series of
effects resulting from high oil prices could knock down previous
estimates of a 3.5 percent growth rate in Europe to around or
below 3 percent, while Italy's less ambitious 3.1 percent
prediction could fall down 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
In presenting the OECD Economic Outlook here, Visco said that
if expensive oil begins to influence salaries, payment and
consumer prices, then "a permanent increase of 10 U.S. dollars per
barrel for oil could, in two years, push consumer prices increases
in Europe above those in the U.S., meaning more than one
percentage point."
</P>
<P>
He warned that growth could be affected by a variety of factors
including monetary policy, taxes and the capacity for producers to
absorb higher costs.
</P>
<P>
According to Visco, if everything remains unchanged and
policies are not adapted so as to cushion the oil impact, "the
impact on the economy could be quite strong: we're talking about a
half point or more decrease in the average production of OECD
countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that previous GDP growth estimates had been calculated
using the price of 25 dollars per barrel of oil, rather than the
current 35 dollars.
