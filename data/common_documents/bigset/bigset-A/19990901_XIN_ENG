<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Peace Culture in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has urged African countries to begin moving from a culture
of hatred and conflict to a culture of peace, from a culture of
destruction to a culture of building bridges of cooperation
between their countries.
</P>
<P>
Chairing the signing ceremony in Lusaka Tuesday for a peace
agreement on ending the year-long conflict in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Chiluba said the cease-fire accord on the
Congo peace process is a demonstration that Africa is beginning to
assume responsibility for solving its own problems.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six founding members of a major rebel movement, the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), signed the peace pact.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba pointed out that the signing of the agreement itself
doesn't mean peace, saying it is rather the beginning of a long
process that will go through difficult phases and will require not
only commitment by all the parties to this agreement but also
total dedication to the process.
</P>
<P>
The primary responsibility for international peace and security
still lies with the international community, and more
specifically, with the United Nations Security Council, the
president noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiluba appealed to the U.N. to deploy a
peace-keeping mission to Democratic Congo with a mandate
commensurate with the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to appeal to the international community to make
available adequate resources that will enable the peace-keeping
mission to be carried out effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
The support of the international community for the peace
process in the Congo should not end when sending a peace-keeping
mission to the war-torn third largest African country, and it
should also be extended to a national dialog and to the economic
reconstruction of the country, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Unless the Congolese people agree on a political system that is
based on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect
for human rights, peace and stability shall continue to elude the
country, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I need to go even further and say that peace and stability in
the Congo and the region as whole will always be threatened if our
countries do not base our political systems on these principles,"
the president added.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends 44.5 Million Dollars to Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Tuesday a loan of 44.5 million U.S. dollars to Romania to finance
a Mine Closure and Social Mitigation Project designed to reduce
the burden of national budget by permanently closing 29 uneconomic
mines.
</P>
<P>
The project marks the first phase in the restructuring of the
Romanian mining sector and is essentially a mine-focused regional
social mitigation project, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The money also will be used to support the government's efforts
to revitalize depressed mining areas through investments for
support of small enterprises, re-training, and job creation
through a more diversified local economy.
</P>
<P>
Total project cost is 61.5 million dollars. Financing would
also include 12.8 million dollars from the Romanian government and
4.2 million dollars from the Department for International
Development of Britain.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank loan will be at the bank's standard interest
rate for LIBOR-based single-currency loans, repayable in 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> UK Consumer Confidence on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- British consumers are more
optimistic about the economy, though they are still reluctant to
spend money on a large purchase, according to a survey published
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by business consultancy GfK Great
Britain, found that 27 percent of the consumers now expect the
general economic situation to improve over the next twelve months,
compareed with 23 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
That was against 24 percent who expected the situation to
deteriorate over the coming year. In July, 28 percent of those
surveyed had expected the situation to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
But although consumers are more confident about the economy,
they are less likely to spend their money on a large purchase.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of those surveyed who believe that now is a good
time to buy a major item, such as a TV or a washing machine, has
fallen, for the third consecutive month, to 28 percent. This
follows a figure of 30 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
But GfK still expects a slight increase in high street spending
as those surveyed said their household finances had improved.
</P>
<P>
Of the people interviewed, 28 percent said their household
finances had improved, an increase of 8 percent year-on-year - and
31 percent expect their household finances to rise over the coming
year, a jump of 9 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
And, for the fourth consecutive month, savings intentions
dropped to the lowest level since December 1996. GfK report said
"it would seem fair to draw the conclusion that increased personal
prosperity combined with dwindling saving intentions will lead to
a slight increase in high street expenditure over the coming
months, despite little enthusiasm from consumers."
</P>
<P>
The survey of 2,000 individuals in the United Kingdom was
carried out by GfK on behalf of the European Commission.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Government Opens Internet Site on Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands has opened a
Internet site about fines to allow the public to look at all kinds
of minor offences, especially road-traffic related regulations,
the Dutch government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The "Fines Database", or Boetebase, was set up on Internet by
the Public Prosecution Service. "This will enable members of the
public to check the sanctions applied by the Public Prosecution
Service or the police for a large number of minor offences," the
government said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The database covers about 600 commonly committed minor
offences, which are divided into several categories. Main
categories are road and water traffic offences, environmental
offences, drink-related offences and offences concerning fresh
water fishing.
</P>
<P>
A long list of fines can be found on the Internet, including
speeding fines, penalties for things such as driving with an
invalid driving licence, putting out home trash too early and
fishing without a permit.
</P>
<P>
In the low land country with population of about 15 million,
more than 5.2 million fines were imposed in 1998 for road traffic
offences alone, including over 3.4 million for speeding offences,
almost 900,000 for parking infringements and 227,000 fines for
running red traffic lights.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Hopes Iran-China Relations Further Develop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami here Tuesday expressed the hope that friendly and
cooperative relations between Iran and China would further
develop.
</P>
<P>
Accepting credentials presented by Sun Bigan, China's new
ambassador to Iran, Khatami said China enjoys an important status
in the world, and it occupies a special position in Iran's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that both Iran and China are against hegemony and
power politics, are striving to develop themselves and their
economic cooperation has been going on very well. He said he hoped
for more economic and trade cooperation between the two sides in
the future.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, a certain country has been trying to turn the world into a
uni-polar one, which he said is not realistic.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the proposed "dialog among civilizations" is
to enable every country in the world to respect each other and
treat each other equally, he said. Khatami put forward "dialog
among civilizations" soon after he took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and China had in the past made important
contributions to human civilization and they can have excellent
dialog between them, Khatami added.
</P>
<P>
The new Chinese ambassador conveyed Khatami greetings from
Chinese President Jiang Zemin. He said Chinese government
treasures its friendship with Iran and is willing to strengthen
and develop its friendly and cooperative ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have strong economic reciprocity, thus giving
their cooperation a solid foundation and great prospects.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Iran have identical or similar views on many
important regional and international issues, and China appreciates
the proposal of "dialog among civilizations" put forward by the
Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Sino-Iranian relations will
further develop on the basis of equality, mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and peaceful
co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Sun arrived in Iran on July 29 to take his new post.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday strongly condemned rebels' killing of
civilians, including women and children, in the capital Bujumbura,
and called on rebels to end all attacks against civilians.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here by a spokesman, said, "The
Secretary-General learned with great distress of the murderous
attacks committed on August 28 and 29 by rebels in Burundi on the
capital city of Bujumbura and which were directed against
civilians living in Mutanga North and Musaga."
</P>
<P>
"As a result, many innocent civilians, including women and
children, were killed and property destroyed," the statement said.
"The Secretary-General strongly condemns these acts and reiterates
his call on the rebels to end all attacks against civilians and
abide by international and human rights norms."
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Hutu rebels attacked the capital in brutal overnight
raids, murdering 38 civilians and taking on the army in fierce
fighting that killed another 20 people, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been locked in a series of ethnic conflicts between
the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority over the past three decades.
About 150,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed
since civil war again erupted in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Accidents Leading Cause of Childhood Death in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Accidental injuries are the
leading cause of childhood deaths in European Union countries,
British researchers said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Around 4,500 deaths, a third of all deaths in children, are
caused by accidental injury every in EU countries, Anita Morrison,
of the University of Glasgow, said in a report published in the
British journal Injury Prevention.
</P>
<P>
The data, which covered the period 1984 to 1993 for children up
to the age of 14, are taken from the World Health Organization
(WHO) and national government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Anita Morrison and her colleagues found that the principal
causes of accidental childhood death in EU countries were the
result of injuries caused by road traffic accidents, which
accounts for almost half of all such deaths.
</P>
<P>
Drownings were the second most common cause of death,
particularly in Northern Europe, followed by fires and falls.
</P>
<P>
Almost a third of injuries were classified as "other", and
included deaths from poisoning, suffocation, wounds and the
adverse effects of medicines.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Unemployment Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' unemployment rate in
the first six months of 1999 was 3.6 percent, Cyprus' Labour and
Social Insurance Minister Andreas Moushouttas said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' unemployment in 1998 was 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after a meeting to review the latest
developments in employment, Moushouttas said the increase is
attributed to the recession in the manufacturing and construction
sectors as well as the illegal employment of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, unemployment rate in the
construction sectors rose to 6.5 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
Moushouttas noted that the island's prospective accession to
the European Union (EU) is likely to have a negative effect on
employment.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that the government is looking closely
at the issue and is already preparing necessary measures to
safeguard the rights of the working populations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started substantive accession negotiations with the EU
in November 1998.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Support for Unity of Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister
Youssef Wali on Tuesday reiterated his country's support for
Sudan's unity.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with John Garang, leader of the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA), Wali said Cairo supports all
efforts aimed at realizing stability and unity of Sudan, the
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Wali discussed with Garang the situation in Sudan and an
Egyptian-Libyan initiative to help bring an end to the civil war
in Sudan and reach national conciliation in the country, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Garang's SPLA has been fighting for 16 years for greater
autonomy for Christians and animists in southern states. Nearly 2
million people have died in the war and the ensuing famine.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has expressed keenness on helping the southern neighbor
realize peace through political means and has been mediating
between the Sudanese government and the opposition in the recent
two years.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed a five-point plan early this month,
calling for permanent cease-fire in Sudan and holding a national
reconciliation conference.
</P>
<P>
The plan was welcomed by the Sudanese government and the
opposition political parties within the National Democratic
Alliance, which includes SPLA, but was rejected by Garang.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader demanded that the government freeze the 1998
constitution, lift the state of emergency, free political
prisoners and restore freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
Garang arrived in Cairo on Monday to discuss with Sadiq
al-Mahdi, former Sudanese prime minister and leader of the Umma
party, his rejection of the Egyptian-Libyan plan. Al-Mahdi lives
in exile in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Discover New Way to Treat Obesity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A novel method discovered by
scientists in the United States could lead to new pharmaceutical
treatments for overweight people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The finding, published in the September issue of Nature
Medicine, an international science journal, is a dramatic
departure from most current obesity research, which concentrates
on controlling appetite.
</P>
<P>
This new approach, developed by scientists at the U.S. National
Institute of Mental Health, centers on the way in which the body
stores and burns fat.
</P>
<P>
The finding is tied to a gene known as POMC, found in both mice
and humans which provides signals that are important both during
development and also later in life.
</P>
<P>
The researchers were originally studying the impact of POMC on
the development of the brain when they discovered it also played a
major role in weight regulation.
</P>
<P>
Their research showed that mice lacking POMC-derived signals
were obese and exhibited rapid weight gain, increased food intake
and other similar physiological characteristics to POMC-deficient
humans.
</P>
<P>
When the scientists treated obese mice with a hormone made by
the POMC gene, called MSH, the mice returned to almost normal
weight in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to do follow-up research in mice and the results
are promising so far," said Brennan, one of the researchers, in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to pair up with a strategic partner that will help
move this study in to human clinical trials," he said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Producer Inflation, Money Supply Ease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's producer
price index (PPI) showed an annual rate of increase of 6.2 in July
this year, 0.2 percentage point lower than in June.
</P>
<P>
Its broad-based M3 money supply rose by 2.5 billion rand or 0.6
percent in July, after a sharp increase of 10.3 billion rand in
June.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released by Statistics South Africa and the
South African Reserve Bank (SARB) respectively on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The higher-than-expected increases in the M3 money supply and
the PPI do not augur well for interest rates in the medium term,
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted an economist as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Bond markets do not like the sign of increased PPI inflation
as it may suggest that producers are confronted with cost-push
pressures and therefore are likely to pass them on to the
consumer," said James Theledi, senior economist at Gensec Asset
Management.
</P>
<P>
"Given the 13-cent-per-liter increase in the petrol price which
is likely to add 0.3 percent to the PPI for September, the markets
will view the recent data as very disappointing and bearish for
interest rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
Theledi said that the higher-than-expected increase in money
supply growth was due mainly to the foreign exchange inflows
generated largely by Old Mutual's demutualization in July this
year.
</P>
<P>
"Money supply growth is expected to trend downwards in the
coming months to reflect the weak economy and remain close to the
bottom of the SARB's target range of 6 to 10 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The fall in private sector credit extension (which is the main
driver of growth in the money supply) in July is consistent with
the sluggish economy."
</P>
<P>
Annual growth in private sector credit extension slowed
significantly in July to 9.42 percent from 11.43 percent in June,
according to the SARB.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Hails Sudan's Export of Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Tuesday hailed Sudan's landmark export of
oil as "a great economic achievement."
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told reporters that he was satisfied to learn that
Sudan has exported the first shipment of crude oil in its history
and joined the club of the oil-exporting countries.
</P>
<P>
Sudan on Monday exported to Singapore its first consignment
consisting of 600,000 barrels of oil after more than two years of
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, the chief of
the 22-nation pan-Arab forum expressed hope that the United
States-brokered Wye peace accord "would be implemented as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
The Wye accord signed last October requires Israel, among other
things, to pull back troops from another 11 percent of the West
Bank in the last two of the three-phased withdrawals and release
hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are trying to reach an agreement
before Thursday on a timetable for the troop pullback and issues
related to the release of Palestinians for the two sides to sign
the agreement in Egypt during a visit by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned With Y2K Impact on Angola Civil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Potential information chaos at
the turn of the millennium in Angola's civil aviation sector
should be given more attention, U.S. ambassador to Angola said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the disastrous influence of Y2k, or called "millenium
bug", on the aviation sector, Joseph Sullivan expressed his
anxiety when he met with Angola's Vice Minister of Science and
Technology Pedro Teta.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Teta, also head of an inter-ministerial
commission responsible for eliminating the Y2K, informed the U.S.
ambassador of the progress made by his commission, especially in
the civil aviation sector, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said that his country has been
collaborating with Angola, furnishing useful equipment, for
example some "cd roms", for preventing the "bug" from rioting.
</P>
<P>
He also considered the meeting with Teta as a good opportunity
for talking about the Y2K problem which results from shortsighted
computer design.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government said in early June that the country had
to spend 200 million U.S. dollars to remove the "bug", which will
probably threaten the country's most sectors including
telecommunications, civil aviation, financial sectors and banks.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy Premier Meets With U.S. Congressional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The meeting with Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Tuesday was "helpful and important,"
a visiting U.S. congressman said.
</P>
<P>
A member of the U.S. congressional delegation, who asked not be
named, told reporters that the meeting was "helpful and
important," adding the U.S. congressional delegation stressed at
the meeting that their visit to Iraq is not state-to-state
political visit, rather it is an "independent" visit.
</P>
<P>
Aziz reportedly said during the meeting that the sufferings of
the Iraqi people were caused by the U.S. policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation said they make the visit to Iraq in order
to know what they can do to help lift the United Nations sanctions
imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The eight-member delegation of U.S. congressional aides arrived
in Baghdad on Sunday to investigate the effect of U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq for nine years.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a U.S. congressional delegation
visits Iraq after the country was put under U.N. economic
sanctions in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Baghdad, the delegation said they would
examine the effect of economic sanctions on the Iraqi civilian
population, Iraqi government policy and U.S. economic and
strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation will also investigate the effects of
depleted uranium, the health hazards suffered by U.S. veterans and
Iraqi civilians, as well as the escalating U.S. bombing campaign
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has blamed the U.N. sanctions for the deaths of hundreds
of thousands of Iraqis through malnutrition and the collapse of
medical services.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Health Undersecretary Shawqi Murqus on Monday met the
U.S. congressional delegation after the delegation visited a
children hospital in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Murqus reviewed the health situation of
the Iraqi people due to shortage in medicine and medical
appliances.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) found that child mortality rates have more than
doubled in south and central Iraq since the sanctions were in
place.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF officials have estimated that some 5000-6000 Iraqi
children under the age of five die each month due to malnutrition
and various curable diseases.

<HEADLINE> Study: Dolly, The Cloned Sheep, Is Not An Exact Copy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found that Dolly
the sheep, the world's first adult cloned mammal, is not a 100
percent copy of the adult sheep from which she was cloned.
</P>
<P>
Though the DNA in the nuclei of Dolly's cells has been proved
to be the same as the genetic material of an adult sheep donor's
mammary cells, scientists were not certain whether the so-called
mitochondrial DNA in Dolly's cells was also copied from that adult
animal.
</P>
<P>
Now Dr Eric Schon from Columbia University, the United States,
working with researchers from the Roslin Institute in Scotland,
where Dolly was created, has shown that the answer is not.
</P>
<P>
The mitochondrion is the "powerhouse" of the cell, providing
the energy that fuels most cellular processes. It has its own
unique genome, which is separate from that of the nucleus and is
inherited exclusively from the mother.
</P>
<P>
When Dolly was created by a method called nuclear transfer, the
nucleus of a donor cell was fused with a recipient egg cell that
had its nucleus removed.
</P>
<P>
During this process, the cytoplasms, the so called cellular
"soup" in which mitochondria reside, of the two different cells
were merged.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, therefore, Dolly's mitochondria could have
derived from the donor cell, the recipient cell or both.
</P>
<P>
In their research, Dr Schon and colleagues investigated the
origin of the mitochondrial DNA of Dolly and nine other cloned
sheep.
</P>
<P>
Their findings, published in the September issue of Nature
Genetics journal, showed that in all cases, the mitochondrial DNA
from the cloned animals differs from that of the nuclear donor
cells, but is similar to that of the recipient egg cells,
suggesting that only the recipient egg cells contribute
mitochondrial DNA to cloned animals.
</P>
<P>
Dr Schon's new research is an "interesting observation" and the
results are much as were "expected", Dr Harry Griffin, Assistant
Director of Roslin Institute, told Xinhua in a telephone interview
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Dolly is not an exact genetic copy dosn't change
her position as the first animal deprived from adult cell, said Dr
Griffin, adding that the new findings are "irrelevant" to any
other commercial applications of the nuclear transfer technique,
which he believed is a better way of producing
genetically-modified livestock.

Comportment
</P>
<P>
LUANDA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government Tuesday
praised the people of East Timor for their good comportment in the
referendum held Monday, saying it is a "very much encouraging
act", local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the Angolan
government, which supports the independence of the former
Portuguese colony, considers the free and just vote of the Timor
voters as "respecting the universally accepted principle of
popular consultation".
</P>
<P>
The document said that the peaceful and civic manner of the
Timor people in their voting Monday could be considered as a "very
much encouraging act."
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government appealed in the statement to all parts
directly involved in the process to respect the results of the
voting and the "sovereign will" the people of East Timor expressed
in the ballot boxes, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
The referendum under an agreement among Indonesia, Portugal
and the United Nations is for the former Portuguese colony to
choose between special autonomy within Indonesia and independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, which was annexed by Indonesia in 1976, has been
seen to be a "non-self-governing" territory by the U.N. General
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Agrees to Finance Egyptian Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has agreed to
provide Egypt with a total of 320 million U.S. dollars in the
current and coming fiscal years to finance some of the country's
projects, a bank senior official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khaled Akram, head of the World Bank's Egypt department, told
the country's Middle East News Agency that 120 million dollars
will be made available during the current fiscal year starting on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
This sum of money will be used in the building of sewage
projects throughout Egypt, Akram said. Large parts of Egypt,
including lower income Cairo neighborhoods, remain without sewage
systems.
</P>
<P>
The bank will offer the additional 200 million dollars in the
next fiscal year for projects aimed at boosting the country's
higher education system and training the workforce, Akram said.
</P>
<P>
Financing for the two projects would be made available through
a number of European agencies and include low-interest, long-term
loans, he said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official said the Egyptian government pursues a
cautious policy based on restriction of foreign loans except for
dire necessity.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which maintains a close cooperation relationship with
Egypt, is ready to study any Egyptian projects that needs finance
because of the strong foundations of the country's economy, Akram
added.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Airlines Launches 1st Intercontinental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The private Rwanda Airlines, in
conjunction with Air Burundi, has launched its first
intercontinental flight of Kigali-Bujumbura-Brussels, the Rwanda
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Rwanda Airlines,Yewondwossen Mengistu,
was quoted as saying Tuesday that the once-a-week flight to
Brussels, Belgium, is a result of a joint venture by the two
sister airlines.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda Airlines has also completed arrangements for weekly
cargo flight from Europe to Kigali using a leased B757 cargo
aircraft from Ethiopian Airlines for operations to begin in
mid-September 1999, said Mengistu.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda Airlines officials said that their company is committed
to providing services, creating employment, training Rwandan
nationals in the aviation sector, thereby providing avenue for
transfer of technology and contributing to the economy by way of
spill-over effect.
</P>
<P>
Mengistu explained that the company has a modest hanger at the
Kigali International Airport where minor routine maintenance is
performed. But major maintenance on aircraft is done abroad.
</P>
<P>
"As we grow, we want to build our own maintenance capacity and
preliminary discussions to that effect have been concluded with
the Ethiopian Airlines," said Mengistu.
</P>
<P>
The new flights to Brussels will be carried out by a leased
B757 cargo aircraft from Ethiopian Airlines on a three-month
renewable contract.
</P>
<P>
It is said that in the future, Rwanda Airlines will open
flights to Zambian capital Lusaka, Sudan, and Dubai of the United
Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean News Groups Petition President for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Employees of the cash-strapped
Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency (Ziana), the Community News
papers Group and the Zimbabwe Mass Media Trust petitioned
President Robert Mugabe Tuesday to rescue the organizations from
imminent collapse.
</P>
<P>
The organizations, jointly owned by the government and the
Zimbabwe Mass Media Trust, also presented a copy of the petition
to the Information Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The workers, however, said of all the organizations that it was
the national news agency Ziana which was in a critical position as
it might fail to operate next month.
</P>
<P>
"All operations have grounded to a halt. There is no money for
fuel, telephone, salaries, electricity and other important
day-to-day requirements which have rendered our operations
impossible," the petition said.
</P>
<P>
The workers did not see Mugabe who was attending a cabinet
meeting, but they were met by the president's press secretary,
George Charamba, and other officials who promised to ensure Mugabe
received the petition as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
They also met Senior Secretary for the Information Ministry
Willard Chiwewe who ruled out possibilities of the organizations,
especially Ziana, closing down, citing that its important role in
transmitting Zimbabwean news to the regional and international
community.
</P>
<P>
Chiwewe said the government would borrow money from the bank
for Ziana.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, German Officials to Meet Over Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 31 (Xinhua) - Israeli officials will visit
Germany next week to find a solution to the aviation dispute over
adding Lufthansa airline's flights to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Local economic daily Globes reported on Tuesday that the
Israeli delegation led by Avner Yarkoni, chief of Israeli Civil
Aviation Authority, will also include representatives of the
Israeli national airline El Al.
</P>
<P>
The dispute arose after Israeli Civil Aviation Authority
decided recently that Lufthansa airline will not be permitted to
increase its activity until a solution is found to the matter of
discrimination against El Al passengers in security checks at
Frankfurt International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority and El Al claim that Lufthansa
passengers travelling from Germany to Israel are subjected to
less stringent checks than that of El Al passengers at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
In response, Lufthansa claims it is not involved in security
regulations at German airports, and there is no reason, therefore,
to prevent it increasing its activity to and from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa is seeking to operate eighteen weekly flights, an
addition of three weekly flights compared to its current activity.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, the company plans to operate twenty-one
flights on this route.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa has reported an increase in the number of passengers
to Israel since the start of the year, and a large order backlog
for the winter season.
</P>
<P>
Due to the full occupancy of its flights, Lufthansa claims it
has been forced to reject requests from tourist groups to reach
Israel by its flights.

<HEADLINE> Parental Height Not Always Reliable When Predicting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- How tall or short the parents are
is not necessarily a reliable indicator of the height of their
children, particularly if the parents are very tall or short,
British researchers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Mid-parental height", or the average of both parent's heights,
is used as a standard way to predict how tall a child will be.
</P>
<P>
However, its reliability has been called into question by
researchers from the Department of Child Health at Britain's
University of Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
After measuring the heights of over 400 children, the
scientists found that while mid-parental height strongly predicted
heights of children whose parents were within the normal range, it
was much less effective if the parents were well above or below
average height.
</P>
<P>
"This is because very short or tall parents tend to produce
children of less extreme heights, a phenomenon know as regression
to the mean", they wrote in the British Medical Association's
journal Archives of Disease in Childhood.
</P>
<P>
On the principle of "regression to the mean", children whose
parents are both short will usually end up taller than the average
worked out for them, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
If a child is too short, it may be due to serious underlying
disease, malnutrition or even abuse, said the researchers,
stressing that "inappropriately ascribing a child's very short
stature to relatively short parents could significantly delay much
needed investigations."

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Peace Culture in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has urged African countries to begin moving from a culture
of hatred and conflict to a culture of peace, from a culture of
destruction to a culture of building bridges of cooperation
between their countries.
</P>
<P>
Chairing the signing ceremony in Lusaka Tuesday for a peace
agreement on ending the year-long conflict in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Chiluba said the cease-fire accord on the
Congo peace process is a demonstration that Africa is beginning to
assume responsibility for solving its own problems.
</P>
<P>
Forty-six founding members of a major rebel movement, the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), signed the peace pact.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba pointed out that the signing of the agreement itself
doesn't mean peace, saying it is rather the beginning of a long
process that will go through difficult phases and will require not
only commitment by all the parties to this agreement but also
total dedication to the process.
</P>
<P>
The primary responsibility for international peace and security
still lies with the international community, and more
specifically, with the United Nations Security Council, the
president noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiluba appealed to the U.N. to deploy a
peace-keeping mission to Democratic Congo with a mandate
commensurate with the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to appeal to the international community to make
available adequate resources that will enable the peace-keeping
mission to be carried out effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
The support of the international community for the peace
process in the Congo should not end when sending a peace-keeping
mission to the war-torn third largest African country, and it
should also be extended to a national dialog and to the economic
reconstruction of the country, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Unless the Congolese people agree on a political system that is
based on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect
for human rights, peace and stability shall continue to elude the
country, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I need to go even further and say that peace and stability in
the Congo and the region as whole will always be threatened if our
countries do not base our political systems on these principles,"
the president added.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 166 Injured in New Quakes in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- One was killed and 166 others
injured in two earthquakes which hit western Turkey on Tuesday,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Bogazici Kandilli Observatory reported that the
5.2-magnitude earthquake, followed by another one of magnitude 4.6
rocked Izmit, about 110 kilometers east of Istanbul, the largest
city of Turkey, Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Kartal Hospital said that 18 persons, who were
injured during the quakes in Izmit, were taken for medical
treatment, but one of them died in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
They said that two persons were injured as they were squeezed
in buildings and others broke part of their bodies by jumping from
buildings during the quake.
</P>
<P>
Kocaeli (Izmit) Governor Memduh Oguz said that seven buildings,
which were damaged during the major quake two weeks ago, collapsed
and 70 persons were injured on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The main warehouses of Brissa tyre factory in Izmit collapsed
in the 5.2-magnitude quake, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Izmit, also called Kocaeli province, was the epicenter of the
7.4-magnitude killer quake that hit western Turkey on August 17,
killing at least 14,000 people and injuring 27,000 others.

<HEADLINE> Last Congo Rebel Factions Sign Truce Pact in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Prospects of peace have finally
dawned on the Democratic Republic of the Congo as the last rebel
factions append their signatures to a cease-fire agreement in
Lusaka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 46 founder members of the main rebel group, the Congolese
Rally for Democracy (RCD), signed the peace agreement in a
compromise solution after a split between two rival factions
threatened to derail the entire peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement, reached in Lusaka on July 10 by six
countries directly involved in the conflict in the Congo, calls
for a cease-fire to begin within 24 hours of the signing ceremony
and the formation of a joint military commission to monitor the
accord and demobilize several irregular militia armies scattered
in eastern Congo or former Zaire, the third largest country in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
It also calls for the creation of a unified army and a national
dialog on the battered country's political future.
</P>
<P>
The rebel groups could not sign the peace pact because of
internal leadership wrangles in the RCD while the other rebel
group, the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) led by
Pierre Bemba, signed the agreement early this month.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba chaired the signing
ceremony, which was overseen by representatives from the Congo,
South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Gabon, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mauritius,
Tanzania, Chairman of the Joint Military Commission (JMC) Rachid
Lalli, as well as the United Nations, Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC), Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA), Organization of Africa Unity (OAU) and the European
Union (EU).

<P>
NEW YORK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Four-time champion Pete Sampras
quitted the U.S. Open on Tuesday because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who retired during a match two weeks ago in
Indianapolis with a groin injury, apparently reinjured his back in
practice on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He canceled Monday's practice and had asked that his first-
round match at the Open be delayed. The organizers agreed and he
was to have played Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was seeded first at the Open and was going for his
record-breaking 13th Grand Slam men's singles title. He tied Roy
Emerson with 12 major championships by winning his sixth Wimbledon
title in July.
</P>
<P>
Sampras' spot in the draw was taken by Mikael Tillstrom of
Sweden, who is ranked 130th in the world.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Falls Again in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Consumer Confidence Index
fell for the second straight month in August as more Americans got
concerned with higher interest rates, the Conference Board, the
U.S. prominent research group, said in a report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The index declined 0.4 of a point to 135.8 from a revised 136.2
in July. The July figure originally was reported as 135.6.
</P>
<P>
"Hikes in interest, severe drought conditions in the Northeast,
and rising gasoline prices have helped dampen overall consumer
optimism," said Lynn Franco, Director of the Board's Consumer
Research Center. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice
in the past months in a bid to preempt inflation from the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
But Franco said, "these latest dips in confidence are not of
great concern. Confidence in the future remains high and the
consumer shopping spree continues, with consumer spending having
generaled virtually all U.S. economic growth during the first six
months of this year."
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said consumers are less confident about
both current economic conditions and jobs than they were in July.
But this slight decline in confidence did not carry over into
consumers' expectations for the next six months, it said.
</P>
<P>
About 17 percent of all consumers look for business conditions
to get better, roughly the same figure recorded last month, the
Board said, adding that about 17.5 percent expect the job market
to improve during the next six months, up from 16 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator because
consumer spending accounts for about two-third of the U.S. overall
economic activity.

<HEADLINE> World Wheat Trade in 1999/2000 to Increase 5%: IGC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) - Increased demand in East Asia and
North Africa, caused by sharply reduced harvests, is expected to
contribute to a 5 percent increase in world wheat trade in
1999/2000, according to a report by International Grains Council
(IGC).
</P>
<P>
Total shipments are expected to rise to 100.1 m.tons, up from
95.6 m. The figure is 1.6 m. above the July projection, largely
due to increased forecasts for Brazil, India and South Korea, IGC
said.
</P>
<P>
The relatively poor quality of crops in some countries may also
trigger purchases of higher grades to meet milling needs.
</P>
<P>
In others, notably in India, the economic advantages of
importing wheat in deficit areas will lead to additional trade, IGC
said in its latest issue of Grain Market Report.
</P>
<P>
Global demand for feed wheat will depend on the availability
and pricing of lower quality grades, although significant amounts
have already been purchased from Ukraine and some Central and
Eastern European countries, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses Kuwait of Seizing its Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Tuesday accused Kuwait
of having seized three Iraqi dhows with their cargos last month,
the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted an unnamed official source at the Iraqi ports as
saying that the Kuwaiti authorities detained the dhows named
al-Waleed, al-Tawfiq and al-Falah on July 17.
</P>
<P>
Al-Waleed was carrying 201 tons of millet, 102 tons of wool,
al-Tawfiq was carrying 793 tons of urea fertilizer and 12 tons of
plant seeds while al-Falah was carrying one ton of organic
fertilizer, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The source did not say whether these dhows had been released by
Kuwait or not.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Baghdad accused Kuwait of intercepting an
Indian ship carrying contracted items under the oil-for-food
program in Iraqi territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal with the United Nations, Iraq is
allowed to sell limited amount of oil in every six months to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 24 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under the U.N. sanctions since it invaded Kuwait
in 1990, which touched off the 1991 Gulf War.

ATHENS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis met here Tuesday with the European Union's coordinator for
the Balkan stability pact, Bodo Hombach, to discuss the
reconstruction in the Balkan region and Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>

Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, who also attended the
talks, expressed Athens' willingness to assist Hombach, saying
that Greece would provide him with all possible assistance in his

<HEADLINE> Britons Remember Princess Diana at Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people have been
visiting Kensington Palace in London to mark the second
anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
And hundreds of bouquets as well as toys, candles and
photographs have been left at the palace gates, echoing the vast
sea of tributes laid in the days after her death two years ago.
</P>
<P>
People have travelled from around the UK to pay their respects,
while some foreign visitors have also laid tributes.
</P>
<P>
The princess died with Dodi Fayed and his chauffeur when their
car crashed in a road tunnel in Paris on 31 August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Many people at Kensington Palace have called for a permanent
memorial to the princess. More than 2,000 people have so far
signed a petition. But initial plans for a memorial garden near
the palace were abandoned when residents objected.
</P>
<P>
Organiser Jill Marseilles was quoted by BBC as saying: "Almost
everybody who has been here has signed in support. We don't want
anything too expensive or lavish, just a small fountain to
remember her by."
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Committee is instead refurbishing a playground in
Kensington Gardens and will create a memorial walkway along the
princess's funeral route, as well as a schools achievement award
and so-called "Diana nurses", caring for children at home.
</P>
<P>
The separate Diana, Princess of Wales, Memorial Fund still has
more than 75 million pounds (120 million U.S.dollars) invested but
does not consider a permanent memorial to the princess to be part
of its brief.
</P>
<P>
"She's forgotten by the establishment but remembered by the
people," Bryan Lewis, who had travelled from south Wales, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
One memorial to Diana is being launched in the shape of a new
rose, brought out by the Royal National Rose Society.
</P>
<P>
It is thought Diana's family have been marking the anniversary
with a low-key remembrance. Her sons, William and Harry, are at
Balmoral, the Queen's Scottish home, according to local media
reports.
</P>
<P>
"There are no formal events marking the second anniversary of
the death of the Princess of Wales," a Buckingham Palace spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, a few people gathered at the makeshift memorial by
the underpass where the accident happened, but nothing like the
crowds of last year, BBC said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Yale
University School of Medicine said that type I diabetes is
triggered by the body's immune system turning on delicate cells,
according to a report from Tuesday's Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
This finding, the researchers said, could lead to a vaccine
against the disease that affects more than one million Americans.
</P>
<P>
Susan Wong and colleagues at the University said they found
an antigen, a protein that stimulates an immune response, in
mice specially bred to develop what looks like human juvenile
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Type I diabetes occurs when the immune system attacks the
pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin for the body. People
with type I diabetes do not produce enough insulin and must
carefully monitor their blood sugar levels and take insulin to
control them.

<HEADLINE> Air Malawi Opens New Route to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Air Malawi has opened a
new route to Tanzania in a move to expand business.
</P>
<P>
The company's public relations officer Vera Ng' oma said that
the flights are arranged between Mzuzu in north Malawi and Mbeya
Region in southwest Tanzania every Tuesday and Thursday with a
12-seat Cessna Caravan.
</P>
<P>
The company's plane last week landed in Mbeya Region,
officially starting the cross-border flights, media reports said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Mbeya, a region bordering Malawi, to
connect with an international air circuit.
</P>
<P>
Ng' oma said passengers from Malawi and other southern African
countries proceeding to Dar es Salaam, Arusha and other
destinations in Tanzania, can take flights of a Tanzanian private
company Precision Air, under a special agreement signed between
the two airlines.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, passengers travelling to Malawi, South Africa and
Europe from Tanzania can take off from Mbeya Region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The public relations officer said that with the privatization
of the Mbeya Cement Company, and the opening of the Mtwara
Development Corridor, more and more people would book Air Malawi
flights between Mzuzu and Mbeya.
</P>
<P>
!0It took us almost an hour from Mzuzu to Mbeya and we had a
comfortable flight,!1 said a French tourist, Michael Dupuls, the
only passenger boarding the maiden flight.
</P>
<P>
The Precision Air service controller, Mwanga Misoke, said he
is optimistic that Air Malawi will boost business as well as
promoting interaction between the people of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Fear "Rural Desert" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gill, speaking at the launch of a questionnaire being sent to
83,000 NFU members, said some of the more remote parts of Britain
could become as empty as areas in central France.
</P>
<P>
The NFU, which says it represents about 75 percent of farmers
in England and Wales, will use the results of its "Audit for
Action" to lobby ministers at the Labor Party conference in
Bournemouth in September.
</P>
<P>
Gill said farmers had known hard times over the past few
years, but now increasing numbers were facing desperation. Farm
incomes had fallen 75 percent in the last two years, but the bare
statistics did not show the real story.
</P>
<P>
"This crisis is accelerating, and many farmers are clinging on
by their fingertips. Depopulation like France's is a real
possibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
The audit, a 24-question survey, asks British farmers to give
details of their own economic situation, to tell "a real-life,
real-time story of the financial crisis which is now affecting
tens of thousands of farmers and their families".
</P>
<P>
Gill warned that it is a story "which no one, least of all the
People's Government, can ignore".

<HEADLINE> Kidnaped Foreign Tourists, Iranian Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Four foreign hostages and their
Iranian guide kidnaped in Iran's southeastern province of Kerman
two weeks ago were freed at 20:30 hours local time (1600 GMT).
</P>
<P>
According to the official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA),
a provincial official said the released hostages would be united
with their family shortly. But no detail is given about the
release, or the condition of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the authorities set free two drug
traffickers from jail in exchange for the safe return of the five
hostages, as demanded by the Shah-Bakhsh tribe, to which the
abductors and drug smugglers belong.
</P>
<P>
The four foreigners are two Spanish priests, 70-year-old
Joaquin Fernandez and 57-year-old Cosme Puerto, another Spaniard,
40-year-old Pedro Garcia, and Italian civil engineer Massimo
Cattabriga, 37. They were kidnaped from their hotel on August
14 by three men and two women armed with automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the authorities and tribesmen have been
going on for days to secure the safe release of the
hostages. Local security forces have found the whereabouts of the
kidnapers and their captives, and surrounded the area, but
stopped short of taking any action for fear of endangering the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers were also demanding the return of the bodies of
those killed in battle with the police, as well as a guarantee of
immunity from prosecution by the government. It is not immediately
known if their demands were met.
</P>
<P>
Governor General of Kerman province Massoud Mahmoudi said the
law and order authority of the province would get tougher with all
drug-traffickers as a matter of routine, IRNA reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Dennis weakened and
slowed to a near halt Tuesday just off the east coast of the
United States, leaving relatively sparse property damage in its
wake along the North Carolina State seaboard.
</P>
<P>
A hurricane warning along the North Carolina coast was
downgraded to a tropical storm warning but forecasters said it was
too early to write off Dennis completely.
</P>
<P>
Dennis, almost stationary Tuesday morning, could linger without
moving much through Saturday, said Rod Gonski, forecaster at the
National Weather Service office in Raleigh, capital of North
Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
If it starts moving again, it's just as likely to head south or
southwest as it is to reverse course toward the Outer Banks or
southeastern Virginia State, Gonski said.
</P>
<P>
"There's a chance it could come back, a little less than 50-50,
but certainly worth talking about for sure," he said. "There is
nothing nudging it out in the ocean right now."

<HEADLINE> Dutch Military Forces Need More Money: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- If the Netherlands wishes to
continue to be able to achieve its military-political ambitions,
and to make a meaningful contribution to the new developments
within NATO and the European Union (EU), more money will have to
be channeled to its Ministry of Defense, said a report published
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government said it has asked a research agency in the
Netherlands, the Advisory Council on International Affairs, to
study recent developments in international security and to map out
the consequences of those developments for the Dutch defense
policy and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The council said in the report that greater military
flexibility and mobility is needed as a NATO member country in
order to sustain the ability to make an effective contribution in
the changing international security situation.
</P>
<P>
"It is precisely the armed forces of the European NATO member
states which fall short in this respect. Moreover, the European
countries themselves increasingly need to be able to assure their
military responsibilities, because American participation in
today's crisis management operations -- in contrast to the common
defense of NATO territory -- cannot be taken for granted. The
European military capability must therefore be strengthened, and
this will inevitably have consequences for the defense budgets of
the European countries concerned," the Dutch government cited the
report in a news release as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that the huge budget can no longer be
found within the defense apparatus itself, and the long-term
budgets for defense spending will therefore have to be increased.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, the ability to deploy Dutch armed forces will fall
short of what is needed, and this in turn will impact on support
for the defense apparatus and the ability to recruit new military
personnel," the study said.
</P>
<P>
The close interrelationship between these elements means that
there is a danger of a vicious circle being created "with negative
consequences for the future ability of the Netherlands to continue
contributing to peace, security and the international rule of
law," the study said.

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Accord Only First Step to Peace: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Emile Ilunga, a faction leader of
the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) said here Tuesday
that signing of the peace agreement is the first step in the long
way to peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader, backed by Rwanda, told a press conference
after signing the agreement that "everybody hopes peace will
follow the signing of the agreement and everybody is happy with
this development."
</P>
<P>
He said that his delegation visited Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and informed him of RCD's will to sign the agreement,
which has already been signed by six African countries involved in
the DRC war.
</P>
<P>
Ilunga appreciated Zambian government for its quick move to
send its Minister of State House Eric Silwamba to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that of the 50 founding RCD members 41 is working
with his faction which is based in Goma.
</P>
<P>
Illunga said there is only one RCD and no two RCD groups,
dismissing as "fictitious" the Kisangani-based RCD group led by
Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba and backed by Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said if his group is attacked it will not
remain defenseless, but added that his group will be committed to
implementing the ceasefire agreement even if it is attacked.
</P>
<P>
A total of 46 founding members of the RCD signed the ceasefire
 agreement, which were signed on July 10 in Lusaka by DRC and its
 supporters-- Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola as well as rebels'
supporters -- Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
RCD and the Movement for the Liberation for Congo (MLC) did
not sign the agreement because of the disagreement within the RCD
over who would sign it on behalf The rebel group.
</P>
<P>
MLC signed the agreement on August 1.
</P>
<P>
To break the deadlock, Southern African Development Community
(SADC) proposed that all the founding members be allowed to sign
the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
In May Ilunga ousted Wamba and was named by his supporters as
new leader of RCD. After the wrangle broke out Wamba moved from
Goma to Kisangani and has been insisting that he is still the
leader of the rebel group.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Power Rationing to Last 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Power rationing in Kenya may
last as long as six months as the reduced power generation has
been caused by the low water level in the country's three main
energy reservoirs due to the poor long rains between March and
June.
</P>
<P>
Just a week ago, the Kenyan government announced power
rationing plans across the country with effect from September 1.
</P>
<P>
Power rationing would last next March when the long rains
season is expected to start, which would improve the water levels
in the reservoirs to allow power generation to return to normal,
said Florence Obura, spokeswoman of the Kenya Power and Lighting
Company (KPLC), here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Engineers from the Kenya Power Company said that water levels
of the main energy reservoirs are at the lowest since the
mid-1960's.
</P>
<P>
Power output in Kenya was under pressure because of a failure
to develop new generation capacity in the late 1980's and early
1990's, the KPLC official said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has liberalized the power sector and encouraged
independent power producers to build power plants. So far only two
power plants constructed by independent power producers are
operational, which account for a small portion of national power
production.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Power Company said that the country's current peak
power demand stands at 760 megawatts against available capacity of
676.5 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
However, KPLC has assured that essential services and
installations would not suffer from the rationing. They include
hospitals, schools, military sites and vital industries like oil
refineries.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Stock Exchange Hits Lowest Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 31 (Xinhua) - Kenya's stock market plunged to
its lowest level in nearly six years on Tuesday due to the
falling profits in the key agricultural sector and the
government's inability to revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said the Nairobi Stock Exchange's main 20-share
index dropped 63.79 points or 2.49 percent to close at 2,493.50
points, the lowest since December 14, 1993.  The stock
exchange market has been in trouble since the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended a loan of 205 million U.S. dollars
to Kenya in July 1997 because of rampant corruption among
government officials and poor governance, according to analysts
here.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the government has taken
various measures, including the frequent changes of senior
government officials, to revive its economy, but there is still
no sign for the recovery. Corporate profits are weak and the
country's infrastructure is improved slowly .
</P>
<P>
Its economic growth has dropped from 4.6 percent in 1996 to
just 1.8 percent in 1998 and this year is expected to be no
better than the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Looks for Partners to Fund Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 31 (Xinhua) - Tanzania is looking forward
to establishing a special fund for rural electrification, the
Deputy Minister of Energy and Minerals Manju Msambya said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the second national seminar on rural power cooperatives
Msambya requested donors to contribute to the creation and funding
of the facility which will greatly assist Tanzania in realizing
rural electrification.
</P>
<P>
He also called on private businessmen to invest in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Msambya said that the Tanzanian government is looking for a new
energy policy aimed to encourage more private participation in the
power sector as a way of accelerating electrification in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Charcoal is still the major source of energy in most Tanzanian
households, accounting for about 90 percent of the total primary
energy use, the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
The managing director of Tanzania Electric Supply Company
Limited (TANESCO), Baruany Luhanga, said at the opening of the
seminar that achieving rural electrification by different
cooperatives has been proven successful in the United States,
Sweden and other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed his concern about the high electricity
tariff in rural areas and called for affordable services to rural
power consumers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy Returns to NATO Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia's envoy to NATO, Colonel-
General Viktor Zavarzin, has resumed his duties at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, the Interfax news agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zavarzin was recalled to Moscow in protest against NATO air-
strikes over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
However, his return does not indicate that Russia has widened
its cooperation with the military alliance from peacekeeping to
full scale operations, Interfax said, quoting Russian military
officials.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Russia-NATO Permanent Joint Military Council,
which is to resume functions in Brussels next Monday, will focus
on the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, before it resumes work at
the ambassadorial level on September 15.
</P>
<P>
Zavarzin is expected to deal with "all the negative aspects"
of the Russian peacekeepers' part in this operation, which can
only be done within the framework of a normal negotiating process.
Interfax quoted Russian military sources in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Zavarzin was promoted to the rank of colonel-general after
Russian troops made a surprise march to Pristina, capital of the
Yugoslav province, ahead of NATO troops in early June.
</P>
<P>
Russia has some 3,600 troops in Kosovo as part of a NATO-led
peacekeeping force of about 40,000.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued
a statement Wednesday urging the peacekeepers, including both
military and civilian personnel, to be objective in their
operations rather than exercising personal likes or dislikes of
ethnic groups living in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It condemned the month-long cover-up of the discovery of a
mass grave containing 15 ethnic Serbs killed in Gnjlane, which is
inside the U.S. sector of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also expressed its indignation over the slow
progress of the disarming of Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"Albanian armed formations should have sharply curtailed their
activities, but no noticeable sign of this exists," the statement
said.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Denies Possibility of Future Talks with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Pyongyang denied any
possibility for future general-level talks with the United States,
after the two sides failed again to reach any agreement on
demarcating a maritime boundary on the sea off western Korea, the
Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
</P>
<P>
General Ri Chan Bok was the chief negotiator of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), while Major General Michael
Dunn represented the U.S.
</P>
<P>
During the talks at the truce village of Panmunjom on Wednesday,
the DPRK repeated its stance that Pyongyang has never recognized
the so-called northern Limit Line, which was unilaterally set up
by the U.S. at the end of the Korean War in 1953.The DPRK
spokesman said the U.S. lacked the necessary sincerity in solving
the boundary dispute between the north and the south.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, DPRK has no choice but to withdraw from the
meaningless game of marathon talks and to do whatever is possible
to protect the integrity of its maritime territory, KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
This was the 6th round of general-level talks since the naval
forces from the Republic of Korea (ROK) and DPRK exchanged gun
fire off the Korean Peninsula's west coast on June 15 this year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Announces Partial Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Raouf Rawabdeh Wednesday announced a partial reshuffle to his
23-member cabinet, including the appointment of two new ministers
and the shifting of three other portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Shuqum, a fomer member of Jordan's national basketball
team and acting president of the Jordanian basketball
association, was sworn in as Minister of Youth and Sports to
replace Mohammed Kheir Mamsar, Jordan's official news agency
Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Mamsar resigned on July 3 after failing to disuade Kuwait from
boycotting the ninth Pan-Arab games in Amman due to the
participation of Iraq whose 1990 invasion of Kuwait led to the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Mamsar's resignation triggered Wednesday's cabinet reshuffle,
the first since Rawabdeh took office on March 4.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Jumaa Wahsh was appointed Minister of Social
Development to replace Faisal Rufoo, who received the cultural
portfolio, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
In the most noticeable change, the portfolio of information
was given to Deputy Prime Minister Aymen Majali to replace Nasser
Lawzi who was shifted to head the Ministry of Transport.
</P>
<P>
Lawzi is known as a liberal politician who called for greater
press freedom and had been at odds with Rawabdeh, who preferred a
more conservative policy on information.
</P>
<P>
Former Transport Minister Jamal Sarayreh remained in the
cabinet with his other portfolios - Minister of Post and
Telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> Canada Cancels Trade Mission to Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada has canceled a high-
profile trade mission to Australia, the Globe and Mail newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien
decided Tuesday to "defer" the trade mission because of the
absence of many provincial premiers.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is scheduled to leave next week for the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in New Zealand. He will then
travel to Japan to head a delegation of about 200 businessmen and
some provincial premiers, who do not want to extend the trip
beyond Japan, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
About 150 Canadian businessmen signed up for the Australian
portion of the "Team Canada" mission, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Australian High Commissioner Gregory Wood was quoted as saying
that he is disappointed at the change in the mission, but his
government understands the vagaries of political scheduling.
</P>
<P>
In a news release Tuesday, Chretien said all of the provincial
premiers had initially agreed to go to Australia, but several
dropped out because of elections, scheduling conflicts and
personal reasons, according to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Unveils New Financial Products for Borrowers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Launched
Wednesday new loan and hedging products for its borrowers,
offering developing countries more flexibility in managing their
financial risks.
</P>
<P>
"Today's unveiling of fixed-spread LIBOR-based loans and
hedging products comes in response to demand from the bank's
borrowing countries for more flexible financial products and
risk-management tools," the World Bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The fixed-spread loan will be available for loans for which the
invitation to negotiate will be issued on or after September 1,
1999. It will offer World Bank borrowers unprecedented flexibility
to tailor their loan repayment terms to suit their project or loan
portfolio needs.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it will give borrowers the option to change
the currency, or fix, cap, or collar the interest rate of their
loan at any time prior to loan's financial maturity.
</P>
<P>
The hedging products would enable borrowers to enter into
currency and interest rate swaps with the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also be ready to sell borrowers interest rate
caps and collars to assist them in lowering their interest rate
risk, or enter with them into commodity swaps, with the latter on
a pilot basis initially. Borrowers transacting hedges with the
bank would beed to do so under a master derivatives agreement to
be signed with the bank.
</P>
<P>
"These products and the outreach which accompanies them should
have a major development impact. Over time, they will increase
borrowers' financial market skills and help them manage other
balance sheet risks," said Graeme Wheeler, director of the bank's
Financial Products and Services Department.

<HEADLINE> Libyans Mark 30th Anniversary of Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Celebrations for the 30th
anniversary of Libya's 1969 Revolution kicked off Wednesday with a
mass parade at Zawiyah city.
</P>
<P>
Zawiyah, a small city 40 kilometers west of the capital Tripoli,
is practically unknown to people outside Libya. But it drew the
attention of media Wednesday by its Alfateh Zawiyah Wedding, an
event held to mark the revolution.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of local residents emptied the city, which
has a population of about half a million, by gathering at a
downtown square to celebrate what they described as a "special
holiday."
</P>
<P>
Shops, bazaars and schools are closed for the event. Buildings
along the city's four-kilometer-long Public Street are decorated
with colorful flags. Posters featuring Libyan leader Muammar
Ghaddafi are everywhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
People holding national flags and portraits of Ghaddafi marched
through the street, chanting "Alfateh" "Alfateh," meaning
"victory" of Libyan Revolution.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy today. You know 30 years ago, our leader freed
the Libyan people from the monarchy," said a female professor from
the Zawiyah University, who join the local residents in the
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, 1969, a group of young officers led by Ghaddafi
overthrew the monarchy in a military coup. They established a
Revolutionary Command Council with Ghaddafi as chairman and
proclaimed the Libyan Arab Republic.
</P>
<P>
The country was renamed the Great Socialist People's Libyan
Arab Jamahiriya in October 1986.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from some African and Arab countries were also
present at the gathering besides international journalists invited
for the occation.
</P>
<P>
The national celebrations, the first since the United Nations
Security Council suspended on April 5 its sanctions against Libya,
will last for days. A grand parade is expected to be held in
Tripoli with participation of troops from 12 African nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. suspended the sanctions on Libya which were in place
since 1992, after Ghaddafi agreed to hand over the two Libyans
suspected of bombing a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in
1988 which killed 270 people.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges to Help Restore Power Supply in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, Sept 1 (Xinhua) - Britain said on Wednesday it would
pledge an extra 700,000 pounds ( about 1.13 million U.S. dollars)
to ensure that war-shattered Kosovo has reliable power supplies.
</P>
<P>
"This is continuing proof of the UK government's commitment to
rebuilding Kosovo, especially as the cold weather season
approaches," Trade Minister Richard Caborn said.
</P>
<P>
Caborn, who is scheduled to visit Kosovo next month, said the
consortium was also looking to the longer term, developing
proposals for future power generation, transmission and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
"With the help of the UK government money, it is estimated that
within one to two years British companies have prospects of
gaining contracts worth between 10 million and 20 million pounds,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"This will be from work arising out of the concession directly
related to the rehabilitation of the power stations, substations
and transmission lines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain played a very hawkish role in NATO's 72-day-long air
strikes against Yugoslavia, which seriously damaged the Balkan
country and killing thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Most of the power plants in Kosovo were also seriously damaged
during the air strikes.

<HEADLINE> Manila Announces 10 Percent Rise in Social Security Pensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Social Security
System (SSS) Wednesday announced a 10 percent pension increase to
its 800,000 pensioners, Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made here during the 42nd anniversary
celebration of the major social security body in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The increase in social security pension for retirement,
disability and death is being made without need for additional
contributions or any increase in the rate of the contributions,
SSS Chairman Carlos Arellano said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the increase in pensions could not have been
possible were it not for the huge investment earnings.
</P>
<P>
The SSS investment earnings for the first six months of the
year amounted to 11.8 billion pesos (295 million U.S. dollars),
almost half of which came from equity investments.
</P>
<P>
Compared to last year's performance for the same period, this
year's investment income is higher by 43 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arellano also said that its resources had grown to almost 170
billion pesos (4.25 billion dollars) as of this June through
better management of investments.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to review our programs to see how we can
increase or enhance benefits from time to time," Arellano added.

<HEADLINE> China Culture Week to Open With Boom in Paris (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Under the warm autumn Paris
sunshine, a festive Chinese atmosphere was being prepared by the
Maison de UNESCO, which is located south of the Eiffel Tower, for
the official opening of "China Culture Week -'99 Paris,"
beginning in the evening of September 1.
</P>
<P>
Red banners heralding the festival were hanging on light posts
surrounding the building at the south end of the elegant Place de
Fontenoy, just opposite the 18th century Ecole Militaire, with its
imposing imperial architecture, where Napoleon once reviewed his
army.
</P>
<P>
A giant Chinese lion wearing a red costume sits at the garden
of the Maison de UNESCO, greeting the long line of cars of
Parisians returning from two months of summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
Inside the building, Much of China's history has been
recreated. A miniature Peking Opera stage has been constructed in
the center of the great exhibition hall, complete with a wide
range of classic figures from ancient Chinese dramas, including a
heroic woman fighting Mongolian invaders, and another heroic woman
who seeks to avenge her husband who was wrongly executed because
of the treachery of his friends.
</P>
<P>
You can also hear traditional folk songs from the Loess
plateau in northwest Shaanxi Province, or watch a craftswoman
demonstrate how to clip popular Chinese paper crafts with scissors.
</P>
<P>
Through the half-veiled glass wall of a separate room in the
corner of the hall, you can see one of the China's most precious
ancient treasures -- the 2,400 year-old chime bells of the Chu
Kingdom from the Spring and Autumn Warring Kingdoms period. The
bells were found in Suixian, Hubei province.
</P>
<P>
 Ma Chengyuan, president of the Shanghai Museum, and an expert
in paleography and bronzes of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, said:
"Ancient Chinese bronzes belong to the world and do not have
frontiers; the French people are among the few who really
understand them."
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac is also an expert on ancient
Chinese bronzes, said Ma, who was invited by Chirac to dinner at
the Elysee Presidential Palace after his arrival in Paris this
week.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebel Leader Rejects Egyptian-Libyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Southern Sudanese rebel leader
John Garang on Wednesday rejected the Egyptian-Libyan plan aimed
at helping put an end to his country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
Garang said in a statement that his Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA) sought peace through the negotiations with the
Sudanese government conducted in Nairobi, Kenya under the auspices
of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, or IGAD.
</P>
<P>
"The SPLA remains committed to the IGAD peace initiative as the
most credible and viable meditation mechanism, and furthermore
considers that there should not be two parallel initiatives,"
Garang said.
</P>
<P>
Through the Egyptian-Libyan plan, the Khartoum government had
an opportunity for its "reckless practice of forum shopping," he
argued.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed early last month the plan, which calls
for a permanent cease-fire in Sudan and a national reconciliation
conference. The plan has been accepted by the government and the
National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a coalition of northern
opposition parties and the SPLA.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA "urges that the IGAD peace initiative and the
Libya-Egyptian initiative should be coordinated by the two sets of
mediators to avoid parallelism," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has met intermittently with government negotiators in
Nairobi under the auspices of IGAD, but the talks have never
produced more than agreements on short-term cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
The government has opposed the participation of the NDA in the
talks hosted by IGAD, which comprises representatives of Kenya,
Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Garang arrived in Cairo on Monday and met with former Sudanese
Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and other members of his Umma party,
who form a major element of the NDA coalition. He also met with
Egypt's Deputy Prime Minister Youssef Wali who handles relations
with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2 million people have died in Sudan's civil war and
ensuing famines since 1983. The SPLA draws its support from the
Christians and animists of the south who seek autonomy from the
Islamic north.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Ambitious in Training Own Astronauts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is ambitious to
develop more space projects, including the training of its own
astronautical personnel, the Thai News Agency quoted a senior
Science, Technology and Environment Ministry official as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Science Minister Arthit Urairat will lead a group of Thai
delegates from agencies involving in astronautical affairs and
academics from local universities to attend an international space
conference, Suvit Viboonyagseth, the ministry's deputy permanent
secretary, said.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, to be held in New Delhi between November
15 and 20, the minister would propose that a regional remote
zoning branch be set up in Thailand to serve as a training center
for astronautical personnel, including those from Thailand, Suvit
said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand now has technical potential to develop its own
satellite and other space projects, despite inadequate personnel
and budget constraints which had undermined the efforts for
further development, Suvit said.
</P>
<P>
The planned regional remote zoning branch would then help the
country make a good debut for its own space development programs,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok is also planning to take part in a regional satellite
project to follow updated rice information from Japan.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Open lost two of
its major stars Tuesday to injuries: Top-ranked Pete Sampras and
two-time defending champion Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
Sampras withdrew Tuesday morning because of a herniated disk in
his lower back.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, a nagging shoulder injury forced Rafter to quit
against Cedric Pioline with the Frenchman leading 4-6, 4-6, 6-3,7-
5, 1-0 in the fifth set.
</P>
<P>
"On contact with the serve is when I felt a sharp pain," Rafter
said. "It's a funny way to leave a tournament."
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Australian is the first defending champion in U.
S. Open history to lose in the first round. Rafter informed
Pioline of his decision to retire after slapping a volley into the
net.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, No 7 Serena Williams advanced in a masterful and
efficient display of power tennis. Williams, 17, whipped Kimberly
Po 6-1, 6-0 in 49 minutes. Williams had five aces, pounded 26
winners and won nine of 10 points played at the net.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Says Turkey Responsible for Murder of Greek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
Wednesday held the Turkish occupation authorities in northern
Cyprus responsible for the murder of a Greek Cypriot.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said that his
ministry would summon a representative of the United Nations
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) regarding the murder.
</P>
<P>
Stelios Harpas, 69, from the Rizikarpaso village in northern
Cyprus was kidnapped and murdered on Monday night, reportedly by
two persons believed to be Turkish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said "the Cyprus government has an obligation to
state publicly that...the occupation authorities are responsible
for the safety of the enclaved (Greek Cypriots in northern
Cyprus)."
</P>
<P>
He said efforts had been made to bring the body to southern
Cyprus and carry out a post mortem examination.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUKUOKA, Japan, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan faced off South
Korea when the Qualifying round went into full wing at the current
Asian men's basketball championship on Wednesday as the South
Koreans stole away the win and set up a convenient posting in the
quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Point Guard Kang Dong-Hee made a crucial steal with one minute
left to post South Korea a 64-61 knockdown of Japan, who
squandered a six-point lead with 2:30 to go.
</P>
<P>
The ball-handler Kang, 33, initiated a final comeback by a
steal from back court following two 3-pointers including the one
nailed the net with 22 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
The South Koreans turned two fast-breaks into four points to
snatch the key win, which almost insured a finals meeting with the
tournament favorites China.
</P>
<P>
"We played a good defense game," South Korea's head coach Shin
Sun-woo said. "The decided shots from two corners are the key
factor to win the game."
</P>
<P>
The fouled-out Seo Jang-Hoon led the Koreans with 19 points
with Kim and Cho contributing 13 and 10, respectively. Japan's
Hasegawa Makoto led the game with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
"We could have won the game, but we did not," Japan's head
coach Kohama Mototaka said. "I think my players did not take the
game as serious as I thought."
</P>
<P>
Japan could face China in the semi-finals if it beat Chinese
Taipei, who handled off Syria 89-81, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China proved its overwhelming domination in group E in the
round-robin quarter-finals, ousting Saudi Arabia 85-56.
</P>
<P>
The expansion Chinese team had all its players on target with
pivot Wang Zhizhi led the squad with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
China fielded quite different teams in two halves to get all
players pop up for a potential semi-final crash against Japan and
final meeting with South Korea, the only matches that deserve
China's respects.
</P>
<P>
In the other quarter-final game, Lebanon surrendered to Kuwait
for its second loss of the competition, 86-81.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates outplayed Hong Kong of China 94-88,
Bahrain beat Malaysia 90-85, while Philippines overcame Thailand

<HEADLINE> China Culture Week to Open in Paris (Part 2) </HEADLINE>

<P>
Napoleon once said: "If China wakes, the sleeping lion will
shake the world."
</P>
<P>
Lying in his tomb about two kilometers away in the grandiose
golden-crowned Invalides Military Museum to the east, Napoleon
would be amused to know that a Chinese lion is gazing at him from
the garden of UNESCO 200 years later.
</P>
<P>
"This year, two noteworthy international activities
celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China will include the "China Culture Week - '99 Paris
" in coordination with UNESCO. The other is the Fortune 99 Forum
in Shanghai in coordination with Warner Brothers," said Zhao
Qizheng, director of the Information Office of the State Council
of China.
</P>
<P>
With a 320-man delegation and 40 containers of exhibition
goods, China intends to use Paris to let the French and other
Europeans gain a better understanding of the country, said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
Even before the festival opened, many guests were visiting
the hall, admiring the Peking opera costumes, the ceramics, wooden
and bamboo mini-sculptures, and the ancient classics in Chinese
medicine.
</P>
<P>
 "Heng mei (very beautiful), duo shao qian (How much)?" said a
Frenchman, who spoke a few words of Chinese, as he watched a
painter from Zhejiang province paint a fan with a picture of a
Chinese maiden sitting in a boat on the West Lake in Hangzhou,
longing perhaps for her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
 One reason China chose Paris to hold this exhibition is
because France, among most Western countries, is culturally close
to China.
</P>
<P>
"The cultural level of French people is high. They understand
civilizations and admire the Chinese culture. Among many
foreigners, the French are more familiar with China's history and
traditions," said Ma Chengyuan.
</P>
<P>
"When President Chirac visited the Shanghai Museum he made a
speech saying that the Great Wall is history, the Great Canal is
history, and Pudong New Area in Shanghai is also history,'' said
Zhao Qizheng, a former vice mayor of Shanghai, who accompanied
Chirac during his tour of the Chinese metropolis in May.
</P>
<P>
 Shao Yudong, director of the press and information office
of Shanghai Pudong New Area, said that Pudong is trying to catch
up with the financial district of La Defense, located west of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai municipal government has on display a model of
the financial district in the Pudong New Area, which is called, Lu
Jiazui, and it is one of the fastest developing zones in the Asia-
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Japanese, U.S. and European investment, as well as many
investment projects from Hong Kong and Taiwan, are being made in
Lu Jiazui.

<HEADLINE> Sensex Prices Fall Further At Bombay Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Decision by the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE) to impose additional carryforward margins sent the
market reeling under pressure Wednesday with the sensitive index
(SENSEX) plunging by nearly 74 points owing to all-round bull
liquidation.
</P>
<P>
Speculators sold heavily to reduce their outstanding positions
following BSE's measures to curb excessive volatility.
</P>
<P>
In order to check the recent volatility, BSE imposed additional
carryforward margins and also reduced the intra and inter
settlement scripwise limits effective from next week.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark BSE sensitive index opened slightly up at
4,910.64 points and gradually moved downwards to a day's low of
4,813.21 before closing at 4,824.44 as against Tuesday's close of
4,898.21, showing a sharp loss of 73.77 points, or 1.51 percent.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-100 index also dropped by 39.70 points to 2,153.24
compared with the previous close of 2,192.24.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the net outstanding positions of nearly 25 billion
rupees at the end of Tuesday seemed to be much higher and some
correction was imminent for a healthy market.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and the Dollex were quoted substantially down at
494.85 and 189.53 points as against last close of 503.45 and
192.78 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Plunges Kuomintang into Conflict Situation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency
released a commentary today denouncing Lee Teng-hui for inserting
his "two states" remarks into a resolution of the Kuomintang held
on August 28-29.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that under Lee's control, the "2nd plenary
session of the Kuomintang's 15th Congress" passed the resolution
to "set the tone" of the cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
His move of including the "two states" remarks into party
resolution exposed his political malice and naivety as well as his
intention to split Chinese territorial integrity and sovereignty
and an attempt to separate Taiwan from China, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has imposed his splittist views and separatist
stance upon the Kuomintang and pushed Taiwan people to the abyss
of greater crisis by undermining the foundation of exchanges and
cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, which
seriously threatens the cross-straits relations as well as peace
and stability in the Asian-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the Kuomintang had all along adhered
to the "one China" policy and fought against "Taiwan independence"
since it fled from the mainland to Taiwan in 1949. However, after
Lee took power, he has changed the Kuomintang's "one China" policy
step by step.
</P>
<P>
During his rule in Taiwan, he has created in succession the "
two equal political entities", "separate rules on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits", and went as far as putting forward the
splittist "two states" remarks, the commentary points out.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Plunges Kuomintang into Conflict Situation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee's move of putting the "two states" remarks into the
Kuomintang resolution has plunged the party into a conflict
situation which will put an end to the future of the Kuomintang,
the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stresses that ever since the emergence of the "
Taiwan issue", the Chinese Communist Party and the government have
insisted on its "one China" stand, and put forward the creative
framework of "peaceful reunification," and "one country, two
systems" for the purpose of solving the Taiwan issue, with the
prerequisite of one China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has all along strongly fought against
the "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan", and "Taiwan
independence", and promised that within the framework of "one
China", Taiwan will enjoy high autonomy after reunification.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government advocates peaceful reunification of the
motherland, but never promises to give up its use of force.
</P>
<P>
Lee stubbornly advocated his "two states" remarks, and went so
far as putting it into the Kuomintang resolution, which will
result in serious damage to the cross-Straits relations. Lee's
splittist attempt is doomed to fail, the commentary stresses.

<HEADLINE> China Culture Week to Open in Paris (Part3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his message of congratulations, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said that the China Culture Week is significant in
promoting friendship between French and Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's French counterpart, President Chirac, said the
principal theme of the culture week -- China Marches Toward the
21st Century -- shows that the "great country, rich in a
tradition of several millenniums, is prepared to whole-heartedly
enter the modern age."
</P>
<P>
The Secretary General of UNESCO, Frederico Mayor, said that
through this cultural week, his organization wants to let the
public see a true picture of Chinese culture, which is often
presented in a twisted way and misunderstood in the West.
</P>
<P>
In the French popular culture, China is viewed as a mysterious
country which has two Homeric monuments -- the Forbidden City and
the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
To let the French general public get closer to China, an extra
program, "Intervilles" (intercity), a sports competition program,
will be presented by France's number one television channel TF1
and the Chinese China Central TV during the cultural week.
</P>
<P>
The famous French TV actor Jean-Pierre Foucault, who will
participate in the competition between teams from Paris and
Beijing on Saturday night, said that for him, China is a vast
country with great cooking.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I can't wait for the competition, because it is
clothed in an exceptional character," said Foucault when
commenting on the first international version of "Intervilles"
since its creation by French television in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, will head the Paris team.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing team also intends to enter its best in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
The competition will be held in front of the famous Chateau de
Vincennes military fortification in southwest Paris. Five
thousand spectators and hundreds of thousands of television
viewers will watch the show, which will be broadcast live by TF1
and CCTV.
</P>
<P>
The French sports star Nathalie Simon, who will also join the
program, said she was amused that CCTV has provided twin girls,
Fang Fang and Yuan Yuan, both 19 years old, to play her part in
the Chinese version of "Intervilles" in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese version of the Interville show has won great
success after one year of broadcasting by CCTV, said Xin Shaoying,
the co-producer of the show who studied television production in
France.
</P>
<P>
This time, the twin girls will help Nathalie serve as the
hostess of the show in French and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
One segment of the show will feature a French cow or bull
chasing French and Chinese runners in a circle filled with wooden
barriers.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- S.R. Nathan, a career public
officer and veteran diplomat, was sworn into office Wednesday
evening as Singapore's sixth president at a ceremony at the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
At the swearing-in ceremony attended by cabinet members, MPs,
personalities of communities and representatives from all walks of
life, the new president reviewed a guard of honor and delivered a
speech.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong made a welcoming speech
before Nathan.
</P>
<P>
Goh said, "The president is the head of state and the symbol of
the nation" and he reiterated that "this role is ceremonial."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said the president's functions are not
ceremonial when he exercises custodial powers to decide whether to
allow the government to draw upon hard-earned past reserves and
whether to accept or reject nominations to key appointments.
</P>
<P>
"As goal-keeper, the president becomes our last line of
defense," Goh said. "If he fumbles, Singapore may never recover
from an irresponsible or dishonest government."
</P>
<P>
Goh repeated what he had said six year ago to then president
Ong Teng Cheong, saying "my government has no intention of
squandering the financial reserves we have so painstakingly
accumulated, nor depart from the cardinal principle of appointing
the best officers to key positions on merit."
</P>
<P>
"In short, my government will not give you cause to exercise
your veto powers," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, President Nathan vowed to be a president for all
Singaporeans, saying "every community of Singaporeans will be my
parish."
</P>
<P>
He promised "to give of my best, the very best I can, and
without fear or favor."
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to exercise the president's custodial powers
"in Singapore's national interests, as my duty and conscience
requires."
</P>
<P>
Returned unopposed on nomination day for the presidential
elections, Nathan assumes presidency without a national polling
and succeeds Ong Teng Cheong as Singapore's second elected
president.
</P>
<P>
Before the swearing-in ceremony, a farewell ceremony was held
for Singapore's fifth president Ong Teng Cheong who ended his
six-year term Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Negotiator Urges Israel to Refrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) - Following his meeting with
Israeli officials, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat
Wednesday urged Israel to refrain from issuing ultimatum and
threats.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Jerusalem, Erekat said that he and
his Israeli counterpart, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's envoy Gilad
Sher, have made maximum efforts to bridge the differences between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the two remaining blocks in the negotiations are
the issues concerning release of Palestinian prisoners and
resumption of the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that he has submitted new suggestions to the
Israeli negotiators on bridging the differences, and hoped to
continue the talks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Palestinian National Authority has
shown determination to reach peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I would urge my colleagues and the Israeli government to
refrain from ultinatum or threats," Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued earlier in the day, Sher said that from
the Israeli respective, the negotiation with the Palestinians is
over.
</P>
<P>
He also said that no further meeting is planned between
him and Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Sher also warned that Barak may announce in his cabinet
meeting later on Wednesday that the Palestinians are interested in
the implementation of the "original" Wye agreement, which means
it will be carried out according to Israeli interpretation.
</P>
<P>
Barak has threatened that if no agreement is reached on
Wednesday evening, Israel will take unilateral actions.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have been engaged in intensified
efforts to reach an agreement on Israeli proposals over the
modification of the Wye interim agreement before United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright starts a visit to the
region on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main issue blocking a breakthrough is the release of
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release 650 political
prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities, but Israel
insists that it will release only 500 prisoners and will not
free those Palestinians involved in killings of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak has proposed to postpone the last of the
three stages of troop withdrawals stipulated in the Wye accord
until February next year, when the two sides are supposed to
have worked out a framework for the final-status talks, which
deal with thorny issues like Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians want Israel to complete all the troop
withdrawals at an earlier date in line with the original
timetable of the Wye accord, which calls on Israel to hand
over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in
three stages over a period of 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Barak's hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu carried out
the first stage of the agreement late last year before
freezing it in a failed attempt to woo back rebellious
coalition partners opposed to territorial concession to the
Palestinians.

SHANGHAI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange,

</P>
<P>
The Top 50 were selected by "Listed Companies," a magazine

<HEADLINE> UK's Mowlam Urges Parties to Back Northern Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam on Wednesday urged parties from both sides of
the community not to give up on the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The basic desire to end the conflict was still there, she said.
"That is why the parties should be in there, talking to each other
about the Mitchell review, not walking away."
</P>
<P>
"People know the Good Friday Agreement is the best chance we
have. But unless there is confidence throughout the community it
simply won't work," she told an audience at Ulidia Integrated
school in Carrickfergus in County Antrim.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell is to begin a major review
of the Good Friday Agreement next week, amid growing fears about
the future of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam's speech was widely considered as a major pitch to both
the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein to give that review a chance to
succeed. Her speech comes at a time when there is growing anger
among unionists about recent violence that has been blamed on the
IRA, and unease within the catholic community over a spate of
loyalist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state said the murder of Charles Bennett and
an alleged republican gun-running plot from the United States, as
well as the continuing loyalist violence, had raised genuine
concerns over the state of the paramilitary cease-fire; but people
had to ask themselves how far Northern Ireland had come in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
She then praised the bravery of the parties supporting the
agreement, noting their efforts were taking Northern Ireland
forward to the future, not back to the past.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said her ruling on the cease-fire had "not been about
appeasement, not about turning a blind eye, but about attempting
to help this province end its historic conflict."
</P>
<P>
Turning to the recent threats made against teenagers in
Northern Ireland by paramilitary groups, Mowlam said: "Let no one
be in any doubt, I condemn kangaroo courts of any kind."
</P>
<P>
Mowlam's remarks come at a time when neither the Ulster
Unionists or Sinn Fein have yet decided whether to participate in
the crucial review of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists responded furiously when Mowlam announced
last week that she believed the IRA cease-fire was still intact --
despite reports of recent violence and alleged gun-running -- and
have postponed a decision on a possible boycott of the Agreement
review.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Land Excluded From Philippine Charter Change: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural lands are excluded
from the proposed 1987 Philippine Constitution amendment aimed to
allow foreigners to own land in the nation, a senior government
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu made the statement when
presenting his department's budget before the members of a House
subcommittee, Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Agricultural lands are excluded in the land ownership issue,"
Espiritu told the House members.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the economic constitutional changes being
pushed by President Joseph Estrada are for the charter to
stipulate a general economic policy which would be effective only
after Congress shall have enacted an enabling law on land
ownership, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
"The 1987 charter would only open opportunities. It is still
Congress which will have to set the limitations. So, there is no
danger that national interest will be prejudiced," Espiritu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Espiritu explained that land ownership does not mean
productivity. "We need capital to make them productive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"By allowing foreigners to own non-agricultural lands would
open many options for increased inflow of the needed capital to
develop our local industries," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"We need capital to ensure productive human and natural
resources," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Releases Rehabilitation Program Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
Wednesday released a new program plan on rehabilitation services
for disabled people for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The plan presents a comprehensive picture of the current and
planned provision and demand of various rehabilitation services.
</P>
<P>
The plan reports on the development of various rehabilitation
services since the last review in 1994, and gives a projection on
the supply and demand of these services up to March 2003 based on
the approved projects in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
It provides a useful reference for relevant government
departments and service providers to plan and develop their
services in meeting demands in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"The new plan is based on the outcome of a review conducted by
a committee chaired by the Commissioner for Rehabilitation with
representatives from government departments, the Hospital
Authority, the Vocational Training Council and the Hong Kong
Council of Social Service," said a spokesman for the Health and
Welfare Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The review concluded that in the next five years, all service
providers will ensure that continued care and support is provided
to people with disabilities to facilitate their integration and
participation in the community.
</P>
<P>
To meet future demands, the government has already earmarked
resources to provide over 4,000 additional day and residential
places in the next few years, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the plan has also identified about 100 issues that
require further study by various parties concerned before the next
review is due in 2002. These include recommendations to further
improve rehabilitation services and requests or proposals from the
non-governmental sector which the government and statutory bodies
have not been able to implement or commit due to policy or
resources considerations.
</P>
<P>
Raymond Wu, chairman of the Rehabilitation Advisory Committee,
welcomed the publication of the plan and paid tribute to the joint
efforts and collaboration made by the government and non-
governmental sector in the review.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The office building for leading
officials of the future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
was put to use Wednesday without a formal unveiling ceremony.
</P>
<P>
About 50 office workers are ready to start work at the building,
according to Ho Veng On, who acts as a coordinator between the
office of the chief executive-designate of the Macao SAR and the
current Portuguese Macao government.
</P>
<P>

appointment of eight leading SAR officials on the basis of
nomination by Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive-designate of the
SAR.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho told reporters Tuesday that the building is only a
place for the leading officials to make preparations for their
future work, and it will not become a second power center, for the
Portuguese Macao government holds administrative power till
December 19.
</P>
<P>
Decoration of the building started at the end of June. The
expenses are defrayed by the central government of China and will
be repaid by the Macao SAR government after the latter's

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Puts Emphasis on "Three Stresses" Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, said today that the educating of
party officials in the "three stresses" must be carried out to the
letter.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks while attending the opening ceremony of a
new semester of the Party School, of which he is also president.
</P>
<P>
The "three stresses" involves underlining and strengthening
theoretical study, political awareness, and good conduct.
</P>
<P>
"The education program has started well and should also end on
a high note," said Hu, who is also a member of the Secretariat of
the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The new education drive is considered an important measure
taken by the Party to improve its leadership and the quality of
Party officials.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, notable achievements have been made in the
"three stresses" education campaign, Hu said but added that there
is still a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
"Party leaders at all levels should improve their study of
Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and particularly Deng
Xiaoping Theory, so as to sharpen their political consciousness,"
he commented.
</P>
<P>
He said the experiment carried out in a number of regions and
ministries has proved the effectiveness of the education campaign
in improving the leadership of the Party and working attitude of
cadres.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged Party committees and leaders at various levels to put
the education campaign at the top of their agenda, and take
concrete steps to improve their leadership and work standards.
</P>
<P>
The Party School welcomed 835 students in the second half of
this year, including cadres attending the training course for
minority Chinese affairs from Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous
regions, and cadres whose native home is Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Qinghong, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of
the CPC Central Committee, member of the Secretariat of the CPC
Central Committee, and head of the Organization Department of the
CPC Central Committee, was also present at the opening ceremony
today.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Raise Growth Target: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will raise
its growth rate target of one percent following the central bank's
optimistic projection, Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry is working for a new growth target of
over one percent after the Bank of Thailand (BOT) forecast Tuesday
that the Thai economy can grow by three to four percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin was quoted by Thailand News Agency as saying that the
new growth target will be announced after the Office of the
National Economic and Social Development Board releases its
economic report for the second quarter, expected by the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin noted that increase in domestic production and
consumption as well as exports were the main reasons for the
economic revival of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The BOT forecast that the Thai economy could grow by three to
four percent this year due to the signs of economic recovery such
as a 6.6 percent year-on-year export increase in July and rising
industrial index and domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's manufacturing output in July was up 13.7 percent
compared to the same period last year while surplus in current and
trade accounts soared to 1.2 billion and 976 million U.S. dollars
respectively due to rising tourism revenue and slower pace of
import growth, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The BOT's projection is in line with that of the Finance
Ministry's Fiscal Policy Office, which says that most economic
indicators of the Thai economy have moved upwards since May,
including industrial index, domestic consumption and exports with
a moderate inflation rate of 0.5 to one percent.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Rapporteur Arrives in Pakistan for Women Rights Talks </HEADLINE>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Special United Nations
rapporteur for violence against women Swami Radhika arrived here
Wednesday on a two-week visit to Pakistan and Afghanistan for
talks on women rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. rapporteur will proceed to Afghanistan next week to
analyze the situation arising from violence against women in the
country, especially woman refugees, said U.N. Information Center
spokesman Stephanie Bunker here.
</P>
<P>
Swami, a lawyer by profession, will meet U.N. officials and
representatives of NGOs in Afghanistan and discuss with them
matters relating to violence against women, according to Bunker.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources said Afghanistan's ruling Taliban have agreed to
allow Swami's visit and promised to facilitate her during her
stay.
</P>
<P>
Taliban, which closed down education for women, have been under
fierce criticism for their women rights record.
</P>
<P>
Swami will also evaluate the situation of women rights in
Pakistan. A recent report said that in every second a Pakistani
woman is the victim of direct or indirect form of mental or
physical violence against them including rape, murder, chopping of
limbs or being burnt alive.

<P>
FUZHOU, September 1 (Xinhua)-- Chinese police have arrested 76
people who were planning to illegally emigrate to the United
States by stowing away on a ship.
</P>
<P>
The group was discovered on the coastal shore of east China's
Fujian Province after failing to make contact with the vessel.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a report from a local tip off, Putian County police
swooped to the area in the early hours of August 31 and found many
of the band walking disconsolately back from the seashore.
</P>
<P>
The police learned that they had tried to reach a big cargo
ship in two fishing boats on the evening of August 30. But when
there was no sign of it at the appointed time they decided to
return home and set out another day.
</P>
<P>
Police confiscated two mini-vans used by the group of people
mostly from counties near Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province. No
further information on who had organized the plan is available at
this point. The case is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Based Steel Maker Marks Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Shougang Iron and Steel
Complex, a well-known steel maker based in the Chinese capital,
celebrated the 80th anniversary of its founding today but with a
warning that it has to diversify to survive.
</P>
<P>
President of the Shougang group Bi Qun urged staff to work
harder to develop hi-tech products and explore international
markets.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the plant will no longer increase the
production of iron and steel products and by next year the complex
will have to earn 50 percent of its profits from non-steel or
overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Shougang is one of the largest steel makers in China.
Between 1979-1998, the company handed over 25.6 billion yuan as
profits and taxes to the state revenue, while it also kept 16.98
billion yuan for its own use, mainly for technological renovation
and expansion of steel production.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, the company has carried out a series of reforms and
has become a multinational firm engaged in a dozen different
industries.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the group, with a total staff of 210,000 produced 7.51
million tons of iron, 8.02 million tons of steel and 7.03 million
tons of steel plate, 3.1 times, 4.5 times and six times the
figures of twenty years before.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it generated 942 million yuan in profits and 2.16
billion yuan in pre-tax profits.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's GDP Growth May Turn Negative: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth, estimated at 2.5 percent for 1998, is
forecast to slow this year and could even turn negative in the
final months of the year, a local financial institution said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered Bank said in its Business Trends in Zimbabwe
that output would fall in all three productive sectors of
agriculture, mining and manufacturing, so that the minimal growth
forecast would come from the services sector.
</P>
<P>
This is in line with a recent forecast by the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe which projected that growth in real GDP for 1999 was only
1.1 percent due to the poor performance of the mining and
manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered Bank said in 1980, agriculture, mining and
manufacturing accounted for 48 percent of GDP but currently their
share had fallen below 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
During 1990s, real GDP growth was estimated to have grown 2.2
percent annually, while population growth had averaged 3.1 percent
a year.
</P>
<P>
The bank said as a result, GDP per head had fallen about eight
percent over the period.

<HEADLINE> 8 Killed in Fresh Communal Clashes in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people died and
six others were injured in two fresh communal clashes in Maluku,
Indonesia, on Wednesday, according to the Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The clashes occurred in Baguala subdistrict in the provincial
capital of Ambon and Saparua subdistrict in Central Maluku.
</P>
<P>
The deaths had not been caused by security forces' actions but
by the rioters involved who fought each other with knives and
self-made bombs, Ambon police chief Lt. Col. Ghufron said.
</P>
<P>
He said security forces succeeded in quelling the conflicts
within two hours with the help of military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The police were investigating the clashes but had so far not
made any arrests, Ghufron said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes in Ambon first broke out in January, in which more
than a hundred people were killed and tens of thousands of people
were forced to flee their villages.
</P>
<P>
Local religious figures, along with the military, have tried to
reconcile the warring camps but clashes broke out again in
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Ambon police spokesman M.J. Yohanis said since July 24, a total
of 132 civilians had been killed and 458 others injured in
communal clashes in the region.
</P>
<P>
In addition, one security officer died and 38 others were
injured.
</P>
<P>
Yohanis said the clashes had also destroyed 765 houses, 196
shops, one bank, three hotels, six government offices and eight
commercial buildings, seven houses of worship, two school
buildings and 19 cars.
</P>
<P>
The police seized 77 people (18 of whom were detained as
suspects) and confiscated 276 weapons, including self-made bombs
and bullets, he added.

<HEADLINE> Black Buck on Decline in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The population of black
bucks inhabiting in Nepal is on decline for lack of well-planned
and concerted efforts and there is an urgent need for the
protection of the animal, the official RSS news agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
belonging to the antelope family, the black buck is one of the
endangered species of wildlife in the world and is among the 26
protected species in Nepal. The number of the animal in Nepal
reached its high of 177 in 1984 and began the downslide
afterwards. It declined to just 54 in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The black buck, which inhabits in the Bardiya district in
southwestern Nepal, prefers to live in dry grassland and in close
proximity to human settlements. Large numbers of black bucks are
said to have escaped to neighboring India when they are driven
away by local farmers as these animals cause great damages to
their crops.
</P>
<P>
Once in the Indian territory, the animals are pursued further
by Indian farmers, thus giving them no chances to return.
</P>
<P>
Lack of effective management, scarcity of fodder and water
around its natural habitat and the gradual depletion of pasture
and forage due to overgrazing by domestic animals are the main
reasons for the dwindling of black buck population.
</P>
<P>
The black buck is so agile that it can jump up to 10-15 feet
above the ground and run 80 kilometers per hour. It is also known
for its special ability to make three turns during a leap in the
air.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The MarComAsia '99, the only
trade fair featuring the latest concept, techniques and tools of
the Asian marketing and communication industries, opened here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the fair
drew the participation of 80 exhibitors from Hong Kong, the
Chinese mainland and Taiwan, and Singapore and India.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Robin Chan, chairman of the
Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said Hong Kong is the ideal
platform to host MarComAsia as it ranks first in the world in
terms of per capita advertisement spending.
</P>
<P>
It is also regarded as the most prominent exporter of marketing,
advertising and communication services in the Asia-Pacific region,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from being a big advertising market itself, Hong Kong is
also a leading exporter of advertising services including ad
design, media buying, direct marketing, graphic design, marketing
consultancy and customized market research," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"The export of these advertising and market research services
totaled 2.7 billion HK dollars (346 million U.S. dollars) in 1997,
representing an average annual growth of over 21 percent since
1990," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chan also highlighted the emergence of the Internet as a new
medium for advertising.
</P>
<P>
"More companies with strong IT background are providing
Internet advertising and marketing services and it is widely
believed that Internet advertising will continue to grow at a fast
pace," he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Philippine Oil Companies Charged With Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Bureau of
Internal Revenue (BIR) has filed a tax evasion case against
Petrolink Corporation and is filing a similar suit versus Lubwell
Corp., a presidential source said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, presidential spokesman Jerry Barrican said
the case against Petrolink was filed on August 23 while the case
against Lubwell will be lodged within this week.
</P>
<P>
Barrican added that six other oil companies were sent pre-audit
notices in compliance with the principle of due process.
</P>
<P>
"Appropriate charges will be filed against them later on should
evidence so warrant," he said.
</P>
<P>
BIR Commissioner Beethoven Rualo earlier reported that these
oil companies have declared their sales of jet fuel as kerosene,
and paid only 60 centavos per liter as excise tax (one peso is
equal to 100 centavos). The excise tax for jet fuel is 3.67 pesos
per liter (one U.S. dollar is equal to 40 pesos).
</P>
<P>
Rualo said that the government is being defrauded of revenues
estimated at 2 billion pesos (50 million dollars) to 3 billion
pesos (75 million dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
Excise tax is collected by the government on alcohol, tobacco
and petroleum products.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese version of "Japan
's Responsibility for War", a book written by a Japanese veteran
about his country's aggression against China between 1931 and 1945,
went on sale today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese version was jointly published by the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the Social Science Document
Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
The author of the book, Wakatsuke Yasuo, was recruited into the
Japanese army in the 1930s and later took part in the Japanese
aggression against China. He said he meant the book to be an
atonement for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
In his book, Wakatsuke Yasuo writes that it was the Japanese
militarists who waged the catastrophic war against China which
caused huge miseries for both the Japanese and Chinese people. He
cites the Mikado, or the Emperor of Japan, and the Mikado system
as the chief culprits and criminals who should take the blame for
the war.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese version of this book was issued in Japan in 1995,
creating a great stir among the public.

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Rich and Poor in Vietnam Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The average incomes in Vietnam
are rising but the gap between rich and poor is growing, Vietnam's
English daily Vietnam News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A survey, conducted in cooperation with the World Bank, the
United Nations Development Program and Swedish International
Development Agency, showed that average per capita income across
all sectors of the country is now 3.465 Vietnamese dong (VND) (248
U.S. dollars) a year, a 250 percent increase over 1993's figure.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that average urban income among the 6,000
households questioned is 9.057 million VND (648 U.S. dollars) a
year, a 3.7-fold increase over 1993, while rural incomes have
increased two-fold to 2.544 million VND (182 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The percentage of households suffering food shortages fell from
20-25 percent in 1992-1993 to almost 15 percent in 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
The survey also reveals that increased incomes have resulted in
a significant improvement in living standards, with spending power
up 140 percent in the five years from 1993 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, despite these positive results the survey exposes a
widening gap between rich and poor, with the highest income group
earning 11 times more than the lowest. In 1996, the figure was a
mere 2.8 times.

<HEADLINE> Poor Will Pay Less Interest Tax Than Rich: Vice-Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite their fears to the
contrary low income people in China will have more to gain than
lose under the new tax on savings interest scheme, Vice-Minister
of Finance Gao Qiang said here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed 20-percent tax rate on savings interest will mean
a cut of the interest rate by 0.45 percentage points, he explained
in a news release.
</P>
<P>
According to Gao, the tax, which was approved by the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, on Monday, is expected to
boost the government's coffers by an additional 20 to 30 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that low income people will suffer a certain loss
of interest due to the new tax. However, he stressed that since
the bulk of the country's nearly 6,000 billion yuan of savings
deposits are owned by a small group of people, it will be the rich
who bear the lion's share of the tax.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the government intends to use the money
raised by the new tax solely to improve the living standards of
low income people, including raising allowances for laid off
workers, increasing pensions for retired people and lifting the
minimum level of subsistence for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence low income people will have more to gain once
these new measures are introduced," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government is also considering reducing or
exempting interest tax on savings deposits when they are used for
education insurance, housing funds, pension or unemployment
insurance.
</P>
<P>
China has slashed interest rates from over nine percent to the
current 2.25 percent over the past two years. However, it has
failed to reverse the falling trend in investment growth and
sluggish consumption even though prices have been falling for more
than 20 consecutive months.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria begins troops withdrawal From S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Tuesday formally began
its troops pullout from Sierra Leone, a Nigerian newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of Nigeria's 2,000 contingent of the Economic
Community of West African States peace force (ECOMOG) were
airlifted out of the country Tuesday, according to the Guardian
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister, Dapo Sarumi, last week said that
Nigeria's 12,000- strong contingent in the ECOMOG force would be
airlifted in phases at a rate of 2,000 troops a month.
</P>
<P>
However, a battalion will be left behind for the modified role
of disarming and ensuring security in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The pullout is expected to last six months, during which period
some 750 civilians stranded in Sierra Leone would be stripped
home, the minister had said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troop's withdrawal is mainly based on financial
considerations. Nigeria has been repeatedly calling for the
United Nations to take over its peace- keeping role in S. Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian troop serves the backbone of the 14,000-strong
ECOMOG force,
</P>
<P>
which moved into Sierra Leone from Liberia in the middle of 1997
to support the elected President Tejan kabbah, who was ousted
earlier by a coup of the country's military junta. Since the late
1997, the ECOMOG force had been fighting with S. Leone rebels,
until the June cease-fire this year before a peace agreement was
reached in Togo's capital Lome ending the country's nine-year
civil war.

SHANGHAI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's President Jamil

<HEADLINE> Angola Rejects Establishment of Humanitarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Angola refused on Tuesday a
proposal of establishing humanitarian corridors for helping
impoverished population in the interior rural areas, saying that
"a majority of those impoverished people are in zones under the
government administration."
</P>
<P>
Angolan Minister of Assistance and Reintegration was quoted
here on Wednesday by local press as saying that the flow of
population from the rural area to the cities was a pity, because
they were forced to leave their rural areas by the rebels with an
aim to create problems in the cities controlled by the government
troops.
</P>
<P>
As for those living in the areas controlled by the rebels, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
Albino Malungo said, " there lives only a small amount of people,
without humanitarian crisis, for they are working in the forest or
the agricultural areas."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that only when the rebels stop attacking the
humanitarian columns can the non-government organizations (NGOs)
enter those areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, who recently made a visit to Geneva,
Swiss, the humanitarian situation in Angola has "changed a lot"
and the country is expected to obtain more humanitarian
assistance.
</P>
<P>
As for the increase of the number of displaced families and
abandoned children in Luanda, capital of Angola, Malungo said it
was due to "the afflux of the people searching for security."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of reinstallation of agriculture, Malungo
expressed his anxiety over the problem of the grain seeds, saying
that the people have few means of production as the agricultural
period is approaching.
</P>
<P>
But Malungo said he believes the agricultural period will not
be missed since Angola has gained the support from some NGOs, such
as "Save the Children" and the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), which have provided the rural residents with seeds and
other agricultural materials.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs
Minister Jaswant Singh said Wednesday that there were reports that
Osama Bin Laden had been involved in the conflict between India
and Pakistan in Kargil and he called Bin Laden an international
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
"At the appropriate time, they will be pronounced upon," the
minister told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Singh also ruled out the possibility of India going to the
International Court of Justice to seek compensation from Pakistan
for its alleged incursions into Kargil.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been punished by the Indian Armed Forces for its
misadventure in Kargil, he said, adding that it suffered heavy
casualties in the operations and its economy has been ruined, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister rejected as "completely unfounded" Pakistan's
claim that it had repulsed an Indian Army attack to capture a
Pakistani post in the Shyok-Turtuk sector near the Siachen
glacier.
</P>
<P>
He denied reports suggesting that Pakistani regulars had
intruded the Kutch area as a retaliatory move to the downing of a
Pakistani naval aircraft on August 10.
</P>
<P>
However, he asserted that any violation of Indian air or land
space will meet with the same response Indian forces had
demonstrated while evicting Pakistani intruders in Kargil.

<HEADLINE> China's Li People See Earth-Shaking Changes On Southern Island Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- To the Li people, who are the
aborigines of China's island province Hainan, earth-shaking
changes have taken place since the founding of the People's
Republic and after Hainan became a province in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is the country's largest special economic zone. It has 7.
43 million people, 1.24 million of them from various ethnic groups,
including 1.14 million Li and 60,000 Miao.
</P>
<P>
Before New China was founded in 1949, most of the Li lived deep
in the island's mountains and led a miserable life, with not
enough to eat and wear. But New China brought development
opportunities to Hainan and good fortune to the islanders. From
1988 to 1998, the Central Government and Hainan Provincial
Government spent well over 22.6 billion yuan in improving
infrastructure in areas inhabited by ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The completed projects include the eastern expressway from
Haikou, the provincial capital, to Sanya, a popular tourist
destination on the southern tip of the island; an international
airport in Sanya; and a great number of new berths for ships.
</P>
<P>
The improved infrastructure allowed ethnic groups to use a
billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment for 900 projects.
Areas that had no industries now have industrial enterprises like
the Hainan Natural Gas Chemical Fertilizer Plant, tropical cash
crops, and tourism in Sanya and Tongshi.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the GDP of the areas was 10 billion yuan and the
number of people living in poverty went down to 250,000 from 870,
000, while the per capita income of farmers was 1,318 yuan and
most rural residents no longer lived in mud huts and had moved
into spacious brick housing.
</P>
<P>
The Li people's ideas have also changed dramatically and they
no longer look down on commerce and have learned how to do
business and promote themselves.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Li Dehui, a Li farmer from Sanya, was praised
for being able to make 70,000 yuan annually during a visit by
President Jiang Zemin to the island.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Negotiator Claims End to Talks Over Wye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) - Following his meeting with
Palestinian officials, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's envoy
Gilad Sher said Tuesday that from the Israeli respective, the
talks with the Palestinians over the implementation of Wye accord
is over.
</P>
<P>
Sher said that no further meeting has been planned between
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Sher noted Barak may announce in his cabinet meeting later
on Tuesday that the Palestinians are interested in the
implementation of the "original" Wye agreement, which means it
will be carried out according to Israeli interpretation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been engaged in intensified efforts to
reach an agreement on Israeli proposals over the modification of
the Wye interim agreement before United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright starts a visit to the region on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main issues blocking a breakthrough were the release of
Palestinian prisoners and the timetable for Israeli troop
redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release 650 political
prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities, but Israel
insists that it will release only 500 prisoners and will not
free those Palestinians involved in killings of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Barak has proposed to postpone the last of the three
stages of troop withdrawals stipulated in the Wye accord until
February next year, when the two sides are supposed to have
worked out a framework for the final-status talks, which deal
with thorny issues like Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians want Israel to complete all the troop
withdrawals at an earlier date in line with the original
timetable of the Wye accord, which calls on Israel to hand
over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in
three stages over a period of 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Barak's hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu carried out
the first stage of the agreement late last year before
freezing it in a failed attempt to woo back rebellious
coalition partners opposed to territorial concession to the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Opens Office in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank officially
opened its new Singapore office Wednesday, declaring the objective
of the move is to facilitate the institution's liaison with local
and regional entities, to coordinate the bank's work program and
to develop long-term strategy for the bank in the region.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Finance Lim
Siong Guan and Vice President of the East Asia and Pacific Region
of the World Bank Michel Severino jointly officiated at the
opening of the World Bank office.
</P>
<P>
Severino said at the opening ceremony that the office will
maintain close contacts with official and private sector experts
in Singapore, the financial community in the city state and
elsewhere in the region and regional coordinating bodies and think
tanks.
</P>
<P>
He noted the economic and financial volatility in the region in
the past two years has set back the poverty reduction efforts that
have been promising in this region.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis underlined a fundamental truth: that economic
growth must be sustainable institutionally, socially,
environmentally and culturally," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we know that this is very difficult to achieve --
especially from a starting point of widespread poverty," he added.
</P>
<P>
Severino emphasized that "the crisis also underlined all
countries, whether rich or poor, must play their part to promote
global prosperity, stability and security."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Negotiator Claims End to Talks Over Wye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) - Following his meeting with
Palestinian official, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's envoy
Gilad Sher said on Wednesday that from the Israeli respective, the
talks with the Palestinians over the implementation of the Wye
accord is over.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Sher said that no further meeting has been
planned between him and the Palestinian senior negotiator Saeb
Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Sher noted Barak may announce in his cabinet meeting later
on Tuesday that the Palestinians are interested in the
implementation of the "original" Wye agreement, which means it
will be carried out according to Israeli interpretation.
</P>
<P>
However, Erekat told reporters in Jerusalem that the two sides
will continue negotiating in a bid to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke against the ultimatum that Israel had fixed
for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have been engaged in intensified
efforts to reach an agreement on Israeli proposals over the
modification of the Wye interim agreement before United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright starts a visit to the
region on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The main issues blocking a breakthrough were the release of
Palestinian prisoners and the timetable for Israeli troop
redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand that Israel release 650 political
prisoners, those jailed for anti-Israel activities, but Israel
insists that it will release only 500 prisoners and will not
free those Palestinians involved in killings of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Barak has proposed to postpone the last of the three
stages of troop withdrawals stipulated in the Wye accord until
February next year, when the two sides are supposed to have
worked out a framework for the final-status talks, which deal
with thorny issues like Jerusalem and Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians want Israel to complete all the troop
withdrawals at an earlier date in line with the original
timetable of the Wye accord, which calls on Israel to hand
over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in
three stages over a period of 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Barak's hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu carried out
the first stage of the agreement late last year before
freezing it in a failed attempt to woo back rebellious
coalition partners opposed to territorial concession to the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Russia Investigating Blast in Central Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian investigators are
probing two leads in an explosion Tuesday evening that rocked
Moscow's Okhotny Ryad shopping center near the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the main
successor to the Soviet KGB, have postulated links between the
bombing and the latest events in the Caucasus, as well as to
extremist organizations, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Dagestani separatists have threatened to carry out terrorist
acts inside Russia in the wake of the federal forces' successful
operation in the Caucasus, Interfax quoted FSB sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police have found at the scene of the explosion a
flyer claimed to be written by a "Revolutionary Writers Union," an
organization not heard of before.
</P>
<P>
A total of 41 people were injured in the "Dynamite" electronic
gaming arcade on the third level of the mall at around 20:00 local
time Tuesday. Twenty-four people, five of them children, remain
hospitalized. Nine are described as in serious condition with
wounds received from flying glass and game machine fragments.
</P>
<P>
The flyer denounces consumerism and hails "city guerrilla
warfare" aimed at creating a "revolutionary situation" in the
country, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"Actions similar to today's create a certain social machine, of
which just experimental samples have been demonstrated. It will
gradually gain the status of a real public factor," the flyer said.
</P>
<P>
"Messrs Consumers," the flyer said, "we do not like your way of
life and it is not safe for you!"
</P>
<P>
In addition, authorities are also looking for "purely criminal
reasons" or simple hooliganism behind the blast, which happened
just several dozen meters from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement departments have stepped up security in the
capital and the search for the perpetuators of the blast will be
carried out in Moscow over the next two days.
</P>
<P>
Companies likely to be stocking explosives and other dangerous
substances will be checked. Venues will be thoroughly examined for
suspicious objects before large sporting, cultural and political
events.
</P>
<P>
Authorities will also instruct the public on what to do when
they spot suspicious objects in stores, the metro and on public
transport, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Pillar of China's National Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year
marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China. Over the past five decades, China's
achievements in all economic sectors have attracted worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency is to release about 20 stories about the
nation's economy. The first of the series was released on August
17. This is the twelfth.
</P>
<P>
A latest report from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture
indicates that China's rural businesses are expected to enjoy
higher growth this year than last year, with their total added
output value exceeding 2,500 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, the total added output
value of these businesses reached 1,406.2 billion yuan, up 16.7
percent over the same 1998 period, with profits and taxes rising
16.6 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, and especially since 1978, the rural
businesses have witnessed remarkable development and constituted
the main part of rural economy, representing almost half of the
nation's industrial sector and become a pillar of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics indicates that in 1998, the
rural businesses realised an added output value of 2,218 billion
yuan, accounting for 27.9 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, such businesses contributed one-fifth of the total
national tax revenues and 34.8 percent of the country's total
exports.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the rural businesses are the fast-growing part
of the economy as a whole, although they have experienced ups and
downs.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and 1960s, farmers began inviting some retired
engineers from cities to set up simple workshops, and by the end
of 1959, they had established more than 700,000 small workshops
and plants, employing some five million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of 1978 when China's reform and opening up
policies were introduced, thousands of agricultural workers, freed
from farming, have cast off the bondage of the planned-economy and
established market-oriented businesses.

<P>
From 1984 to 1988, such enterprises reached the first stage of
overall rapid development and their number exceeded 18 million,
employing 95.46 million people.
</P>
<P>
In the following three years, the fast growth trend of the
rural businesses slowed down partly as a result of over supply in
the market.
</P>
<P>
The second boom time for the rural businesses came in 1992 when
the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping stressed their importance
during his major tour of southern China.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the rural businesses grew in output value by
54.7 percent over the previous year with their total added output
value hitting 1,797.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
After 1995, such businesses entered a period of stable
development. Despite huge difficulties in both domestic and
overseas markets last year, the rural businesses still enjoyed a
17.3 percent rise in added output value over the previous year, 9.
5 percentage points higher than the nation's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the rural businesses, an imaginative creation
of Chinese farmers, have played a pivotal role in optimizing the
structure of the rural economy, supporting agricultural
development and increasing farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, the added output value of these businesses
only accounted for less than a quarter of the total production and
services output value in rural areas, but in 1987 it exceeded the
total rural agricultural output value, making up 52.4 percent of
the total rural production and services output value.

<P>
The booming rural businesses have also become a major source of
investment in agriculture, and last year, the collectively-owned
rural businesses alone provided 6.4 billion yuan for the
development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
With the rise of farming efficiency a considerable number of
surplus rural laborers were thrown onto the market, and the rural
businesses again became a major source of employment for them.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1998, China had more than 20 million
rural businesses employing near 130 million people, an increase of
3.4 times over the 1978 figure.
</P>
<P>
While the rural businesses provide more job opportunities for
rural surplus laborers, they also helped boost the rise of farmers
' income. In 1998, the annual per capita income of workers in such
businesses quadrupled that in 1978, standing at over 4,000 yuan,
and one-third of farmers' income come from these businesses.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the rural businesses has also boosted the
urbanization of rural areas. In 1998, the number of cities and
towns established with government approval surpassed 19,000,
accommodating 150 million rural residents.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people are paying increasing attention to the
development of the rural businesses, as their performance will
have a direct impact on the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that if such businesses grow in added output
value by 3 percentage points, the nation's GDP will rise by one
percentage point.

<HEADLINE> Peace to Prevail in Middle East: Israeli Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Peace will eventually prevail in
the Middle East region though the road to the peace is long, a top
Israeli official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arabs radio, Israeli
Deputy Foreign Minister Nawaf Mosalhah expressed hope that Arab
countries and Israel will reactivate peace talks in a bid to
realize just and durable peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Since his election in May, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has expressed readiness repeatedly to resume negotiations with
Syria. Damascus has responded positively.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' talks came to a halt in early 1996 over the
future of the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in
the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are holding intensive talks for a
timetable for Israeli troops pullback from part of the West Bank
and the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The two issues are major parts of the Wye Accord signed last
October, under which Israel should pull out its troops from
another 13 percent of the West Bank. Israel suspended the accord
in early December only after handing over 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mosalhah was appointed by Barak last month as deputy foreign
minister, the most senior post Arabs have ever taken in the
government of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Mosalhah contended that the implementation of the Wye accord
does not constitute a problem in the Palestinian-Israeli talks,
but the final status talks will mostly challenge the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks will tackle thorny issues including the
fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees and
the Palestinian statehood.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Russia Ink Accord on Free Isle Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan and Russia on Wednesday
agreed to allow former Japanese residents of disputed Russian-held
islands off Hokkaido to visit the islands freely.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a meeting between Japanese
Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura and Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Viktor Khristenko, who arrived here Tuesday for a four-
day visit.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers "reached a final accord and agreed to
exchange a verbal note Thursday" for free access to the disputed
islands of Etorofu, Shikotan, Kunashiri and the Habomai group of
islets, a Japanese government official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, former Japanese inhabitants, their spouses
and children will be able to visit the islands anytime they wish
using identification papers. They will not be required to hold
passports and to go through immigration procedures.
</P>
<P>
The disputed islands off Japan's northernmost Hokkaido were
seized by Soviet troops at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
The agreed free access is a step beyond the current visa-free
arrangement under which Tokyo and Moscow do not require visas for
Japanese and Russian visitors participating in government-arranged
exchange programs to and from the disputed islands.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi made the proposal for free
access during his trip to Moscow in last November.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Komura also reiterated that Japan has
decided to resume and soon disburse 1.1 billion dollars in untied
loans to Russia through the Export-Import Bank of Japan, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi announced his decision to resume the loans on Tuesday in
a meeting with Khristenko.
</P>
<P>
The loans are part of 1.5 billion dollars in untied Ex-Im Bank
credit Japan pledged in February last year to extend by the end of
1999 under a co-financing scheme with the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Rules out Meddling in Colombian Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said on Tuesday that his government would not meddle in the
conflict between Colombia's leftist guerrillas and the
paramilitary rightists.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said: "We have had various talks in various places with
Colombian President Andrez Pastrana about Colombia's internal
problems, but I will not interfere in this matter."
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president, who will attend the inauguration
ceremony of the Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso, said that he
is prepared to mediate between the two sides to help negotiate an
end to the Colombian civil war.
</P>
<P>
If the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) asked for
his help, he would have the right to talk with them in Venezuela,
said Chavez.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would not recommend measures like those taken
by the National Constitutional Assembly of Panama and other Latin
American countries.
</P>
<P>
Chavez stressed that every country has the right to search for
its own path, and Venezuela has found its own after suffering a
state of chaos.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president had said during his political campaign
that his government would amend the country's constitution.

<HEADLINE> HK Seeks Public Views on 2000 LegCo Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Affairs
Commission of Hong Kong announced Wednesday that it will launch a
public consultation program later this month to seek views on the
Legislative Council election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
On the basis on the public opinions, the commission will put
forward its final recommendations to the chief executive by the
end of October this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the Legislative Council (Amendment) Ordinance 1999, the
number of members to be returned for the geographical
constituencies has increased by four to 24 and each constituency
is to elect between four and six members.
</P>
<P>
The commission proposes that Hong Kong Island and New
Territories East constituencies will each have five seats, Kowloon
West and Kowloon East will each have four seats and New
Territories West six seats.
</P>
<P>
Woo Kwok-hing, chairman of the commission, said at a press
conference Wednesday that the commission must observe several
statutory criteria for making recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The population of each constituency is a primary consideration,
he said, and in addition, each constituency is to be formed by two
or more contiguous whole District Council constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The commission shall have regard to the existing boundaries of
districts, the existing boundaries of the Municipal Council areas,
community identities, the preservation of local ties and physical
features of the relevant areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the government forecast, Hong Kong will have a
population of 6,736,900 by the end of March 2000. It follows that
each of the 24 seats will cater for 280,704 people.
</P>
<P>
The commission has drawn up a provisional recommendation that
delineation and names of the existing five geographical
constituencies may remain the same in the 2000 Legislative Council
election, except minor adjustments to the boundaries of four
constituencies in Kowloon and the New Territories as a result of
district developments.
</P>
<P>
Woo said, "We consider it proper to maintain the existing
boundaries and names because electors have got used to them."
</P>
<P>
"Our recommendations are drawn up with an objective and fair
method and fully meet all the statutory criteria. Political
influence or advantage plays no part at all in our decisions," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The commission will meet the public at a public forum on
September 27 to listen to their views.

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Ballot Vote Count Starts on Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) is scheduled to begin its vote count on Friday after it
completes its reconciliation count on Thursday, UNAMET deputy
chief Carlos Valenzuella said in Dili, capital of East Timor,
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reconciliation count, which aims to cross-check the number
of ballots from the ballot boxes against the number of ballots
issued by the UNAMET, began on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reconciliation count will be concluded in two days,
Valenzuella was quoted by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
After the reconciliation count, he said, all the ballot papers
will be mixed together so that it would be impossible to detect
which vote dominated which district.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sensitive period, thus we urge various parties,
particularly the Indonesian Police, to secure it," Valenzuella
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara, the reconciliation count is being
witnessed by independent domestic and foreign observers,
representatives of the Indonesian and Portuguese governments and
UNAMET officials.
</P>
<P>
He further said representatives of East Timor's warring
pro-autonomy and pro-independence factions did not show up at the
count.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that representatives of Indonesia and
Portugal came," he added.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET spokesman Ueki Yoshiro meanwhile said some 45 military
liaison officers arrived in Dili from Darwin, Australia, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 45 officers, consisting of 27 Australians and 18
Pakistanis, will join the present 50 military liaison officers.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET has reduced the number of its voluntary staff
members gradually, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 57 U.N. volunteers left for Darwin on Tuesday while 118
others are scheduled to leave on Wednesday and 135 more on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET is maintaining 100 personnel to help in the vote
count, Yoshiro was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 450,000 East Timorese cast their votes in the August 30
U.N.-sponsored ballot that will decide the political future of
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The ballot was to determine whether East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony, will enjoy wide-ranging autonomy within
Indonesia or get independence. East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move was never recognized by the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> New Gas Find Confirmed in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Energy confirmed Wednesday earlier reports on the discovery of new
gas deposits in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
As a support for Philippine President Joseph Estrada's earlier
disclosure of the event, Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui said the
gas find in Maguindanao, Mindanao, is of good quality and is
expected to provide ample supply to the local market.
</P>
<P>
He said the gas find was made by the Philippine National Oil
Company (PNOC) Exploration Division which drilled about 1,500 feet
(about 500 meters) where an ample deposit of 95 percent methane
gas was discovered, Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Methane gas is a common household name because it is used for
cooking and other industrial uses.
</P>
<P>
According to Tiaoqui, the gas find is estimated to have a flow
rate of more than 200,000 cubic feet per day.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Clashes occurred near a U.N.
compound in Dili, capital of East Timor, on Wednesday afternoon,
killing at least one person, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place after hundreds of pro-integration
militia followers attended the funeral of a pro-integration member
killed on Sunday by pro-independence supporters in Dili.
</P>
<P>
CNN reported that around 200 people had taken refuge inside the
U.N. Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) compound after militiamen
fought a running battle with an unidentified group.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that tension returned to East Timor on Tuesday,
one day after a peaceful vote on the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
A group of people armed with homemade guns were seen stopping
motorists heading to the western outskirts of Dili on Tuesday. A
similar scene was reported in Manatuto, some 60 kilometers east of
Dili.
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot on August 30 was to determine whether East
Timor, a former Portuguese colony, will enjoy wide-ranging
autonomy within Indonesia or get independence. East Timor was
integrated into Indonesia in 1976, but the move was never
recognized by the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, French FMs Discuss Mideast Peace on Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa has held a telephone conversation with his French
counterpart Hubert Vedrine on the Mideast peace process as part of
the continued consultations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Al-Akhbar daily reported Wednesday that Moussa called
Vedrine Tuesday night to brief him on the latest developments
in the peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moussa updated Vedrine with fresh efforts aimed at pushing the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks forward, especially the ongoing
negotiations for an agreement on the implementation of the Wye
Accord signed last October, the pro-government newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The conversation came after a visit to Egypt by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in the
Mediterranean port city of Alexandria Tuesday and the two leaders
discussed the Palestinian-Israeli talks before the Mideast tour of
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright starting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are trying to set a
timetable for the last two of the three-phased Israeli troops
withdrawal from another 11 percent of the West Bank and reach an
agreement on the release of hundreds of Palestinian political
prisoners held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's phone call fell within the context of the continued
coordination between Egypt and France on all issues of mutual
interests, foremost the Middle East peace process, an Egyptian
Foreign Ministry source said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, is an active mediator between Arab countries and
Israel. France, which maintains close political relations with
Egypt, wants to play a key role in the Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language newspaper said the two ministers agreed to
meet in September for more coordination in New York on the
sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine is scheduled to visit Egypt in autumn as part of a
multi-leg tour of the Middle East, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Go On Cracking Down on Armed Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that his government will continue to go
hard on armed groups bent on challenging its authority and the
law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a weekly radio program, Estrada said the heavy
casualties sustained by extremists who kidnapped a four-year-old
girl in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao were proof of
this resolve.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated the warning he issued in late July in
his State of the Nation Address against armed groups that there
would be punishment for rebellion.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 extremists were reportedly killed in a recent
military offensive against the extremists' stronghold in the
outskirts of Basilan, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government operations resulted in the release of
four-year-old Wilmarie Furlgay, granddaughter of a former mayor of
Lamitan.
</P>
<P>
Wilmarie was kidnapped on August 11 in front of her parents'
store in downtown Lamitan. Her abductors initially demanded 3
million pesos (75,000 U.S. Dollars) and 100 head of cattle as
ransom.
</P>
<P>
The president has repeatedly stressed that while his
administration is open to peace talks with rebel groups, it will
not tolerate their criminal acts or violation of the constitution
and the law.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Call for New Development Strategy for Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The development strategy for
northwest China should focus on promoting the overall development
of science, technology, information and education rather than
merely pursuing economic growth, a leading group of Chinese
scientists have declared.
</P>
<P>
In a special report which was released here today, members of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China's top scientific
research organization, proposed a new strategy for the
northwestern region.
</P>
<P>
The scientists share the opinion that the major gaps between
the northwestern and eastern region of China lie in scientific
knowledge, information, education and technology.
</P>
<P>
"And these gaps cannot be narrowed by simply increasing capital
investment and exploring natural resources only," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The consultation report proposes giving priority to narrowing
that particular gaps between the northwestern region and the
developed coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin pointed out recently that
accelerating the development in northwest China requires new
thoughts, and that changes in the domestic and international
markets should be taken into full consideration.
</P>
<P>
The scientists suggested that the development of education, the
reform of scientific and technological systems and the
construction of communication facilities should be at the top of
the agenda in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
They also offered advice on issues covering health care,
population, employment, poverty reduction and water resources
utilization along with environmental and ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of CAS academicians to offer advice
on China's major economic and social problems," said Sun Honglie,
a CAS academician, adding that the consultation report will be
submitted to the State Council and related governmental
departments.

<HEADLINE> Japan Holds Drills to Mark Disaster Prevention Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Japan's central and local
governments held drills Wednesday to mark Disaster Prevention Day
in a bid to prepare people for the possible occurrence of a major
earthquake, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5.7 million people, including firefighters and
medical personnel as well as those in charge of public utilities
such as electricity and gas, took part in the drills, which
focused on information communication and guiding evacuees, Kyodo
said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese central government conducted its drills in Fuji,
Shizuoka Prefecture, and in Tokyo, drawing on scenarios based on
an earthquake hitting the Tokai region and on a direct hit in the
Kanto area.
</P>
<P>
Many of the drills held this year placed emphasis on securing
communication links by such means as teleconference systems
receiving pictures from earthquake response centers and
helicopters using satellites.
</P>
<P>
The drills also incorporated practical exercises such as
dispatching medical teams to the theoretical disaster site.
</P>
<P>
The drills in Tokyo began in the afternoon with an alert that a
quake measuring 7.2 on the open-ended Richter scale had just
struck central Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Boarding a helicopter in front of the Imperial Palace, Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi proceeded to the drill area to take
command of crisis management efforts.
</P>
<P>
Envisioning transport disruptions, some 550 participants were
asked to walk seven kilometers from the Yurakucho district to the
drill site while the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) warships were sent
to ferry stranded commuters to their homes via Tokyo Bay.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Hyogo Prefecture, southwestern Japan, where 6,400
people died in the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake, about 62,000
people participated in drills which hypothesized an earthquake
registering an upper 6 on the 7-point Japanese seismic scale
centering on Himeji.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Disaster Prevention Day commemorates the Great Kanto
Earthquake, which struck the Kanto area, centering on Tokyo, on
September 1, 1923. The powerful quake measuring 7.9 on the Ritcher
scale killed 140,000 people and injured 100,000 others.

TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi left here Wednesday morning for a two-day visit to
Finland, which now holds the rotating presidency of the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Local media said Iran's relations with Finland and the EU will
be high on the agenda of Kharrazi's talks with his Finnish
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The visit is seen here as part of Iran's effort to woo
European countries. Tehran has normalized relations with EU
members states, which were disrupted by Iran's condemnation of
British writer Salmon Rushdie for his book, The Satanic Verses.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi and Finish officials will discuss issues of mutual
interest as well as key regional and international developments,
according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iran hopes to expand and consolidate ties with Finland and the
EU in political, economic and cultural fields, and follow up
signed agreements on mutual cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Children's Situation Worrying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Forty percent of Zambian
children are chronically malnourished resulting in excessive
intellectual damage, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
has said.
</P>
<P>
The situation of Zambian children and youths was threatened as
never before, Zambian UNICEF representative Peter Mcdermott told a
consultative meeting of co-operating partners here.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality is estimated at 112 among every 1,000 children
in the country, Mcdermott was quoted by Wednesday's Zambian
newspaper, the Post, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Most children in Zambia never reach their sixth birthday. The
government, in fact, estimates that about 50,000 children are born
with HIV/ AIDS each year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mcdermott said over 600,000 children managing to reach the age
of five in a healthy state have never attended the primary school,
while for thousands more the quality of education is such that
learning is limited.
</P>
<P>
Those who survive these perils would still live to face the
vice of sexual abuse, forced or exploitative labor, a life in
conflict with the law spent on the streets and the reality of
abandoned children who often grow into disaffected homeless
youths, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of thousands of others are brought up in households
of chronic sickness and death doing untold psychological damage
to the young child," he added.

<HEADLINE> Consultative Commission Set Up in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) Wednesday announced the establishment of a Consultative
Commission for East Timor Reconciliation in Dili, capital of East
Timor, the Antara News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The consultative commission is formally established, although
there are some problems that have halted the announcement of its
membership," deputy spokesman for UNAMET Ueki Yoshiro said.
</P>
<P>
The commission, whose establishment was proposed by U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, has 25 members, including 10
representatives of the pro-integration camp, 10 of the
pro-independence camp and five appointed by the U.N. secretary
general.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting on the establishment of the commission was
held on Tuesday and attended by six members of the
pro-independence group and some pro-integrationists who were
nominated as members of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four supporters of integration said they would
resign from the commission if the UNAMET can not clarify
allegations of impropriety during the direct ballot on August 30.
</P>
<P>
East Timorese Pro-Integration Joint Front spokesman Basilio
Dias Araujo has said his organization recorded at least 37
violations during the ballot.
</P>
<P>
He charged that most of the violations were committed by UNAMET
personnel, who he said compelled voters to choose independence
over autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiro said he did not yet receive the statement of the four
members and UNAMET chief Ian Martin asserted that no members of
the commission will resign.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNAMET, 98.6 percent of the registered voters
in East Timor took part in the direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
The ballot was to determine whether East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony, will enjoy wide-ranging autonomy within
Indonesia or get independence. East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move was never recognized by the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Tomato Ban Might Squash Deals with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Agriculture Ministry
has warned that if local tomato farmers insist on banning the
import of Jordanian tomatoes, Lebanon's export deals with Jordan
will be also canceled.
</P>
<P>
Fakhr Dakroub, a senior official at the ministry, said that
banning Jordanian tomatoes would be a blow to Lebanon, the Daily
Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"How can the farmers ask us to ban the import of tomatoes while
Lebanon sells large quantities of apple and potato to Jordan,"
Dakroub added.
</P>
<P>
According to existing agreements, Lebanon exports potatoes and
apples to Jordan and imports a variety of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from southern Lebanon has met Agriculture Minister
Suleiman Franjieh to ask him to protect Lebanese agricultural
produce.
</P>
<P>
The farmers claim that importing tomatoes to Lebanon does not
make sense because the country is sitting on a surplus of domestic
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
"We produce 300,000 tons of tomatoes each year, half of which
are dumped or sold at very cheap prices," said Waddah Fakhri, head
of the Southern Farmers Association.
</P>
<P>
According to Fakhri, many local farmers are selling 25
kilograms of tomatoes for just 5,000 Lebanese pounds (about 3.33
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Jordan export wheat, fertilizers and other
products that are not available in Lebanon, a demand which has
been rejected by Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Lebanese government to subsidize the cost
of fruit and vegetables grown by Lebanese farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Other countries do this and it would only cost the government
about 50 million dollars a year," Fakhri added.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urge Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- All the debt owed by Africa to
the donor community should be scrapped, a high-level seminar on
Africa's debt urged in a statement.
</P>
<P>
President of Botswana Festus Mogae, also chairman of the
two-day seminar, said Tuesday that African governments were ready
to accept conditions for the debt reprieve but noted that the
conditions should be discussed and agreed on by parties affected
instead of only the donor countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times daily Wednesday quoted Mogae as saying that
African governments must fulfil the conditions given by the donors
and creditor countries if they expect to benefit from the
anticipated debt relief.
</P>
<P>
"African countries must undertake the fundamental changes that
will make further assistance available," he said.
</P>
<P>
These changes include trade liberalization, civil service
restructuring, a working judiciary, democratization, respect for
human rights and improved infrastructure, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Africa faces a total debt of 285 billion U.S. dollars,
representing more than 200 percent of Africa's exports, according
to World Bank statistics.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Speaker Calls for Coexistence in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Speaker Humayun
Rasheed Chowdhury on Wednesday called for "tremendous efforts" to
consolidate peaceful coexistence in Asia and challenge the threats
to peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The speaker made the call here at the inaugural session of the
four-day "Asian Parliamentarians' Conference for Peace and
Cooperation," which was initiated by Bangladesh early this year to
identify the role of parliamentarians in creating and promoting an
atmosphere of peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We need peace to build up justice for the vast masses of
citizens throughout the world who live their lives in poverty...
The only battle we should be fighting is the battle for the
dignity of our people and for development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentarians, as "the formal, legal and institutional
representatives of the people," have the capacity and the duty of
voicing the opinions of the peoples they represent, said the
speaker.
</P>
<P>
"We will all be responsible for taking the decisions and we
should always consider those who will bear the burden of our wrong
decisions, and who will need to endure more in the absence of
peace," Chowdhury pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, he said, "we must make tremendous efforts to
consolidate our peaceful coexistence and to challenge the threats
to peace that are present in our continent." "We need to prevent,
resolve and transform violent conflict that... causes suffering to
our peoples."
</P>
<P>
"We want to intensify our efforts for the cause of peace... We
need to know better what are the deep causes of war to enroot the
culture of peace... We want to renew our commitments to
disarmament and human security. And we want to strengthen the
rights of our peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the conference, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina said, "We assembled here today to see our continent emerge
in the 21st century as the continent that will have its presence
felt and its voice heard all over the world."
</P>
<P>
"Peace is an all-embracing state, a state in which the woes
that afflict human life would be banished once and for all. Peace
is the state that guarantees economic and social emancipation and
generates friendship between all," she said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said there are differences on some issues
between countries, "but we are here to make a collective and
concerted effort for peace," not to highlight the differences.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Chinese delegation Zeng Jianhui, member of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of
China and chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee, delivered
a speech on behalf of all the parliamentary delegations attending
the conference.
</P>
<P>
Former Indian Prime Minister I.K. Gujral, Pakistani Speaker
Illahi Bukhsh Soomro and representative of the U.N. Development
Program in Bangladesh David E. Lockwood also spoke at the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 33 Asian countries, including Bangladesh,
China, Indonesia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, South
Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, are participating in the conference
funded by the Bangladeshi government and the U.N. Development
Program.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Improve Power Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Power and Lighting
Company (KPLC) has taken new measures to sustain adequate
electricity generation capacity to its 480,000 customers in the
country following the liberalization of the power sector.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued Tuesday by KPLC said that to improve
power supply, the company had entered into power purchase
agreements with various power-generating companies including the
independent power producers, the government-run Kenya Times
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of the sector will help alleviate power
shortage by encouraging private investors to take up the
challenge of generating  enough power to meet local needs, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, Kenya Electricity Generating Company
(KenGen) will build power projects with a total capacity of 254
megawatts, and one of its projects, the Sondu Miriu hydropower
station with a capacity of 60 megawatts in Nyanza Province in
southwestern Kenya, is now under construction, the KPLC said.
</P>
<P>
Completing with KenGen in the liberalized power supply sector
are also two independent power producers including the Tsavo
Power Company in Coast Province in eastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
KPLC said by 2002, Kenya would envisage 503 megawatts of
additional electricity capacity to be commissioned under the
committed projects.
</P>
<P>
According to KPLC, the country's current peak demand stands at
760 megawatts as against available capacity of 676.5 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Just a week ago, KPLC announced to start power rationing
nationwide from September 1 following the low water level in the
country's three main energy reservoirs as a result of the dry
spell during the long rains season between March and June.

<HEADLINE> International Meeting of Prosecutors Scheduled for Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Association
of Prosecutors (IAP) will hold its 4th annual meeting from
September 5 to 10 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 prosecutors, 51 of them attorney generals and 24
deputy attorney generals, from 81 countries, regions and
international organizations are expected to attend, according to
Zhang Qiong, a deputy procurator-general and chairman of the
Chinese organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The participants will discuss investigating and prosecuting
cases of fraud and corruption and professional ethics and
responsibilities, Zhang told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The IAP was founded in June 1995 in Vienna. The Chinese
Association of Prosecutors was one of the founders. It now has 58
member organizations and more than 600 individual members. Its
purpose is to promote prosecutorial rights, supervise criminal
proceedings, and increase cooperation among prosecutors and legal
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The association has played an active role in promoting
cooperation among prosecutors and curbing domestic violence and
international and organized crimes, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Puts Zero Tariff Loss at 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Loss of revenue as a result of
implementation of zero tariff in the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) region is estimated at an average of two
percent.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the COMESA Rules of Origin Workshop here
Tuesday, Secretary General Erastus Mwencha said the regional body
is currently undertaking studies to determine the actual loss of
each member when the zero tariff is implemented next year.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope to explore ways of addressing the expected
losses. For example, the loss can be compensated through increased
trade and improved efficiency in revenue collection as well as
diversification of revenue sources," he was quoted by Wednesday's
Zambian newspaper, the Post, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the timing or speed at which COMESA is moving toward
a free trade area, Mwencha said the tariff reduction program began
in 1984 and it was originally intended that by 1992 the free trade
area would have been established.
</P>
<P>
"However, member states requested for an extension up to the
year 2000, giving a total of 16 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said given the globalization process, other trade regimes
provided for less than ten years transition period to a free trade
area and the on- going debate should concentrate on the benefits
of free trade area.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for market integration is to create a large market
that will attract investment and enable the region to utilize the
local resources and to integrate into the global economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said a free trade area would also lead to increased
competitiveness of the local industry and consumers would stand to
benefit in terms of price and quality of products.
</P>
<P>
He explained that representatives of the private sector from
each COMESA country have been invited to the workshop as the rules
of origin will have a direct impact on intra-regional trade.

<HEADLINE> Post Should Focus on Customer Value: Anderson Consulting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua)-- The advance of information
technology will greatly broaden the borders of traditional postal
services instead of squeezing them out of the market, says an
international expert on posts and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Brennan, a partner in the Anderson consulting of
the United States, said in a recent Xinhua interview that postal
services have many crucial resources that are invaluable in these
times of information technology.
</P>
<P>
Brennan, who was attending the 22nd Universal Postal Congress (
UPC) being held here from August 23 to September 15, spoke at the
general debate of the congress.
</P>
<P>
He said that almost everyone is a customer of post offices
which have the most extensive home delivery network in the world.
The reliability that the post has makes it the ideal trusted third
party for doing business on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to Anderson Consulting estimates, the value of on-
line shopping will grow to 180 billion U.S. dollars worldwide by
2003.
</P>
<P>
Although some traditional postal services are disappearing in
the face of the competition from electronic communications, new
value-added services as call centers, on-line shopping, supply
chain management and postal finances will enable the postal
services to survive and compete, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Postal administrations should shift from thinking merely of
mail to thinking about all the other things they can do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Post offices in some North American and European countries have
already started transforming their services. For example, the
Dutch post office has bought its way into the logistic industry by
acquiring TNT, a major international transport company; and the
Canadian post has offered electronic bill payment services to all
residents in the country.
</P>
<P>
Brennan said that for developing countries, the majority of the
members of the Universal Postal Union (UPU), the priority for
postal development should be coordinating their resources in a bid
to achieve the highest possible efficiency.

<P>
GENEVA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Mike Moore of New Zealand
officially took office as the new Director-General of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He and Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand were chosen as the WTO
's next two consecutive leaders by the ruling General Council on
July 22.
</P>
<P>
Moore will head the WTO until August 31, 2002 when he will be
replaced by Supachai who will also serve a three-year term of
office until August 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
At the decision-making meeting on July 22, WTO members agreed
that neither should be eligible for reappointment as WTO director-
general, nor should his period of office be extended.
</P>
<P>
Normally, the term of office of the WTO chief is four years as
the former WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero has served.
</P>
<P>
The decision was a compromise based on proposals by Bangladesh
and Australia after a year-long dispute among WTO members on who
would succeed Ruggiero. Ruggiero left office as scheduled on April
30, 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen left here Wednesday for his three-nation trip to Canada,
Cuba and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure at the airport, Hun Sen told reporters that
he has many things to talk with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
during his stay in New York. He mentioned the issue of the
establishment of a Khmer Rouge tribunal with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. legal team, which is also leaving here Wednesday, held
two rounds of meetings with its Cambodian counterpart chaired by
Sok An, senior minister and minister of the Council of Ministers,
on the setting up of a mixed Khmer Rouge tribunal, but failed to
reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have wide divergence on the nature, structure and
composition of the tribunal, according to the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Om Yentieng, a top political affairs advisor to Prime Minister
Hun Sen, told reporters that the Cambodian government will not
change its positions on the Khmer Rouge tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen will lead a delegation of the royal government of
Cambodia to attend the Eighth Summit of the heads of state and
government of Francophone countries to be held in Canada from
September 3 to 5 at the invitation of his Canadian counterpart,
Jean Chretien.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Lowers Prices of Gasoline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has announced to lower
gasoline prices by 200 Lebanese pounds (about 0.13 U.S. dollars)
per 20 liters, the first drop following three hikes since April.
</P>
<P>
In response to a fall in the international oil price, Lebanese
Oil Minister Suleiman Traboulsi Tuesday decreed that a 20-liter
tank of 92 octane gasoline, the lowest grade available at the
pump station, would cost 12,700 pounds (about 8.46 dollars), while
a tank of 98 octane gasoline would be priced at 13,000 pounds
(about 8.66 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The price of every 20 liters of undeaded gasoline is also
lowered to 13,000 pounds (about 8.66 dollars), but keeping
kerosene at 6,600 pounds (about 4.4 dollars) and increasing the
cost of fuel oil by 100 pounds (about 0.06 dollars) to 6,100
pounds (about 4.06 dollars), the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The head of the country's Association of Gas Station Owners,
Sami Brax, welcomed the move, saying "it would enhance sales,
although to a limited extent."
</P>
<P>
"The gas stations that stored large amounts of gasoline in
anticipation of another increase will lose, but not much," he told
the paper.
</P>
<P>
Last month, gasoline prices were initially raised by 400 pounds
(about 0.26 dollars) and then additional 300 pounds (about 0.2
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In April, the cabinet raised gasoline taxes by 2,000 pounds
(about 1.33 dollars) per 20 liters to bolster the government's
coffers.
</P>
<P>
Traboulsi said the previous hikes were necessary to offset
increases in international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
But, his decisions sparked criticism from taxi drivers, who
have demanded official permission to use diesel to lower costs and
combat competition from mini-buses and vans that have been
licensed in recent years.

KAMPALA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's former mayor of the
capital city Kampala, who is now in a jail in the United States,
would be freed later in September.
</P>
<P>
Nasser Sebaggala, who was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment

lying to the United States, would be released on September 23,
Tuesday's New Vision daily reported.

<P>
Sebaggala was arrested in June of 1998 and convicted later in
Boston, the United States. His conviction and sentence deprived
him of the mayorship automatically according to the Ugandan laws.
</P>
<P>
Though being accused of being short of an A level certificate
required by the top post in the capital city, Sebaggala enjoyed
massive support among the common people. His misfortune was widely
believed to have been the result of some plot.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A four-day conference of Asian
legislators started here Wednesday morning to identify the role of
parliamentarians in creating and promoting an atmosphere of peace
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Law-makers from 33 Asian countries are here to attend the
"Asian Parliamentarians' Conference for Peace and Cooperation,"
initiated by Bangladesh early this year.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three countries have been invited, and representatives

<HEADLINE> Chinese MP Emphasizes Peace, Development and Cooperation at Asian Parliamentarians' Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- It is still the common
aspiration of the world people and the mainstream of the times to
seek peace, development and cooperation at the time of entering a
new century and a new millennium, a senior Chinese official told a
four-day conference of Asian legislators started here Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Law-makers from 33 Asian countries are here to attend the
"Asian Parliamentarians' Conference for Peace and Cooperation"
initiated by Bangladesh early this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony on behalf of all the
parliamentary delegations attending the conference, Head of the
Chinese Delegation Zeng Jianhui said the meeting "will promote
mutual understanding and cooperation among parliamentarians and
peoples of various countries and will contribute to regional peace
and development."
</P>
<P>
"Looking back into the 20th century, human society has created
unprecedented material wealth and cultural civilization but also
suffered from two disastrous world wars. The Cold War has been
over, but the issue of peace and development have not been
resolved," said Zeng, who is also chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee of China's National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Asia takes up over half of the world population. Its stability
and prosperity is a great contribution to world peace and
development," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hegemonism and power politics have registered new development,
"neo-interventionism" is on the rise while trampling on the norms
of international relations, infringement upon other countries'
sovereignty and interference in the internal affairs of others can
be seen from time to time, the Chinese official observed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on economic globalization, he said that though
globalization may promote economic growth, "we must not neglect
the fact that the economic globalization process dominated by the
developed countries has intensified unfair international
competitions and brought enormous financial and economic risks to
the developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Reality proves that, it is an urgent task for all peace-loving
countries and peoples to uphold the internationally-acknowledged
norms particularly the principles of mutual respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and
mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, and to safeguard the
authority of the United Nations and its role that can not be
replaced, and to promote the establishment of a peaceful and
stable, just and reasonable new international political and
economic order," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"As parliamentarians, we have the responsibility to reflect the
voices of the people and pursue peace and happiness for the
people. We should have the courage to shoulder the duty assigned
to us by history and the people, unite together with one will and
join hands in exploring effective ways and means to maintain peace
and stability in Asia and the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Participating the conference are 105 members of parliament of
33 Asian countries and 38 members of civil societies of these
countries, including Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam.
The conference is being funded by the Bangladeshi government and
the United Nations Development Program.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- It's a hat trick for Houston
Comets coach Van Chancellor, although he barely edged Sacramento's
Sonny Allen by one vote for the WNBA Coach of the Year Honors for
the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor received 18 out of a possible 51 votes from a panel
of sportswriters and broadcasters. Allen finished with 17 votes,
followed by Los Angeles' Orlando Woolridge with 11.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor guided the Comets to a 26-6 record, the best in the
league for the third straight year. They owned the league's best
home and road records at 15-1 and 11-5, respectively, holding
their opponents to a league-low 64.7 points.
</P>
<P>
The Comets will meet the New York Liberty in the WNBA Finals,
beginning Thursday in New York.
</P>
<P>
New York's Richie Adubato received one vote for Coach of the

<HEADLINE> TB, HIV Threatens More than Health in S. Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- The deadly duo of tuberculosis
(TB) and Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are threatening not
only health of the South Asians but also their economic
development and social integrity, The Rising Nepal quoted experts
as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending The Status and Trends of HIV/AIDS and TB in
SAARC Member Countries here Tuesday concurred that the HIV and TB
infections were already large and there was possibility of further
rise in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Together they present a huge financial and social burden to
our member countries," the experts cautioned.
</P>
<P>
With three million TB deaths annually, World Health
Organization (WHO) has already declared TB as global emergency.
</P>
<P>
However, the burden of this disease in the South Asia is more
prevalent than in any other regions. Statistics reveal that 40
percent of the global burden of TB is concentrated in the region
while one third of annual global deaths from TB occur in this
region alone.
</P>
<P>
The health threat posed by HIV is equally high and equally
dangerous. By the end of 1998, the United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS and WHO estimated that the number of people living with
HIV will have swollen up to 33.4 million globally, which is 10
percent higher than just a year ago.
</P>
<P>
More than 95 percent of the people with HIV live in the
developing countries and 95 percent of deaths caused by the
infection occurred in these countries.
</P>
<P>
In order to mitigate the effect of the deadly duo, Deputy
Director of SAARC TB Center Dr. Kumar suggested that a dual
strategy be formulated to fight the dual epidemic. He further
suggested that mobilizing communities, unifying national and
international efforts and formulating regional strategy and
national specific action plans for the South Asian countries would
help prevent and control TB and HIV infections.

MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines posted an
employment increase of 4.3 percent to 29.1 million persons in July
1999 from 27.9 million a year earlier, an official statement said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The employment increase almost matches the nation's increased
labor force in July this year, which amounted to 1.12 million
persons, according to the statement released by the National
Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
Of the newly-increased employment, the agriculture sector
registered 800,000 persons, 6.8 percent up from July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Employment in services recorded an increase of 434,000, or 3.5
percent up, while the industrial sector slightly increased by
13,000, or 0.3 percent up from July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The total number of Filipinos aged 15 years old and over
reached 48.3 million in July, of which 31.7 million joined the
labor force in the month, up 3.7 percent from July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Those who were not in the labor force, like housewives,
students, disabled and retired persons, increased by 98,000 to
16.6 million in July 1999 from 16.5 million a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Promises to Help California Fight Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Agriculture Secretary
Dan Glickman assured California firefighters "they will have the
resources they need" as he toured the worst-burned area in the
state Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is not a budget cap on firefighting," said Glickman. "
When it comes to natural disasters, the government does respond,
and Congress does respond, the president does respond."
</P>
<P>
Fires across California have scorched more than 130,000 acres,
exhausted the state's firefighting resources and forced
evacuations of residents, hikers, campers and vacationers in some
of the most severe areas.
</P>
<P>
The worst fire in U.S. West has been one near Lake Arrowhead in
the Apple Valley, 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Los Angeles,
that has scorched nearly 50,000 acres of brush and pine forest.
</P>
<P>
"This is the No. 1 priority fire -- given the size and location
of it," said Glickman who visited the site in responses to state
pleas for disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
California Governor Gray Davis Friday asked President Clinton
to declare a federal emergency for four counties in the state. A
federal emergency would allow California to receive more
assistance from federal agencies, including the Defense Department
and U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
California is not the only state fighting uncontrolled blazes.
Flames are raging in Idaho, Montana and Utah Tuesday.

<P>
SNOW DRAGON SHIP, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The 56-day North Pole
expedition, China's first government-sponsored Arctic expedition,
has laid a sound foundation for further polar research, said the
chief scientist aboard the homeward-bound expedition ship Snow
Dragon today.
</P>
<P>
Chief Scientist Chen Liqi told Xinhua that the expedition
achieved reliable and valuable research data, laying a sound
foundation for future research.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese scientists will offer a large amount of first-hand
data and many new scientific views to international polar
researchers," said Chen, who has been to the South Pole and North
Pole many times.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also director of the Polar Research Office under the
State Oceanic Administration, said that the expedition has greatly
improved the Chinese scientists' ability to conduct research in
the polar region and will promote this endeavor in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
"I hope some of the young scientists who took part in the
expedition can become leading world scientists in the coming
decades," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Huangpu River to Become Tourist Attraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
city, has unveiled a massive program to turn its Huangpu River
into a tourist attraction comparable to Hong Kong's Victoria
Harbor and Australia's Sydney Harbor in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
An official with the local municipal government said that all
coal, chemical, and bulk cargo docks in the downtown area will be
moved to a new port area on the outskirts of Shanghai, and tourist,
recreational, and commercial facilities will be built instead
along the river.
</P>
<P>
Among the major projects is a 10,000-sq-m recreational center
in the southern part of the Bund along Shanghai's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
The Huangpu River, which flows into the Yangtze River, has been
a transportation channel for more than 100 years. But in recent
years, the amount of cargo handled by the city's wharves in the
urban area has been declining and has had a negative effect on the
urban environment.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the municipality has built a series of
scenic spots along the river, including the Orient Pearl TV Tower
and the picturesque Binjiang Avenue, while giving a facelift to
the famous Bund.
</P>
<P>
This autumn, a dragon boat competition, the first of its kind
in Shanghai, will be held on the river as part of the city's
effort to promote tourism.
</P>
<P>
These plans have drawn an increasing number of overseas
investors, and dozens have shown their keen interest in investing
in the city.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows BJP Alliance Set to Win in Indian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies are poised to gain
an absolute overall majority in the 13th Lok Sabha (lower house)
elections in India.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted earlier this month in 76 Lok Sabha
constituencies in 15 states, the Hindustan Times said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, commissioned by the Hindustan Times, was conducted
by ACNielsen, formerly known as MRAS and the world's largest
market research company.
</P>
<P>
The findings are based on interviews with 13,959 voters between
August 14-23.
</P>
<P>
While giving a total of 300 seats to the BJP-led alliance,
called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the survey
forecasts a combined tally of 146 for the Congress party and its
regional partners, 20 seats less compared to the 1998 results.
</P>
<P>
Of the 300 seats for the NDA, the BJP is expected to get 190
seats. The Congress itself is likely to win only 123 seats.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Chinese President's Visit to Further Boost Ties With Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard said Chinese President Jiang Zemin's forthcoming
state visit to Australia will significantly advance bilateral ties
in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Howard described the visit as "a very very significant event"
and "a huge boost to the relationship between Australia and China.
"
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward very much to welcoming President Jiang
Zemin," he said, adding that Jiang's visit, the first ever by a
Chinese head of state, will be an opportunity for them to discuss
important bilateral and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Howard predicted that the visit will be "very successful."
</P>
<P>
Describing the bilateral relations as "very sound and strong,"
Howard said that since his summit meeting with Jiang in Beijing in
1997, exchanges of visit of ministers between the two countries
have been conducted and a very good dialog on defense and regional
issues has been developed.
</P>
<P>
While Australian companies are very active investors in China
in resources, manufacture and services, China is a valued investor
in Australia, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries reached 10 billion Australian
dollars (6.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On Australia's China policy, Howard said there are a number of
reasons that Australia gives one of its foreign policy priorities
to China.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997 White Paper on Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia
identified China as one of the four countries which Australia has
key relations with.
</P>
<P>
China is a big and influential country by any measurement, he
said, and it is important for a country like Australia, which is a
medium power, to develop relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"And of course, there are big areas of cooperation," he said,
adding that the two countries should "maximize the areas of mutual
interest."
</P>
<P>
"China is a very big and very influential country and all the
nations in the region can build constructive relations with China,
and then China can contribute a great deal to the whole region, to
the stability and wealth of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who called for an engagement China policy of the
Clinton administration during his U.S. trip last July, said he
believed that the word "containment" is an "old expression" and "
engagement looks to the future."
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Howard also reaffirmed Australia's "One China
" policy and its support for China's membership in the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He said his country has been supporting "One China" policy for
a long time and will stick to it.
</P>
<P>
As for China's WTO membership, Howard said, "We want to see
China in the World Trade Organization. We have already reached an
understanding with China."
</P>
<P>
"If China becomes a member of the World Trade Organization,
that will obviously improve trade between our two countries," he
said. "But that's not just bilateral benefit. It's a very big
group benefit in China being part of the World Trade Organization.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Board of
Investment (BOI) Tuesday signed an agreement worth 1.2 billion
rupees (17 million U.S. dollars) with Japan's Mitsui Mining Co.
for two major expansion projects, official sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company will invest in a new production line to expand the

<HEADLINE> Clark: Work in Balkans Not Over Despite Progress in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Wesley Clark, supreme
European allied commander of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), said Tuesday that violence against the Serbs
in Kosovo is going down, but the work in the Balkans is not over.
</P>
<P>
"The instance of violence has gone down dramatically over the
last couple of weeks," he said in a speech at the American
Enterprise Institute on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians started an ethnic cleansing campaign
against the Serbs in the Yugoslav province after Serb forces
withdrew and NATO troops controlled the province. Thousands of
Serbs fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has protested against the uncompliance by the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) with its commitment to be disarmed in
accordance with the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Clark claimed that the KLA is complying with the agreement.
"The compliance by the KLA with their promises that they undertook
to KFOR and NATO has been, by and large, satisfactory at the 60-
day point," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking ahead anxiously to the 90-day point for the
completion of the demilitarization program. But that seems to be
very much on track. There's a great deal of work to do to build
the institutions there, to assure we do have a climate of security,
and to move into the next steps," he said.
</P>
<P>
The American interests, the general said, are at risk in the
Balkans. "Europe will remain a dynamic environment, and the
Balkans will remain a crucible for testing of our own values and
capabilities."
</P>
<P>
"I know the Balkans is on the -- at least what we would
consider to be the geographic periphery of Europe. But it is at
the strategic center of Europe today ... And at that strategic
center, America indeed has its vital interests engaged," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to NATO's future, Clark said the organization's
credibility "has been enhanced."
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the alliance outlined its new strategic concept
to interfere in conflicts beyond borders of its members.
</P>
<P>
"It was a concept that we spent a long time debating
theoretically, but we already took the first practical steps in
the air campaign and in subsequent operations to deliver on the
theory of that strategic concept," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which strongly opposed NATO's air campaign against
Yugoslavia, will no doubt remain active in pursuit of its own
interests, Clark said, but adding that "hopefully" it will remain
a partner with NATO.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Announces Efforts to Reduce National Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Danish government on
Tuesday announced its draft state budget for 2000, with the target
of reducing national debts as the top priority.
</P>
<P>
Denmark will continue a tight fiscal policy next year. The
draft plan shows the country's 2000 budget will have a surplus of
7.9 billion kroner (around 1 billion U.S. dollars) and will slash
the national debts to 44.4 percent of the gross domestic product (
GDP).
</P>
<P>
The government said the national debts have to be cut in order
to make up for the increasing expense on pension for more and more
aged people.
</P>
<P>
Denmark has pursued a tight fiscal policy for more than a
decade. The national debts have been reducing year by year, and
expenditure on the interests of the debts dropped from 7.3 percent
of the total GDP in 1985 to 3.8 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan shows the largest expense of the Danish
government will be on unemployment relief.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Announces Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso on Tuesday announced an economic recovery plan
that envisaged an annual growth of four percent in the coming four
years.
</P>
<P>
The plan "Brazil in Progress", with a total outlay of some 600
billion U.S. dollars, is aimed to build a strong, just,
competitive and better country for Brazilians, said President
Cardoso in the Planalto Palace.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Brazil will spent 134.167 billion
dollars in the year 2000, 148.091 billion dollars in 2001, 156.037
billion dollars in 2002 and 161.865 billion dollars in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The largest Latin American country will create 8.5 million new
jobs in the four years, reducing the jobless rate by 1.5
percentage points. Brazil's unemployment rate in July was 7.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The "Brazil in Progress" plan has a basket of 358 programs
designed to meet the basic needs of the Brazilian people,
including health, education, security, accommodation and
transportation, said Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil in Progress" is the second plan presented by President
Cardoso in his second term. The first plan "Brazil in Action",
which started to be implemented in August, 1996, focused on
construction efforts.
</P>
<P>
The second plan, along with the draft budget of the federal
government for the year 2000, will soon be presented to Congress
for approval.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Two Democratic members of the U.S.
Congress are continuing their visits to Cuba as the heads of two
different missions.
</P>
<P>
Dannice Davis, from Illinois, and Tom Lampson, from Texas,
arrived in Cuba on Sunday. They have begun contacts separately
with the local authorities as part of their stay which would last
till the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Davis, accompanied by a group of doctors, visited hospitals in
the capital city and the Latin American School of Medical Science.
He has planned a meeting with the officials of the Commission of
Health, Sport and Environment of the National Assembly (Parliament)
.
</P>
<P>
Lampson, for his part, visited agricultural cooperatives
together with a party of North American agriculturists. His
working agenda includes meetings with the officials of the
Ministries of Agriculture and Foreign Trade.
</P>
<P>
A third delegation, led by Democratic representative Sanford
Bishop from Georgia, will join the two men tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
A government source said that the three delegations will meet
with National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the same source, Bishop showed interest in
possible official cooperation in anti-drug operations between Cuba
and the U.S. For this reason he will hold discussions with the
officials of the Cuban institutions responsible for the fight
against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
To explore the possibility of real bilateral cooperation in
this matter, Democrats Tomas Daschle and Byron Dorgan paid a visit
to Cuba in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
The two Democrats had talks with Cuban President Fidel Castro,
Justice Minister and President of the National Anti-drug
Commission Roberto Dias Sotolongo and Economy Minister Jose Luis

<HEADLINE> Peace March of 1 Million Proposed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A world renowned Sri Lankan
social activist has proposed a march of 1 million people from the
south to the war-torn north this month to press for an end to the
prolonged ethnic conflict of the country.
</P>
<P>
The march will be led by A.T. Ariyaratne who heads Sarvodaya
(All People's Prosperous Movement), a 41-year-old nongovernmental
organization that carries out social work mainly in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News Wednesday quoted Ariyaratne as saying
that once initial arrangements have been completed a date will be
fixed for the march.
</P>
<P>
The march will start from five different points in the country
and end in the rebel-controlled north, about 260 kilometers from
Colombo, said Ariyaratne.
</P>
<P>
The route will pass both military and Tamil rebels' camps and
through Sinhala, Muslim and Tamil villages.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the march participants will spread the message
of peace while encouraging bystanders to join in.
</P>
<P>
Ariyaratne said though their target is a million participants
he expects the number be doubled.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday over 200,000 people participated in a peace march
and meditation campaign organized by Sarvodaya in Colombo when
only 100,000 were expected, said Ariyaratne, adding that this
clearly reflected the people's desire for peace.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old civil war between
the Sinhalese majority-controlled government and the Tamil
minority rebels who demand a separate homeland in the north and
east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Thirteen Delegations Take Part in Indonesia Open Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Around 250 players from 13
countries and regions are set to compete Wednesday in the
Indonesia Open in Denpasar, about 1,000 kilometers east of here,
according to a release quoted by the Indonesian Observer.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Denmark, two of the world's badminton powers,
look set for stiff rivalry in the tournament which runs until
September 5 and offers a total prize of 150,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, 13 of the world's 20 top players,
including Singaporean Open champion Heriyanto Arbi, are ready to
take up the challenge.
</P>
<P>
Local hopefuls include Budi Santoso (world's number six),
Hendrawan (number seven), Taufik Hidayat (number nine) and Rony
Agustinus 16).
</P>
<P>
Denmark will deploy world number two Peter Gade-Christensen,
the 1999 All-England champion Poul Erik Hoyer-Larsen, Peter
Rasmussen and Keneth Johanssen.
</P>
<P>
Rashid Sidek, Wong Choong Han and Roslin Hashim will spearhead
the Malaysian squad while Sweden will hang their hopes on Thomas
Johansson.
</P>
<P>
The absence of reigning champion Mia Audina should leave
Camilla Martin from Denmark favorite to win the women's singles
title. Mia now plays for the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Martin is likely to face a tough challenge from fellow Dane
Mette Sorenson, runner-up last year.
</P>
<P>
Cindana Hartono and Lidya Djaelawijaya from Indonesia will have
to prove that they can do the job without Mia, who used to be the
country's number one player.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia look to maintain supremacy in the men's doubles with
Toni Gunawan/Chandra Wijaya, Flandy Limpele/Wahyu Agung, Ricky
Subagja/Rexy Mainaky and Antonius/Halim Heryanto in the running.
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles, the Indonesian pair of Etty Tanri and
Cynthia Tuwanakota are seeded second behind Ann Jorgenson/Vange
Maiken from Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Elysa and Deyana Lomban from Indonesia will
have to retain their titles. However, Elysa and Deyana will have
to work hard to overcome Danish pairs of Mette Schjoldager and Ann-
Lou Jorgensen in the quarterfinals. If they reach the semifinals,
they will likely challenge top seeded Ann Jorgensen and Vange
Maiken.
</P>
<P>
In the mixed doubles, Dane Michael Sogaard was optimistic that
he and partner Rikki Olsen would make a comeback after beating Tri
Kusherjanto and Minarti Timur from Indonesia. Last year in Jakarta,
Sogaard and Olsen had to bow out to Tri and Minarti.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) deputy
athletes development officer Hadi Hazri Tuesday expressed hope
that Indonesian shuttlers in the women's singles and doubles and
mixed doubles could take advantage of the absence of Chinese and
South Korean players in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"If we see from their drawings, our national players could
benefit. They must not lose in early rounds before their own
public. With the recent point system where athletes will get a
point bonus if they can beat seeded players, I hope our shuttlers
will not be afraid and can win. They must think of it as their
chance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hadi said PBSI plans to petition the International Badminton
Federation (IBF) to take steps on certain countries' absences in
the Indonesia Open.
</P>
<P>
He said he would also ask PBSI chief of foreign affairs to urge
the IBF to warning the countries.
</P>
<P>
China skipped the Indonesia Open for the third time since 1997.
South Korea also missed the tournament for the second time due to
financial restraints in sending its players here.
</P>
<P>
Hadi said PBSI would also request the Asian Badminton
Confederation (ABC) urge other Asian countries to compete in
tournaments in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that Asian countries don't support tournaments
staged in the same region. I hope the ABC will take steps to
overcome the problem," he said.

<P>
URUMQI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Traffic is flowing more
smoothly in Urumqi these days now that a number of new river
bridges and highway overpasses have been added to the frontier
city's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, this capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region had just five bridges spanning the Urumqi River.
Now, there are 70, clearing the way for more people arriving from
the countryside to live on both sides of the river.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 33 elevated overpasses have been built over the
city streets.
</P>
<P>
These structures have added to the appeal of the far west city,
which covers 140 sq km and has 1.55 million residents.
</P>
<P>
Half a century ago, the city was divided into two parts by the
Urumqi River. When the People's Republic of China was founded in
1949, there were only three wooden bridges across the river.
</P>
<P>
Now, 14 more overpasses are being built over Xihong and
Qiantangjiang roads and other congested thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Urumqi has spent 16.3 billion yuan on
infrastructure development.

<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- "The development of high and
new technology is crucial for Beijing's economy," said Jia Qinglin,
secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
When asked how Beijing will face the challenge of the 21st
century, Jia said that Beijing will attach great importance to
technological development, and it will play a crucial role in
social development as outlined in both Deng Xiaoping Theory and at
the 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
China has made rapid progress in technology and science over
the past 50 years since the founding of New China in 1949,
especially during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 500 city-level scientific institutions,
50 key national laboratories, and 26 national engineering research
centers in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also boasts some 1.1 million technicians and
professionals, 327 academicians with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, and 162 academicians with the Chinese Academy of
Engineering now working in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the gross domestic product had been growing at an
average annual rate of 9.8 percent from 1978 to 1998, and
technology and science have contributed to 51 percent of national
economic growth of the city.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that competition among nations is actually a
technological contest, which is both a challenge and an
opportunity. Therefore, Beijing will make every effort to further
the development of science and technology and industrialize the
fruits of scientific research.

YANGON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced a total of
4,080 tons of cotton yarn in fiscal 1998-99 which ended in March,
318 tons more than that in the previous year which was 3,762 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures published by the Central
Statistical Organization, Myanmar also produced 11,895,000 meters

Myanmar's annual cultivated area of cotton is 283,500 hectares,
while annual production of cotton stands at over 160,000 tons, of
which long staple cotton accounts for 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the enthusiasm of cotton growers and relieve the
shortage of investment capital, the government not only provides
annually more than 1 billion kyats (over 3 million U.S. dollars)
of loans to the growers, but also grants advance payment for the
purchase of cotton.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Economy to Recover: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's gross domestic product
grew 6 percent in the first six months of the year, indicating a
quick economic recovery, said Vice-minister of Economy and
Planning Alfonso Casanova on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure showed that Cuba is going to overfulfil its plans
for 1999, which was a growth of 2.5 percent, said Casanova at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said this was the result of the changes in the principal
sectors of the national economy, especially in the sugar industry
which has witnessed a moderate recovery.
</P>
<P>
The production of sugar, the major catalyst for the economy of
the island country, grew by almost half a million tons in the last
harvest, after a fall to a record low of 3.2 million tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that the recovery of the sugar industry
has had a positive impact on the economy of the country, as well
as on tourism, which has recorded a growth of over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industry registered a notable growth of 5 percent over the
first half of the year, agriculture 6 percent and construction 7
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Casanova also mentioned a rise in productive efficiency,
because of a better relationship between energy consumption and
production.

<HEADLINE> Synthetic Oral Insulin Created in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 31 (Xinhua) -- After decades of research,
Mexican scientists recently created a synthetic insulin for
diabetics to take by mouth, according to the local press.
</P>
<P>
With pharmacological properties identical to natural insulin,
the synthetic insulin is said to be able to adequately control the
sugar level in the organism and avoid complications usually caused
by insulin injection, such as sight problems, skin allergies and
complications with the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
Experiments conducted on laboratory mice showed that the
synthetic insulin is capable of reducing the glucose level by 40
percent in a short period of time, according to the scientists
from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who began the
research project in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the purified animal insulin, the synthetic one will not
be deactivated by enzymes in the intestine, nor does it produce
anti-bodies, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Gutierrez, a chemical engineer heading the research team,
said that after being absorbed by the intestine, the synthetic
insulin is distributed rapidly into the organism by the peripheral
tissues and immediately begins its therapeutic action.

</P>
<P>
Beijing will continue its efforts to upgrade key technologies
to reach the world's advanced level by the year 2010, as it
strives to make the Zhongguancun Technological Garden one of the
most advanced in the world in the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
The city also will try to maintain the continuous growth of key
industries, including electronics and information, biological
engineering, new pharmaceuticals, new energy sources, and ecology-
friendly industries.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the city's industrial structure and efforts to
attract overseas investment in hi-tech sectors will continue, as
Beijing encourages further cooperation among scientific research
institutions, universities and industries.

HELSINKI, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish telecommunication
company Sonera is ready for an immediate launch of the world's
first information service for WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)
mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
The first products of WAP mobile phones are expected to be
available on the market within this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing its own services, Sonera will give its
business partners opportunity to offer their services based on
Sonera's WAP concept.
</P>
<P>
Some of its partners, Finnair and CNN Interactive, for example,
presented their WAP-based services at the launch event here of
Sonera's vendor-independent WAP solution.
</P>
<P>
Timo Ahomaki, Sonera's Development Manager, said WAP provides
an excellent platform for new and more interactive service
products.
</P>
<P>
The products presented here have tapped only a tip of the WAP
potential, he said, adding that this is only natural because the
potential and limitations of the new technology are not yet fully
known.
</P>
<P>
Even though WAP offers new business opportunities, the Sonera
company will meanwhile continue developing services for the "

<HEADLINE> Sampras Withdraws, Sixth seed Henman Upset at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of the stunning
withdrawal of top seed Pete Sampras, Patrick Rafter of Australia
and American Lindsay Davenport start their bids to repeat as U.S.
Open champions today when they play their first round matches at
the 14.5 million US dollars Grand Slam event in New York.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who was seeking his record 13th Grand Slam title and
fifth U.S. Open championship, had withdrawn because of a strain in
his lower back.
</P>
<P>
Sampras sustained the injury during a practice session with
Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil on Sunday. Sampras had been the hottest
player on the men's tour, winning Wimbledon for the sixth time and
taking 24 consecutive matches and four titles before withdrawing
with a hip injury during a match against fellow Amercian Vincent
Spadea two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Sampra's injury was diagnosed as a small herniated disc. He is
expected to be out of the Pilot Pen in New Haven, Connecticut,
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sixth-seeded Tim Henman of Britain became the first
men's upset victim at the U.S. Open tennis championships when he
was beaten by unseeded Argentine Guillermo Canas in straight sets
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Henman who ranked fifth in the world, was unable to return the
strong volleys from the 21-year-old Argentina who only ranked 68th
and suffered a defeat 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 6-3 on Louis Armstrong
Stadium court.
</P>
<P>
Henman, who reached the round of 16 in last year's Open, had
beaten Canas in three sets in their only previous encounter in the
second round of last year's Canadian Open.
</P>
<P>
Five other seeded men's players are in action today. Kuerten,
who is seeded fifth, plays Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic,
No. 7 Todd Martin of the United States avoided a five-set meltdown
and held off Stephane Huet of France 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (2-7), 6-7 (5-7)
,7-6 (7-3) in a four hour match.
</P>
<P>
The 13th seeded Alex Corretja of Spain goes against hard-
serving Australian Wayne Arthurs and No. 16 Nicolas Kiefer of
Germany faces Jason Stoltenberg of Australia.
</P>

Seles, a nine-time Grand Slam champion, missed a month of
action with an arm injury before reaching the final at last week's

<HEADLINE> Several Million People Out of Poverty in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Seven million rural people
have been lifted out of poverty since 1990 in central China's
Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the number of the needy had
decreased to 3.16 million in 1998 from 10.4 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
During the eight years, local treasury departments at all
levels have earmarked a total of 3.475 billion yuan for their
poverty-relief efforts, and last year alone they allocated 646
million yuan for poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local treasury departments also implemented a set
of fiscal preferential policies to assist the 34 poorest counties
in the province so that the impoverished could improve their
ability to develop.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Henan Province has begun to place more
emphasis on infrastructure construction, improving production
conditions, and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
For these purposes, 899 million yuan was put into some poor
regions in 1997 and 1998, 83.5 percent of the total fund.
</P>
<P>
With the fund, local governments have created 49 small and
medium-sized reservoirs and maintained and rebuilt 29 water-power
stations and 3,220 drinking-water projects. They also built or
reconstructed 3,132 kilometers of road and 807 bridges and
culverts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 466 schools, 148 village clinics, and seven
country broadcasting stations were also established during this
period.
</P>
<P>
Due to the improvement in production conditions and
infrastructure, the economy and social facilities of the poor
counties have greatly developed.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the government revenue of the 34
poorest counties in Henan Province had reached 2.382 billion yuan,
nearly double that of 1990.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income of the farmers in the poor counties had
risen to 1,579.22 yuan in 1998 from only 326 yuan in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Also, many roads in most villages are now open to traffic, and
telephones have been installed in households across the province.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Y2K Bug: Is Asia Prepared? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- With just four months to go
before the clock ticks over to 2000, is Asia prepared to withstand
the Y2k bug that many fear could trigger havoc?
</P>
<P>
There remains no definite answer to this question, because
while Asian countries are working hard to meet the deadline, there
is still much work to be done before the region is
"Y2K-compliant."
</P>
<P>
The Y2k bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems that
prevent them from correctly recognizing dates from January 1, 2000
onward.
</P>
<P>
As a result, such computer systems could mistake the year 2000
for the 1900 and could possibly jeopardize operation of computer
dependent industries.
</P>
<P>
However, according to a recent survey by the Gartner Group, a
consultancy, progress in the region on moves against the Y2K bug
is uneven. Singapore, South Korea and Japan have received top
rating, but much work remains to be down in many other Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Because of the inadequate preparations So far, Asian government
officials are expressing cautious optimism. They said that crucial
services in the region are not expected to be in chaos when 2000
comes, but problems such as temporary power shortages or
telecommunication breakdowns may not be completely avoided.
</P>
<P>
"The chance of things like a collapse in infrastructure -- like
electricity, gas, water, communications -- on January 1, 2000, or
Y2K issues making any noticeable impact on the nation's gross
domestic product, is very unlikely," said Takeo Shina, head of
Japan's advisory panel on millennium compliance.
</P>
<P>
Amable Aguiluz, chairman of the Philippine Presidential
Commission on year 2000 compliance, said that most of the seven
mission-critical sectors in his country are at least 70 percent
Y2K prepared except the health care sector which is at 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
The other six critical sectors are utilities, finance,
tele-communication, transportation, manufacturing and government.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the millennium bug is no more than a passing
storm. but, nonetheless, we should be prepared," Aguiluz said at a
recent meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the deadline for banking full compliance is
June 30, 1999 and for all other sectors is September 30, 1999. So
far, most financial institutions in the country have already
conducted Y2K Simulation tests and been proved Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
Just like the Philippines, other Asian countries and business
organizations are taking the 2YK bug seriously.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that China has spent 5 billion yuan (600 million
U.S. dollars) to ensure trading and banking system will not crash.
In Japan, Japan Airlines has spent 25 million U.S. dollars combing
31 million lines of computer code to ensure its jets keep flying
unevenfully.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, while many countries have made rapid progress
plugging the gaps in crucial systems, the region is "a little bit
behind, firstly in terms of awareness, and secondly in terms of
doing anything about the bug," said Stephen Kucia, managing
director of an American company that has carried out Y2K work in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
In some countries, preparations have been hampered by a lack of
funds and inadequate coordination.
</P>
<P>
Experts also warned that without full preparations in the
region, the Y2K bug will not only hit individual countries
themselves, but their trading partners because of their
inter-dependence.
</P>
<P>
"If there are problems in Hong Kong, they would probably come
externally, from our international trading partners," said Roy Ko,
head consultant of Hong Kong's Productivity Council, which
overseas Y2K readiness of some 300,000 local small and
medium-sized firms.
</P>
<P>
Facing the potential challenges, some Asian countries are
preparing for the worst on Y2K bug. In the Philippines, the
central bank is directing all banks to prepare for the worst-case
scenario in drafting their Y2K plans.
</P>
<P>
As the country's health sector is only 69 percent Y2K prepared,
the government is encouraging state and private hospitals to pool
their resources together to tackle the bug. At the same time, It
asked hospitals that are non-Y2K compliant to direct patients to
those that are already compliant.
</P>
<P>
Some of Japan's biggest manufacturers, such as electronics
giant NEC Corp. and audio equipment maker Aiwa Co. Ltd, said last
month that they are building up extra stockpiles of necessary
components in anticipation of problems related to the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
With the year 2000 approaching, government officials and
experts are appealing to less-prepared sectors or organizations
for quicker steps against the Y2K bug.

<HEADLINE> A Chinese Breeder 's Dream (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year marks the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People' s Republic of China. Xinhua News Agency is
releasing about 50 stories on Chinese men and women, young and old,
illustrating the changes that have taken place in China over the
past half century. These people will describe their own
experiences and how they fit into the changes in the motherland.
This is the eleventh story.
</P>
<P>
JINAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- "I have a dream, in which
farmland will be able to produce a higher grain yield," said Li
Denghai, 50, president of the Laizhou Academy of Agricultural
Sciences of east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to make his dream come true, Li has in the past
34 years set up a world record of maize yield per hectare of some
16.44 tons, adding over 40 million tons to the nation's grain
output by extending his high-yield maize seeds in 47 million
hectares.
</P>
<P>
He was depressed in 1966 after observing that the yield per
hectare in China was only 1.5 tons to the 2.25 tons when he
graduated from junior high school at 17.
</P>
<P>
It was then that he made up his mind to become involved in
breeding research projects aimed at increasing the maize yield and
help his hometown villagers eliminate poverty as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He spent whole days in the fields and studied theories on
breeding late into the night until he went to the Laizhou Academy
of Agricultural Sciences in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the maize yield per hectare in the U.S. was
already 18.75 tons in his graduation year had an extremely big
impact on him.
</P>
<P>
He wrote down in his diary on his graduation day: "I will
devote my whole life to the research of corn breeding and to
realize a great farming dream."
</P>
<P>
Some westerners had predicted when New China was founded in
1949 that the country would not be able to solve the problem of
grain shortage on its own.
</P>
<P>
However, half a century of hard work has proved that China has
been able to provide for 22 percent of the world's population with
some 10 percent of the world's arable land, realizing a balance
between demand and supply on grain.

BUCHAREST, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Senate Chairman Petre
Roman said here Tuesday that his country will stick to the "One-
China" policy and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
The "two states" statement recently put forward by the Taiwan
authorities is very ridiculous and this attempt to divide China is
doomed to fail, said Roman while meeting with the outgoing Chinese
Ambassador Liu Guchang.
</P>
<P>
It is in the interests of Romania and its people to further
develop political and economic cooperation with China, the senate
chairman said.

<P>
China's stability will benefit world peace and development,
Roman added.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Good Example for Developing Countries: Yemeni Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China's great success achieved
with its reform and opening-up policy is attracting worldwide
attention and China has set a good example for other developing
countries, Yemeni Vice President Abdo Rabo Mansour Hadi said in a
recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"China has become one of the major economic powers in the world,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many economic and technological development zones in China
have become centers of industrial production, advanced technology
research and foreign investment. They are the epitome of
achievements made by China's reform and opening-up policy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In April, Hadi paid a week-long visit to China at the
invitation of his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao. He said he was
deeply impressed by Shanghai and Shenzhen, models of China's
development.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Yemen and China, Hadi said, "Friendship
between us has borne fruits. The Yemeni people will never forget
the economic assistance and help from the Chinese government."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Sino-Yemeni ties have developed steadily since
the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1956. China
helped Yemen build its first highway, the Sana - Hudaydah highway,
which played a key role in its revolution and economic
construction. In addition, China sent more than 2,500 medical
workers to Yemen over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
"President Ali Abdullah Saleh and I are very happy to notice
that the Chinese people anticipate great events this year," Hadi
said, referring to the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China and return of Macao to the motherland.
"We share the happiness of the Chinese people and wish China to
accomplish the task of unifying the country as early as possible."
</P>
<P>
The 55-year old vice president was born in Yemen's southern
province of Abyan. He was appointed defense minister in May, 1995,
and became vice president in October the same year.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Not to Mediate in Colombian Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez said on Tuesday that his government would not mediate in
the conflict between Colombia's leftist guerrillas and the
paramilitary rightists.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said: "We have had various talks in various places with
Colombian President Andrez Pastrana about Colombia's internal
problems, but I will not interfere in this matter."
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president, who will attend the inauguration
ceremony of the Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso, said that he
is prepared to mediate between the two sides to help negotiate an
end to the Colombian civil war.
</P>
<P>
If the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia asked for his
help, he would have the right to talk with them in Venezuela, said
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would not recommend measures like those taken
by the National Constitutional Assembly of Panama and other Latin
American countries.
</P>
<P>
Chavez stressed that every country has the right to search for
its own path, and Venezuela has found its own after suffering a
state of chaos.

<HEADLINE> A Chinese Breeder' s Dream (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li found out through later experiments that the close-sowed and
photosynthesis efficient hybrid maize seed is crucial for high
yield, and the results of his first research in this field, called
"No. 2 Yedan", meant he was able to increase the production per
hectare to more than 11.25 tons.
</P>
<P>
Then he decided to move to Sanya City in south China's Hainan
Province for his research work as the comparatively low
temperature in northern China hindered the breeding program's
progress.
</P>
<P>
Over his 21 years of research, he says, he was never bothered by
the mosquitoes and snakes, or the heat. And some dozens of disease
resistant maize species have been formed during the period.
</P>
<P>
His "Yedan" series of hybrid seeds were spread to 28 provinces,
municipalities, and autonomous regions in 1997, the total sowing
acreage accounting for 43.5 percent of the nation's total, and the
economic returns reaching around 50 billion yuan (about 6 billion
U.S. dollars), according to Ministry of Agriculture statistics.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing the annual maize output from 100 million tons to
some 500 million tons in the past 50 years despite farmland
reduction, population increase, and frequent natural adversities,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is far from enough, as there are still some 40
million needy people across the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Together with his colleagues, he set up some 16,700 hectares of
maize breeding bases nationwide last year, planning to double the
size by the year 2000 and increase the use of high-quality maize
seeds to 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"I will work for the agricultural cause of my motherland until
the last breath of my life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China has increased its annual crop production
by over 180 million tons in the past four years, while the demand
for the grains has increased by just some 50 million tons.
</P>
<P>
This means, says Li proudly, that China will be able to produce
enough grain to feed its people.
</P>
<P>
It won't be a problem at any time for China to ensure food
security for its people, said officials with the Beijing Office of
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
</P>
<P>
China still has an idle land of 35 million hectares suitable
for agricultural undertakings, and 14.7 million hectares of which
may be used for grain production.

<HEADLINE> Italy Finds New Gene Causing Hereditary Deafness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Italian medical researchers found a
new gene playing a role in hereditary deafness, a problem that
affects one person out of every 2,000 and which is the cause of at
least half of the hearing defects found in newborns.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian news agency Ansa, the new gene,
"connexina 30," was found in humans by Italians Paolo Gasparini
and Leopoldo Zelante, researchers in the field of genetics at the
hospital in Italy's southern province of Foggia.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is yet another step forward in the precocious
diagnosis of hereditary deafness and efforts to combat
deaf-mutism.
</P>
<P>
The gene had already been found in laboratory rats. The
Italians managed to isolate it and then, through the study of some
200 families suffering from hereditary deafness, to find the same
gene in humans.
</P>
<P>
They further discovered that a mutation in "connexina 30" had
rendered the protein the gene produces incapable of letting
electric charges pass to neighboring cells.
</P>
<P>
There are around 60 genes suspected of involvement in
hereditary deafness. Around 12 of them have been shown to play a
part while the worst of them, "connexina 26," was discovered two
years ago, also in Italy.

secretary of commerce and acting commissioner of patent and
trademarks, said the U.S. and China have enjoyed a good working
relationship for a number of years in the area of intellectual
property.
</P>
<P>
"We know that China is in the process of amending some of its
intellectual property laws, such as the copyright and trademark
laws, and we look forward to seeing these laws fully implemented
to provide all intellectual property owners greater protection
for their intellectual efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day fair, co-sponsored by the State Intellectual
Property Office of China and the U.S.-China Council for
International Exchange, Inc., is being held to exhibit China's
intellectual property protection system and its accomplishments as
well as to promote better understanding and cooperation between
the U.S. and China in the intellectual property area.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 31 (Xinhua) -- A leader of an African
non- governmental organization said Tuesday that the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) countries should co-operate
in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Director for Human Rights and Documentation
Trust of Southern Africa, Philiat Matsheza, told a press
conference in Dar es Salaam that there is a need for SADC
countries to participate fully in the war against corruption,
because this part of Africa is heavily hit by the evil.
</P>
<P>
A four-day roundtable SADC conference on ethics and
anti-corruption will be opened in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Matsheza said the roundtable conference will provide an
opportunity for 14-member SADC countries to co-operate more
closely in fighting the evil.
</P>
<P>
He said that delegates will make suggestions to leaders on what
should be done.
</P>
<P>
The director said that corruption is a complicated issue, which
a country sometimes feel difficult to deal with individually.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Prevention of Corruption Bureau, said in a statement
that earlier this week that participants at the meeting will be
armed with specific and practical skills and strategies for
enhancing existing anti- corruption efforts in their countries.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the second of its kind, is co-hosted by the NGO
and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania was chosen as a venue of the second conference because
of its extensive experience and commitment to anti-corruption
activities.

<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges Backing for Mowlam on N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
ignored Protestant anger Tuesday and backed his Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam over her ruling that the Irish Republican
Army's ceasefire was intact.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Mowlam, Blair, who was just
back from holiday, emphasized the government's commitment to the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
And he stressed that it was vital for the Northern Ireland
political parties to become fully engaged in the review of
Northern Ireland's stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Blair's office said earlier that former U.S. Senator George
Mitchell was ready to launch a review next Monday but would first
seek assurances from all parties that they remained committed to
it.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Irish Republic hope Mitchell, who brokered last
year's Good Friday peace agreement for the British province, can
employ the review to end a long-running deadlock between
Protestant and Roman Catholic politicians over guerrilla
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Blair also spoke to Northern Ireland's main
Protestant politician David Trimble Tuesday but declined to give
details.
</P>
<P>
Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party, which represents many of the
province's Protestant majority, met Tuesday to discuss taking part
in the Mitchell review but reached no decision on whether to take
part in next week's review.
</P>
<P>
The party also delayed a decision on whether to seek a judicial
review of the British government's verdict that the IRA ceasefire
is still intact.

NEW YORK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Tuesday with blue chip stocks falling and technology shares
rising.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 84.85 at 10,829.28
for the fourth consecutive sessions. The index fell 452.91 points
in the three previous tradings.
</P>
<P>
But the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 26.66 at
2,739.35. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 3.61 at 1,320.41.
</P>
<P>
The Dow moved lower as investors were concerned about inflation
after the National Association of Purchasing Management released
inadvertently one day ahead of schedule the August survey on
manufacturing activity. The survey showed growth in the industrial
sector of the U.S. economy, indicating the build-up of
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The increase in inflationary pressures would convince investors
that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates for the third
time this year. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice in
the past two months in a bid to preempt inflation from the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
The technology shares rose on the merger. Sun Microsystems
acquired Star Division Corp., a small maker of office productivity
software and the acquisition was seen as an assault on Microsoft's
dominance of the office software market.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 2.80 at 612.33. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 0.20 at 775.41 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 0.47 at 427.83.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin, on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,671 down, 1,316 up and 582
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 838.40 million shares from 585.59
million in the previous session.
