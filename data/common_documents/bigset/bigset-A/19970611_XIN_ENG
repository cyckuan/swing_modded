<HEADLINE> Xinhua On Patriotism (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 100 education bases provide people with historical
information on the Chinese nation's patriotic tradition through
generation after generation, and improving continuously, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation regards contributing all of one's energy to
the construction and protection of the motherland as the greatest
glory, and harming national interest and dignity as the greatest
wrong.
</P>
<P>
This is a lofty national sentiment and a major source of
strength that helps the nation survive and develop. With this
patriotic feeling, our country has beat off invaders and has built
an independent socialist country.
</P>
<P>
During the period of the reforms and opening-up, we should
continue to hold high the banner of patriotism and put all
national strength into building the country.
</P>
<P>
Holding high the banner of patriotism will help us adhere to
the basic national policy of opening up, absorb the best of other
civilizations and cultures, and introduce the advanced foreign
science and technology to accelerate the national development and
progress.
</P>
<P>
It will help us stand firm in the face of difficulties and
setbacks, maintain national dignity and confidence, and turn love
for the motherland into selfless contribution and the
determination to build a strong country.
</P>
<P>
It will also help maintain national unity and the unity of
various ethnic groups, and safeguard people's interests with
patriotism. Making young people aware of patriotism will help them
learn the glorious history of the motherland and help them turn
their patriotic feelings into ideals to contribute to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"I am a son of the Chinese people, I love my motherland and
people deeply," the commentary quoted the late leader Deng
Xiaoping. The Chinese people should follow his example and make
their own contribution to the building of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, the commentary said.

<HEADLINE> Sakurauchi Hails Hong Kong's Return to Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Yoshio Sakurauchi, Chairman of
Japan's Association for the Promotion of International Trade,
today hailed the coming return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In a speech, Sakurauchi congratulated China on the coming
historical day, July 1, when Hong Kong returns to the embrace of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Sakurauchi mentioned a photo collection book on the Opium War
between Britain and China in 1840, during which Chinese people had
to take arms against the oppression of Britain which started the
war to protect its exports of opium to China.
</P>
<P>
Sakurauchi said the book made him understand the sufferings
China had experienced during the war.
</P>
<P>
It is understandable, Sakurauchi said, that the Chinese people
welcome the return of Hong Kong to the motherland with such
immeasurable joy since the island fell under the colonial rule of
Britain soon after the war.
</P>
<P>
Sakurauchi said he believed a brand new age was waiting for
Hong Kong after July 1, just as Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the concern of some of the 25,000 Japanese living
in Hong Kong about their life after the return, the chairman said
he was confident that Hong Kong will maintain its role as Asia's
finance, trade, transportation and information center, under the
principle of "one country, two systems", proposed by the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Sakurauchi said Hong Kong, known as "the Pearl of the East,"
will shine more brightly after its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Sakurauchi expressed hope that Hong Kong's return would lead
China one big step forward to its ultimate goal of reunifying of
the whole territory.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament Begins Budget Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Jatiya Sangsad (parliament) of
Bangladesh began its budget session this afternoon while Speaker
Humayun Rashid Chowdhury sought cooperation from all political
parties for the smooth functioning of this session.
</P>
<P>
He said in his opening speech that the current session is very
important as the one-year economic development and activities of
the government will be discussed and decisions will be taken in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury said in a parliamentary democracy, parliament is the
focal point of all activities. "We shall achieve success in the
parliament only when all members of the ruling and opposition
parties will go ahead targeting the national progress and
development," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria will place the
national budget for the fiscal 1997-98 before the House. This will
be the second budget of the Awami (people's) League government
which came to power through the June 12 election of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the finance minister is unlikely to propose fresh
taxes but most likely to expand the tax-net. The growth rate in
the gross domestic product is expected to be fixed around 6
percent in the national budget, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Water Supplies Will Remain Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun,
speaking at a conference marking Guangdong province's
thirty-second year of providing water for Hong Kong today, urged
the Guangdong provincial government to work harder to improve
water supplies for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on water officials to improve management,
guarantee water quality and offer better services to Hong Kong's
six million people.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu Man Shiu, director of Hong Kong's Water
Supplies Department, Hong Kong suffered from a drought from the
autumn of 1962 to the summer of 1963 that caused severe water
shortages in Hong Kong, which has no major lakes, rivers or
underground water supply.
</P>
<P>
At that time, China came to the rescue with a water-supply
project, bringing water from Dongguan City in Guangdong Province
for a distance of 83 km to the Shenzhen River, which reaches Hong
Kong, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The project was renovated three times and provides more than
700 million cubic meters of water to Hong Kong a year, meeting
over 70 percent of Hong Kong's water needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the more than 600 people in the audience that
Guangdong's water supply has provided Hong Kong with the
fundamental means to embark on a road to riches.
</P>
<P>
Not a few people attribute Hong Kong's success to low taxes,
free and fair market competition, a sound legal and financial
structure, a sophisticated infrastructure, a capable working
population and a group of aggressive entrepreneurs, he said.
</P>
<P>
But, he stressed, the most important and a relatively
inconspicuous reason is the stable and reliable water
supply. Otherwise, Hong Kong's development history could have been
rewritten.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Wishes Ratification of EU Stability Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- President Jacques Chirac today
expressed his wish that the European Union (EU) monetary stability
pact be ratified at the EU summit in Amsterdam to be held on June
16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the French government is justified to
stress the need to build a European social model and improve
economic coordinations among EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The French Minister of Economy and Finance Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said on Monday at the EU Council of Economy and
Finance in Luxembourg that France wants to delay the ratification
of the stability pact, because its present text fails to includes
policies on employment and economic coordination among EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
The stability pact, which is aimed at punishing those EU
countries with excessive public deficits after the launching of
the European single currency, is approved by all other 14 EU
members.
</P>
<P>
After having a meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok in
Paris today, Chirac said that France remains committed to the goal
of launching the euro on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"That means that we should examine in Amsterdam, on the one
hand the pact of stability and growth which I hope will be
ratified in Amsterdam, and on the other hand the social models and
coordination of economic policies which, justifiably, the French
government has just emphasized," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that France presented a memorandum on a European
social model two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I relayed to the president of the (European) Union (Prime
Minister Kok) the worries, the concerns and the requests of the
French government on the last point," said Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Military Junta Not to Give Up Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 10 (Xinhua) - The military junta in Sierra
Leone said it never asked the deposed civilian government for
money and cars in return of returining power to civilians.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a claim made on the BBC African network programme
on Tuesday that the junta was willing to give up power, a
military spokesman said, "no transaction like that happened".
</P>
<P>
"We are still going for negotiated settlement which would
auger peace for Sierra Leone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said a negotiated settlement would involve all
political parties, the rebel and other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
According to a report published by the International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Tuesday, 120 civilians died as a
result of Nigerian-led bombardment by ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
It said about 200 civilians were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Civilian exodus was put at 25,000, mainly evacuated to parts
of the north while 20,000 people crossed the border into Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The capital remained calm but there has been a considerable
escalation of prices on essential consumer goods.

<HEADLINE> Germany Dismisses Change of EU Stability Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
today ruled out the possibility to make any change of the
stability pact for the planned single European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
"I have made it clear that there will be no renegotiation of
the stability pact," Waigel said in Berlin in an apparent response
to French plans announced Monday to delay the pact.
</P>
<P>
French Finance Minister Dominique Strausse-Kahn Monday said
Paris needed time to consider whether to sign the pact, which
would impose huge forfeit on countries for failing to limit budget
deficits within 3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product as
required for qualifying for euro membership.
</P>
<P>
Waigel strongly backed the pact which was reached after tough
negotiations by European Union (EU) leaders last December and was
supposed to be signed at the EU Amsterdam summit slated for June
16-17.
</P>
<P>
German industry today urged the German government to reject the
French move.
</P>
<P>
"The stability pact must remain -- the German government must
be tough on this, " said Dieter Rath, spokesman for the
influential Confederation of German Industry.
</P>
<P>
French Deputy Minsiter for European Affairs Pierre Moscovici,
said in Paris that France would not give in to any pressure and
the pact could not be approved at Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
In addition, German main opposition Social Democrats (SPD)
today announced that it would decline a revised EU Maastricht II
treaty if it failed to carry provisions on job creation.
</P>
<P>
Bonn opposes an EU job program, which Rath said "would not
create a single new job."
</P>
<P>
The revised EU treaty is expected to pass the Amsterdam summit.
</P>
<P>
SPD, controlling the upper house of the German parliament, can
block the EU Maastricht II accord, which needs the approval of at
least two thirds of the votes at both lower and upper chambers of
the parliament.

<HEADLINE> EU Provides Humanitarian Aid for Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Tuesday that it had approved humanitarian aid worth ECU
400,000(one ECU equals 1.13 US dollars) for landmine victims in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is one of the most densely mined countries in the
world. After years of war, civilian populations are now the main
casualties of anti-personnel mines. About one in 300 Cambodians
has a landmine injury.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said that the grant would enable a
Belgian non-governmental organization to run six existing centers
fitting landmine victims with artificial limbs, and to set up a
new center in Banteay Meanchey, the most heavily mined province in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Commission also approved humanitarian aid
worth ECU 470,000 for Burkina Faso to combat a meningitis epidemic
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Two other projects approved by the Commission were food aid for
Chad(ECU 270,000) and Guinea Bissau(ECU 60,000).

<P>
LUSAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Software production could become a
major earner for Zambia if fully exploited, a Zambian computer
expert has said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Dove computing director Jeremiah
Phiri as saying in Kitwe, northern Zambia, at the weekend that
the computer software production is a potential money spinner
because it requires very little material inputs.
</P>
<P>
"All you need is a computer and diskettes and a brain, then
you can produce your software," Phiri said.
</P>
<P>
He said the market is readily available in the country as 60
percent of companies are using computers.
</P>
<P>
At present there are very few local companies that produce
software and most firms only sold computers, he said.
</P>
<P>
People face problems because they prefer to import software,
some of which is of inferior quality, said the computer expert.
</P>
<P>
"Because the software is from developed countries, people
think it is always of high quality. Some of the software packages
have been rejected in developed countries and are just dumped in
Africa where people accept anything," Phiri said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called on schools to continue to enhance the work of party
building and promote cultural and ethical progress in order to
help students become more qualified successors to China's
socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
"This is the fundamental task for the schools, as it concerns
the success of the strategy of revitalizing the nation with
science and education, as well as the future of the country," said
Jiang, who is also the General Secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in a meeting here with representatives
of a national conference on party building in higher education
institutions, and another national conference on moral education
in primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
The president said that schools have made remarkable
achievements in instilling in the minds of teachers and students
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, promoting cultural and ethical progress in the
schools, and advancing education reform and development. He also
praised schools for their great contribution to China's opening-up
and modernization.
</P>
<P>
With the promotion of socialist cultural and ethical progress
as an important goal of and a basic guarantee for building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, Jiang said that schools
should play a leading role in promoting cultural and ethical
progress for all of society.
</P>
<P>
The president urged schools to use Hong Kong's imminent return
as a foundation for carrying out intensive patriotism education
among their students. This will help them understand China's long
history and culture, especially the history of Chinese people's
struggle for national independence and revitalization over the
past 150 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Studying hard and contributing to the motherland's socialist
modernization will nurture in students the sense of mission and
responsibility, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the meeting were Hu Jintao, Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau and member of the
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee; and Li Lanqing, member
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and

BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Propaganda Department of the
Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee has announced the
namelist of 100 model bases for patriotic education, said a

Every province, autonomous region or municipality has at least
one model base, among which are museums, cemeteries, historical

<HEADLINE> Iran to Seek War Reparations From Iraq's Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran said today that it will seek
reparations from Iraq's oil sale for accommodating war refugees
and for pollution in Iran's territorial waters in the Persian Gulf
in the aftermath of Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Hosseini, director-general in charge of foreign
nationals' affairs of the Interior Ministry, was quoted by the
state-run Tehran Radio as saying that "Commission on Estimation of
Reparation located in Geneva, Switzerland, ruled in its latest
session that the cost incurred by Iran would have to be paid from
revenues earned from Iraq's oil sale."
</P>
<P>
Hosseini said that Iran will submit the required documentation
of its financial damage to the U.N. commission.
</P>
<P>
Iran was entitled to the reparations in view of influx of some
1.2 million Kurdish refugees as the result of the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait in 1990, the Iranian official said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no detail on how much reparations Iran
seeks.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. signed last year the "oil-for-food" deal,
which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over
six months. Some 30 percent of the amount is earmarked for war
compensation and U.N. operations in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Official Calls for Common Ideal, Belief in Building Socialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese official
today urged young experts to do their best to understand China's
actual conditions, strengthen the common ideal in building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and strive to propel the
country's opening-up and modernization into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau
and member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, made the remark here during a meeting
with 29 young experts who have recently conducted research into
national conditions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the Organization Department of the
CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu said he fully approved of their study, and hopes China's
young intellectuals will shoulder the historical responsibility of
leading the country's socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Following Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics so as to revitalize the Chinese nation is
a job for the whole Party and the nation, Hu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hu stressed that the CPC is the core force of leading the
entire Chinese people in the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
One of the most outstanding aspects of China at present is that
it is still, and will be for a long time, in the early stages of
socialism, Hu said, urging young intellectuals and experts to
study actual social conditions, and to mix with workers and
peasants so that all can work together for the country's socialist
development.
</P>
<P>
Hu called on young intellectuals and experts to turn their
patriotism into actual deeds, by contributing their knowledge and
expertise to China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 20 years ago Deng Xiaoping put forward the idea
of respecting knowledge and special personnel, and the idea is
especially important now if China's lofty cross-century goals are
to be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
He urged authorities at all levels to continue to implement the
policy of respecting knowledge and special personnel.

<HEADLINE> Iran Understands Turkey's Security Concern: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Iranian official
said here today that Iran understood Turkey's concern over its
border security and would cooperate with Turkey in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the Iranian Embassy here,
visiting Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Alaeddin Brujerdi said
that he had exchanged views with Turkish officials on recent
developments in the region and the security issues as well.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran attached great importance to the security
problem on the two countries' border area, adding that the
Iranian government would extend efforts to help Turkey ensure
its border security.
</P>
<P>
In response to Turkey's appeal for preventing the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels from sheltering in Iran,
Brujerdi said that the Iranian government had ordered its
security forces to arrest those rebels if they tried to
enter Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian deputy foreign minister also denied reports that
there were terrorists' camps on the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Brujerdi arrived here Monday on a surprise visit to Turkey to
voice Iran's concern over Turkey's large-scale military operation
in northern Iraq to wipe out PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
He carried a message from Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani to his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel, but the
content of the letter was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian official said that all countries should
respect the independence and territorial integrity of Iraq,
indicating that Turkey should put an end to its cross-border
military operation in northern Iraq as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Turkish government to take effective
measures against the activities of the alleged anti-Iranian
groups on the Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Iran and Turkey should promote their relations,
Brujerdi said that the scheduled participation of Iranian
President Rafsanjani in the upcoming M-8 Group summit was a good
evidence of Iran's good will to develop its cooperation with
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 Turkish government troops have launched a
massive cross-border military operation in pursuit of the
outlawed PKK rebels in northern Iraq, drawing severe criticism
from many regional countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- All the soldiers and officers of
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should carefully study the
"Outlines of Deng Xiaoping's Ideas on Building the Army in the New
Period," a senior Chinese official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum held in Beijing to mark the publication of
the pamphlet, Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission, said that it is good supplementary material for the
study of Deng's ideas on building the Army in the new period.
</P>

The outline is not only true to Deng's works, but also explains
the major speeches of President Jiang Zemin on military affairs
and the major decisions of the Central Military Commission, added
Liu, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC).
</P>
<P>
He said that the pamphlet will play an important role in
encouraging the army to learn Deng's ideas and improving the
political work in the army.
</P>
<P>
"Deng's ideas on building the army in the new period are an
essential part of his theory on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and officers should put the theory to practice in this
important time to help build up both the country and the army, Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that when doing the study, people should spend more
time reading Deng's original works.

and national defense, issued by the CPC Central Committee, with
Jiang at the core, and the Central Military Commission, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Malt Factory Produces Enough to Supply Breweries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The general manager of the
Assela Malt factory, Getahun Kassaye said today his factory has
now reached a stage whereby it could fully supply quality malt to
the breweries in Ethiopia, according to a report from the
Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Assela malt factory now produces 15,000 tons of malt
yearly, compared with only 10,000 tons in the past. The factory
obtained a net profit of 3.4 million birr (about 500,000 U.S.
dollars) from the sale of 9,000 tons of malt over the past nine
months of the current fiscal year (July 8, 1996- July 7, 1997).
</P>
<P>
The general manager attributed to the boost in production to
the installation of additional pitchers and other equipment at a
cost of 26 million birr (about 3.8 million U.S. dollars) and
farmers supplying adequate barley to the factory.
</P>
<P>
He said the factory could supply local breweries quality malt
according to their demands.

<P>
He added that as the quality of beer depends upon the quality
of barley the factory is now engaged in distributing select-seed
to peasants in the area of credit basis.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport, one
of the three largest in China, will introduce a joint-stock system
to raise funds for further development and improving efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The airport will set up the Hongqiao International Airport
Joint-Stock Company Ltd. this month. Shareholders will mainly be
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Authorities say that the majority of funds raised will be used
to purchase part of the management rights of Pudong International
Airport, and a small amount will be kept for purpose of developing
Hongqiao Airport.
</P>
<P>
Pudong International Airport will go into operation by the end
of 1999. The Shanghai Airport Joint-Stock (Group) Company, which
will soon be formed, will be entitled by the Shanghai Municipal
State-Owned Assets Management Committee to manage state-owned
assets of the two airports.
</P>
<P>
The civil aviation industry of Shanghai has grown rapidly over
the past few years. Hongqiao Airport handled 12.3 million
passengers last year, a 11.5 percent rise over 1995, while its
designed capacity is only for 9.6 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the airport's number of take-offs and
landings of airplanes, the passenger handling capacity, and the
cargo and mail handling capacity increased by 18.4, 22.6, and 23.2
percent annually, respectively, during the 1991-1995 period.

PARIS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- France today denied a report by a
Taiwan newspaper that the Socialist government wishes to sell 60
Mirage 2000-5 combat aircraft to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"This report does not tell the truth," said French Foreign
Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said France respects "word by word" the 1994 Franco-Chinese
agreement, in which Paris promised not to sell armaments to Taiwan
from then on.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the agreement paved the way for the
normalization of bilateral relations, which had been shaken by the
decision of a former French government to sell 60 Mirage combat
aircraft to Taiwan in 1993.
</P>
<P>
During his state visit in China in May, President Jacques
Chirac reaffirmed France's commitment to not sell armaments to
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> China Cooperates With UNDP to Strengthen Coastal Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- In a move to strengthen
environmental protection and preserve coastal resources, China
today launched a project for integrated coastal management in the
northern part of the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
With 1.1 million US dollars in funding from the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), the project will establish a
coordinated management system among the provincial governments of
Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces to improve monitoring and
supervision of the environment.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the project in three years, an
experimental zone will be set up in each of the three provinces,
focusing on the sustainable development of fishery resources, port
management, and multi-layered development of oceanic resources.
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic growth of China's coastal areas has led to
the deterioration of its coastal environment and resources, which
has drawn increasing attention from the central government.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made to tighten supervision over the coastal
areas. For example, China has set up a large oceanic environmental
monitoring system which has conducted in-depth studies into the
coastal ecological systems, and a second survey of the nation's
polluted ocean areas will start soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several oceanic environmental protection zones have
been set up, and a series of laws and regulations on oceanic
environmental protection have been drawn up.

<HEADLINE> Clash Recovered Between Nigerian and Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 11 (Xinhua) - All is now quiet at the Lungi
international airport in Sierra Leone after Nigerian and Sierra
Leone soldiers traded mogtar shells on Tuesday night, local
residents said.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of casualities, but state radio
quoting an announcement from the military junta, attributed the
clash to a "small misunderstanding between a skeleton of the
Nigerian army and a unit of the Sierra Leone army''.
</P>
<P>
The airport is located 12 miles from the capital across the
Sierra Leone river and can be reached from the mainland by ferry.
Residents near the airport reached by telephone said the gunfire
lasted between 10 and 15 minutes and was reechoed in the city
itself.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thought it was the imminent military invasion by
Nigerian-led ECOMOG forces and we dived under our beds," one
Lungi resident said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation was quickly arrested and is now under perfect
control," the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the clash highlights the state of tension
at the airport with Nigerian and Sierra Leone soldiers facing
each other with itchy fingers on the trigger. No commercial
flights have arriveed since the junta lifted the air, land and
sea blockade it imposed after the coup.
</P>
<P>
"We are virtually idle except for the infrequent arrival of
ECOMOG helicopters from Monrovia and the take-off and landing of
helicopters belonging to the Sierra Leone army. Each side watches
the other's aircraft but does not interfere", a civil aviation
worker told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the junta has denied it asked for 43, 000,000
dollars from the ousted civilian government in return to give
back power.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Enhances Security for Liberia's Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, has appointed electoral officers to
coordinate security at the grassroot level of the country during
the elections billed for mid-July.
</P>
<P>
The step was to strengthen the ECOMOG security network for the
election and further boost the confidence and sense of security
of the Liberian populace, especially in the hinterland, the force
commander major-general Victor Malu said on Tuesday in Monrovia,
capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, the ECOMOG electoral officers will continue
to receive regular briefings so that they can effectively police
the areas assigned to them.
</P>
<P>
Commending the Liberian politicians who have started to expand
their activities into the hinterland, Malu said they should go
into remote towns and villages instead of towns near Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG chief also reiterated the force's readiness to
provide additional security to encourage politicians entering the
hinterland. ECOMOG has promised to escort politicians to such
places for election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, the military coup in neighboring Sierra
Leone is now generating a new wave of refugees who are fleeing
into Liberia to escape the anarchy and insecurity in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG troops stationed in some of the border areas with
Sierra Leone have been giving regular reports of the rattled
Sierra Leoneans escaping brutalities by the rebels and coupists,
he said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Begins Inspection Tour Of Law On Product Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Governments and people's
congresses at all levels should strengthen the enforcement of the
law on Product Quality, said Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks here today after hearing a report on the
enforcement of the law from the provincial government of south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Four inspection teams sent by the Standing Committee of the NPC
have gone to provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Hebei and Henan,
while Tianjin Municipality, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Yunnan and Fujiang
provinces have begun conducting self-inspections on their
effectiveness in carrying out the law.
</P>
<P>
Governments and enterprises at all levels should emphasize
product quality, as it is crucial for enterprises that want to get
a foothold in the international market, said Wang Guangying.
</P>
<P>
A leader in China's reform and opening drive, Guangdong has the
fastest growing economy in the country, but in some parts of the
province, shoddy or fake products still are sold.
</P>
<P>
As many as 5,150 stores that sell poor-quality products have
been punished in Guangdong since 1994, and more than 760 workshops
which produce phony goods have been closed.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing to resettle 337,200 People in five years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- China's fourth and newest
municipality of Chongqing is scheduled to move 337,200 people out
of the Three Gorges Area within five years, or 67,400 people per
year.
</P>
<P>
The figure still only accounts for about one-third of the total
of 1.2 million people to be evacuated from the Three Gorges
area. The resettlement will be completed by the year 2009.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, which gained municipality status in March, is
responsible for the resettlement of about one million people.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Three Gorges, where the world's largest
hydro-electric power project is being built, will rise sharply
after the river is dammed this November, and many places around
the area will be flooded.
</P>
<P>
"The resettlement of people in the Three Gorges areas is a key
factor for the ultimate success of the project," said Gan Yuping,
vice-mayor of the city, who is in charge of the resettlement.
</P>
<P>
"So we must make sure that people in the area will be moved out
in time and be resettled comfortably," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled resettlement of people in the Three Gorges area
began in 1993. By the end of 1996, 3.4 billion yuan (about 410
million US dollars) had been spent on the relocation of 28,000
rural residents in Chongqing.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Nearly Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
jumped 92.7 percent in April, to 1,091.8 billion yen (9.8 billion
dollars) compared with its level a year earlier, the Japanese
Finance Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
Exports in April advanced 21.6 percent to 4,313.4 billion yen
(38.9 billion dollars), up for the 21st consecutive month.
Imports grew 9.3 percent to 3,209.8 billion yen (29.6 billion
dollars), rising for the 33rd month in a row, the ministry said in
a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
In particular, automobile exports increased 32.2 percent in
value and 20.2 percent in volume from a year earlier as auto
manufacturers, faced with the declining domestic demand resulting
from the consumption tax hike on April 1, turned their eyes to
foreign markets, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus of goods and services in April amounted to
417.6 billion yen (3.8 billion dollars), compared with a deficit
of 32.5 billion yen (300 million dollars) a year before. Surplus
in merchandise trade soared and a deficit in services trade,
including tourism, expanded.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Black Graduates Difficult to Get Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's well-educated
black youngsters are battling to find jobs as companies in the
country are opting for experience rather than educational
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The number of black graduates from universities and technical
schools is soaring in recent years, but this does not mean black
graduates have easy access to good work, personnel agencies and
educationists said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A study found that from 1991 to 1994 the number of degrees,
diplomas, and certificates awarded by universities to Africans
grew by 42 percent against a comparable figure for whites of one
percent.
</P>
<P>
At technical schools, the figure for Africans rose by 167
percent against 10 percent for whites.
</P>
<P>
Last year there were still nearly twice as many whites with
degrees, 403,000, as there were African, of whom 188,000 had
degrees. Coloreds had 24,000 and Indians 35,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the increase in the levels of education of blacks has
far outstripped the jobs availble, educationists complained. They
urged companies to put training programs in place to help
graduates make the transition from the academic world to the
workplace.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States dollar slipped to
the 110 yen range on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange today as a massive

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Kenya and India has
increased by almost 20 percent in the past few years with India
in favorable, the Kenya Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Indian High Commissioner T.P. Sreenivasan said on Tuesday that
although Kenyan exports to India have risen tremendously over the
same period, the imbalance of trade is in favor of India.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government is ready to work with its Kenyan
counterpart in narrowing the deficit, he said when paying a
courtesy call on Kenyan Health Minister Jackson Mulinge.
</P>
<P>
India is planning to send a team of doctors to Kenya's
Kenyatta National Hospital to assist in grading facilities and
research work in the area of heart treatment, he revealed, adding
that Indian drug manufacturing companies are also ready to set up
units in kenya.
</P>
<P>
"The government of India is willing to cooperate with Kenya in
various fields including the health sector and especially in the
area of pharmaceuticals," he said, lamenting India's low share in
the local pharmaceutical market.
</P>
<P>
Mulinge praised the relations between the two countries,
urging India to provide training opportunities to Kenyan health
personnel.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that India send technicians to Kenya to train
local personnel or sponsor the ministry's staff for short-term
courses in India.
</P>
<P>
Most drugs in use locally in the eastern African country are
imported from India, he noted.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya earned 18 billion Shillings
(about 333 million U.S. Dollars) from tea exports last year,
making the country the largest tea exporter in the world, the
East African Standard newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The total of Kenya's tea earnings stood at 20 billion

The tea production jumped to 257,162 tons in the eastern
African country last year, up 5.2 percent from recorded 244,000
tons in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to favorable weather conditions, timely
application of fertilizer and the improved prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, production of cashew nut has fallen by nearly 60
percent in the country over the past four years.

<HEADLINE> Volkeswagen Sales Up 9.2 Percent Through May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The German carmaker Volkeswagen sold
about 1.8 million vehicles through May this year, an increase of
9.2 percent over the first five months of 1996, the company said
today.
</P>
<P>
Company chairman Ferdinand Piech told a meeting of company
employees in Wolfsburg that the sales in western Europe, however,
dropped by 4.4 percent to 595,000 cars, due to a 10.8 percent
decline in domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the reduced sales in Germany to the upcoming
introduction of a new Golf car, the company's best-selling
model. Orders of the old models would drop as customers usually
awaited the new ones to appear on the market, he added.
</P>
<P>
But Piech noted that the Wolfsburg-based firm remained
Germany's leading carmaker with a 17.8 percent share of the
domestic market.

<HEADLINE> British Envoy on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- British Special Representative
for Cyprus Sir David Hannay stressed here today that the only way
for an agreement on Cyprus issue is through "give-and-Take".
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters before leaving for Athens for
talks with the Greek government, after a three-day visit here,
Sir David noted that "give-and-take" is not a method, but common
sense and the only way that any negotiation can be brought to
agreements.
</P>
<P>
He said that the solution to the Cyprus issue will take time,
because the "subject matter is complex and the issue is sensitive".
</P>
<P>
However, Sir David expressed the hope that it will be possible
to make progress in the early rounds, and that later on there
will be "gradual progress" to arrive at a comprehensive solution
to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he is optimistic, Sir David said he was "very, very
pleased that after a long preparatory process, we have now
reached a point where the U.N. Secretary-General is resuming the
effort to get a formal negotiating solution through face to face
negotiations".
</P>
<P>
He was particularly pleased that the leaders of the two
communities are clearly happy to go along with that and the
governments of both Greece and Turkey are supporting the effort.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his meeting Tuesday night with Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash, Sir David described it as "useful".
</P>
<P>
The talks concentrated on the important issues: how to make the
direct talks, scheduled to begin on July 9 near New York, a
success; what will be the main subjects covered; what the main
pre-occupations on the Turkish Cypriots are; and how to overcome
these problems, the British envoy said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay on the island, Sir David also had two rounds
of talks with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Sir David's visit to Cyprus came one month ahead the
U.N.-sponsored direct talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides for a comprehensive solution to the protracted Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 after Turkish troops
occupied its northern third in the wake of an pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
This is his sixth visit to the island since Sir David was
appointed as British Special Representative for Cyprus in April
1996.
</P>
<P>
After his visit to Athens, the British envoy will fly on
to Ankara to meet Turkish government officials and possibly the
military.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Manila-Singapore Ties Return to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong today wound up his two-day official visit to the Philippines,
bringing to normal the bilateral relations which were almost
severed over the hanging of a Filipino maid in Singapore in 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Goh and President Fidel Ramos explored ways
of strengthening bilateral relations and methods of enhancing
cooperation on trade and investment, socio-cultural projects and
infrastructure development among other concerns of common
interests.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to work out an Action Plan to strengthen
the diplomatic, economic and cultural cooperation between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
They also witnessed the signing of a memorandum of
understanding on cultural cooperation and three economic
agreements between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the talks, President Ramos
said the "turbulence" in Philippine-Singapore relations was
"finally over", adding the two leaders pledged to elevate their
countries' partnership to greater heights of cooperation and
mutual trusts.
</P>
<P>
Goh responded: "We are also glad that the period in our
bilateral relations is finally over. I, therefore, regard this
visit to the Philippines as a very important step towards the
reinvigoration of our ties."
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Singapore and the Philippines
were strained in March 1995 after the hanging of Filipino maid
Flor Contemplacion who was found guilty of murdering a fellow maid
and a four-year-old Singapore boy. Angry Filipinos burnt
Singaporean flags and boycotted Singaporean goods. Manila withdrew
its ambassador to Singapore, which responded by doing the same.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said Singapore and the Philippines fully
restored their diplomatic relations due to the needs of their
political and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and the Philippines were both founders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). After assuming
office in 1992, the Ramos administration turned the emphasis of
its diplomacy policy from the United States to ASEAN and has been
seeking a bigger role in ASEAN affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, its diplomatic disputes with Singapore became a
stumbling block. In the meantime, Singapore was also not
comfortable over the imbroglio. To play more positive roles inside
ASEAN, the two countries must first mend their cracked
relationship, especially when ASEAN is admitting Laos, Cambodia
and Myanmar in July to become a ten-member body which also
includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Both Singapore and the Philippines also noticed that poor
relations hampered their cooperation in trade and investments and
did harm to their respective economic development.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is a financial center in Southeast Asia. Its per
capita income is about 20 times higher than that in the
Philippines. As the country's third biggest trade partner,
Singapore accounts for some 5.6 percent of the Philippines' total
export.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Philippines is no longer "the Sick Man
of Southeast Asia". Its economy has recovered during the past few
years and grew by 6.8 percent last year. Industrial and
agricultural growth are performing well, inflation is slowing down
and financial situation is further improving in the country at the
present time.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the normalization of bilateral relations
was also the outcome of joint efforts by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has six million overseas workers in about 100
countries and regions. Cases of abuses against them have been
increasing in the past two years, prompting the Philippine
government to be more careful in resolving these cases.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, for its part, has adopted more measures to protect
some 80,000 Filipino workers in the city state.
</P>
<P>
Ramos and Goh broke the ice by agreeing to send their
ambassadors back earlier last year. In July last year, the
Philippine president took a further step, lifting the ban on
deploying Filipino workers to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon visited
Singapore, inviting Goh to visit the Philippines at any time.

<HEADLINE> Five S. Leonean Soldiers Executed for Looting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The military authorities in Sierra
Leone executed five soldiers for looting on Tuesday, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said this indicated that the coup leaders have
started taking tough actions against looting and raping, which
has been wild in Freetown since the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Four of the soldiers were executed for trying to loot and rape
nuns at a convent in Freetown, while the fifth for killing a
photographer to get his camera, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council also appealed to
the public to report any soldier found looting or any armed
robbery case to the police.
</P>
<P>
The authorities also ordered the arrest of over 700 prisoners
set free from a Freetown prison during the coup. They suspected
that the prisoners were behind the looting and robbery cases.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Freetown indicated that there have been a wide
spread of lootings after the coup. Among the victims are foreign
nationals and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Sierra Leone was also looted and razed.
About 800 million Leone (nearly one million U.S. Dollars) was
reportedly carted away by the robbers.

<HEADLINE> Zhujiang River linked up A Million Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhujiang River, one of the most
important in south China, existed as a major river one million
years ago, according to a Chinese geologist.
</P>
<P>
Yang Liankang, research fellow with the Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources, drew the conclusion after close study at the
section of linking-up site in Bose in southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Yang discovered that 700,000-year-old crystal aerolites, which
were widely found in south China and Australia, were distributed
at the layer some 105 meters above the bottom of the river bed,
suggesting that the linking-up took place at least 300,000 years
before the formation of the layer.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who spent 151 days this year to tramp along the river,
also found that the origin of the river is at the highest peak of
Mount Maxiong in Qujing in southwest China's Yunnan province,
which is 2,443.9 meters above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
Previously it was thought that the river was initiated at the
mountain foot.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Yang found that the river mouth is not at Humen in
south China's Guangdong province but near Shekou to the south of
Humen, because the water to the south of Humen is still fresh.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the extending of origin and river mouth, the Zhujiang
River must be longer than the previously-thought 2,214 km, Yang
said.
</P>
<P>
Yang is the first Chinese scientist who has tramped along the
Yellow River and the Yangtze River. He has left his footsteps
along five of the seven longest rivers in the world.

<HEADLINE> Africa Needs to Redefine Visions of Development: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A representative of African
countries said at the Asia-Africa forum here today that "to better
orient development, African leaders will have to redefine their
own visions of development in order to improve living conditions
of their population."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of African countries at the opening session
of the three-day Asia-Africa forum which began here today, Rwaka
Constance, permanent secretary of the Rwanda Foreign Ministry,
said although several African countries have embarked on political
and economic reform since 1994, the results are not yet
substantial.
</P>
<P>
She said, "foreign debts continue to increase to a level of 340
billion US dollars for the whole of Africa in 1996 which
represents 76 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 237
percent of the value of export."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she added, savings and investment rates are "far
below those of other developing countries in Asia and Latin
America, while direct foreign investment in all of Africa was only
4.5 billion dollars in 1996, or a mere 5 percent of the total flow
of investment to developing countries."
</P>
<P>
She said, "this forum is an important step towards finding the
means to develop African countries and to establish equitable and
sustainable partnership with the Asian countries which have
achieved remarkable social performances."
</P>
<P>
The forum, the second of its kind, will discuss lessons learned
from successful examples of Asia-Africa cooperation, Africa's
sustainable agricultural developments, food security,
capacity-building and private sector development.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 participants from 65 countries are participating.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the forum will be for reference for the group 7
industrialized countries in their political and economic ties with
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The first Asia-Africa forum was held in Bandung, Indonesia, in
December 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The German carmaker Volkeswagen sold
about 1.8 million vehicles through May this year, an increase of
9.2 percent over the first five months of 1996, the company said
today.
</P>
<P>
Company chairman Ferdinand Piech told a meeting of company
employees in Wolfsburg that the sales in western Europe, however,
dropped by 0.5 percent to 595,000 cars, due to a 10.8 percent
decline in domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the reduced sales in Germany to the upcoming
introduction of a new Golf car, the company's best-selling
model. Orders of the old models would drop as customers usually
awaited the new ones to appear on the market, he added.
</P>
<P>
But Piech noted that the Wolfsburg-based firm remained
Germany's leading carmaker with a 17.8 percent share of the
domestic market.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPPCC Officials Hold Forum on Hong Kong's Return (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- To resolve the Hong Kong question
in accordance with the "one country, two systems" principle will
set a good example for the reunification of the motherland and act
as pioneering work for the peaceful settlement of issues between
countries left over from history.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made here today at a forum by some members of
the Subcommittee of Foreign Affairs under the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Yu Hongliang, a member of the subcommittee, said at the forum
that China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
is of great significance for the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is part of China's territory, but has been occupied
by Britain for more than 150 years. July 1 this year will be an
exciting day for all people of Chinese origin both at home and
abroad, and will be a great milestone in the course of the
motherland's reunification.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the motherland will
be an example to greatly promote the resolution of the Macao issue
and Taiwan issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
From the aspects of economics, subcommittee member Jiang
Guanghua noted, Hong Kong's return will play an important role in
advancing the economic take-off of the Chinese nation. As an
international financial and trading center, Hong Kong for many
years has been making a remarkable contribution to the reform and
opening-up in the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
The great concept of "one country, two systems" is becoming a
great reality, and it will provide great experience with rich
contents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Guanghua expressed his belief that after Hong Kong's
return on July 1, the central government will give fuller scope to
its unique function.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Have Brighter Future: Malaysian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will achieve faster
development and its future will be brighter with support of the
inland areas of China after its return to China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The view was expressed by Malaysia-China Friendship Association
President Usman Awang in a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua
here.
</P>
<P>
Usman Awang said "nowadays, China's position is strong. With
China as its backing and with its development linked with that in
China, Hong Kong, after its return to China, would be able to make
greater progress and would be better developed."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's position as an international financial and trade
center will not only remain but also be further enhanced," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the Asia-Pacific region, Hong Kong is playing an important
role in economic development, and besides, Hong Kong is China's
important gateway, therefore, Hong Kong to be more prosperous will
be "an inevitable outcome", he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Hong Kong will certainly become one of the
most prosperous and richest regions in the world and be one of the
world's very vital economic and financial centers.
</P>
<P>
The association president said some investors who earlier
transferred their investments from Hong Kong to some other places
in the world are now coming back to Hong Kong for investments.
This shows they are confident of Hong Kong to be economically
prosperous in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong would continue to prosper because the Chinese
government has stipulated a series of practical principles and
policies for the region, including "one country, two systems",
which provide a guarantee for a stable and prosperous Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Hong Kong would succeed in implementing these
principles and policies.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated China on its resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and congratulated the Hong Kong people
on their return to the embrace of the motherland.

Xu Kui, another member of the subcommittee, said that the "one
country, two systems" is a pioneering undertaking that contains
the outstanding wisdom of Chinese leaders, and it is a principle
that takes into account the interests of various sides in the
light of Hong Kong's history and reality, and the international
situation as well.
</P>
<P>
Tang Longbin, who had participated in the signing of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration, said at today's forum that the
settlement of Hong Kong question was reached through arduous
efforts following 22 rounds of negotiations between China and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of Hong Kong issue on the basis of "one country,
two systems" principle offers beneficial experience for the
international community to peacefully resolve questions left over
from history by means of negotiation, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee member Wen Yezhan said that China's economic
growth and the increase of its national strength is the basis for
the smooth resumption of its exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
So China should lose no time to accelerate its development and
raise its national strength if it wants to play its due role in
the international community, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Ling Qing, deputy director of the subcommittee, noted that with
Hong Kong's return at hand, China shoulders heavy responsibilities
for ensuring the long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the Basic Law is a cornerstone and a guarantee
to achieve such an objective. Therefore, the Basic Law must be
carried out to the full after July 1, Ling Qing said.

Other members of the subcommittee, including its director Qian

<HEADLINE> Two More Nigerian Warships Sent to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Two more Nigerian naval warships
have been deployed to Sierra Leone to reinforce the on-going
military intervention by the west African peacekeeping force
(ECOMOG) to flush out the coup leadership of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The additional warships, which were confirmed by the navy
authorities on Tuesday, underscored the seriousness of ECOMOG to
restore democracy in Sierra Leone, according to local press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Commander A.M. Umar, a navy spokesman, said in a statement
that Nigeria's flagship NNS Aradu, an all purpose frigate, was one
of the two ships which left the country's territorial waters for
Sierra Leone on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
NNS Ekpe, a fast attack patrol craft, also left early Monday
to complement the arsenal of two other Nigerian naval ships NNS
Ambe and NNS Ekun already there.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear as of last night what specific instructions
had been given to these warships. However it might be a clear
message to the military junta in Sierra Leone led by Major Jonny
Paul Koromah that the Nigeria-led ECOMOG troops wanted nothing
short of total surrender.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for peaceful resolution of the Sierra Leonean
crisis have been underway after the May 25 coup but so far no
report of any development is available.

mission to explain Turkish military incursion into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister is expected to hand over today a message

military incursion into northern Iraq, the Egyptian MENA news

</P>
<P>
Turkish military movement in northern Iraq which started on May

</P>
<P>
Mubarak has previously sent a message to the Turkish leader
voicing his deep concern over the military operation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the statement by Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan Sunday that the Turkish army's 25-day-old operation in

Thousands of Turkish troops, backed by air power, poured into
northern Iraq on May 14 in a cross-border operation against the
outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) bases which were used for
raids into southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish operation was condemned by the Arab League

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Supports UN's Resolution Demanding Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. committee's resolution
demanding Israel to pay compensation for damages in shelling of a
U.N. base in south Lebanon Last year reflected the international
will, Lebanese foreign minister has said.
</P>
<P>
An-Nahar, the most-circulated newspaper in Lebanon, quoted
today Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz as saying that the
"decision of the U.N. General Assembly reflected the international
will on both political and financial matters."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz's statement came in response to U.S. Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns' declaration Tuesday at a news briefing
that the U.N. General Assembly's Administrative and Budgetary
Committee has no authority to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the committee adopted a motion calling on
Israel to pay 1.7 million U.S. dollars for damages and casualties
inflicted on a U.N. peacekeeping force camp at the town of Qana
during the shelling of the compound on April 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
A total of 107 countries voted in favor of the motion, when
Israel and the U.S. voted against it and Russia, Ukraine and
Japan abstained.
</P>
<P>
The money will be part of the 1997-98 budget of the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
Burns said the committee should not be allowed to direct "how
funds for a peacekeeping mission can be spent or cannot be
spent."
</P>
<P>
"It is simply beyond the competence of the committee to make
the decision that they took over the weekend," he said.
</P>
<P>
Details of the speeches delivered during the committee's
debate were released by the U.N. Tuesday, which confirmed that
the U.S. had threatened to link the vote to the renewal of the
UNIFIL's six-month mandate, which comes up for review next
month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. delegate Linda Shenwick was quoted as saying that "the
adoption on the draft would make it hard for Israel or the
United States to support the force."
</P>
<P>
"It would also make it difficult for the United States to
approve the extension of the UNIFIL's mandate next month,"
Shenwick added.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Monday, Boueiz said Lebanon
"strongly rejects any attempt to link the issue of Israeli
compensation to the mandate of the U.N. peace keeping force in the
south (Lebanon)."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital Girds for HK Handover Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- In the run-up to the celebrations
for the Hong Kong handover on July 1, Beijing is taking on a
festive air.
</P>
<P>
Mountains of books about the region have appeared on shelves of
bookstores throughout the city, while exhibitions, concerts and
seminars on the theme cram listings of what's on in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Repair work on Beijing's thoroughfare, Chang'an Avenue, has
been completed 20 days before the big day. Meanwhile, workers are
installing new lights on Tian'anmen Square, where a mass gathering
will be held on the evening of June 30.
</P>
<P>
A sports stadium has been prepared for a huge performance on
July 1. Dancers and singers due to take part were busy rehearsing
yesterday when Beijing mayor Jia Qinglin and other high-ranking
officials came to inspect.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth television broadcast of the extravaganzas
to every corner of the world, Beijing telecommunications workers
are busier than ever before.
</P>
<P>
"We have prepared 13 ground stations and nine transmittance
vehicles for the event -- that will provide a reliable service for
news organizations from more than 30 countries and regions. And 13
communications satellites will operate for the handover," said
Zhao Jidong, deputy director of the Beijing Telecommunications
Administrative Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the municipality has prepared enough fireworks to
make the handover night a colorful one. Among the fireworks
displays, some have been given special names like "the Flower of
Bauhinia," and "The Night of Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
Residents have joined in pre-celebrations by singing songs and
reciting poems in the site of a ruined imperial garden -- Yu Ming
Yuan Park, on the city's northwestern outskirts which was
destroyed in 1900 by the Eight-Power Allied Forces, troops sent by
British, the United States, France and other Western powers, as
well as drawing paintings and playing dramas with the Hong Kong
theme.
</P>
<P>
Many Beijingers are flocking to museums where exhibitions are
being held to remind people of the history of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"In the last 12 days, we received some 50,000 visitors. The
number is unusual in the museum's history," said Guo Junying, an
executive from the Museum of the Chinese Revolution.

<HEADLINE> United Opposition Formed in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Three major Philippine opposition
parties today formally merged to form a united opposition front in
order to beat the powerful ruling Lakas-NUCD party in the May 1998
general elections.
</P>
<P>
A merger agreement was signed this morning by the leaders of
the Laban Ng Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), the Nationalist
People's Coalition (NPC) and the Partido Ng Masang Pilipino (PMP).
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a new opposition party called Laban Ng
Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Common Filipinos)
will be formed after the merger, with Laban chairman Edgardo
Angara and NPC president Ernesto Maceda as its co-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
The new party will choose the opposition standard bearer, with
a full national and local ticket, for the coming May 1996 national
and local elections, the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
But the three parties failed to woo back the People's Reform
Party led by Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago to join the united
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Defensor-Santiago pulled out of the merger talks late last week
after learning about an alleged agreement that the new united
opposition group will choose its presidential candidates only
between Angara and Vice President Joseph Estrada, who led the PMP.
</P>
<P>
But Angara told reporters after the signing ceremony that he
was optimistic that Defensor-Santiago will change her mind and
join the course of the united opposition later.
</P>
<P>
Angara denied there is such an agreement and promised the
selection process for the united opposition's presidential bet
will be fair and open to all presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
He said the new party will register itself with the Commission
on Elections to become a formal political group after it convenes
on August 11 to formulate its constitution and other laws.
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, Maceda, who is also senate
president, said his NPC party will not nominate any presidential
contender but his party will back up any presidential candidate
chosen by the united opposition.
</P>
<P>
Maceda said the new party will win the 1998 presidential polls
because it is "more than a match to the ruling Lakas-NUCD party."
</P>
<P>
According to Maceda, the new party controls 63 seats in the
278-seat bi-cameral Congress, 49 in the House of Representatives
and the rest in the Senate, and has the support of 35 provincial
governors and vice governors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Maceda predicted the governing party led by
President Fidel Ramos is facing the danger of break-up after the
Supreme Court Monday upheld its earlier ruling banning any charter
change to lift the term limit of Ramos through a people's
initiative.
</P>
<P>
With Ramos losing the chance of re-election because of the
court ruling, at least three presidential aspirants of the ruling
party will woo the endorsement of Ramos and thus a breakup of the
party is possible, Maceda said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Down as US Dollar Slides Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended lower
today against the US dollar, pressured by a sharp decline in the
greenback's exchange rate against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The falling US dollar/yen rate had pushed the Australian dollar
to a 10-month low against the yen before some of that weakness
flowed through to the Australian dollar/US rate.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the US dollar fell against the yen in the Asian
time zone as profit takers moved in after the release today of
Japanese current account data, which were in line with
expectations.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed lower at 75.98 US cents compared
to its previous session close at 76.13 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen, it closed at 84.32 yen, down from 86.08 yen
previously.
</P>
<P>
The Australian unit was last seen at these levels against the
yen in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 1.3011 German marks, from 1.3012
marks.

<P>
PARIS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin took on Tuesday three measures to
fulfil the promises he made during the legislative campaign: the
regularization of the situation of thousands of paperless
immigrants, the freezing of a plan to build a railway between
Grenoble and Sisteron in southeastern France, and the designation of
an expert to solve the dispute over Renault's plan to close its
Vilvoorde auto assembly plant in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
-- France's European partners are studying the request by Prime
Minister Jospin to add a chapter on employhment in the Stability and
Growth Pact of the European Union (EU) monetary union. The Dutch
Prime Minister Wim Kok, who is now the president of EU, said Tuesday
in Paris that EU countries could reach a ``very elaborated''
agreement when ending their negotiations on the revision of the
Maastricht treaty during the Amsterdam summit to be held on June 16
and 17.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has agreed to
re-examine the situation of tens of thousands of paperless
immigrants and some 40,000 illegal immigrants are likely to be given
the right to stay in France. The officials of prime minister's
office received a delegation of paperless immigrants Tuesday and
promised to study the files of some 100,000 irregular foreigners
case by case.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac Tuesday gave a hand to Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin by backing the latter's request to add a chapter on
employment and social models into the EU monetary Stability Pact.
While expressing his wish that the Stability Pact could be signed at
the EU Amsterdam summit this weekend, Chirac described the demand by
the Socialist government on further reflection on the pact as
``justifiable.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Minister Hails Egyptian Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Minister of Planning
and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath today praised efforts
exerted by Egypt to salvage the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice of Arab radio, Sha'ath described
Egypt led by President Hosni Mubarak as the "honest guardian of
the Palestinian people's rights."
</P>
<P>
Egypt brokered a meeting between experts of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and Israel here Sunday for the first
time in nearly three months in a bid to break the deadlock
caused by the Israeli move to build new settlement for Jews in
disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
No breakthrough was made at Sunday's meeting, but the
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators agreed to meet in Israel
Thursday again to narrow the wide gap still dividing them.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Mubarak's Advisor Osama el-Baz will go to
Gaza and Tel Aviv to meet with PNA President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu within the framework of
Egypt's sustained efforts to revive the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath reaffirmed the Palestinian position on resuming the
peace talks through a freeze on the Jewish settlement building
including the controversial Har Homa construction on occupied
land at the outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are ready to return to the negotiating
tables if Israel should show readiness to freeze settlement
activities, complete implementation of the Hebron agreement, open
checkpoints between the West Bank and Gaza and release
Palestinian detainees and prisoners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been pressing Israel for a three to six months halt
in settlement building to allow talks on a final resolution of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict to restart.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the Jewish settlement expansion policy
seemed to be deepening Wednesday as Netanyahu rejected the key
Palestinian demand.

<HEADLINE> Incidence of Malaria Down in Southwest China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of malaria has
declined from 249 people per 10,000 in 1953 to 3 per 10,000 in
1996 in southwest China's Yunnan Province, statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Yunnan, a notorious malaria-prevalent region before
1949, have worked hard to discover the characteristics and
mechanism concerning the spreading of malaria under the special
conditions which exist in the province.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Institute of Malaria Prevention, China's only
malaria research organ of its kind, established in 1957, has been
running classes in the past 40 years and has trained more than
2,000 personnel in malaria prevention and treatment.
</P>
<P>
Doctors also popularize knowledge on malaria prevention among
people of various minority groups which are numerous in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the institute has received 56 experts and
researchers from 11 countries on academic exchanges and
cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
The research of the institute has been aided for seven
consecutive years by the World Health Organization.

LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- William Hague, the shadow Welsh secretary, rocketed to the
front in the Conservative leadership contest Monday night after
Peter Lilley and Michael Howard, defeated badly in the first
ballot of the Party's MPs, pulled out and threw their weight
behind him.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Bank of England is likely to raise UK interest rates
above seven percent unless the chancellor restrains consumer
spending by raising taxes in his forthcoming budget, the
Confederation of British Industry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Agreement on a new European Union Treaty may have to be put
off until a second EU summit later this summer because of the
growing crisis over monetary union. Senior diplomats and
politicians believe that the Franco-German dispute over the single
currency "stability pact" may dominate next week's Amsterdam
summit, making agreement on a new treaty to reform the EU's
institutions impossible.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's first motorway bus lane is being planned by the
Labor government as an immediate demonstration of its commitment
to an integrated transport system.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- An inquiry into why poor people die sooner than the rich is
to be launched by the government as part of a drive to highlight

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientist Uses Fish to Kill Mosquitoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli ecologist has
invented a trap which uses an organic solution to attract
mosquitoes which then could be killed by gambusia fish.
</P>
<P>
According to The Jerusalem Report, a bi-weekly magazine, Tzvi
Horesh, a former founder member of the Society for the Protection
of Nature in Israel, has developed the Gambusia Mosquito Trap
which includes enough solution to keep the mosquitoes coming for
six months and four gambusia fish -- a tiny species native to
fresh waters of the eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
The trap -- an opaque plastic tank that must be kept out of
direct sunlight -- is supposed to keep a 100-square-meter area
mosquito free.
</P>
<P>
The fish, also known as the "mosquito fish" because of its
predilection for devouring the bloodsucking insects, require no
other food. They fall into a kind of coma in the mosquito-free
winter, and can be roused by brief exposure to sunlight when
summer comes around.
</P>
<P>
The trap has just gone on sale in Israel at a price of 197
shekels (some 58 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the firm marketing the trap said that the
precise formula for the magic solution is a closely guarded
secret. At present, the trap is for sale only in Israel, but
there are high hopes for marketing abroad in the future.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Welcomes Court Ruling on Charter Change Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Ramos said
today he respected the final ruling of the Supreme Court
prohibiting a charter change movement aimed at extending the term
of the president.
</P>
<P>
The court Tuesday rejected a motion filed by the People's
Initiative for Reform, Modernization and Action (PIRMA), a
pro-Ramos group, for reconsideration of the group's petition to
amend the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"I respect the position taken by the justices and applaud them
for their commitment to the rule of law," Ramos said in a
statement issued during his visit to Clark with Singaporean Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong.
</P>
<P>
"We should now accept the Supreme Tribunal's decision, even as
we should have wanted a contrary ruling in order to uphold the
people's sovereign right as enshrined in the Constitution," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA, launched late last year by Ramos' supporters, has
sought to remove the term limits for all government officials,
including that of the president, by changing the country's 1987
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The existing charter, which was promulgated after the downfall
of former dictatorial president Fernand Marcos, provides for a
single six-year term for the president.
</P>
<P>
Ramos himself has repeatedly indicated that he will step down
when his term of office expires in June 1998.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Agrees to Meet Opposition Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has agreed
to meet opposition parties within three weeks in a bid to
facilitate sustainable democracy in the country, according to
Zambia Daily Mail today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on Tuesday in Sweden, where
representatives from the ruling Movement for the Multi-party
Democracy (MMD) and several opposition parties attended a
roundtable meeting organized by the International Institute for
Democracy and Electoral Assistance.
</P>
<P>
The representatives reached agreements to systematically
approach the short, medium and long-term strategies for building
sustainable democracy in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The roundtable meeting held in Sweden is the first one between
the MMD and the opposition parties since the general elections
held last November.
</P>
<P>
The United National Independence Party (UNIP) led by former
president Kenneth Kaunda boycotted the elections in protest
against the constitutional amendment bill, which in fact barred
Kaunda from running for the presidency because his parents are
foreign immigrants.

<HEADLINE> China's Human Rights Stance Spelled out in Oslo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(Part One)
</P>
<P>
OSLO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The President of the Human Rights
Society of China, Zhu Muzhi, today spelled out China's position on
human rights in a speech at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who heads a delegation from the Chinese human rights
research group, is making a four-nation European tour, which will
also take him to Sweden, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Zhu Muzhi called for dialogue to clear
up misunderstanding on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to Norway this time because we hope to engage in
dialogue with various quarters so as to increase understanding,
clear up misunderstanding, learn from each other's strong points
to offset one's weaknesses in the interests of promoting human
rights," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that differences in the concept of human rights
and other values are only natural and normal since situations in
different countries vary.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to resolve the differences is through
constructive and earnest dialogue, not confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said peace and development are the two most important issues
in the world today and are the issues that the Chinese people care
about most.
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to these two issues, some Western countries
do not know much about China and many misunderstandings exist, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"One rather common argument is that China's economy has been
developing but China is not democratic."
</P>
<P>
But in the view of the Chinese people, he said, developing the
economy is to fulfill the will of the people and economic
development is a manifestation of democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Some countries in the West stress democracy is an individual's
right to express one's views and pursue personal interests. We
believe individual rights are certainly not something that can be
dispensed with, but they are not the entire embodiment of
democracy. Things must be done according to the views and
interests of the majority of the people. That is democracy," Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights and democracy possess both universal and specific
characteristics. Countries face different situations and their
path to achieving democracy is also different.
</P>
<P>
"Today, many countries are following different roads and
practicing different models," he said.
</P>
<P>
The system of people's congresses that China has adopted is
appropriate to China's situation, he said. It guarantees Chinese
people's democratic rights to be masters of their own country and
brings them the greatest benefits.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that China has made rapid development shows that the
system of people's congresses is a democratic model suited to the
situation in China," Zhu said.

WELLINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand sharemarket

A big move of the day was Telecom, whose shares climbed 12
cents to 729 cents and accounted for one third of the market
turnover.
</P>

Other leaders also closed higher or steady. Air New Zealand and
Lion Nathan were both unchanged at 292c and 372c respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
There is another argument in the West which maintains that
China's development constitutes a threat to other countries and
hinders world peace, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The argument is also a consequence of a lack of understanding
of the actual situation in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China takes peace as a precondition for development. China
believes that without peace, there cannot be development."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China is now trying hard to secure a peaceful and
stable domestic and international environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Proceeding from the groundless conclusion that China will
inevitably expand and pose a threat, some people advocate
containing China and not allowing China to develop. This attitude
is rather short-sighted and very dangerous," Zhu commented.
</P>
<P>
Containing China will lead to one of two possibilities. One is
that China cannot be contained and will continue to develop. In
this case, the party imposing the containment policy will
ultimately find itself the victim of its own policy.
</P>
<P>
The other possibility is that as a result of containment, China
once again falls into the tragic situation of poverty,
backwardness, disintegration and continued internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
It would certainly mean disaster for the Chinese people, but it
would do no good to the advocates of the containment policy and
the world at large, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"To begin with, the large Chinese market will
disappear. Hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars worth of trade
will no longer exist while millions and even tens of millions of
refugees will flood into the (outside) world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked for an objective assessment of China's human rights
situation.
</P>
<P>
The progress, or lack of it, in China's human rights
development should be viewed in a historical context. Whether
achievements are the dominant factor, or mistakes and shortcomings
are the dominating issues, the conclusion should be reached by
taking into consideration the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
"Assessment should not be made according to one particular
incident at a particular time. We believe that great achievements
have been made, but there are still many problems and efforts are
being made for further improvement. This is a fair assessment of
the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is not only sincere in improving human
rights within its territory, but also active in protecting human
rights internationally.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people not only value human rights in their own
country but attach great importance to the safeguard and promotion
of international human rights.
</P>
<P>
"China has always respected the principles of promoting human
rights contained in the Charter of the United Nations and other
international documents regarding human rights, such as the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"To date, China has signed seventeen international human rights
conventions. Within the year, China will also sign The
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
"China has been actively participating in UN human rights
activities and making her contributions to the promotion of
international human rights endeavors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's speech was applauded by the audience and was followed by
a question and answer session.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Squeezes Further on Baht Punters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand apparently is
rushing more curbs on foreign speculators who are eager for the
baht to arbitrage, as its earlier bid to stabilize the baht
overseas seemed triggering a backlash on the local stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank Monday imposed measures, what it called
temporary, to bar commercial banks and finance companies from
transferring unpaid shares to foreign accounts, or lending stocks
to foreign investors for speculative short-selling on the Thai
market.
</P>
<P>
It also required banks to use foreign currencies, instead of
the baht, to settle payments to the selling of shares by
foreigners on the Stock of Exchange of Thailand (SET).
</P>
<P>
The central bank introduced a tight baht policy to safeguard
the currency on offshore markets in late May, which successfully
drove the rate of the baht against the U.S. dollar down to around
23.90.
</P>
<P>
However, the policy made a big backlash on the local stock
market where speculators panically sold Thai stocks to obtain the
baht to arbitrage on a significant gap of the rate of the currency
against the dollar between the local and offshore markets, which
drove the SET index dive to an eight-year low last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign speculators converted their dollars into the baht
at the local exchange rate of 25.80 baht to buy Thai stocks and
sell them on the same day to cash in the baht and then shift the
money to offshore markets, like Singapore, where they could buy
back the dollar at 23.90 baht to make profits.
</P>
<P>
Some punters who do not have Thai stocks simply borrowed the
securities from Thai custodians.
</P>
<P>
In a latest circular sent to all banks and finance companies,
the Thai central bank urged the financial institutions to comply
with the new measures, warning that otherwise their foreign
exchange and other businesses will be affected.
</P>
<P>
The circular also said that Thailand has no policy to ban
foreigners from investing in Thai stocks and they were free to
trade and transfer the proceeds abroad but only in foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan
stressed that Thailand had liberalized its financial sector to
help trading and investment, but not speculation.
</P>
<P>
The new measures would remain as long as they were needed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government believed that its latest action could
contain the speculation on the baht on the local market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The First China International
Material Handling and Logistic Equipment Exhibition opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
Attending the exhibition are nearly 100 logistic facility
suppliers from Japan, US, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Germany,
Singapore and China.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which is a part of the ongoing 97' Asia and
Pacific Material Handling Conference, is jointly sponsored by
China's State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), the Ministry
of Internal Trade, and the European Federation of Material Handling
Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, a SETC leading official said
that to upgrade the infrastructure and technical benchmark for
material handling, the Chinese government invested 110 billion
yuan (about 13 billion US dollars) in the sector during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), a five fold increase over
investment during the previous five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996-2000 period, China will focus on developing
industrial cranes, special transportation equipment, and material
handling machines, while importing more advanced logistic equipment.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony of was attended by Xu Penghang, executive
vice minister of SETC, Ma Yimin, chairman of China Association for
Material Handling, and Kurt Meier, secretary general of European
Federation of Material Handling Manufacturers, and senior
officials of concerned ministries.

<HEADLINE> Laid-off Workers Peddle in Street Markets (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Yang Xiaoying, a 40-year-old
woman, left home as usual at 7:00 am. But she didn't push her way
onto a crowded bus taking workers to a state-owned factory, she
got on her bike -- or rather trike -- and headed for a nearby
street market to sell garments.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the woman worked in a sanitary products factory,
but it was forced to close due to poor management. The closure was
a crisis to her at first, but she created an opportunity out of it.
</P>
<P>
Stories like Yang's are not unusual in China these days.
Statistics show that although last year the Chinese government
arranged new jobs for more than two million laid-off workers, even
more redundant workers have to seek new job opportunities for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Yang rented a small stall, less than five meters square,
alongside Shidanan Lu in east Nanchang, the capital of southeast
China's Jiangxi Province, to sell a range of garments: coats,
trousers, T-shirts and belts.
</P>
<P>
"The business here is not bad, I have sold a few things this
morning soon after arriving," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the street market management members of
staff, Guo Jiayuan, some 150 redundant workers have set up stalls
in the market. People call Shidanan Lu a "re-employment street
market."
</P>
<P>
"There are other seven other street markets similar to this one
in Nanchang, and the more traders there are, the cheaper it
becomes for everybody in terms of the taxes levied," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, an average of ten laid-off
workers each day have generated new sources of income for
themselves in these street markets, he added.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the situation two years ago when her factory had just
closed, Yang said that she felt as though the end of the world had
come. "But I soon realized that moaning wouldn't help me: I knew I
had to plan my own future out for myself as early as possible,"
she said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Laid-off Workers Peddle in Street Markets (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to an official source, the majority of Nanchang's
90,000 laid-off workers have found new jobs themselves. Only
20,000 of them are employed in the state sector.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the provincial department of labor shows
that three-quarters of Jiangxi's 400,000 redundant workers have
regained job opportunities through their own efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Such community re-employment channels like the 're-employment
street market' have created many job opportunities for laid-off
workers," said Shi Zhongliang, the president of Jiangxi
Economic and Finance University and an employment researcher.
</P>
<P>
Some sociologists also note that "re-employment street markets"
as a phenomenon indicate an improvement in psychological
conditions of laid-off workers in China.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese workers who used to be secure at work in a life-long
employment system are now facing the reality of the market
competition situation," Qiao Jian, an expert on social relations
of employment, said.
</P>
<P>
Such "re-employment street markets" have also appeared in other
Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
So far, in economically developed Shanghai and east China's
Jiangsu province, more than 400,000 laid-off workers have found
new jobs for themselves. In east China's Zhejiang province,
according to an official source, some 200,000 laid-off workers
will have to find new jobs themselves within the coming three
years.
</P>
<P>
Li Boyong, Minister of Labor, has spoken highly of the
self-employment effort by laid-off workers. He said that the state
will not play a major role in the re-employment process, and more
and more people will have to find jobs by competing in the jobs
market.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the State Statistical Bureau shows that
in the next 15 years demand and supply of labor in China will
remain balanced, with 50 million, or one quarter of the total
employed population, being absorbed by non-public sectors.
</P>
<P>
At present the official unemployment rate in China is three
percent, and the figure will be controlled to under four percent
by the year 2010, a source from the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing to Attract More Investors by Opening Wider: New Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing's newly-elected mayor
Pu Haiqing has vowed to establish a good image of an open
Chongqing and attract more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Pu, who was elected mayor of Chongqing, the fourth municipality
of China, yesterday at the ongoing first session of the Chongqing
Municipal People's Congress, said Local people must build
Chongqing into a fully-open city which should cater to the needs
of other parts of China and the world in its economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Without opening wider and faster development," said the new
mayor, "we cannot attain the goal of enabling local residents live
a prosperous life".
</P>
<P>
Pu, 56, also pledged that Chongqing would be active in
participating in international division of labor and competition,
and in entering domestic and international macro-economic cycling.
</P>
<P>
According to Pu, a new opening pattern will be formed, with
downtown areas as the center, supported by the opening of
national-level economic and technological development zones and
high-tech industrial development zones, as well as the development
of areas along the municipality's expressways and the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
Attracting and using overseas funds will be treated as a
priority of Chongqing's opening drive, said the mayor. He set the
goal for the use of overseas funds at four billion U.S. dollars
during the Ninth Five-Year-Plan Period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, Chongqing signed 108
contracts involving use of overseas funds. During the period, the
city actually brought in 170 million U.S. dollars in overseas
funds, a rise of 23.1 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the city had set up 2,560 overseas-backed
enterprises, involving 2.81 billion U.S. dollars in overseas funds
in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing will increase the sector range making use of overseas
investment, improve efficiency in using overseas funds and
increase guidance over the flow of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile it will start joint ventures or cooperative
businesses with the world's first-rate companies by offering some
profitable projects and selecting key local enterprises for such
partnerships, said the mayor.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has received 173 overseas delegations looking for
investment opportunities since it became China's fourth
municipality on March 14 this year.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Develop "Silicon Valley" in Inchon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A media valley, known as the South
Korean version of the "Silicon Valley", is setting out with the
development of a site in Inchon on its western coast.
</P>
<P>
According to the Inchon City and the Media Valley Planning
Committee, Inchon City is to reclaim offshore land of 3.49 million
square meters by February 1999 and start the construction of
infrastructure projects from the latter part of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The project is due to be completed in 2001 at a cost of 1.94
billion U.S. dollars. The total investment of the media valley,
which will consist of a software park, media park, media academy
and multimedia information center, is estimated at 4 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Inchon City will promote the software park as a base for
domestic and foreign software industries, selling the reclaimed
land at 136 dollars per square meter to companies which will set
up business there.
</P>
<P>
It will also make efforts to attract Asia Pacific Information
Infrastructure (APII) to the multimedia information center, which
is expected to build up as communications-supported headquarters
for a high-speed information communications network.
</P>
<P>
Inchon plans to take special measures to offer land in some
areas without cost in a bid to attract leading foreign companies
and venture businesses.
</P>
<P>
The project's planning committee and Inchon City said that
bringing in the world's leading high-tech firms would be crucial
to the success of media valley, adding that this would necessitate
the government's enactment of preferential policies. Incentives
offered to companies would include easing of administrative
regulations and tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, companies wishing to move into the media valley
site include large-sized companies, such as Hyundai, Daewoo, LG,
Hansol and other mid-sized companies.

<HEADLINE> Petrol Prices Hiked in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The prices of petroleum products
were increased by 24 percent today by the Zambia National Oil
Company (ZNOC).
</P>
<P>
While explaining the price increase, a ZNOC spokesman said
that the earlier prices did not reflect the international prices
obtained in the market, and this had resulted in under recovery
costs by the company.
</P>
<P>
"There is also need to reflect the extra tax introduced in
this conversion of fuel levy as duty on the wholesale price," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The ZNOC hiked the prices of petroleum products in
December, 1996, by 15 percent due to the depreciation of the
local currency Kwacha against international currencies and the
increase of the international prices of petroleum products.

<P>
KAMPALA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan authorities have
released 234 rebels of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), the New

</P>
<P>
The freed WNBF members had surrendered since March this year,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Colonel Nathan Katagara, the 409 Brigade Commander, said

the government will create job opportunities for the released
through non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Donato Amabua, a local council official of Aura, asked the
former WNBF members to report to local authorities.

WNBF is a crippled rebel group which was acting in the
northwest and had bases in southern Sudan. Its main forces were
eliminated in southern Sudan by the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army in March.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said some 200 remnants of WNBF joined the
Lord's Resistance Army, another rebel group of Uganda acting in

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Prakash
Chandra Lohani has withdrawn his support to Prime Minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand's ruling coalition by tendering
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Lohani, who is from Chand's National Democratic Party (RPP),
told an urgently-called press conference here today that he had
handed his resignation to the prime minister to protest against
the crimes during the local elections last month.
</P>
<P>
Reading out his resignation letter at the press conference,
Lohani accused the prime minister of failing to protect the
interests of the National Democratic Party (RPP) in the local
polls.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear whether the prime minister has
accepted the resignation.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition the Nepali Congress (NC) has alleged that
workers of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML), the biggest party of the ruling coalition, resorted to
widespread illegal activities including threat, intimidation and
rigging to secure a landslide victory in the local polls.
</P>
<P>
Lohani told reporters that Indian Prime Minister I. K. Gujral's
visit to Nepal last week caused the delay of his resignation.
</P>
<P>
He said that he joined the government three months ago at the
request of Prime Minister Chand, who is also the parliamentary
party leader of the RPP party.
</P>
<P>
Chand formed the present government with the participation of
the CPN-UML in March when he managed to topple a NC-led government
by withdrawing his party from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Rumors here said that NC party leaders were making efforts to
lure away some ministers from the ruling coalition in order to
bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Foreign Minister Lohani, who held the same
post in the former NC-led government, indicated that Chand's
three-month-old government would face a crucial challenge in the
near future, political analysts here said.

</P>
<P>
This is the fourth course of such training.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government for years has made efforts for gender
balance in education, management and government services. However,

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Omani Sultan's Special Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today that China is ready to forge a long-term, stable, and
comprehensive cooperative relationship with Oman for the next
century, on the existing basis of current bilateral links.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark this morning during his meeting with
Thuwainy Bin Shihab Al-Said, a special representative of Oman's
Sultan Qabus Bin Said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that peace and development are the two major topics
facing the current world as it moves towards multi-polarization,
Jiang said both China and Oman are developing countries and that
they are concentrating their efforts on safeguarding peace and
developing their economies.
</P>
<P>
The two countries understand each other politically and their
economies are strongly complementary, thus leaving huge potential
for further cooperation, added Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that continued consolidation and development
of bilateral friendship and cooperation are in the fundamental
interests of the two peoples, and maintaining them will constitute
a contribution to both regional and world peace.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed the visitors on China's accomplishments in
its reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Oman and China have maintained good long-term cooperative
relations, Thuwainy said, and they have all along understood and
supported each other in both bilateral issues and those in
international arenas such as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Oman thanks China for its political and economic support and
assistance, and hopes that there can be more progress to
benefit bilateral friendship and cooperation, added Thuwainy.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his country's early congratulations on the
coming return of Hong Kong, wishing China continuous development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked Thuwainy to convey his regards to Sultan Qabus,
saying that the latter was welcome to visit China at a time
convenient to the Sultan.
</P>
<P>
Thuwainy said that Sultan Qabus, who attaches great importance
to Oman-China relations, will be glad to accept Jiang's invitation
and realize a China visit as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> China's Human Rights Stance Spelled Out in Oslo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The President of the Human Rights
Society of China, Zhu Muzhi, today spelled out China's position on
human rights in a speech at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who heads a delegation from the Chinese human rights
research group, is making a four-nation European tour, which will
also take him to Sweden, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Zhu Muzhi called for dialogue to clear up
misunderstanding on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to Norway this time because we hope to engage in
dialogue with various quarters so as to increase understanding,
clear up misunderstanding, learn from each other's strong points
to offset one's weaknesses in the interests of promoting human
rights," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that differences in the concept of human rights
and other values are only natural and normal since situations in
different countries vary.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to resolve the differences is through
constructive and earnest dialogue, not confrontation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted peace and development are the two most important issues
in the world today and are the issues that the Chinese people care
about most.
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to these two issues, some Western countries
do not know much about China and many misunderstandings exist, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"One rather common argument is that China's economy has been
developing but China is not democratic."
</P>
<P>
But in the view of the Chinese people, he said, developing the
economy is to fulfill the will of the people and economic
development is a manifestation of democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Some countries in the West stress democracy is an individual's
right to express one's views and pursue personal interests. We
believe individual rights are certainly not something that can be
dispensed with, but they are not the entire embodiment of
democracy. Things must be done according to the views and
interests of the majority of the people. That is democracy," Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights and democracy possess both universal and specific
characteristics. Countries face different situations and their
path to achieving democracy is also different.
</P>
<P>
"Today, many countries are following different roads and
practicing different models," he said.
</P>
<P>
The system of people's congresses that China has adopted is
appropriate to China's situation, he said. It guarantees Chinese
people's democratic rights to be masters of their own country and
brings them the greatest benefits.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that China has made rapid development shows that the
system of people's congresses is a democratic model suited to the
situation in China," the scholar said.
</P>
<P>
There is another argument in the West which maintains that
China's development constitutes a threat to other countries and
hinders world peace, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The argument is also a consequence of a lack of understanding
of the actual situation in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China takes peace as a precondition for development. China
believes that without peace, there cannot be development."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China is now trying hard to secure a peaceful and
stable domestic and international environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Proceeding from the groundless conclusion that China will
inevitably expand and pose a threat, some people advocate
containing China and not allowing China to develop. This attitude
is rather short-sighted and very dangerous," Zhu commented.
</P>
<P>
Containing China will lead to one of two possibilities. One is
that China cannot be contained and will continue to develop. In
this case, the party imposing the containment policy will
ultimately find itself the victim of its own policy.
</P>
<P>
The other possibility is that as a result of containment, China
once again falls into the tragic situation of poverty,
backwardness, disintegration and continued internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
It would certainly mean disaster for the Chinese people, but it
would do no good to the advocates of the containment policy and
the world at large, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"To begin with, the large Chinese market will disappear.
Hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars worth of trade will no
longer exist while millions and even tens of millions of
refugees will flood into the (outside) world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked for an objective assessment of China's human rights
situation.
</P>
<P>
The progress, or lack of it, in China's human rights
development should be viewed in a historical context. Whether
achievements are the dominant factor, or mistakes and shortcomings
are the dominating issues, the conclusion should be reached by
taking into consideration the overall situation.
</P>
<P>
"Assessment should not be made according to one particular
incident at a particular time. We believe that great achievements
have been made, but there are still many problems and efforts are
being made for further improvement. This is a fair assessment of
the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is not only sincere in improving human
rights within its territory, but also active in protecting human
rights internationally.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people not only value human rights in their own
country but attach great importance to the safeguard and promotion
of international human rights.
</P>
<P>
"China has always respected the principles of promoting human
rights contained in the Charter of the United Nations and other
international documents regarding human rights, such as the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"To date, China has signed seventeen international human rights
conventions. Within the year, China will also sign The
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
"China has been actively participating in UN human rights
activities and making her contributions to the promotion of
international human rights endeavors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's speech was applauded by the audience and was followed by
a question and answer session.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India Sign MOUs for Cement Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Four private companies of Bangladesh
and India signed two Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) here
Tuesday, under which two cement factories would be set up in both
countries, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The two joint ventures, each with an annual production capacity
of 100,000 tons, will be established in either Rajshahi or Sylhet
district of Bangladesh and Meghalaya of India, in order to meet
demands of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The MOUs signing ceremony was witnessed by ASM Quasem,
president of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) and
HS Kumbhat, leader of the delegation of the Federation of
Industries of North Eastern Region (FINER) of India.
</P>

the long common border between Bangladesh and India's northeastern
region was providing ample scope for closer trade and economic
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result of trade liberalization policy in Bangladesh, India
has become one of the greatest beneficiaries with its increasing
exports to this country from 145.32 million U.S. dollars in
1989-90 to 1.1 billion dollars in 1995-96, Quasem said.
</P>
<P>

million dollars to 72.35 million dollars during the same time.

42-member delegation of businessmen in Bangladesh, also expressed
the hope that the signing of MOUs would pave the way for further
cooperation in trade and business between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Economic Summit to Focus on Africa and Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Promoting economic development
in Africa and integrating Russia into the global economy will be
the major goals for this year's annual economic summit of G-7,
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the world's seven richest industrial countries --
the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy --
will hold the 23rd summit in Denver on June 20-22. Russian
President Boris Yeltsin for the first time will join the
discussions from the beginning of the summit.
</P>
<P>
"In an era of globalization where national borders no longer
define the boundaries of economies, we can use our position to
encourage the free flow of goods, capital, technology and
ultimately wealth across the globe," he said in a speech prepared
for delivery to the summit.
</P>
<P>
On Africa, he said the Denver summit is expected to explore
ways to alleviate poverty by promoting economic growth and trade.
</P>
<P>
"Approximately 600 million people or one-tenth of the world's
population have yet to fully participate in the global economy and
reap the benefits of integration," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that "the deepening of Russia's engagement in the
summit process reflects Russia's increased stature on the world
stage and its heightened commitment to work in close partnership
with the seven."
</P>
<P>
The summit leaders would also review efforts to reduce threats
to global financial markets to prevent future financial crises
such as the one that engulfed Mexico when it was forced to devalue
its currency in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Summers said that the Clinton administration would use this
summit to showcase the opportunities presented with the end of
the Cold War and spread of free markets around the globe.

<HEADLINE> Fugitive Sicilian Mafia Boss Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A suspected leading drug trafficker
of the Sicilian Mafia was arrested Monday in France in a joint
French-Italian police operation after two years on the run, police
said today.
</P>
<P>
In the latest of a string of arrests netting top fugitives of
Cosa Nostra, Francesco Paolo Albamonte, 35, was detained in
Toulon, a southern French port, after a tip-off from Italy's
paramilitary police.
</P>
<P>
Albamonte was suspected to be a leading lieutenant of jailed
Mafia "super boss", Salvatore "Toto (the beast)" Riina, in charge
of a cocaine smuggling ring with South American countries.
</P>
<P>
He did not put up resistance while being found at a gas station
in central Toulon. French police found false documents and
identification papers with him, which had allowed him to travel
through European and South American airports.
</P>
<P>
Albamonte allegedly controlled Riina's international drug
operations including quality control at production and
transport. The international arrest warrant said he was involved
in an international drug ring dismantled in Britain several months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Italian police arrested a suspected No.2 Mafia
leader, Pietro Aglieri and two other fugitive convicted killers in
Palermo, Italy. These are the latest blows to Cosa Nostra in a
police campaign starting from the capture of Riina in 1993.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House of Representatives to Vote on Flag Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- As the U.S. House of
Representatives set to vote on a constitutional amendment banning
flag burning Thursday, a poll indicates most Americans favor such
a measure.
</P>
<P>
"This amendment has received resounding support around the
country," said Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon, who
co-authored the amendment. He said the measure, with 285
co-sponsors, will reach the House floor Thursday, two days before
Flag Day.
</P>
<P>
The recent telephone survey showed that 81 percent of
registered voters would vote for a constitutional amendment to
protect the flag from desecration and burning, Neal Rhoades of
Wirthlin Worldwide told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must win
two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate, followed by
ratification by three-quarters of the states.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in 1989 ruled that burning the U.S. flag is
protected free speech, invalidating statutes in 48 states.
Congress then passed a law protecting the flag, but the Supreme
Court found that unconstitutional in 1990. Then Congress tried but
failed to get two-thirds majority votes for a constitutional
amendment.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the House passed, 312-120, an amendment to let
Congress and the states establish laws protecting the flag, but
the Senate fell short, 63-36.
</P>
<P>
This year's amendment, which cleared the House Judiciary
Committee on a 20-9 vote on May 14, would give only Congress "the
power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the
United States."

WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Continuing the recent upward
surge in bankruptcy filings, Americans filed a record 335,073
bankruptcies in the first three months of this year, a report
released by the American Bankruptcy Institute (ABI) said today.
</P>
<P>
This peak represents an increase of 26 percent over the same

mark a new record in bankruptcy filings.
</P>
<P>
Non-business bankruptcy filings, which stand at 96 percent of
total filings, recorded 321,242 in the first quarter, an increase
of 27.1 percent over the same quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Consumer filings for calendar year of 1996 eclipsed the 1
million mark for the first time in history.
</P>

Total bankruptcy filings in the U.S. have more than doubled
during the past decade with only 530,436 petitions filed in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Hungary to Seek More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will continue to
encourage foreign investment regardless of the outcome of the 1998
general election, Prime Minister Horn Gyula said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hungary wants to establish long-term cooperation with foreign
investors who have already set up projects in the country and that
his government will be open to proposals, he told a foreign
investment conference in the capital.
</P>
<P>
One of the government's main priorities is to speed up
infrastructure development across the country, he told the
meeting, attended by senior government officials and domestic and
foreign business executives.
</P>
<P>
Privatization has now been completed in the main sectors of the
economy and agriculture, which has been in severe difficulties
over the last few years, should now start to recover later this
year or early next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Privatization Minister Csiha Judit told conference delegates
that Hungary has attracted foreign investment totaling 16 billion
U.S. dollars over the last few years, of which five to six billion
dollars came through privatization.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of state enterprises by foreign investors has
been a major feature of Hungary's privatization process.
</P>
<P>
But she said that although the program had drawn close to an
end, remaining state properties would not be sold off at bargain
prices.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Seeks National Consensus on Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is seeking
a consensus among major political parties over its 1950 treaty
with India, which is expected to be reviewed by the two
governments within two months, the local press here said today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Kumar Gyawali has written letters to the
political parties asking them for recommendations on the question
of reviewing the 1950 Nepal-India Peace and Friendship Treaty,
newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The letters to all parties represented in parliament were sent
out last Sunday, one day after Indian Prime Minister I. K. Gujral
concluded his three-day official visit here, according to a
Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
During his recent stay in Nepal, the Indian prime minister and
his Nepali counterpart Lokendra Bahadur Chand directed that all
bilateral issues including those relating to the 1950 treaty be
discussed at the next foreign secretary level meeting within two
months.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nepali side is still perplexed with what exact
clauses of the treaty should be reviewed although the two
governments have agreed to review it after Nepal's persistent
demand during recent years, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India agreed for the first time in early 1995 to
review the controversial treaty after criticism arose from all
sides in Nepal describing the treaty as outdated.
</P>
<P>
Critics here said that some of the treaty's clauses infringe on
Nepal's sovereignty and also fail to reflect the changing times.
</P>
<P>
The treaty provides for special bilateral relations between the
two countries. For example, citizens of one country should be
given national treatment in the other one when conducting economic
activities and they should enjoy privileges in residence,
ownership of property and participation in trade and commerce.
</P>
<P>
India earlier had maintained that the 1950 treaty would either
be retained entirely or abolished in accordance with its
provision, ruling out any possibility of revision.
</P>
<P>
With the no-revision provision of the 1950 treaty, Nepal and
India might review the treaty and turn it into a new one which
requires ratification by parliament, a high-ranking Foreign
Ministry official said.

would not be among the first batch of applicants to join NATO, it
could be among the second.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- About 200 Tamil rebels and
government soldiers Tuesday were killed when rebels of the
liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) launched a massive attack
on military defense positions at Vavuniya in the Northern Province
of Sri Lanka, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
About 500 to 700 LTTE rebels stormed the military positions
with heavy artillery in a six hour battle. The military were
finally able to repulse the attack.
</P>
<P>
The reports said around 70 soldiers and 60 civilians were
killed and many others injured in the action while at least 60
rebels were killed and over 150 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were able to cause heavy material losses. They blew
up an army ammunition dump that exploded when a mortar landed
during fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least three armored fighting vehicles were
among the millions of rupees worth of armaments lost during
Tuesday's battle which is considered the biggest attack against
government troops by the LTTE so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, having approached the defense from the western
flank of the main road, attempted to destroy the headquarters and
the artillery gun position in Vavuniya area. The aim of the LTTE
had been to destroy the headquarters to disrupt the ongoing
military operation by the troops in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
On May 13, government forces launched a major offensive
code-named "Jaya Sikuru" (Certain Victory) with the intention of
capturing 75 kilometers of roadway on the main highway from
Vavuniya to Jaffna through the rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
To date, the forces have been able to recapture only 16
kilometers with rebel resistance building up as the troops inch
their way forward.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a war for a separate state in the
north and east of the country since 1983.

BANGKOK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has decided to
take tough actions against protesters who use violent or illegal
means to gain concessions for their demands.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the weekly cabinet meeting Tuesday

</P>
<P>
Officials of the Interior Ministry at all levels nationwide
have been ordered to take action whenever and wherever protesters
resorted to violent or illegal means.

Protesters who wanted to bargain for something would have to
gather in an orderly manner or send representatives to negotiate
with officials, Thai Interior Minister Sanoh Thienthong was quoted
as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there had been a total of 63 protest
demonstrations in the past five months around the country,

<HEADLINE> 200 Rebels, 70 Soldiers Killed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- About 200 Tamil rebels and 70 army
 soldiers Tuesday were killed when rebels of the liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) launched a massive attack on military
defense positions at Vavuniya in the Northern Province of Sri
Lanka, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
About 500 to 700 LTTE rebels stormed the military positions
with heavy artillery in a six hour battle. The military were
finally able to repulse the attack.
</P>
<P>
The reports said around 70 soldiers and 60 civilians were
killed and many others injured in the action while about 200
rebels were killed and over 150 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The rebels were able to cause heavy material losses. They blew
up an army ammunition dump that exploded when a mortar landed
during fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least three armored fighting vehicles were
among the millions of rupees worth of armaments lost during
Tuesday's battle which is considered the biggest attack against
government troops by the LTTE so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, having approached the defense from the western
flank of the main road, attempted to destroy the headquarters and
the artillery gun position in Vavuniya area. The aim of the LTTE
had been to destroy the headquarters to disrupt the ongoing
military operation by the troops in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
On May 13, government forces launched a major offensive
code-named "Jaya Sikuru" (Certain Victory) with the intention of
capturing 75 kilometers of roadway on the main highway from
Vavuniya to Jaffna through the rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
To date, the forces have been able to recapture only 16
kilometers with rebel resistance building up as the troops inch
their way forward.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a war for a separate state in the
north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> China Could Be Largest Basketball Market: NBA Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SALT LAKE CITY, June 10 (Xinhua) -- As some 650 million people
around the world watched the Chicago Bulls to be tied by the Utah
Jazz in the NBA finals, NBA commissioner David Stern is looking
further beyond the Pacific Ocean for the future.
</P>
<P>
"I think, China could develop the largest basketball market in
the world," Stern told Xinhua in an interview on Monday during the
1996-97 NBA finals here. "And sometime in the next four or five
years we may hold a NBA regular season game in China.
</P>
<P>
"Before the regular game goes there, we may have some
exhibition games in China."
</P>
<P>
The NBA boss still remembered his first visit to China in the
year of 1989 when he made the first TV contract with China's
nationalwide TV station -- the CCTV. And the NBA games soon
attracted a lot of fans in the country.
</P>
<P>
"That's what really happened in the United States, and the same
thing we experienced in Europe. When more NBA games on television,
people, especially young children, became to love it every where
in the world." Stern said.
</P>
<P>
Stern, who became the NBA commissioner in 1984, has guided the
league to chang "from a small business to a business all around
the world."
</P>
<P>
The total NBA revenue equals 192 million U.S. dollars in 1984
while the gross retail sales of NBA products was over 30 billion
U.S. dollars in the 1996, according to NBA Properties release.
</P>
<P>
Stern considered the largest population of 1.2-billion people,
the rapid development of economic and the improvement of people's
living standards as the three main factors for China to build its
own basketball pro-market.
</P>
<P>
China has been dominating Asian basketball for the last two
decades. The Chinese men's team just made a breakthrough to take
the ever best eighth place in the Atlanta Olympic Games. The
Chinese women's side was silver medalist both at the 1992
Barcelona Olympic Games and the 1994 world championship.
</P>
<P>
During halftime interval at the NBA finals game two last
Friday, Stern called from Chicago to Hong Kong to greeting a NBA
Finals Party which was attended by some 150 local reporters.
</P>
<P>
"That was the only place I called during the Finals and I even
had a video message to the people there before the game started,"
said Starn, who believed that the Asian, especially China, is the
most important goal in NBA's development of international
initiative.
</P>
<P>
NBA has opened offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Melbourne and other
oversea cities.
</P>
<P>
Stern thought the handover of Hong Kong to China on July 1
would bring NBA closer to China.
</P>
<P>
"We've already had very good relationship with the Chinese
Basketball Association (CBA) and we looking forward to increase
the relationship betwee the NBA and CBA," Stern said.
</P>
<P>
China has started two professional men's basketball leagues in
the last two years and Starn believed "the CBA and NBA can work
with each other to arrange visits" by teams from both sides.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is full of confidence in
developing an all-round cooperation with China, Ukrainian Prime
Minister Pavel Lazarenko said during his meeting with visiting
Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian here today.
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and Ukraine has reached 846 million
U.S. dollars in 1996 and is expected to climb to one billion
dollars this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the Ukrainian economy would stop slipping and
start to recover at the end of 1997. The prime minister said
Ukraine could control the decrease of its production within 9
percent in 1997, compared with 47 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Ukraine has successfully curbed inflation, which stood
at 5.2 percent in the first five months this year, down from 37
percent in 1996 and 230 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko stressed it is a priority for Ukraine to develop
trade ties with China. He hoped that leaders of both countries
would make concerted efforts to lift bilateral relations to the
level of strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who arrived here on June 6 for a five-day visit, said that
military cooperation should go as fast as trade links between the
two countries. He emphasized that the cooperation between Beijing
and Kiev would contribute to regional and global stability.

JAKARTA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign investment
dropped 36 percent in the first five months this year to 13.7
billion U.S. dollars from 18.38 billion dollars in the
corresponding period of last year, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
However, "there is nothing to worry about because what has been
achieved so far has exceeded the achievement in the last five-year
development plan (1990 to 1994) period," State Minister for
Investment Affairs Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the Investment Ministry today,
Sanyoto attributed the drop of foreign investment to the effect of
the May 29 general election in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Investors take a wait and see stand to see which party emerges
as the winner in the elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he believed the situation would recover by

election.

<HEADLINE> Rural Economy Grows Fast In Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Province in northeast
China is making the most of its grain production, animal
husbandry, and farm produce and by-products processing, to bring
agriculture to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
The province, one of China's major grain producers, set a
record high in grain production last year with 23.2 billion kg,
and its farmers had 2,100 yuan of annual income per capita, up 30
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Good harvests for years running have in turn promoted livestock
raising as well as agricultural products processing.
</P>
<P>
Its animal husbandry produced 11 billion yuan in output value
last year, and increased the value of more than five billion kg of
maize, a significant proportion of which was consumed by
animals. As a result, Jilin raised 18 million pigs to have enough
meat for people in the province, and some to spare for sale
outside Jilin.
</P>
<P>
The province, although known as a granary in north China, was
short of meat, and had to import pigs from south China. But now it
has become an important pig production base, and sells pork
elsewhere on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
Jilin is increasing efforts to turn grain resources into
profit, and has invested more than a billion yuan into developing
farm produce and by-products processing industry.
</P>
<P>
Its starch, alcohol, seasonings, and other products now take a
lion's share of the domestic market, and have begun to sell on the
world market. A company mainly engaged in chicken production
collected two billion yuan in sales value last year, with exports
totaling 70 million US dollars.

observers who will be sent by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to oversee the poll, informed
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Albania is to hold elections in a bid to end the crisis in the
country following an anti-government rebellion earlier this year
triggered by the failure of bogus investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
The ruling committee also agreed to recommend to the
U.N. Security Council the extension of the MPF's presence in the
troubled Balkan republic for another 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Although the multinational force is sponsored by the OSCE, its
current mandate, which expires on June 28, is authorized by the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Council is expected to make a decision around June 26 on
whether the force will continue to stay in Albania after the
elections, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Car Sales Down in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of passenger cars sold
in the Philippines went down 5.8 percent in the first five months
this year to 33,912 units from last year's 35,995 units, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In May alone, passenger car sales reached only 6,603 units,
10.2 percent lower than the 7,357 units the major local assemblers
sold for the same month last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the
Philippines Inc., the decrease was due to a slowdown in bank
processing of car loans and the market anticipation of the
introduction of new car models.
</P>
<P>
Data released by the chamber also showed that sales of all top
four car brands reached only 4,870 units in May, 16.4 percent
lower than their year ago level of 5,829.
</P>
<P>
Honda remained the country's top car brand last month, but the
1,478 cars sold by Honda Cars Phils. Inc. represented a 25.2
percent drop from the 1,977 cars it sold for the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
The sales figures of local car assemblers serve as a major
economic indicator. Economists use it to measure the growth of the
middle class.

<HEADLINE>   Cold Wave Threatens Coffee Harvest in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian coffee harvests
could be affected by a recent cold wave in the southeastern state
of Minas Gerais, the biggest coffee-growing region in Brazil, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Low temperatures are continuing and may produce the same
phenomenon occurred in 1994 when extremely cold weather affected
the 1995 production. Coffee production fell by 15.8 percent
between 1994-95 after dropping from 2.6 million in 1994 to 1.9
million tons in 1995, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The "El Nino" phenomenon was first observed in the country in
February, causing heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
The state of Minas Gerais produces half of the coffee grown in
Brazil which is the world's largest coffee producer.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Vaccine Offers Hope for Skin Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- An effective treatment for the
most deadly form of skin cancer, melanoma, could be on the horizon
after promising tests on a vaccine by Melbourne researchers.
</P>
<P>
In a recent trial, the vaccine halted or reversed the progress
of melanoma in more than 50 percent of patients with an advanced,
and usually fatal, form of the disease, local newspaper the Age
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough, to be unveiled at a melanoma conference in
Sydney today, could offer the first real hope of conquering a
disease that kills almost 1,000 Australians a year.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine was jointly developed by researchers at the Ludwig
Oncology Unit at the Austin Hospital and scientists from Belgium
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jonathan Cebon, director of the Ludwig unit, said the
European scientists had identified a series of proteins present on
melanoma cells which, when injected back into the patient,
stimulated an immune response that attacked the cancer.
</P>
<P>
The Melbourne researchers, working with the European
scientists, tested the proteins, which are called antigens, in
patients with advanced melanoma.
</P>
<P>
They found that the immune response was particularly strong
when the melanoma antigens were injected back into the patients
with a hormone known to enhance the immune response.
</P>
<P>
Out of 28 patients in the trial, two experienced complete
remission, two had partial remission and in 11 the progress of the
disease was halted. Thirteen of the patients progressed to more
serious disease and death.
</P>
<P>
Professor Cebon said the vaccine-hormone treatment may be more
effective against melanoma in its early stages than when the
cancer had already spread.
</P>
<P>
The professor predicted clinical trials of a melanoma vaccine
within a decade.
</P>
<P>
Success against melanoma would probably be achieved by a
combination of vaccines and other immune-enhancing therapies, in
the same way that HIV patients were showing improvements with a
cocktail of drugs rather than a single type of treatment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Attitude on Human Rights, Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's support for Australia's
push into Asia has been thrown into doubt by Canberra's handling
of sensitive issues such as human rights and Asian immigration, a
top Japanese official was quoted today as saying.
</P>
<P>
The comments by a senior adviser to Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto are the first signal that Japan is imposing
conditions on its support for Australia in key Asian political
forums, an unprecedented move in the post-war relationship, the
Australian Financial Review reported.
</P>
<P>
Until now Japan has been the most consistent supporter of
Australia's drive for a greater political role in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The official, from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
made it clear that Australia's handling of issues, such as
Australia's opposition to Myanmar's entry into the Association of
Southeast Asian Naitons (ASEAN) and belated government's response
to the immigration debate sparked by MP Pauline Hanson, had
prompted the change in attitude.
</P>
<P>
Debate among senior Japanese officials about Australia's
attitude to Asia had also prompted a significant change in the key
speech delivered by Hashimoto during his visit to Australia in
April, removing references to Australia's tradition of "liberalism
and democracy".
</P>
<P>
The official said Australia could not rely on Japan's
unqualified backing for its participation in the Asia-Europe
Meeting forum (ASEM), the key group for political and economic
dialogue between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
ASEM brings together the leading Asian and European economies
and has become a touchstone for measuring Australia's success in
seeking greater engagement with Asia, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed surprise at the way in which the debate over
Pauline Hanson's comments has been allowed to drag on and not
dealt with quickly by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
The official referred to Australia's opposition to Myanmar's
entry into the ASEAN as an example of the greater sensitivity
required in dealing with Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We were embarrassed when Australia opposed Myanmar's entry
into ASEAN and the way it was handled," he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Corolla Cars to March into Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Toyota Motor Corp is
introducing a new series of cars into the Chinese market, the
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new Corolla cars, Toyota's global sales champion, are
making their debut at the seventh Shanghai International
Automotive Industry Fair which opens yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Corollas will be the stars of the fair, said Koji Hasegawa, a
Toyota director and board member.
</P>
<P>
The annual vehicle fair, a festival for thousands of Chinese
auto fans and a showcase for international and domestic auto
producers, is held alternately in Beijing and Shanghai cities.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, Ford, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen, Chrysler and
Hyundai are all represented at the auto show, which will run
through June 16.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa said the new Corollas, equipped with 1.6-liter and
1.3-liter engines to meet China' market demands, will be in
showrooms this month. There will be six models available.
</P>
<P>
Although imported cars have not sold well in China during the
past couple of years and few believe a substantial pick-up will
appear this year, Hasegawa is "optimistic about the sales prospects
of the new cars,"
</P>
<P>
But he said that much work needs to be done in the Chinese
market before an accurate sales forecast for the new vehicles can
be drawn.
</P>
<P>
This is the eighth generation of Corollas since 1966.
</P>
<P>
The cars are now manufactured in 15 countries, Hasegawa said,
noting that cars sold to China will be made in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the fair are Toyota's new 1.3-liter 8A-FE
engine with its latest technology for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Toyota invested in an engine project last May in Tianjin, with
a registered capital of 24.8 million US dollars. Its 24 component
joint ventures in China give the company a strong footing in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa said Toyota plans to launch a passenger car project in
Tianjin with Chinese partners.

<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
continue to ensure a fresh water supply to Hong Kong as it has
done for the last 32 years, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted vice-premier Jiang Chunyun as saying that
the move will help maintain the territory's booming economy and
prosperity after it returns to the motherland on July 1 of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called upon 1,500 project workers to contribute more to
welcome the handover by working hard and ensuring the fresh water
supply, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 70 percent of Hong Kong's fresh water used by
its more than six million residents and industries depend on a
water supply project launched 32 years ago by the central
government, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, the project has supplied nearly 10
billion cubic meters of fresh water to Hong Kong, the paper
added.

<P>
ROME, June 10 (Xinhua) -- French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten
of Brazil was back in action after a day's rest with an easy
doubles victory Tuesday playing with compatriot Fernando Meligeni.
</P>
<P>
They defeated Argentine and Mexican qualifiers Marcelo

<P>
He was quoted as saying that he celebrated his French Open
title with his family who had travelled to France. "But then I
went to bed early and went to sleep immediately. I stayed calm."

<HEADLINE> Fossilized Birds Unearthed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
unearthed 23 fossilized birds believed to be 150 million years old
in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 11 were discovered at a site in the city of
Baipiao, a treasure trove of primitive birds. So far, hundreds of
fossilized birds have been found in Liaoning, providing important
clues for scientists to study the origin and evolution of birds in
the Jurassic period.
</P>
<P>
The newly-found bird fossils were from the family of
Confuciusornis, similar to Sinosauropteryx, which some scientists
theorize is the ancestor of all modern birds.
</P>
<P>
The fossils were excavated in a five-meter-deep pit by a group
of scientists who were doing investigation work there.

SAN JOSE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican police announced
today that they have arrested eight suspects of a bank robbery
gang and confiscated several weapons.
</P>
<P>
Three Costa Ricans, three Colombians, one Panamanian and one
Venezuelan were detained early Monday morning in different houses
outside San Jose, judicial investigative police authorities (OIJ)
said.
</P>
<P>
The gang has been operating for several months and is believed
to have committed at least five robberies.
</P>
<P>
Police did not disclose the names of those detained but pointed
out that the leader of the gang is a Colombian.
</P>
<P>
The weapons seized were an AK-47 assault rifle, a Uzi machine
gun, three revolvers and detonators for explosives.
</P>
<P>
An OIJ agent said the police were alarmed by the violence of
the group in robbing a branch of the National Bank in Cartago, a
city 25 kilometers southeast of San Jose.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the gang was trying to seize money to
purchase weapons of higher caliber and plot bank robberies in
metropolitan and rural areas where banks are not well guarded.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Begins to Be Piped into Beijing Kitchens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Another 6,000 Beijing families
yesterday began to cook food with natural gas, which means less
exhaust smoke and cleaner kitchens.
</P>
<P>
The environmentally-friendly gas is piped into Beijing from
North China Oilfield in the capital's neighboring province of
Hebei.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, 100,000 households using coal gas now
will have their gas fittings adapted to burn natural gas,
bringing the clean gas to 550,000 Beijing households, Wu Liya,
vice-director of the Beijing Public Utility Bureau, was quoted as
saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
More than one million families will be natural gas users by the
end of 2000, when the city will be supplied with 850 million cubic
meters of the gas annually.
</P>
<P>
Enough natural gas from Shaanxi Province is expected to arrive
in Beijing by September 30, via an 860-kilometer pipeline, to
supply 80 percent of the city's needs.
</P>
<P>
The North China Oilfield, yields 500,000 cubic meters of
natural gas daily, promised to guarantee needs for natural gas
from Beijing before the influx from Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
The first gas storage tank for civilian use is expected to be
ready by the end of 2000. The 100-million-cubic-meter tank will be
located underground at the North China Oilfield.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Au Wei-lun of Hong Kong's senior
soccer club of South China won the honors of Hong Kong's Player of
the Year, Top Footballer and Most Welcomed Footballer at a
ceremony on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in the history of the local game that a
player won three top honors in a same season.
</P>
<P>
Au was first listed as one of the eleven Top Footballers of the
year and then elected Player of the Year through a poll by the
players, who were honored Tuesday, and the local media.
</P>
<P>
And the 25-year-old was also named as the Most Welcomed
Footballer as a result of a poll by local fans and the media.
</P>
<P>
South China, this season's senior League champion, won the
most honors as Au and six teammates were among the eleven Top
Footballers named.
</P>
<P>
Turning professional nine years ago, Au had played for two
other clubs before switching to South China four years ago.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Hong Kong team and usually assigned as a
forward or mid-fielder, Au is famed for his tricky play and sharp
shots. Having scored 18 goals so far this season, he is now
top-ranked among local Chinese players.
</P>
<P>
The annual selection was jointly organized by the Radio
Television Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Football Association and the
Hong Kong Chinese Football Association.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges N.Irish Group to Be Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Facing a rising tension in Northern
Ireland over pro-British parades, British Secretary of Northern
Ireland Mo Mowlam today urged local people to calm down to avoid
possible violence.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to everybody to try and cool it. Things are very
tense at the moment," she told reporters after a session of talks
involving most of the province's parties in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Pro-British loyalists, angry at a police ban on annual
Protestant parades through a nearby Catholic village, injured 27
police officers last Saturday and tried to burn down a Catholic
church at Harryville on the outskirts of Ballymena town, causing
tension in the area.
</P>
<P>
Catholic nationalists in Belfast, who wish to separate from
Britain and merge into the Irish Republic, have demanded the
abolition of anti-riot plastic bullets, blamed for the deaths of
14 civilians during years of strife, after Britain said some
stocks had been withdrawn in April because their velocity was too
high.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said there must be no repeat of widespread conflict last
year over the parades. "It is up to the people of Northern Ireland
to help us to avoid that happening," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army's political wing Sinn Fein has been
barred from multi-party negotiations since last year because it
insists on a military campaign to end the British rule of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But Britain's new Labor government last month ended a 16-month
ban on low-level official contacts with Sinn Fein after a lull in
IRA violence, giving the Northern Ireland peace process some new
hope.

<HEADLINE> US Supports Loan to Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. will support a loan of
13 million U.S. dollars from the International Finance
Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, to Croatia,
the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decided to back the loan because of recent actions by
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman that met demands set down by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, State Department
Spokesman Nicholas Burns announced.
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters that the U.S. government has decided not
to block the "very modest loan."
</P>
<P>
He cited the fact that Tudjman had opened a long-closed bridge
at Brcko between Croatia and Bosnia and ordered the arrest of
several people suspected of brutalizing elderly Serbs who tried to
return to their pre-war homes in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman last weekend publicly committed Croatia to inter-ethnic
reconciliation and to making sure that Serbs had a place to live
there in Eastern Slavonia, Burns added.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we've seen concrete positive steps, not just words,
by the Croatian government and by Tudjman personally, surely we
want to send a positive signal that this is the kind of action
that will warrant support from the West," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
But he added that if Tudjman did not follow up on his
commitments, the U.S. would act to block future loans and
assistance, including a much larger World Bank loan.
</P>
<P>
During her trip to the Balkans, Albright warned both Croatia
and Serbia that they will not get aid from the U.S. unless they
fully comply with the Dayton peace accords.

<HEADLINE> US FAA Requires Airline Cargo Fire Suppression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today asked
all airlines to install fire detectors and extinguishers in the
cargo compartments by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The rule would affect about 3,000 U.S. commercial airliners,
the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
Most airline cargo compartments already have detectors and
extinguishers, but that equipment has not been required for sealed
compartments.
</P>
<P>
It was assumed that lack of oxygen would extinguish any fires
that might break out in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that a cargo of oxygen generators in a
sealed compartment fed the fire in the ValuJet plane, leading to
the deadly crash in 1996 in Florida that killed 110 people.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board has pressed for new
rules on the equipment, and the Air Transport Association
announced that its members would install the equipment.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia will not be able to join
the Paris Club at the Group of Seven summit in Denver on June
20-22, said local reports today.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official, who declined to be named, was quoted as
saying that Russia is making progress in negotiations to join the
Paris Club but an agreement may not be reached in time.
</P>
<P>
"I would not be surprised if they could resolve these by next
week, but at this juncture I'm not counting on that happening,"
said the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
At the summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in March,
U.S. President Bill Clinton agreed to accelerate the negotiations
for Moscow to join the club this year and Russia attended the G-7
summit fully.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia is also pressing for membership in a series
of institutions, that were once the exclusive preserve of the
West, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development and the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will attend most of the meetings at the Denver summit,
which will gather leaders from the U.S., Canada, France, Britain,
Japan, Italy and Britain.

<HEADLINE> OHR: Serbs to Lose Aid by Obstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Office of High Representative
(OHR) warned Bosnian Serbs today that their obstruction of the
country's common institutions might cost them international
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The warning came after Serb representatives' absence forced the
postponement of the sessions of the Council of Ministers and the
Bosnian parliament. The two sessions were originally scheduled for
today and Monday respectively.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind the Serbs' failure to show up at the joint
institutions was that they have backtracked from the economic laws
which they agreed last month, according OHR spokesman Colum
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of those economic laws is the pre-condition for
holding a donors' conference on Bosnia and because of the
agreement on the package of laws by all parties in Bosnia, the
conference was scheduled on June 24-25.
</P>
<P>
Despite the likeliness that the laws might not be approved by
the Bosnian parliament, the donors' conference will still be held
as scheduled, Murphy said, adding that the Serbs would be
penalized for their obstruction.
</P>
<P>
Those who meet the demands by the international powers will
receive financial assistance and "those who do not cooperate will
not," he said.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Frank Talks With China Serves US Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has said what the United States should do with
China is to make frank dialogue rather than to sever the trade
relations by revoking the Most Favored Nation status.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks in an article published in today's
Washington Post, as the annual congressional debate concerning
China's trade status is under way.
</P>
<P>
"The administration is convinced our interests are better
served by a frank dialogue with China in which differences are
aired and opportunities to establish common ground are explored,"
the secretary of state said.
</P>
<P>
She reminded those who opposed the extension of China's MFN
status that one of every five human beings on this earth lives in
China who would move forward no matter what kind of oppositions
were confronting them.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the outcome of the debate (over China's MFN status),
China will be a rising force in Asian and world affairs," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Albright warned those opposition factions in Congress "not to
let the differences voiced in the current debate obscure agreement
on long-term goals."
</P>
<P>
She said revoking the MFN status would not only do harm to
China, but also affect "U.S. exports, endangering more than
170,000 high-paying American jobs."
</P>
<P>
Besides that, higher tariffs on low-cost Chinese imports would
add more than 500 million dollars to America's shopping bill.

<HEADLINE> US Plans to Sell Stingers to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said today that it
planned to sell 1,065 "stinger" anti-aircraft missiles and 213
launchers to South Korea for 307 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said in an announcement that it was the first such
kind of deal with South Korea, intended to help South Korea
"develop a defense capability with an ability to protect itself
from unwarranted aggression."
</P>
<P>
Stinger, fired by a single soldier with the launcher resting
on a shoulder, find and track targeted aircraft or helicopters
after launch. They are made by the Hughes Missiles System Co., a
unit of General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest military supplier to South
Korea and the sale of Stinger was the latest deal of weaponry.
</P>
<P>
In defending the sale, State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns said it "makes sense" for U.S. policy on the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take very seriously the security of South Korea.
It's imperative that South Korea have the most modern weaponry
available to defend itself, along with the 37,000 (American)
troops there," he said.

<HEADLINE> Crash Recording Device for Air Bags Urged in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board today recommended the development of a
crash recording device to store information about auto accidents
in a hope to prevent more deaths from deploying air bags.
</P>
<P>
The board called for the modification of the computer sensor in
air bags to allow safety officials to retrieve data about crash
speeds and air bag deployment.
</P>
<P>
Board officials said the device would work like the black boxes
that record information about airplanes in flight.
</P>
<P>
Board officials want to know more about the severity of
crashes, air bag deployment as well as seat belt usage. They want
to document cases of successful air bag deployments so better air
bags can be designed.
</P>
<P>
Deploying air bags has been blamed for the deaths of 40
children and infants and 27 adults in accidents they should have
survived.
</P>
<P>
The deaths from deploying air bags were in low-speed accidents
and in most cases the other occupants in the car suffered only
minor or no injuries. Most air bags are designed to deploy in
head-on crashes of 12 mph or more.
</P>
<P>
There are 60 million cars on the road in the country today with
air bags that are not safe for everyone, officials said.

<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The environmental group Greenpeace
said today it would take the British government to court if the
government decides to open up Atlantic waters for oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
"Greenpeace has given the Department of Trade and Industry 10
days in which to respond before the matter is lodged before the
High Court requesting leave for a judicial review," the
environment group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace sent a letter to Trade and Industry Minister
Margaret Beckett today, protesting against the government's
alleged failure to apply European Law in the Atlantic frontier
north of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"Greenpeace believes that the government has failed to apply
the European Habitats Directive in relation to cold water coral
and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the British government to suspend exploration
licenses awarded under the 17th offshore oil licensing round.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Atlantic Frontier oil development is damaging,
unnecessary and illegal," Greenpeace Deputy Executive Director
Chris Rose was quoted by local media reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry had reportedly promised to
respond to the letter in the next few days.

<HEADLINE> German Chancellor Kohl Meets Chinese Leader Li Ruihuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met
here today with visiting Chinese leader Li Ruihuan, both stressing
the need to further strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Li, Chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Kohl
said that Germany attaches great importance to the German-Chinese
relations.
</P>
<P>
Although there were some twists and turns last year between the
two countries, the bilateral relations have witnessed improvement
again, he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Europe is making efforts to speed up the
integration process while China is undergoing sustained and rapid
economic development, Kohl said that to improve and expand the
bilateral relations is in the interests of the two countries and
the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan conveyed to Kohl the cordial regards from Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. He also conveyed Li
Peng's invitation for Kohl to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan said he was greatly delighted to visit Germany on the
eve of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic
relations between China and Germany.
</P>
<P>
He said that through the visit he has become more aware of the
profound social foundation and broad prospects for the Sino-German
friendship.
</P>
<P>
He said there exist no problems left over from the history, nor
conflict of interests, between the two countries. Rather, China
and Germany share extensively common interests in economy and
other fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China can draw on Germany's advanced technologies and
use as reference its managerial experience.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese government attaches importance to its
relations with Germany and hopes to further their comprehensive
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sino-German relations in general are good,
as they have returned onto the track of healthy development after
experiencing twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
In expanding bilateral relations, he said, leaders of the two
countries have played an important role. He said the Chinese
government especially appreciated Chancellor Kohl's unique
contributions to promoting Sino-German ties and the
far-sightedness and vision he showed in handling international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kohl expressed his agreement with Li's views. He also asked Li to
extend his regards to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng, and accepted Li Peng's invitation to visit China. Kohl said he
is looking forward to meeting Chinese leaders again. He last visited
China in 1995, his fourth trip to the country since he became German
chancellor in 1982.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li briefed Kohl on China's current economic
situation and on Hong Kong's return to the motherland. They also
exchanged views on international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is on a seven-day official goodwill visit to Germany, met
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel Monday, and is scheduled to meet
German President Roman Herzog and Rita Suessmuth, president of the
Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament, Wednesday.

</P>
<P>
During the fortnight-long visit, Hussein will rally support for
resuming the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations and

<HEADLINE> French Troops Continue Evacuation From Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- French troops today continued to
evacuate foreigners, mostly French nationals, from the Congo
Republic's Brazzaville to Libreville in Gabon, while fighting
resumed between the two warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Fifty foreigners were evacuated on board a French military
transport aircraft from the airport of Brazzaville, after French
troops evacuated 700 others on Monday, French military officers
said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between government troops and the militiamen of former
President Denis Sassou-N'Guesso continued only 50 meters from the
French soldiers at Brazzaville's international airport. But the
French were not threatened, said Alexis Jaraud, spokesman for the
French troops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 850 French soldiers, including 400 foreign
legionnaires and 400 elite parachutists, were supposed to complete
their deployment in Brazzaville after flying from Chad and
military bases in southern France.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese government today assured France that there was no
anti-French hysteria in Brazzaville, and asked Frenchmen to stay.
</P>
<P>
"No xenophobic feeling is developing in Congo. The relations
between Congo and France remain the best," the national radio of
Congo said.
</P>
<P>
It said: "The movements of the French troops on the Congolese
territory are known and authorized by the Congolese
authorities. No military action of the French troops is directed
against the people of Brazzaville and the interests of the
Congolese people."
</P>
<P>
The French government also encouraged Frenchmen to stay at home
in Brazzaville, because their properties could be looted during
their absence.
</P>
<P>
The Gabonese President, Omar Bongo, who is a close friend of
Congolese President Pascal Lissouba, and the father-in-law of
Sassou-N'Guesso, is trying to mediate a ceasefire with the support
of French President Jacques Chirac, who personally intervened last
night asking the warring sides to stop fighting.

<HEADLINE> More Consolidation Seen in Banks, Securities Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 10 (Xinhua) -- BankAmerica Corporation announced
Monday that it is buying Robertson, Stephens &AMP; Company, a San
Francisco investment firm, which is seen as another thrust by
commercial banks into investment banking.
</P>
<P>
This is also the latest evidence of a trend--consolidation
among banks and securities firms--gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the Bankers Trust New York Corporation agreed
to buy Alex. Brown &AMP; Sons, the oldest stock brokerage in the
United States, for about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars. Then in
mid-May, the Swiss Bank Corporation agreed to acquire Dillon, Read
&AMP; Company. A New York investment company, for about 600 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With more consolidation occurring among banks and securities
firms, many financial experts concluded that the wall that was
thrown up between commercial and investment banking in the
Depression was "definitively breached".
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Congress has for more than a decade debated
whether to repeal the glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which bans banks
from underwriting stocks, rulings by the Federal Reserve and
other regulators have given commercial banks permission to perform
virtually all of the functions of a brokerage firms, according to
a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
After BankAmerica buying Robertson, Stephens investment firm,
executives from financial services expected to see more
consolidation, particularly among the larger banks and securities
firms.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes Holbrooke to Help Resolve Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government said it hoped
U.S. special envoy for Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke, to help ensure
that talks on the Cyprus issue not be used as a pretext for
"obstructionism", government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements made by Holbrooke concerning the
possibility of conflict between Greece and Turkey, Reppas said the
Cyprus issue was the "touchstone" for the improvement of
Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all sides must approach the problem with
responsibility and show real interest in finding a solution.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Financial Times on Monday, Holbrooke
said that the situation in Cyprus could deteriorate at any moment,
bringing Greece and Turkey into direct conflict.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said that a solution could open the way for a "great
historical rapprochement" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and the Turkish-
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have agreed to hold direct talks in
New York in July. On the same day Clerides will go to Greece to
coordinate their policies before the start of the talks.

<P>
CAIRO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Volume of daily transaction in the Beirut Bourse has
increased about 150 times in only 14 months since its opening,
Ghabriyal Sahnawi, chairman of the Beirut Bourse Committee, was
quoted by the Al-Hayat daily Tuesday morning as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the average volume of transaction now has reached
nearly 3 million U.S. dollars a day from 20,000 dollars at the
beginning, and the number of exchanged shares has reached 300,000
a day, compared with only 30,000 of 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli defense firms are negotiating some 10.5
billion U.S.dollars worth of contracts with foreign clients and
expect more than half to be signed by the year 2000, The Jerusalem
Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government English daily quoted Ilan Biran, Defense
Ministry director-general as saying that more than 60 percent of
the contracts are being negotiated with clients from the Far East
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Ilan Biran said at a news conference in Tel Aviv Monday that in
1996 Israel signed contracts that totaled 2 billion dollars, and
this year, it has so far concluded more than 1 billion dollars in
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Currently the second most active area is Western Europe,
where Israeli firms are negotiating nearly 1.4 billion dollars
of contract, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The potential lies more in Eastern Europe, where officials
expect to win contracts of 1.47 billion dollars by the year
2000. North America is expected to collect close to 700 million
dollars in defense contracts within the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Biran said that he hopes the Israeli defense firms will
cooperate with each other abroad and embark on joint marketing
and manufacturing ventures. This, he said, would eliminate
inefficiency and needless competitions.
</P>
<P>
Military sales are a major foreign currency earner for
Israel. The country's large defense industry has suffered much
in recent years, due to a fierce competition at the shrinking
post-cold war market.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has signed a contract with the U.S. for the
purchase of 1 million tonnes of wheat because of the global wheat
price drop, Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 165,000 tonnes of wheat will arrive in Egypt by July, and
the rest in the end of November.
</P>
<P>

accessories, as well as furs.

Greece and Cyprus, have been invited to attend this event, which
will last until Sunday, June 15.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister on Labor Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the International
Labor Conference to pay more attention to the social and economic
development level of most International Labor Organization (ILO)
members when formulating labor standards.
</P>
<P>
"For developing countries which constitute the overwhelming
majority in the membership, the existing labor standards, taken as
a whole, do have the defect of being excessive in number and in
criteria," said China's Labor Minister Li Boyong at the 85th
session of the International Labor Conference held here on June
3-19.
</P>
<P>
"At present, many countries, particularly developing countries,
are yet to ratify more standards, this is not because of the lack
of political will, but rather as a result of their limited
capabilities," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The key to solving this problem lies in more economic
development and better labor legislation so the ILO should provide
its members with more effective technical cooperation and
assistance that are tailored to their actual needs, he said
</P>
<P>
Li expressed China's opposition to the two proposals of the
"social labeling" and the introduction of some type of new
mechanism in addition to strict supervisory procedures.
</P>
<P>
"The labeling of one country's products as up to labor standards
is, in essence, tantamount to openly advocating the rejection of
products from other countries," Li said.
</P>
<P>
On the new mechanism, Li said pointed out that the nature of
this proposition is to force members who have not ratified the
standard to undertake the same obligations as those that have
ratified.
</P>
<P>
"This is not consistent with the provisions of the ILO
constitution, " said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official appealed to ILO to concentrate on
increasing employment and eliminating poverty while pushing for
the setting of labor standards.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way can the organization live up to the
expectations of its members and better rise to the challenges of
the 21st century, " he added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Crown Prince to Visit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan will
pay an official visit to Turkey Thursday amid increasing
tension incurred by Turkish military thrust into northern Iraq,
Jordan's official news agency Petra reported today.
</P>
<P>
The details of Hassan's visit has not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
On May 27, Jordan officially called on Turkey to pull its
troops immediately out of northern Iraq, saying its thrust into
Iraq to fight Kurdish rebels was a violation of Iraqi
sovereignty and a threat to its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Continued Turkish military operations in Iraq would also
accelerate tension in the area, a Jordanian Foreign Ministry
spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish troops moved into northern Iraq
on May 14 allegedly to fight rebels of the Kurdish Workers Party
(PKK) there.
</P>
<P>
Last year, King Hussein and Hassan paid separate visits
to Turkey to discuss ways to get water from Turkey.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Disaster
Prevention and Preparedness Commission today announced that it
has drawn up plans to prevent and ward-off any sudden flooding
disaster that might surface in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, at a one-day meeting
on the exchange of experiences in flood prevention and
containment, the commission said the plan includes pre-disaster
prevention, post- disaster measures and rehabilitation, adding
that the plan has taken into consideration the strong and weak
points of the measures taken during the flooding which hit
several parts of the country last year.

<P>
The commission estimates that 450,000 people could be exposed
to flooding this year.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes U.S. for Holding Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed Al-Sahhaf criticized the U.S. for holding the food and
medicine contracts submitted to the U.N. Sanctions Committee, the
Iraqi News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent Monday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Al-Sahhaf said the U.S. representative to the Sanctions Committee
behaved with motives "far from the humanitarian objectives."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. representative recommended the committee to hold the
contracts signed by Iraq and foreign companies under the
"oil-for-food" deal, claiming that the items included in these
contracts were not listed within Iraq's purchase and distribution
plan, according to the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said that the contracts included 10 for medical
supplies, one for French wheat and another for sugar from the
United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the country's need for wheat and sugar, two
essential materials in the purchase and distribution list,
saying that the U.S. representative had approved similar
contracts for the supply of the two items on previous occasions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister asked the U.N. Secretary-General to
intervene personally in the Sanctions Committee to expedite
smooth processing of the contracts signed by Iraq and foreign
companies under the "oil-for-food" deal.
</P>
<P>
He also requested that his letter be distributed as a
U.N. Security Council document.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. signed last year the "oil-for-food"
deal, which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over six months on a renewable basis to buy food and other
daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which expired on June 7, has been renewed for
another six months, allowing Iraq to sell another 2.1 billion
dollars of oil.
</P>
<P>
However, all the contracts signed between Iraq and foreign
companies must be approved by the Sanctions Committee consisting
of representatives of all the 15 Security Council members, before
they are conducted.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S., a permanent Security Council member, remains
deeply suspicious of Iraq. It insists that the U.N. imposes tight
controls to make sure the supplies are distributed fairly and not
used for military purpose.

<HEADLINE> SADC Countries Urged to Realize Energy Plan of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Southern African
Development Community (SADC) member countries today were urged
speedier realization of the energy plan of action for
sustabinable development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Opening a four-day 22nd SADC energy officials' meeting in
Arusha, Northern Tanzania today, the Principal Secretary in the
Ministry of Energy and Minerals, Patrick Rutabanzibwa, emphasised
that member states should concentrate on the energy plan of
action for the benefit of the whole region.
</P>
<P>
"Securing a stable supply of energy is a vital pillar for
maintaining sustained economic growth. We see the results in the
Asian region where rapid economic growth has occured and energy
demand had risen sharply," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Rutabanzibwa also called upon SADC members to make efforts in
developing alternative sources of energy that would reduce the
burden on women and children and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Instead of concentrating only on electricity related projects,
he exhorted renewable energies such as solar and efficient
technologies that will reduce strain on forests and environmental
degradation.
</P>
<P>
He also paid tribute to SADC Technical and Administration Unit
(TAU) for co-ordinating energy activities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Regional Co-ordinator of SADC energy sector,
Antonio Da silva, said the signing of the Southern African Power
Pool (SAPP) two years ago by member states except Mauritius, was
the final critical step in the establishment and implementation
of the project.
</P>
<P>
He informed the meeting that important activities have already
been undertaken for the operationalisation of the power pool.
"The power pool will constitute the most important instrument for
the development co-operation in the electricity sub-sector for
the coming years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Da Silva told the participants that the Democratic
Republic of Congo (former Zaire) has become a formal
co-operating partner of SAPP.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM Stresses Urgent Need for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides today underlined the urgent need for a settlement to
the Cyprus question, likening the problem to a dormant volcano
which could explode at any time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his departure for a three-day official visit to
Japan, Kasoulides said the complacency which prevailed over the
years and the indifference toward the need for a settlement must
be dealt with "because the Cyprus question is a factor of
instability in the Eastern Mediterranean."
</P>
<P>
"What we have been saying for a long time that Cyprus is a
dormant volcano likely to erupt, has now been accepted, as I
gather from statements made by U.S. Presidential Emissary
Richard Holbrooke," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
This, he added, "reassures us that the international
community will be interested more actively than in the past in
the need for a settlement."
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus
Holbrooke told the BBC World Service Monday that the situation
in Cyprus could "explode one of these days in a gigantic tragedy
which will embrace other countries in the region."
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said Holbrooke's assertion is that a pending
Cyprus problem could create disruption and conflict in a region
where peace and stability are the main objectives.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the forthcoming U.N.-sponsored direct
negotiations, likely to take place on July 9 near New York, the
minister acknowledged that the Greek Cypriot side will be under
pressure during the talks, but "the more we base our positions
on international law and human rights principles the more
difficult it would be for others to exert pressure on us to
accept notions that are, for us, unacceptable," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to issue
invitations to President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash for face-to-face negotiations after
three-month U.N.-led proximity talks between two sides on the
island.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Reviews Iran-EU Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament today reviewed
the on-going diplomatic crisis between Iran and the European
union (EU) as well as the future prospects.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported that members of the
Parliament Foreign Policy Commission and Iranian ambassadors to EU
states stressed on safeguarding of Iran's foreign policy
principles based on the dignity, philosophy and expediency of
the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Iranian ambassadors to EU states
maintained that relations between Iran and European states
should be based on mutual respect and due regard for each
other's cultures and religious sanctities.
</P>
<P>
It said that the meeting studied a report on the latest
developments in Iran-EU diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
However, it gave no detail on what kind of measures the
Islamic system might take to tackle the diplomatic crisis
between Iran and European countries.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the session spelled out a message
that Iran will continue to take tough action on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian diplomats have to be obedient to the order issued
by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who issued the order on
April 30 to refuse German ambassador to return to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said last
month that Iran wants normal relations with European countries
but the German ambassador has to wait to come back to
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
In April the 64-year-old president attacked Germany for
"destroying 100-year friendship with Iran because of baseless
verdict by the Berlin court" on April 10.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court ruled that the top political leadership in
Iran was behind the assassination of Kurdish opposition leaders
in Berlin's Mykonos restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The court gave life imprisonment to one Iranian national
and a Lebanese and sentenced two other Lebanese to long prison
terms on charge of assassinating the four Kurdish dissidents.
</P>
<P>
The verdict sparked diplomatic battle between Iran and
Germany as well as other European countries. EU has recalled
their ambassadors, suspended ministerial level contact and stop
critical dialogue.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe, which is campaigning for a
lift on the international ban on ivory trade, said today it is
receiving growing support at the ongoing 10th conference of parties
to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES).
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Ambassador to Geneva, Tichaona Jokonya, said a number of
delegations were changing their negative attitude on the proposal to
remove elephants from the list of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
''There is a growing appreciation of Zimbabwe's cause, and the
atmosphere has changed greatly since we started,'' said the Chairman
of the CITES meeting.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, together with Namibia and Botswana, are calling for the
downlisting of the elephant from appendix I, which bans trade in
ivory, to appendix II, which allows controlled trade.
</P>
<P>
The three southern African states argued that their countries could
not sustainably maintain the current large elephant populations while
ivory stockpiles which had accumulated since 1989 could be sold for
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe would need the support of at least two thirds of the 138
CITES members for its proposal, which had been unsuccessful for the
past three meetings, to succeed.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pan African Youth
Movement (PYM) today commended Tanzania for maintaining peace and
stability in the country since its independence three decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here today, PYM Secretary
General Aly Diop said Tanzania was among very few countries in
Africa which have managed to maintain peace and unity, which he
said is an example that should be emulated by other countries.
</P>
<P>
He commended Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa for his
efforts in safeguarding peace, a pre-requisite for development of
any country.
</P>
<P>
However, Diop noted with concern that many other African
countries were trapped in wars and conflicts which he said are
"the No. 1 enemies of development."
</P>
<P>
Diop also appreciated Tanzania's efforts and role in the
development of the youth body.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete commended
the youth organization for evolving a new and dynamic platform in
line with the changing political, economic and social situation
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said the changes in the youth body will help
consolidate democracy, peace, development and youth employment,
particularly by using the national youth council structure to
ensure non-partisan involvement of youth.

Diop, who arrived in the country two weeks ago for a visit,

<HEADLINE> Iran Complains of Refugee Influx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran, busy with tackling an influx
of refugees from war-torn Afghanistan and northern Iraq, said
today that it will only accept refugees whose lives are in danger.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Husseini, director-general of the Interior Ministry's
Department for Foreign Nationals and Refugees, said that the
ministry has adopted the measures to deal with the refugee influx.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has entered into negotiations with the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other countries to
help the refugees move to other countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that preliminary negotiations were also held with the
UN officials to establish the UNHCR regional office in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that Iran is on top of the list of
countries hosting foreign refugees. About 1.4 million Afghan
refugees, 576,000 Iraqi refugees and migrants from Bangladesh and
Pakistan are living in Iran.
</P>
<P>
While talking with local press, he said, Iran is working to
prepare grounds for repatriation of the refugees to their own
countries.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said after withdrawal of the troops of former
Soviet Union from Afghanistan, 1.38 million Afghan refugees
returned to their country voluntarily, adding that voluntary
return home of 250,000 Afghan refugees this year has stopped
owing to the current crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the fact that the prospect for their return to
Afghanistan is grim, Iran has been proposing that the Afghan
refugees should be accommodated in a third country," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Iraqi refugees living in Iran, he said a program is
prepared to voluntarily repatriate 10,000 Iraqi Kurds to northern
Iraq and since 50 percent of Iraqi refugees are Kurds, their
repatriation would have no problem because Saddam's forces are not
present in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the total assistance of international organizations and
private charity institutes to refugees in Iran was 43 million
U.S. dollars in 1997 which is very slight compared to the costs of
managing over 2 million foreign refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to the Geneva convention on refugees adopted in 1951,
he said, three ways are envisaged concerning the fate of foreign
refugees that are, repatriation, integration into the country
where the refugees are living and settlement of refugees and
migrants in a third country.

<HEADLINE> Minister Warns Against Deforestation in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Agriculture Seifu Ketema today warned against the country's rapid
rate of deforestation which he said is 200,000 hectares annually.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia will entirely lose its forestry resources by the
year 2020 unless measures are taken to curb the practice," he
told a meeting on national forestry resources policy held here.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, about 43 million hectares of land in
highland Ethiopia has suffered various forms of degradation,
rendering about 2 million hectares of land uncultivatable.
</P>
<P>
And Ethiopia loses about 200 million tons of soil to
neighboring countries annually while only 4 million hectares of
its land mass is currently covered with forest, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has formulated a forestry and land
use policy with the view to controlling the depletion of the
nation's natural resources.

<HEADLINE> WWF Official Proposes Debt-For-Ivory Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries with huge
stockpiles of ivory should consider a debt-for-ivory scheme under
which creditor nations could restructure a country's debt in
exchange for environmental conservation, a policy expert from the
World Wildlife Fund said here today.
</P>
<P>
Director for International Policy of the World Wildlife Fund,
Ginette Hemley, said the debt reduction initiative might be
a practical solution to the ivory stock issue.
</P>
<P>
''It is up to the African countries and the creditor nations
to agree on the debt-for-ivory scheme because it would need to be
on a government-to-government basis,'' said Hemley.
</P>
<P>
The debt-for-ivory scheme was being seen as the most effective
since it would address developing countries's debt burden which
had seen large percentages of national revenue being channelled
to service foreign and domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
When the ban on ivory trade began in 1989, a number of
countries found themselves stuck with stockpiles worth millions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is lobbying the ongoing Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species to lift the ban.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows: Whites, Blacks Differ on Race Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Black Americans have a far more
pessimistic view of how the races get along than do whites, a new
Gallup survey of race relations finds. But more than half of both
blacks and whites say race relations will always be a problem in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
In general, whites see little to be concerned about when it
comes to opportunities for blacks in jobs, education and housing,
according to the poll released Tuesday. Blacks, however, continue
to see racial discrimination as a factor limiting full equality.
</P>
<P>
Just 34 percent of whites feel the government should make
greater efforts to support minorities, while 59 percent of blacks
see the need for great governmental remedies to inequality.
</P>
<P>
Some measures of white racism seem to show as easing of
discriminatory attitudes such as shrinking white resistance to
interracial marriage, voting for a black for president and sending
their children to school with black classmates.
</P>
<P>
But a majority of both groups believe problems of race are here
with us to stay.
</P>
<P>
Asked if race relations will always be a problem in the United
States, 58 percent of blacks said yes. Among whites, 54 percent
said race relations will always be a problem.

4-February 28 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3

<HEADLINE> British Animal Body Attacks Zimbabwe on Ivory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A British-based international
organization today accused Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana, which
are campaigning for lifting ban on ivory trade, of lacking
political will to solve problems with elephant over-population.
</P>
<P>
International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) leading scientist
Barbara Maas told a press conference here today that other means
could be found to solve problems of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
"Alternative solutions can be found if people have the
political will to look for them. The lack of political will is
the problem here," said Maas who was attending the ongoing
conference of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
The three southern African countries had earlier proposed to
the 138-member CITES that the African elephant be downlisted from
Appendix I, which bans trade in ivory, to Appendix II, which
allows for limited and controlled trade.
</P>
<P>
The three countries maintained that the current level of
elephant population was not sustainable, while accumulating ivory
stocks could earn millions of dollars which could be reinvested
in conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
But Maas said there was no scientific proof that elephants
could cause loss of biodiversity as complained by the southern
African countries.
</P>
<P>
She declared that IFAW is opposed to the downlisting of the
elephant because none of the proposing countries had means to
control illegal ivory trade within their borders, while she said
trade in one country could affect the already dwindling elephant
populations in other African countries.
</P>
<P>
The organization was also opposed to the bid by South Africa
to allow trade in parts and derivatives of the white rhino, she
added.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Drill for Martian Exploratory Journey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian scientists are working
against time to design a drill which will be carried by a Russian
spaceship to Mars in the year 2001, the Egyptian MENA news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The drill, which will be used to explore the possible existence
of water on the red planet, will be ready in September, said
Muslem Shaltout, the chairman of the Space Research Department at
the National Institute for Astronomical and Geophysical Research.
</P>
<P>
The prototype will be manufactured by the Arab Industrialization
Organization or the Ministry of Military Production, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the prototype is tested, it will be sent to Russia to be
assembled with other equipment on the spaceship.
</P>
<P>
"Marsekhod," the spaceship, will then be launched by a
U.S.-made "Delta" rocket from Cape Canaveral in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The solar-powered Egyptian drill, to be named "Pharoahs' God"
will take samples of earth on Mars at depths of between three and
four meters, according to Shaltout.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. spaceships "Viking 1" and "Viking 2" which were sent
to Mars in 1975 drilled to a depth of only 10 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is supplying the drill under an agreement of cooperation
signed among the Egyptian Ministry of Scientific Research, the
Russian Space Research Institute in Moscow and the International
Society for Space Research at Pasadena, U.S., in last September.

European Union (EU) countries should agree upon the question of
employment during their Amsterdam summit on June 16-17.
</P>
<P>
"What is very important is to agree upon the question of labor
and employment. At the intergovernmental conference, there is an
extraordinary challenge about employment to which we should face
up to," Blair told TF1 television channel.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government of France has called for a delay of
the signing of the EU monetary Stability Pact, in order to include
clauses on employment and coordination of economic policies into
the pact, which was due to be signed during the Amsterdam summit.
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam summit is supposed to conclude the negotiations
on the revision of the Maastricht treaty on European economic and
monetary integration.
</P>
<P>
Blair also reiterated his stand that Britain would continue to
run its own border controls and that London will not join the
European single currency until a referendum is held in Britain on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is "very improbable" that Britain will join
the euro "in the first wagon," although London is working in "a
constructive way" with France and Germany on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Blair again expressed his difference with the French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin over the government regulation of labor
market.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the government today should be to encourage the
flexibility because the world has changed," said Blair.
</P>
<P>
Blair said during the Socialist Congress held in Malmoe,
Sweden, last week that the Socialist parties of Europe today
should seek a third way which is different from both the
conservative parties and the old Socialist governments in seeking
economic growth and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Jospin stressed the importance of social cohesion and the role
for the government to achieve social cohesion.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone's Envoy to U.N. Warns of Genocide at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's ambassador to the
United Nations, James Jonah today disclosed a plan of genocide at
his home country, saying even his relatives have been threatened
by the military junta.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in New York this morning, the envoy
said: "Only yesterday, military personnel went to the homes of my
relatives and warned them unless i condemn any Nigerian
intervention, they will be killed."
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian Television Authority, Jonah has
asked the Security Council to give "serious consideration" for
setting up a tribunal of the genocide. All the men in
the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary council in Sierra Leone, including
former rebel Leader Foday Sankoh, are responsible for the planned
genocide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have been going on shortly after some soldiers in
Sierra Leone launched a military coup on May 25 which overthrew
the civilian government led by ousted President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The coup, which is wide condemned among the international
community, triggered off the military intervention of the West
African Peacekeeping Force known as ECOMOG in a bid to restore
the civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the military junta under major Johnny
Paul Koromah are demanding 46 million U.S. Dollars to step down
and allow the return of Kabbah's regime.
</P>
<P>
A delegation sent by Major Koromah to Cote d'Ivoire has ended
its visit and is expected to arrive in Ghana today for talks on
peaceful settlement of the crisis in the west African country.

<HEADLINE> UK Industrial Production Rises in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- British industrial production rose
1.2 percent, the highest rate for more than a year and a half in
April, while inflation at the factory gate remained subdued.
</P>
<P>
Prices at the factory gate, a key indicator of inflationary
pressures, rose 0.1 percent in May to show a 1.0 percent change on
May 1996.
</P>
<P>
April's increase pushed the annual rise in industrial output to
2.2 percent, compared with an increase of only 0.2 percent in the
year to March.
</P>
<P>
The rise in domestic demand was helped by an improvement in the
manufacturing sector. Its output grew by 0.6 percent during April,
an annual increase of 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was the strongest pace since July 1995, and came as a
surprise following the virtually flat first-quarter figures.
</P>
<P>
There was little sign that export-dominated industries were
suffering more than the rest. However, some of the City economists
said that the government should not be tempted into leaving taxes
alone in the coming budget on July 2.
</P>
<P>
"Just because the weakness of exports is being masked, does not
mean that all is rosy in the economy," one expert said.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends Extension of UNFICYP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today proposed to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFIYP) for a further period of six
months until December 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said that during
the period of last six months, the number of serious incidents
decreased in Cyprus and both sides of Greek and Turkish Cypriots
generally respected the cease-fire and the status quo.
</P>
<P>
But the tension along the cease-fire lines remained higher than
in the past, he said. There were a number of shooting incidents
and violation of the airspace of Cyprus. Military construction by
both sides continued.
</P>
<P>
There had no changes in the excessive levels of military forces
and armaments in Cyprus and the rate at which they were expanded,
upgraded and modernised, the U.N. chief added while explaining the
reason for the extension of the force.
</P>
<P>
Annan also urged the two sides to make a renewed effort to
reach agreement on measures to reduce tension along the cease-fire
line across the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed in the north in reaction to a coup in Nicosia by the
military government then ruling Greece. The United Nations has
since been trying to reunite the island on the agreed basis of a
bicommunal federation.
