<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Accused of Attempting to Setting Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- General Omar Hajji Masalleh,
chairman of the Somali National Front, Friday accused Ethiopia of
attempting to establish an administration for the Somalis inside
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists in south Mogadishu, General Masalleh
also accused Ethiopia of destabilizing Gedo region and creating
confusion among his faction and the Somali people as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the border town of Bulo Hawo indicate that the
Ethiopian forces stationed in the town are further tightening
their grip on the town and its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
After successfully restoring normalcy to the town, the
Ethiopian forces rounded up more than 20 people Thursday night.
Among the apprehended are General Abdulaziz All Barre, former
commander of the 26th Division of Somalia's former national army
and Hassan Abdi Hirey, former district commissioner of Dolow town
in Gedo region.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces have also arrested more than 16 gunmen and
 confiscated their guns.
</P>
<P>
According to some traditional leaders of Bulo Hawo town
contacted on the VHF radio Friday, the Ethiopian forces have
sealed off the town from every corner, even its border with Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The elders added that the Kenyan police have also closed their
border by deploying armed units so as to block the influx of
people moving to Kenya for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians have no rights to cross into Somalia and
apprehend people in their own country, General Masalleh said,
demanding the immediate and unconditional release of the
apprehended people and the withdrawal of the Ethiopian forces from
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Ethiopian forces Friday reportedly nominated
their own administration for the town. Mohamed Sheikh Ali Burale
has been nominated as the chairman of the town, while Nur Matan
and Abukar Sankus were made his deputies.
</P>
<P>
No immediate comment was available from the Ethiopian side.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Parliament Speaker Fails to Secure U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Parliament Speaker Sypros
Kyprianou has said in Belgrade that he failed to achieve the
release of the three American soldiers captured by Yugoslavia, the
Cyprus News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
Friday afternoon, Kyprianou also said that neither the U.S. nor
their allies have taken his mission seriously and Belgrade's
overriding impression is that any gesture made by them will not
achieve any results.
</P>
<P>
He expressed deep regret over his failure, adding that the
unrelentless bombings by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) over the past days have made his mission more difficult.
</P>
<P>
NATO began bombarding Yugoslav Serb targets on March 24 after
Milosevic refused to accept a peace agreement, which requires
Belgrade to grant autonomy to the independence-seeking Kosovo
while allowing NATO peacekeeping forces to police the province.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Yugoslavia have had good relations over years and
Kyprianou developed warm ties with leaders preceded Milosevic when
he was president of Cyprus from 1978 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou arrived in Belgrade Thursday on what he declared
"purely humanitarian mission" to seek the release of the three
U.S. soldiers, who were among the NATO troops deployed in
Macedonia and captured by Serbian forces near the
Macedonian-Yugoslav border late last month.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou earlier in the day visited the bombed areas around
the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
The Greek air force has said it will provide Kyprianou with an
aircraft to take him back home.

<HEADLINE> Vatican, France in Alleged Plot to Save Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Vatican and France were trying
to save the Rwandan Bishop of Gikonongoro, Augustin Misago, who
was accused for the involvement in the Rwandan genocide in 1994,
Rwandan News Agency (RNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The RNA report said since the reburial of the remains of over
20,000 Tutsis killed at Kibeho in the Rwanda genocide in 1994 in
which Augustin Misago, the Bishop of Gikongoro, was cited as a key
ring-leader, things have taken a new twist with The Vatican, and
France endeavoring to save him from justice in facilitating his
flight.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed religious sources in Kigali, capital of Rwanda,
have RNA that since Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu asked
Wednesday that Misago be quickly indicted and brought to book,
Misago did not return to his bishopric.
</P>
<P>
''He is hiding somewhere in Butare (in southern Rwanda),
fearing to be immediately put into custody,'' the same sources
said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that French Ambassador to Rwanda, the Pope's
Nuncio, and the Archbishop of Kigali held a meeting to discuss
this issue on Thursday night at the French ambassador' s residence
and ended in the small hours of Friday.
</P>
<P>
''Misago is seen as a key witness of the genocide in Gikongoro,
and more particularly the crimes committed by the French troops of
the Turquoise Zone,'' said a clergyman who requested not to
disclose his name.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there is no doubt that Bishop Misago would make
serious revelations about the role of France in condoning acts of
genocide which went on unabated after their arrival, which were
orchestrated by the '' genocidaire '' government.
</P>
<P>
Both Misago and the then Bishop of Cyangugu, Thaddee
Ntihinyurwa, now Archbishop of Kigali, were regularly flown by
French helicopters to Gisenyi, which served as the new capital of
the ''genocidaire'' government, to attend its meetings.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, genocide survivors in southwest Cyangugu
equally charged Archbishop Ntihinyurwa of active collaboration
with the armed Hutu gangs who were butchering Tutsis in his
diocese.
</P>
<P>
The two high-ranking clergymen are reportedly highly protected
by The Vatican which belatedly accepted that its servicemen and
women be brought to court and tried for their role in the killings
which claimed over half a million lives in 1994.
</P>
<P>
''There is nothing like that about Misago, I'm not aware about
any plan to help him escape justice,'' an official from the French
Embassy in Kigali, rebutted. ''What happened last night was a
reception organized by our ambassador to welcome the new Nuncio,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremonies at Kibeho, Rwandan President Bizimungu
had emphasized the need to punish Misago, saying he is not above
the law.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Minister of Justice Jean de Dieu Mucyo had told the
press that Misago's case file was complete, and there was nothing
still hindering his arrest and trial save that the government did
not want confrontation with his denomination.
</P>
<P>
Human rights organizations have repeatedly drawn the attention
of the Holy Seat on the Catholic Church's stubbornness to protect
its clergy people who committed crimes in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
These organizations have charged that over 20 Rwandan
''genocidaire'' priests are hiding in The Vatican.''

<HEADLINE> Purges Go on in Rwanda's Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan parliament is shaken
by deep purges affecting nearly all parties sharing the 70 seats
of the National Transitional Assembly, the Rwanda News Agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following the sacking of four parliamentarians of the
Republican Democratic Party (MDR) last month on account of alleged
crimes ranging from misconduct, incompetence, active collaboration
with the armed Hutu rebellion, to high treason, another six have
been summoned to resign within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The request was made Thursday by the forum of political parties
under the chairmanship of Charles Muligande, the secretary general
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).
</P>
<P>
Besides the RPF and the MDR, the forum includes the Social
Democratic Party, the Democratic Islamic Party , the Rwandan
Socialist Party, the Union for Democracy and Progress in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
One Damien Barihuta from the Christian Democratic Party, was
among the six ordered to tender their resignation or face
exclusion from their own parties.
</P>
<P>
Barihuta is said to have attempted to hit a ''cow-boy'' with a
machete. After missing the boy, the honorable parliamentarian
hit his cow with repeated machete blows.
</P>
<P>
The two parliamentarians from the Social Democratic Party have
been charged with grave misconduct.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said here on Friday that it is waiting for the demand of
Turkish officials to contribute to the aid campaign for the
Kosovar refugees who took shelter in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia News Agency quoted UNHCR spokesman in Turkey Metin
Corabatir as saying that the U.N. is very grateful to Turkey since
it acts very generously and rapidly for the Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
Over 8,000 Kosovar refugees have arrived in Turkey since the
air strikes launched by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Corabatir pointed out that the U.N. is waiting for the demand
of Turkey to provide aid for the refugees staying in
northwestern Kirklareli province.
</P>
<P>
The delay in the demand of Turkey can affect the contribution
of the international community for the refugees in Turkey, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Corabatir stressed that the U.N. can only provide more money to
this fund when Turkey officially demands aid from the U.N..

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique
and Zambia have reaffirmed their commitment to jointly building
the Mtwara Development Corridor, a key regional trade link.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Works Anna Abdallah has said the country
remains serious about the initiative.
</P>
<P>
The corridor project is to build a 820-kilometer highway from
the Mtwara port on the country's southeast coast to Lake Nyasa as
a shortcut for the movement of goods for landlocked Malawi and
Zambia, and launch transportation and energy projects along the
road.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique will also benefit from the project, which is
expected to spur the economic development of its northern areas.
</P>
<P>
"Our government has no choice but to create the necessary
environment to ensure the success of this important undertaking,"
Abdallah told a meeting on the corridor Thursday in Malawi.
</P>
<P>
"I am pretty sure we shall win," media sources Friday quoted
the minister as telling delegates from the four African countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is also head of the Tanzanian delegation,
said Tanzania has received inquiries and proposals on how and when
to invest in the corridor projects.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that some work has already started on the Mtwara
port on the southeastern coast of Tanzania, adding that proposals
to develop the road between Mtwara port and the Mbamba Bay on Lake
Nyasa are being studied.
</P>
<P>
Malawian Foreign Minister Mapopa Chipeta, who led his country's
 delegation, said Malawi will extend unwavering support to all
identified projects.
</P>
<P>
The four countries endorsed a proposal made by Tanzania to host
the Investors and Donors Forum in Arusha town, north Tanzania, to
solicit funds and attract investors.
</P>
<P>
Ann Dimande, head of the Mozambican delegation, said her
country will encourage people to invest in the transport
infrastructure in the corridor, adding the next inter-state
meeting on the corridor will be held in Pemba, Mozambique next
month.
</P>
<P>
Misheck Mwanza, leader of the Zambian delegation, said it is
high time the four countries worked together to harness their
resources.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting on the Mtwara Development Corridor was held
in January this year in Tanzania.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The spokesman for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Friday issued a statement, saying
that Annan "has learned with dismay of the assassination this
morning of President Ibrahim Mainassara Bare of the Niger."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General wishes to reiterate his condemnation of
such terrorist acts and any attempt to change the government of
any country by force or by other unconstitutional means," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He calls on all political, military and civil society leaders
to make every effort to avert violence in the country, and to work
for an early return to peace, stability and constitutional order,"
the statement said. "The Secretary-General conveys his condolences
to the family of the late president."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ibrahim Assane Mayaki of Niger announced the
president's death in a broadcast on state radio but said only that
he had been killed in an "unfortunate accident," reports said. It
is not known why the killing occurred.
</P>
<P>
Mainassara, 49, a former army chief, led a coup in January 1996
that toppled an elected government. Since winning a disputed
presidential election in July of that year, Mainassara had faced
relentless pressure from a militant opposition spearheaded largely
by leaders of the civilian government he overthrew.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Coffee Production to Be Up by 70 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee production is
anticipated to increase by 70 percent this year reaching 53,000

ready for marketing and 21,750 tons of unmilled coffee, and the
country's five major commercial millers had by March received

</P>
<P>
The Kenya Planters Co-operative Union, the country's leading
coffee miller, projects to receive 41,584 tons of coffee this year

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Peace Efforts by Pakistan, India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese leader said here
on Friday that China believes the situation in South Asia is
moving in a positive direction and welcomes the recent measures
taken by Pakistan and India for the improvement of their bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China, was answering questions during a joint
interview with five major Pakistani media organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in South Asia is moving in a positive
direction," especially after the meeting between Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari
Vajpayee in Lahore in February this year, Li said, when answering
a question on maintenance of peace and stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the leaders of the two South Asian neighbors
indicated their willingness to resolve their disputes, including
the Kashmir issue, in a political way.
</P>
<P>
"I think that this is a good beginning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such an expression of willingness should be followed up with
actions and concrete measures, so that the disputes could be
resolved through negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about what possible and necessary steps could be taken to
ensure peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region, Li said
China believed in political multipolarity and economic
globalization, which meant that world affairs should be
participated in by all countries and groups of countries rather
than are dictated by a single or a few countries.
</P>
<P>
"That is the way to ensure the peace and stability in this
region, and this is the task faced by the region," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there already existed some groups of countries in
the Asia Pacific region such as the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that these organizations would play an
increasingly important role in the process of achieving regional
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of financial crisis, Li said: "The economic
globalization brings opportunities to countries, especially the
developing countries, but at the same time it also exposes all
countries to very great challenges." Some countries which were hit
by the financial crisis have suffered heavy losses in their
respective economies.
</P>
<P>
"So in the course of economic globalization, we have to learn
how to protect ourselves," said Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
To a question about the nuclearization in South Asia and
China's relations with Pakistan, Li stressed that China as a
signatory state to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the
Non-Proliferation Treaty always honors its commitment.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pakistan conducted its nuclear tests in May last
year after similar tests by India. "China does not support or
encourage nuclear proliferation. China does not want to see
nuclear war as it is catastrophic to the mankind," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the nuclear cooperation between China and
Pakistan was confined to the area of peaceful use of nuclear
energy and such cooperation was carried out under the strict
supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Li held discussions with Wasim Sajjad, chairman
of Pakistan's Senate, on the exchanges between China's NPC and the
Pakistani Senate and ways to further all-round development of
relations between the two countries. Sajjad also hosted a banquet
in honor of the Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng arrived here Thursday afternoon on a four-day official
visit to Pakistan at the invitation of his Pakistani counterpart
Ellahi Bukhsh Soomro.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is the fourth leg of Li's current six-nation tour. He
has already visited Greece, Turkey and Syria, and will also tour
Bangladesh and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Human Body Versus Steel Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KRAGUJEVAC, Yugoslavia, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Six NATO bombs
exploded right in front of thousands of Zastava employees early on
Friday wounding hundreds, of whom 126 were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Up in the sky NATO pilots knew there were people inside the
automobile factory complex while down on the ground Zastava
employees and their families knew that bombs were falling upon
them.
</P>
<P>
It was a combat between steel bombs and human bodies.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the onslaught of NATO bombing against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, employees and their families of the
Zastava Automobile Factory have been protecting, day and night,
their livelihood with their body.
</P>
<P>
The 150-year-old factory provides jobs for 38,000 people around
Kragujevac and for 60,000 more in 200 other automobile component
factories around the country.
</P>
<P>
Families and relatives included, the six bombs that exploded
inside the Kragujevac factory could affect the livelihood of
upwards of 300,000 in this country, which has a population of 1.1
million.
</P>
<P>
The bombs severely damaged the molding workshop, paint
workshop, power plant, truck assembly line and car assembly line
of the factory. More than half of the 300 hectares of the factory
were demolished within seconds right in front of the very eyes of
its employees.
</P>
<P>
Average monthly salary of Zastava employees already plummeted
from 875 Deutsch marks before international sanctions to 52 marks
at the time being.
</P>
<P>
"Has the worst already happened to us or not?" asked Milan
Beko, a chairman of the board of directors of the enterprise that
used to manufacture 235,000 automobiles a year, but now it only
managed to produce between 5,000 and 8,000 vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of the Serbian government, Zastava planned
to turn out 27,000 cars this year to improve the living standards
of its employees. But....
</P>
<P>
What Zastava employees could not understand was that they
exported 165,000 Yugo cars to the United States within two years
back in 1985 and 1986. Their truck production line was a joint
venture with Italy's Iveco while their paint workshop used German
equipment and then these countries joined hands in bombing the
factory.
</P>
<P>
Beko asked that if Zastava was bombed for the fact that the
military and police use its vehicles for transport, then should

<HEADLINE> UAE, France Hold Joint Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and France began joint military exercises Friday to enhance combat
abilities and readiness of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman of the UAE said that the exercises,
codenamed "Gulf 1-99," will last for several days, with land, air
and naval troops involved in the first day's war games.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said the UAE-French drills were one of a
series of exercises the UAE has decided to hold with friendly
countries this year.
</P>
<P>
The UAE-U.S. joint naval exercises, codenamed "Iron Fist 99,"
concluded last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 Gulf War, in which the U.S.-led alliance ended
Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait, the U.S., France and
Britain have sold billions of dollars worth of arms to Gulf
countries while conducting military exercises with them to enhance
their fighting capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is especially wary of its powerful neighbor Iran, with
which it has a territorial dispute over three Gulf islands: the Abu
Mousa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are located near the
strategic shipping lanes close to the mouth of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the UAE launched strong protest against the Iranian
naval exercises conducted near the islands. Iran flatly rejected
the protest, saying it was not wise for the UAE to condemn others
while itself was conducting military exercises frequently.

<HEADLINE> Nigerien PM Announces Dissolution of Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nairobi, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerien Prime Minister Ibrahim
Assane Mayaki Friday announced the dissolution of parliament and
the suspension of political activity after the sudden death of
President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister said over the state radio that the
present administration would keep in office until a national unity
government took over in the land-locked west African country.
</P>
<P>
Mainassara's death came "at a particularly grave moment in the
history of our country," Mayaki was quoted by Reuters as saying in
capital Niamey.
</P>
<P>
The political temperature rose sharply in Niamey Thursday with
an opposition call for Mainassara's resignation, which came after
the supreme court ordered poll reruns in the majority of
districts.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting in February was disrupted by violent attacks on
poll centers as the opposition appeared in the lead.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerien president was ambushed by soldiers at Niamey
Airport Friday as he was leaving for Filingue region, some 200
kilometers northeast of the capital city..
</P>
<P>
In capital Niamey itself, troops with tanks have reportedly
moved into the streets, blocking access to the presidential palace
and other key locations.
</P>
<P>
Since his election in July 1996, Mainassara had faced
relentless pressure from a militant opposition spearheaded largely
by leaders of the civilian government he overthrew in a coup
earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
Mainassara's regime has been grappling with a spate of public
service strikes which have further paralyzed the economy of the
land-locked west African country.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Workers to Protest Against Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The General Labor Confederation,
Lebanon's largest trade union, Friday called for sit-ins in Beirut
to protest against government's price hike policy in its 1999
budget.
</P>
<P>
The sit-ins will be held on April 21 in front of the prime
minister's palace and on the first day of the parliamentary debate
on budget bill, said a statement issued after an emergency meeting
of the 350,000-strong union. But the debate date has yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
The statement complained that the price hikes, especially the
rise on gasoline price, will impose more burdens on the middle-
and low-income classes.
</P>
<P>
It said the current government headed by Prime Minister Salim
Hoss is following suit of the previous administration of Rafik
Hariri, which received vociferous denunciations for heavy taxes
policies.
</P>
<P>
The government said the broad tax increases in the 1999 budget
endorsed Wednesday night were aimed at bringing down the deficit
to 3.37 trillion pounds (2.24 billion U.S. dollars), or about 40
percent of expenditure, from an estimated 58 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The bill includes a rise of 2,000 pounds (about 1.3 dollars) per
20 liters on gasoline; a 104 percent tax increase on imported
liquor, 55 percent on imported beer, 35 percent on cigarette and
35 percent on flowers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Repeats NATO Conditions for Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Friday repeated his demand the Yugoslavia comply with all NATO
conditions before considering an end to bombing against the
country.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is determined to persist and prevail," Clinton told
reporters at the White House, repeating a refrain he has used time
and again since airstrikes began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must accept all
the NATO's conditions, saying he should not just comply partially
or even give "the illusion of partial compliance."
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic must withdraw from Kosovo his military
police and paramilitary forces... He must permit deployment of an
international security force... He must allow the unconditional
return of al refugees... He must take these essential steps as we
move toward self-government and security for the people of
Kosovo," Clinton stressed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged there has been a wave of refugees since
the NATO bombing raids against Yugoslavia. But he attributed the
responsibility not on the NATO military campaign, instead, on the
Serb resistance to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
While the Yugoslav government was convincing ethnic Albanians
into staying in their home in Kosovo, Clinton again accused
President Milosevic of blocking their "escape routes... by force."
</P>
<P>
The wave of refugees now has become a burden to U.S.-led NATO,
which was beyond alliance's expectation when starting bombing. And
Clinton has to come to do what his government could do for the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"A C-5 aircraft, our largest transport plane, loaded with
humanitarian daily rations header for Albanian and Macedonia, will
be stocked," he said. "Thus far, we have seen 800,000 of the 1.1
million daily rations we pledged for the region."
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not mention a Cypriot leader's mission in Belgrade
to try and obtain the release of three U.S. soldiers from the
Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has announced to hand over the three U.S. soldiers
as a condition to stop conflict in Kosovo, but has been rejected
by U.S.-led NATO.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Weapons Inspector Barred From Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler was barred from attending Security
Council's consultations on Iraq, a U.N. diplomat said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said Russia had vowed to block Butler, Executive
Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, from ever
appearing before the Security Council in its closed session.
</P>
<P>
Butler, who had excluded from Council's Wednesday
consultations, decided to send his deputy, American Charles
Duelfer, in his place to attend the meeting this morning,
according to the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Russia wants Butler dismissed and UNSCOM replaced by another
commission. Russia slammed his December report, which said Iraq
failed to cooperate fully with the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Russia also blamed Butler for providing pretext for the United
States and Britain to launch military strikes against Iraq last
December by report that Iraq had not fully cooperated.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Price Up by 0.2 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The producer price, which
measures prices paid by wholesalers to U.S. producers such as
factories and refineries, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.2
percent in March as energy costs jumped sharply, the Labor
Department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mild increase in the department's Producer Price Index for
finished goods brought the annual rate of inflation at the
wholesale level to 1.5 percent so far in 1999, compared with a
tiny 0.1 percent price decline for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Prices of finished energy goods jumped 1.2 percent in March,
with gasoline rising 3.5 percent, heating oil soaring 13.1 percent
-- the most in five years, residential electricity edging 0.2
percent higher and natural gas falling 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, energy consumers likely face even sharper price
increases in the months ahead. Crude oil jumped 27.1 percent in
March, the biggest increase since October 1990, thanks to the
recent agreement by major oil producers to cut production.
</P>
<P>
Food costs paid by wholesalers rose a moderate 0.4 percent last
month. Fruit prices fell 5.5 percent, reflecting an 18.5 percent
drop for navel oranges and 5.9 percent for golden delicious
apples.
</P>
<P>
However, vegetable prices soared 20.2 percent, the most in
eight months, reflecting increases of 115.5 percent for eggplant,
67.9 percent for corn, 67.1 percent for lettuce and 45.4 percent
for tomatoes. Fish prices jumped 9.4 percent, the largest rise in
nearly 13 years. Pork and beef rose, too.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the
so-called "core" producer price was unchanged in March for the
second consecutive month. That reflects pressure on domestic
producers to compete with cheaply priced imports.
</P>
<P>
Economists look to the "core" rate to discern underlying
inflation trends. After the rebound in energy costs is absorbed
over the next several months, overall price pressures should once
again become tame, they believe.

<HEADLINE> New Water Act Gazetted In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government gazetted
a new water act Friday which will see the development and
utilization of water resources in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The act will provide for the control of the use of water when
it is in short supply; the protection of the environment and the
prevention and control of water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Under the new act, no person is entitled to ownership of any
water in Zimbabwe and no water is to be stored, abstracted,
apportioned, controlled, diverted or used in any way dealt with
except in accordance with this act.
</P>
<P>
It has taken a long time for the act to be gazetted because
some commercial farmers have strongly opposed the water bill,
saying the proposed law would violate their basic rights to
privately own water resources.
</P>
<P>
Some legislators felt it was necessary to re-draft the bill to
avoid situations where the state would be faced with many legal
challenges during the implementation of the budget.
</P>
<P>
The new act replaces the Water Act of 1976, bringing to an end
the system of exclusive water rights.
</P>
<P>
Water users will participate in the management of the resources
through their representatives who shall sit in the catchment
councils to be established.

Brazilian, who displayed occasional flashes of brilliance but
lacked consistency, sought to pin Rios on the backline.

<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Scientific and Industrial
Research and Development Center of Zimbabwe signed an agreement of
partnership with the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
Industrial Energy Management Project here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, SADC Industrial Energy Management Project
would embark on a two-year industrial energy management training
program for industrial personnel in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the program would be to enhance the ability of
industry to assess its energy to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
The energy to be assessed would include electricity, solid
fuels, liquid fuels and water.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Zimbabwean development center,
Christopher Chetsange said that the program would hopefully
improve energy management in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the industry would gain from this move as it is
looking for means of cutting on its energy bill without
sacrificing productivity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Director of the center, Mosad Emissiry told reporters that
Zimbabwe is importing about 40 percent of its energy from
Mozambique and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's energy management is very low and needs
to be supported by all stake-holders.
</P>
<P>
"Any effort to serve energy should be supported to cut on the
importation of energy and the huge bills the country has to pay,"
he said.

LONDON April 9 (Xinhua) - Commercial vehicle registrations
soared this march by 27.5 percent, from 30902 in 1998 to 39409,
according to the latest figures by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders(SMMT).
</P>
<P>
The introduction of 'T' registration vehicles from 1 March
particularly affected smaller sectors of the market. LCVs under
1800kg are up 24.4 percent; those from 1801-3500kg soared by 32.6
percent; and light 4x4 utilities rose 27.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The heavier end was less affected, due mainly to pre-planned
buying cycles and the repercussions of pre-budget VED uncertainty,
said the SMMT.
</P>
<P>
However, the trucks sector did enlarge by 17.9 percent to 5632
from 4777 last year. Buses and coaches were similarly buoyant,
enjoying a healthy swell from 448 to 545.
</P>
<P>
Year to date (YTD), the overall market for the first quarter is
slightly down on 1998's strong performance, down 5.2 percent with
72553 registrations compared to last year's 76573.

LONDON April 9 (Xinhua) - New technologies to help businesses
reduce their impact on the environment will get a helping hand
from the Government in a new scheme announced Friday by Energy
Minister John Battle.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local entrepreneurs at a conference in Cambridge,
Battle said the Sustainable Technologies Initiative (STI) will
help UK businesses face up to the challenges of sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, 7.8 million pounds will be available
to support the development of new technologies that will help
business by:
</P>
<P>
- being more efficient in the use of resources;
</P>
<P>
- producing less waste and pollution;
</P>
<P>
- aiming for greater social equity in their operations and
products.
</P>
<P>
Proposed programs under the STI will cover the development of
more sustainable manufacturing processes and more sustainable
products.
</P>
<P>
Battle said sustainable technologies could not only reduce the
impact of business on the environment and society, but also
improve their competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
However, "sustainability will be one of the major challenges
facing business as we go into the next century. To meet this
challenge we will need to develop new processes, new products, and
new ways of doing business," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerien PM Confirms Assasination of President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nairobi, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerien President President
Ibrahim Bare Mainassara was killed at Niamey Airport Friday,
Nigerien Prime Minister Ibrahim Assane Mayaki confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Mayaki announced Mainassara's death on the state radio, Reuters
said in a report from the Nigerien capital Niamey.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was quoted as saying that the president had
been killed in an "unfortunate accident."
</P>
<P>
The report said that soldiers fired on the president in an
ambush at the airport as Mainassara was said to have left for
Filingue region, about 200 kilometers northeast of the capital
city.
</P>
<P>
In capital Niamey itself, troops with tanks have reportedly
moved into the streets, blocking access to the presidential palace
and other key locations.
</P>
<P>
The political temperature rose sharply in Niamey Thursday with
an opposition call for his resignation, which came after the
supreme court ordered poll reruns in the majority of districts.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting in February was disrupted by violent attacks on
poll centers as the opposition appeared in the lead.
</P>
<P>
Since his election in July 1996, Mainassara had faced
relentless pressure from a militant opposition spearheaded largely
by leaders of the civilian government he overthrew in a coup
earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
Mainassara's regime has been grappling with a spate of public
service strikes which have further paralyzed the economy of the
land-locked west African country.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. to Continue to Work for Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
and U.S. Vice-President Al Gore reaffirmed here Friday that China and
the United States will continue to work together for the protection of
the global environment.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and Gore made the reaffirmation at the second session of the
China-U.S. Forum on Environment and Development.
</P>
<P>
"Environment and development are major issues of general interest
of the international community today and how to protect the ecological
environment on which mankind depends for subsistence and development,
while developing the economy, has become a pressing and arduous task
facing the people across the world," Zhu said when speaking at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said China and the United States held the first session of the
forum in Beijing in 1997. Over the past two years, he said, the two
countries have conducted extensive exchanges and cooperation in
various fields covered in the forum and made positive progress in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that at this session the two countries will review the
progress made during the last two years, share experience and look
into the future. "This will be of great significance to increase
mutual beneficial cooperation between our two sides to meet the
challenges of the new century," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China will use more clean energy so as to protect the
environment better. To do that, he said, the government need to
restructure the economy and to use more natural gas and other clean
energy and oil.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, China and the United States have indeed conducted
very productive cooperation in environment protection, especially in
1997, when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the United States and
the two countries signed the initiative on environment and
development.
</P>
<P>
During U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China last year,
China and the United States signed a letter of intent for the urban
air quality monitoring between the two sides, thus further deepening
the bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who co-sponsored the first session of the forum with then
Chinese Premier Li Peng when he visited China in March 1997, said
today that the United States and China have a very strong interest in
working together to find ways to solve the environment problem, which
also allow the two countries to continue the economic progress.
</P>
<P>
"We have gathered some of the best minds from both of our
countries, and we have asked them to work together to find new ways to
achieve our common goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that the United States and China are a world apart, and
so much of "our work together must," therefore, inevitably be done
long-distance. "That should make us appreciate all the more the
opportunity for today's face-to-face meetings, an uncommon
opportunity, which we should seize, to move forward toward a cleaner,
brighter and better future for both of our peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the first session of the forum, China and the United States
agreed to strengthen their cooperation in energy and environment
through an initiative to accelerate clean energy projects and the
appropriate transfer of related technologies.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China's State Planning Commission and the U.S. Energy
Department signed the China-U.S. initiative on energy and environment
cooperation to promote effective cooperation in these fields, including
the use of clean energy.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived in the United States Tuesday for an eight-day official
visit to the country, the first by a Chinese premier in 15 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China Friday called on
parties concerned to show political will in solving the issue of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after attending Security Council
consultations on Iraq, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to
the United Nations Shen Guofang said the Security Council had
started the process of reviewing the Iraqi panels' report.
</P>
<P>
Shen said there were some constructive proposals in the reports
and he hoped that the reports would serve as a basis for the
Council to find a way out of the current deadlock regarding Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the solution to the current deadlock hinged upon the
political will of the parties concerned, and moreover, cooperation
from Iraq was also very important.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China supported U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in
continuing to play an active role in the current process.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the continued airstrikes in the so-called no-fly
zones in Iraq were not conducive, he urged the parties concerned
to stop the military operations as soon as possible so as to
create a good atmosphere for an early solution of the Iraq
question.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Reduce Troops in S. Lebanon: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Moshe
Arens said on Friday that he will propose to the government to
reduce the number of Israel Defense Force (IDF) in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Israel television channel one, Arens
said he has this idea for some time and is thinking about to
reduce the IDF number in the security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The IDF will continue to transfer some of the IDF outposts
into the hands of the South Lebanese Army (SLA) inside the
security zone, through which the number of the IDF soliders could
be reduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
Till now, he said, about 70 percent of the military outposts
inside the security zone have already been transferred into the
hands of the SLA and the IDF will hand over more to them.
</P>
<P>
Transferring more outposts to the SLA can help reduce the IDF
numbers and by this way it could help prevent more casualties of
the IDF in the security zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he added, this does not mean that Israel is to
withdraw its troops from the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with
a self-claimed purpose of protecting its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese military groups such as Hezbollah have been waging
military resistance against the IDF since then.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges End to Hostilities in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday unanimously adopted a resolution demanding "an immediate
halt to the hostilities" in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and calling for "the immediate signing of a cease-fire agreement
allowing the orderly withdrawal of all foreign forces."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "welcomes the intention of the Government
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to hold an all-inclusive
national debate as a precursor to elections, and encourages
further progress in this regard," said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution condemns all massacres carried out on the
territory of the Congo (K) and "calls for an international
investigation into all events, including those in the province of
South Kivu and other atrocities," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council slammed "the continuing activity of and
support to all armed groups" in the country, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed its support for the regional
mediation process by the Organization of African Unity and the
Southern African Development Community to find a peaceful
settlement of the conflict in the Congo (K) and called on the
international community to continue to support these efforts, the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe Thursday
recommitted themselves to helping their ally President Laurent
Kabila fight a rebellion in the Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
After two days of talks in the Angolan capital of Luanda which
some analysts had thought might produce a cease-fire proposal, the
leaders said that they would continue to provide assistance to the
embattled Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola sent troops and military equipment
to the Congo (K) last August to help Kabila fight a rebellion
backed by Uganda and Rwanda.

a strategic alliance, Mexican President President Ernesto Zedillo
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo said this at the official welcoming ceremony for
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien in the center of the capital
city, which happens to occur during the 55th anniversary of the

countries.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican President expressed his satisfaction at the fifth
anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo highlighted the benefit brought by NAFTA to the two
countries, saying that five years after the signing of the
agreement, trade exchanges between Mexico and Canada grew 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Mexicans feel very proud of their relation with Canada,
because it is founded on mutual respect and a firm friendship, in
growing affinities and in the search for reciprocal benefits,"

</P>
<P>
He said that Chretien's visit will strengthen the constructive
dialogue between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Raps Israeli Acts Against Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Friday denounced
Israel's aggressive practices against the Palestinian people,
asserting that such acts contradict international laws.
</P>
<P>
The league made the denunciation in a statement marking the
Deir Yassin massacre perpetrated by Zionist gangs against the
Palestinians on April 9, 1947.
</P>
<P>
The league said the Israeli onslaught against the Palestinians
was continuing in an attempt to get rid of the Arab presence in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement underlined that all the abhorrent and racist
practices by Israel will not undermine the Palestinian people's
steadfastedness on their rights, including setting up an
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
But Israel maintains that Jerusalem is its "undivided and
eternal capital" and is taking steps to judaize the holy city.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the world community to curb the current
practices of the Israeli government and counter its Zionist policy
based on driving Palestinian inhabitants out of their land so as
to build Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
The statement also lauded the stance adopted by the European
Union (EU), which voiced its clear support for the Palestinians'
rights to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The EU issued a statement last month, saying that the
Palestinians have "unqualified right to self-determination,
including the option of a state."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has threatened to declare an
independent state on May 4 when the five-year interim self-rule
period enshrined in Oslo accords expires.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is on a global campaign to rally international support
for the plan and recognition for the future Palestinian state.

said. (Russia-Italy-Kosovo)

<HEADLINE> IRA Rejects Peace Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army (IRA)
confirmed on Saturday its rejection of last week's draft
declaration on the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Senior representatives said they were "unimpressed" by the
efforts of British and Irish Governments to advance the Northern
Ireland peace process, according to BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The news is a serious blow to hopes of achieving a breakthrough
on the thorny issue of arms decomissioning when talks resume on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
IRA personnel told journalists in briefings that the draft
document drawn up after marathon multi-party talks at
Hillsborough, near Belfast, showed the two governments failed to
address the Ulster Unionist "veto" on progress in the peace accord
and had caused anger among republicans.
</P>
<P>
IRA's political wing Sinn Fein has rejected the peace
declaration, saying it has had "massive change" to the peace
agreement signed a year ago and was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
The peace declaration said decommissioning of IRA and other
terrorist arms was not a condition for the entry of Sinn Fein into
a power-sharing executive of a new assembly. But it stated that
there was an obligation to hand over weapons to meet the
requirements of last year's peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Smile and Surprise: Chinese Audience Come Across New Curies in French Comedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese theatergoers attending
the Friday night Chang'an Theater presentation of a new French
comedy exhibited both surprise and amusement at the new face
portrayed for highly-respected Nobel Prize winners Pierre and
Marie Curie.
</P>
<P>
"My generation worships scientists, especially prestigious
scientists like the Curies," said a middle-aged medical school
professor, adding that "I was quite frankly pleased with the new
face of the seemingly familiar scientists and was shocked by the
jokes and innuendoes."
</P>
<P>
Two students from the Beijing Broadcast Institute praised the
comical effect, but nonetheless voiced their disapproval of the "
depiction" of the scientists whom they studied and learned to
respect.
</P>
<P>
Playwright Jean-Noel Fenwick flew to Beijing to see his comedy -
- The Palm of Mr. Shutz -- staged in China, the 18th country to
stage the comedy.
</P>
<P>
Fenwick, a literature major and journalist, entered the ranks
of professional authors in 1988. His first drama -- The Palm of Mr.
Schutz -- won 11 nominations and won four French Moliere Awards in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Fenwick said his goal was to offer audiences a fresh
perspective enabling them to observe the lives of the renowned
scientists. He proceeded on the basis of historical and scientific
fact, and used brave artistic exaggerations for comedy.
</P>
<P>
French ambassador to China Pierre Morel sent a letter of
congratulations to the Chinese cast and commented that the
dramatist disclosed the complexities of human nature in the
scientific community. The ultimate purpose of scientific research
failed to hinder the Curies' enjoyment of life, including the
beauty of nature, and both their enthusiasm for work and mutual
love.
</P>
<P>
Wei Xiaoping translated and directed the comedy staged with a
cast from the China National Youth Theater. Wei said Chinese
scientists requested that he avoid following the old path of
stereotyping them as scientific geniuses and idiots of life.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining a balance between the humanity of scientific
saints and considering the acceptability of traditional viewers is
very much like dancing in chains," said Wei.
</P>
<P>
Ding Jiali, the recipient of a series of national drama and
movie awards, cited her role as Marie Curie as an ultimate
challenge.
</P>
<P>
"I totally rejected the new image of Marie. However, reading
biographies vividly opened my eyes to a wise, lovely, humorous and
even naughty Marie, and I simply accepted the challenge," said
Ding.
</P>
<P>
"The conflict between the purity of science and the vanity of
authority, as well as the inconsistency between lofty ideals and
harsh reality in the play reflect our lives, and lead us to
meditation after laughter," said Producer Luo Dajun.
</P>
<P>
"The Curies wear stiff face, while mine is wild and cheerful,"
said Fenwick, adding that "the true Curies are between the two
dimensions."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Military Vows to Avenge Its Deputy Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC) Saturday vowed to avenge the killing of
Brigadier General Ali Sayyad Shirazi, deputy chief of the joint
staff of the Iranian armed force.
</P>
<P>
Expressing condolence to Shirazi's family, Commander of IRGC
Rahim Safavi said under the command of the Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the IRGC and the army are ready to counter
any plot of the enemies, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shirazi was killed at 0645 hours local time (0215 GMT) in
northern Tehran as he left home for work, the agency said. It gave
no details.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based Iranian opposition MKO has claimed responsibility
for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
The armed opposition group said that Shirazi was targeted
because he was responsible for purging and executing military
personnel and the death of hundreds of thousands of teenagers in
the Iraqi-Iranian war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Shirazi, born in 1944, served as commander of the Iranian
army's land force during the Iranian-Iraqi war.
</P>
<P>
The MKO has claimed responsibility for several assassinations
in Iran, including the killing last August of Assadollah
Lajevardi, the former head of Iran's Prisons Organization.
</P>
<P>
The MKO had fought against the former Iranian shah regime, but
was outlawed in 1981 due to sharp difference with the then Iranian
government.
</P>
<P>
It has since launched a series of attacks on Iranian interests
inside and outside Iran. In retaliation, the Iranian armed forces
also bombed the MKO bases in Iraq several times.
</P>
<P>
Following Shirazi's assassination, senior Iranian leaders,
including President Mohammad Khatami, Chairman of the State
Expediency Council Hashemi Rafsanjani and Majlis (parliament)
Speaker Nateq Nouri, issued condolence messages over the killing.

XIANDU (Zhejiang), April 10 (Xinhua) -- Volunteers
participating in the 10-day workcamp in Xiandu, east China's
Zhejiang Province, reluctantly expressed fond farewells today.
</P>
<P>
The volunteers from a number of countries, including China,
Japan, the Netherlands and Australia, focused on environmental
protection and expanding cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The group planted trees, repaired roads and provided various
volunteer services to residents in Xiandu, in addition to visit
cultural relics in the local area.
</P>
<P>
"The volunteers planted the seeds of friendship in China," said
Scottish volunteer Gavin Starks. "I'll return to the lovely town
of Xiandu someday," he added.
</P>
<P>
The beautiful scenery in Xiandu left volunteers with a deep
impression. Kayano Takashi, an elderly Japanese man participating
in the China International Young Volunteers Workcamp, said that
everyone should make an effort to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Joo Young-oh, a teenager from the Republic of Korea, said that
environmental protection is a global issue. He added that mankind
should coexist with the nature and leave a harmonious world for
later generations.
</P>
<P>
Australian Graeme Smith, who currently studies environmental
impact assessment at Beijing University, said he plans to
interview Chinese environmental experts and representatives from
nongovernmental Chinese organizations.
</P>
<P>
"I also plan to study the relationship between NGOs in China,
as well as environmental protection organizations and the nation's
policies concerning related issues."
</P>
<P>
The successful experiences gained in Xiandu have provided him
with good material for later environmental protection efforts,
according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
Starks expressed hope that the work of the volunteers will
provide Chinese people with a greater awareness of the fact that
China should avoid Western mistakes regarding the issue and in
turn enable them to enjoy a better environment.

<HEADLINE> Iran Determined to Support Palestinians: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi stated Saturday that Iran is still determined to support
the ideals of Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting head of the Political Department of
the Palestine Liberation Organization Farouk Kadoumy, Kharrazi
said despite foreign pressure, Tehran stands to support the causes
of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Jerusalem is not a Palestinian problem, but a
problem of the world of Islam, the Islamic Republic News Agency
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance for a continued Palestinian
resistance to the Israeli expansionist policies, saying that most
of the crises gripping the region have their roots in Israel's
expansionist policies.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iran's disapproval of the Middle East peace
talks, saying that Iran had predicted the futility of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which has been calling for military struggle against
Israel, strongly criticized Palestinian leaders for making
compromise with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumi, who arrived here Friday, praised Iran's stands
toward the Palestinian cause, saying "from the very beginning, we
were of the belief that the Oslo agreement would not lead to a
just peace" to the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. failure to remain impartial and the increasing
expansionist policies of the Israeli regime have contributed to
further violation of Palestinian rights, he said.

<HEADLINE> Plenary Meeting of MSAR Preparatory Committee Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese vice-Premier Qian Qichen
today expressed his confidence that the Selection Committee for
the First Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region (
MSAR) will be fully capable of selecting a candidate for the
position as the region's first chief executive.
</P>
<P>
The 200-odd member Selection Committee was announced today at
the closing session of 7th Plenary Meeting of the Preparatory
Committee for the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
Qian, chairman of the Preparatory Committee, said that
formation of the Selection Committee is the core of ending
colonial rule over Macao and establishing the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
Members, all influential figures in Macao, have participated in
various aspects of social and public affairs, according to Qian.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that Portuguese descendants with permanent
Macao residence have been elected to the Selection Committee
demonstrates the broad representation on the body.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting ended with the adoption of three documents
covering methods for forming the first MSAR Legislative Council,
the decision on establishing an independent committee responsible
of recommending judges and the decision on the emblem, seal and
flag of public institutions of the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the important documents will form a solid
foundation for the establishment of the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
The methods for forming the first Legislative Council mainly
involves the establishment of the Legislative Council in terms of
both principle and procedure.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee will also be responsible of selecting
new members of the Legislative Council once there are vacancies,
said Qian.
</P>
<P>
He noted the formation of an independent committee to recommend
judges is part of preparations for establishing the MSAR judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Judges for Macao courts at various levels were for many years
appointed by the Portuguese government. However, local judicial
officers have been appointed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Formation of the MSAR judiciary is one of the Preparatory
Committee's important tasks in accordance with the 1993 decision
of the National People's Congress, said Qian, adding that the
committee will also formulate stipulations governing the formation
of various other MSAR judicial departments.

<HEADLINE> Wild Siberian Tiger Population Drops in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Wildlife experts said today that
less than 20 Siberian tigers currently live in the wild in China
due to deteriorating ecological environment
</P>
<P>
The population figure was reached following a two-month joint
investigation by wildlife experts from China, the United States
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, carried out between January 16 and the end
of March, covered major tiger habitats in Heilongjiang and Jilin
provinces, northeast China. Extensive information was obtained by
tracing tiger footprints and interviewing eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Guan Guosheng, a representative of the Heilongjiang Wild Animal
Research Institute, said the province has only five to eight wild
Siberian tigers, with an additional 10-odd animals living in the
wild in neighboring Jilin.
</P>
<P>
"Heilongjiang and Jilin were home to some 20-30 wild tigers in
the early 1990s, down substantially from the 80-odd tigers some 20
years ago in Heilongjiang alone," said Guan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the deteriorating environment mainly caused by
extensive felling of trees is to blame for the rapid decrease.
</P>
<P>
China plans to introduce a comprehensive plan to protect
natural forests in northeast China and will demarcate wild tiger
protection zones in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers, one of the world's most endangered species,
are dispersed in natural habitats in Siberia and northeast China.
Chinese zoos currently house some 100-odd such animals.

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
left here Saturday for Denver to continue his official visit in
the United States, after achieving significant progress with the U.
S. side on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Washington for Denver, the third stop of his U.S.
trip, the Chinese Premier issued a joint statement with U.S.
President Bill Clinton concerning China's entry into the WTO, in
which the United States expressed its strong support for the
accession of China to the WTO in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the two leaders reaffirmed that the two
countries have advanced substantially their common goal of China's
accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed an agreement on U.S.-China
agricultural cooperation earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the two countries signed a protocol to the agreement
relating to civil air transport.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement and the significant consensus achieved on a
broad range of market access and Protocol issues have further
advanced that goal," said the Joint Statement.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu and President Clinton have instructed their trade
ministers to continue bilateral negotiations in order to
satisfactorily resolve the important remaining issues and reach
agreement on strong commercial terms as soon as possible,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is the first Chinese premier to visit the United
States in 15 years, arrived in Los Angeles on April 6 for the
official visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Washington, Zhu exchanged views
with President Clinton and other American leaders on China-U.S.
relations as well as international and regional issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
He also co-chaired with U.S. Vice President Al Gore the second

OTTAWA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Friday that it

<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Tome said that preparations,

smoothly under the leadership of the commission.
</P>

framework of electoral laws, but should definitely be held within
this year, and by no means be postponed, Tome said.
</P>
<P>
The government and parliament are operating normally, Tome
said, any postponement, as rumored by some western powers and
opposition parties, will force the president to have a care-taker
government, which is not necessary.
</P>
<P>
Tome said the ruling Frelimo party has created every condition
to win in the coming elections, citing the fast development of the
country's economy as one of the very important conditions for its
victory.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Threatens to Hit Backers of S. Leone Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peace-keeping
force of ECOMG has threatened to bomb all channels involved in
the supply of heavy arms to the rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG force commander Major General Felix Mujakpero said in
capital Freetown Friday that the present tension between ECOMOG
and the Liberian government was sparked off by a massive arms
shipment by Liberia on behalf of the rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"We shall proceed to strike at all the channels involved in
the movement of heavy arms and ammunition to the rebels by land,
sea and air, " The Post Express paper Saturday quoted the
commander as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, a Ukrainian registered cargo
aircraft ANTENOV 124 carrying 68 tons of arms arrived in
Ouagaduogou, capital of Burkina Faso, and was parked at the
presidential wing of the airport.
</P>
<P>
The arms were transported to Robertuille International Airport
in Monrovia and subsequently to Gbanga, a neighboring town in
Liberia with Sierra Leone for onward delivery to the RUF rebels,
it added.
</P>
<P>
Mujakperuo specifically warned the government of President
Charles Tayor that "we will no longer watch this mischief by
supposed leaders continuing side by side with the peace efforts
by the government of Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that the encouragement being given by the leaders
of Liberia and Burkina Faso toward the continuation of the war in
Sierra Leone by the rebels must be condemned.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG commander warned that ECOMOG will not hesitate to
strike where necessary to forestall all the schemes being
packaged to undermine the peace efforts in the sub-region.

</P>
<P>
In addition, Chongqing's sales-production ratio has grown
remarkably in the wake of a booming market. For example, the sales/
production ratio for both textiles and chemical products grew by
21 percentage points, with the ratio for electronic products and
light industrial products rising by 10 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume for motor vehicles and other products
manufactured by national defense industries, which account for
nearly 25 percent of Chongqing's total industrial sales value,
increased by 37.7 percent to 4.51 billion yuan in the three-month
period and effectively reversed last year's loss-making conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli naval vessel opened fire
at a Palestinian fishing boat off the southern coast of the Gaza
Strip Saturday, wounding two Palestinian fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The wounded Palestinian fishermen were taken to Khan Yunis
Hospital for treatment and one of them was in a very serious
condition, according to a Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military said that the incident occurred Saturday
morning at the Mediterranean Sea, some 25 kilometers off the
southern coast of the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli naval patrol vessel intercepted the Palestinian
fishing boasts and asked them to stop for inspection, but one of
the fishing boats did not stop and tried to flee, so the patrol
vessel opened fire at it while in chasing, the military said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority are at dispute
over fishing areas off the coast of the Gaza Strip. Israel insists
that the Palestinians can only fish at a distance of 12 kilometers
from the coast, while the Palestinian side said it should be 20
kilometers.

<HEADLINE> HK Enjoys More Monetary Autonomy After Handover: Yam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong enjoys a higher
degree of monetary autonomy after it became a special
administrative region of China on July 1, 1998, Joseph Yam, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), its monetary relationship with China's mainland has
been handled strictly in accordance with the "one country, two
systems" principle, Yam noted in a speech at a symposium in
commemoration of the ninth anniversary of the promulgation of the
Basic Law of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Yam said the legal protection offered by the Basic Law, the
constitutional instrument of the HKSAR, has, to a very great
extent, contributed to Hong Kong's monetary stability during the
political transition and has enabled Hong Kong to withstand the
severe challenges brought about by the unprecedented financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law provides that the HKSAR government shall, on its
own, formulate monetary and financial policies to maintain the
status of Hong Kong as an international financial center, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
"The high level of monetary autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong, as
provided in the Basic Law and the monetary legislation, is not
just something written into laws, it is also realized in our
actual implementation of monetary policies," Yam stressed.
</P>
<P>
The financial turmoil that erupted just after the transfer of
government has subjected Hong Kong's monetary autonomy to a
rigorous testing, he said.
</P>
<P>
When the HK dollar and the financial markets were under great
pressure and the economic and monetary conditions were extremely
difficult, all the measures to address the financial crisis,
including the market operation undertaken last August for the
purpose of preserving order in Hong Kong's financial markets, were
entirely formulated by the government of the HKSAR on its own, he
said.
</P>
<P>
During this period of financial turmoil, the central government
has strictly adhered to the provisions of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The central government has shown confidence in the ability of
the HKSAR government and has not interfered in Hong Kong's
monetary affairs, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
The success of the HKSAR government in addressing the financial
turmoil has fully demonstrated the effectiveness of "Hong Kong
people ruling Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
An issue related to monetary autonomy is the handling of the
monetary relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland under the
"one country, two systems" principle, especially given that the
economic relationship between the two places has become
increasingly close, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
The relationship can be best summarized as "one country, two
currencies, two monetary systems and two mutually independent
monetary authorities."
</P>
<P>
Financial business between the mainland and Hong Kong is
treated as international financial affairs and conducted in
accordance with the rules and practices of international financial
activities, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong continues its participation in international
financial activities in accordance with the provisions of the
Basic Law, which provides that the HKSAR may, using the name of "
Hong Kong, China," maintain and develop financial ties with
different countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Following the handover, Hong Kong has become even more active
in the international financial scene, Yam noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition to further developing cooperation with regional
central banks, the HKMA has strengthened its ties with
multilateral and international financial institutions such as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the Bank for
International Settlements, he added.

<HEADLINE> Agassi, Becker in Hong Kong Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Third seed Andre Agassi of the
United States outplayed Hendrik Dreekmann of Germany in straight
sets here Saturday to join veteran German player Boris Becker in
the final of Salem Hong Kong Open.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, the only non-German player in the semi-finals, overcame
an early deficit to beat Dreekmann, who eliminated American
Michael Chang and top seed Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, 6-
3, 6-0 in 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
After losing his first game in the opening set, Agassi, who
conceded no more than three games in every set he played in the
tournament, found rhythm and broke back to level the score quickly.
</P>
<P>
Dreekmann seemed to have lost confidence when he led 40-0 but
was broken by swift Agassi in his first game of the second set.
Agassi then served three aces in the next game to make it 3-0 and
broke a slackened Dreekmann twice again to win the match.
</P>
<P>
Agassi said he did not find rhythm right away at the beginning
of the match but gradually got comfortable with his serves and
shots. "I focused quickly and took every point seriously," he said.
</P>
<P>
Confirming a report about his planning of divorce with actress
Brook Shields, the former world No.1 said he has come to Hong Kong
simply because he "needs to play more tennis."
</P>
<P>
Agassi, now having a chance to win his first title of the year,
said he felt good both physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
Dreekmann said he had two chances in the first set but Agassi
played so fast and "there's no much to do like that."
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old and 98th-ranked German, who started to cheer
himself up after a nice shot in the last part of the match, said
he was satisfied with his performance since he had beaten such
strong players as Krajicek and Chang.
</P>
<P>
He said the Hong Kong Open gave him confidence and he is "
looking forward to Tokyo (Japan Open)."
</P>
<P>
In the other semi-final match, experiences helped Becker to
defeat countryman Bernd Karbacher 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Karbacher seemed to be unstoppable on his way to the semifinal
as the 31-year-old ousted No. 2 seed Patrick Rafter in the first
round and seventh seed Jonas Bjorkman in the quarter-final.
</P>
<P>
Becker, seeking his 50th career title, anticipated the final
with in-form Agassi a "50-50" match, saying he is now enjoying
tennis and is doing his best to play rather than caring too much
about the title.

<HEADLINE> Tarim Oil Field Ranks Eighth Largest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tarim Oil Field in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has emerged as the
country's eighth largest crude oil and natural gas producer.
</P>
<P>
Today marks the 10th anniversary of oil and gas exploration and
exploitation at the Tarim Oil Field which is located in the Tarim
Basin in southern Xinjiang. More than 20,000 skilled personnel and
workers have participated in developing the field over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
"The field has produced some 20 million tons of crude oil and
more than three billion cu.m. of natural gas, with total revenues
surpassing 3.44 billion yuan," according to Liao Yongyuan,
director of the Tarim Oil Exploration and Exploitation
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The field has an annual crude oil production capacity of five
million tons, with actual annual production hitting 4.2 million
tons in 1997. The figure represented a dramatic increase compared
with the 34,000 tons produced in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Liao said "the field has maintained a stable production, with
the daily average output of each well reaching 80 tons, 16 times
the national average."
</P>
<P>
Chinese geologists have discovered that the Tarim Basin, an
area about the same size as France, has 10.8 billion tons in
petroleum reserves, as well as 8.4 trillion cu.m. of natural gas.
The area is reputed as the "Ocean of Hope" for China's petroleum
industry.

MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Army Sgt. Alipio
Lozada, abducted by the New People's Army (NPA) on March 5, is set
to be released by the rebels in Mindanao Sunday, Philippine News
Agency quoted Senator Legarda as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Legarda, who had helped broker the successful release on Friday
of Police Chief Inspector Roberto Bernal in Sorsogon, said Lozada
would likely be released in Caraga region.
</P>
<P>
Lozada is being held captive by the NPA in Surigao del Sur.
</P>
<P>
Legarda expressed confidence that Lozada's safe and orderly
release would push through, "assuming that conditions favor such."
</P>
<P>
"If the military and police forces in Surigao del Sur will
exercise as much self-restraint and discipline as the government
troops in Albay and Sorsogon, where Bernal was released, then we
see no reason why Lozada's release should be aborted," Legarda
said.
</P>
<P>
Legarda stressed the need for the rebels to complete the
release of all the four military officers on or before their
self-imposed April 19 deadline.
</P>
<P>
"This would create a lot of goodwill between the rebels and the
government and guarantee the resumption of the stalled peace
negotiations," Legarda said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels abducted and took hostage four military and police
officers during the past two months.

<HEADLINE> German Envoy Arrives, Khatami Invited for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A German special envoy arrived
here Saturday morning to submit an official invitation from
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to his Iranian counterpart
Mohammad Khatami to visit Germany.
</P>
<P>
Bodo Hombach, head of the Federal Chancellery, arrived here
after the Iranian judiciary on Thursday granted a release on bail
to German businessman Helmut Hofer, who had been sentenced to
death for having "illegal sexual relations" with an Iranian Muslim
woman.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Hombach was appointed as Schroeder's special
envoy in charge of the Hofer case.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, the German envoy said that the governments of
Iran and Germany are doing their best to improve bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to break all the barriers and the time has
come now to have another start for expanding our ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hombach said his visit aims at strengthening economic and
cultural ties between the two countries and the two governments
are determined to cement their ties in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Germany has been Iran's biggest trading partner. However,
bilateral ties were strained in April, 1997 after a Berlin court
accused Iranian leaders of sponsoring terrorist assassinations
against Iranian dissidents in Germany.
</P>
<P>
A possible rapprochement between the two sides was then blocked
by the death sentence on the German businessman.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in September, 1997 at Tehran international
airport together with an Iranian woman who was waiting for him,
upon his arrival from Germany. He was then sentenced to death by a
local court in Tehran in January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under Iranian law, non-Muslim men are forbidden from having any
sexual relations with Muslim women.
</P>
<P>
Hofer appealed the court ruling by claiming that he had
converted to Islam before meeting the Iranian woman. And Bonn has
repeatedly called on Tehran to release Hofer.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old businessman reportedly would be delivered to
the German envoy during his visit.
</P>
<P>
However, an Iranian judicial spokesman said on Thursday that
Hofer would not be allowed to leave Iran and could be brought back
for trial again.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Complete Agrarian Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 90,000 hectares of land
have been turned over to Philippine farmers since the new
government took over on June 30 and almost 127,000 hectares more
are due for distribution soon in line with the goal of President
Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Philippine News Agency Saturday,
the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) has already distributed
90,779 hectares to farmers beneficiaries and another 126,699
hectares are in various stages of documentation prior to
distribution under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program
(CARP) which the president plans to wrap up under his watch.
</P>
<P>
"Agrarian reform is one of the foundations of the Estrada
administration's commitment to food security, poverty reduction
and countryside development," DAR said in a performance report
submitted recently to the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The DAR reported that it has also executed 6,558 leasehold
contracts covering 13,450 hectares of land and benefiting 7,271
farmers and sponsored 1,202 training programs for 24,120
beneficiaries and field personnel.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, DAR vowed to complete the turnover of 1.3 million
hectares to farmers, representing the remaining 40 percent of
CARP-covered lands, in pursuit of President Estrada's 1998 order
for DAR to complete during his term the land reform program
implemented by the previous Aquino and Ramos administrations.
</P>
<P>
DAR Secretary Horacio Morales Jr. said the completion of CARP
is an integral part of the Estrada administration's three-pronged
comprehensive rural development policy.
</P>
<P>
The three components of this broad-based rural development
approach are food security and agricultural modernization,
equitable access to land and other natural resources and watershed
management and an ecosystems approach.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Confident of Basic Law Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Elsie Leung, secretary for
Justice, said here Saturday that she has confidence in the full
implementation of the Basic Law with goodwill on both sides of the
mainland and Hong Kong and improved mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium in commemoration of the ninth
anniversary of the promulgation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR), Leung reviewed the
significant developments under the Basic Law in such important
areas as adaptation of laws and mutual legal assistance between
the SAR and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Noting steady progress in the adaptation of laws, she said that
in the past year, a number of adaptation ordinances have been
passed. They deal with a wide range of matters, including
references to foreign countries, courts and tribunals,
interpretative provisions and nationality related matters.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six other adaptation bills have been introduced and are
now going through the legislative process, she said.
</P>
<P>
Leung said important steps have been taken to develop mutual
legal assistance between the SAR and the mainland and progress in
this area has been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, an agreement was signed in respect of the
mutual service of judicial documents in civil and commercial
proceedings between mainland and SAR courts.
</P>
<P>
This agreement provides the necessary rules to regulate the
service of judicial documents in civil and commercial proceedings
between the SAR and the rest of China and fills the vacuum created
when the relevant Hague Convention ceased to apply to cross-
boundary service after Hong Kong's return to China, she said.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, major principles were agreed with
relevant mainland authorities on the new arrangements for direct
and mutual recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards between
the SAR and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Leung said a draft agreement is being discussed, with only a
small number of issues still outstanding.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the progress of the discussions between the SAR
government and the Central People's Government is encouraging and
it is hoped that agreement will be reached soon.
</P>
<P>
These positive developments are examples of close cooperation
between the mainland and the SAR.
</P>
<P>
"With such cooperation and the consolidated effort of the SAR
government and the people of Hong Kong, I trust that our
collective enterprise of translating the high principles and
values enshrined in the Basic Law into reality will be a huge
success," she said.
</P>
<P>
Leung said: "Although we have less than two years' experience
of operating under the Basic Law, its strengths are already
apparent."
</P>
<P>
She said the fact that controversial issues have arisen should
come as no surprise, adding, "I am confident that, with goodwill
on both sides and improved mutual understanding, the controversial
issues that must from time to time arise can all be satisfactorily
resolved within one country in accordance with the Basic Law."

Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The Arab League Friday denounced Israel's aggressive
practices against the Palestinian people, calling such acts
contradictory to international laws.
</P>
<P>
The league made the denunciation in a statement marking the
Deir Yassin massacre perpetrated by Zionist gangs against the
Palestinians on April 9, 1947.
</P>
<P>
The league said the Israeli onslaught against the Palestinians
was continuing in an attempt to get rid of the Arab presence in

in Oslo, Norway in 1994 expires.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Mail:
</P>
<P>
-- Switzerland has suspended its sanctions against Libya, which
include a freeze on Libyan assets, imposed after the North African
state refused to hand over two men linked to the bombing a Pan Am
jet over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, which is not a member of the United Nations,
imposed its sanctions on Libya in 1992 which mirrored those set by
the world body.

<HEADLINE> FPDA to Conduct Exercise With Malaysia Re-joining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The group of the Five Power
Defense Arrangement (FPDA) will conduct an air defense exercise
between April 14 and 21 with the participation of Malaysia which
decided to pull out of FPDA exercises last year.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Ministry of Defense said in a news release
Saturday that air and naval forces from the FPDA, which groups
Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and Britain, will
participate in the 10-day exercise code-named Major ADEX 99-2.
</P>
<P>
Major ADEX 99-2 will be coordinated by the Headquarters
Integrated Air Defense System located at Royal Malaysian Air Force
Base Butterworth under the command of Air-Vice Marshal R.B.
Treloar and its aim is to exercise FPDA forces in protecting the
airspace of Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore and enhance
inter-operability, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The exercise will be the first joint FPDA action involving
Malaysia since the country decided in August 1998 to pull out of
FPDA exercises slated for last year because of the country's
economic woes and tense relations with Singapore at that time.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Malaysia's decision, a major maritime and air
exercise scheduled for the third quarter of last year by the FPDA
allies was unable to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The FPDA has existed for about 28 years and held joint
exercises almost every year.

PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 100,000 French people have expressed their
readiness to humanitarian groups to receive Kosovo refugees in
their homes. Experts said that the reason for French people to
react so strongly to the plight of the refugees is the proximity
of the Balkans, which is two hours' flight from France.
</P>
<P>
-- According to a poll published by Liberation on Saturday, 54
percent of the French people doubt that the U.S. government can
find a lasting and fair solution to the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the crisis in Yugoslavia, the stock exchanges in
Europe rose greatly on Friday because of a lowering of interests
rate by the European Central Bank. In the primary minutes of
transactions, record high indexes were inscribed in the stock
exchanges of Paris and London.
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed on Friday to
Belgrade for a cease-fire in Kosovo, which he said could lead to
an ending of airstrikes by NATO against Yugoslavia. The French
government immediately expressed its support to the appeal by
Annan.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time since NATO began bombing Yugoslavia,
Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned on Friday that if NATO
continued to intensify its attack on Yugoslavia, the conflict
could extend to a European, if not global, war.

<HEADLINE> Philippine National Railways Plans to Lure Private Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Philippine
National Railways (PNR) is drafting a plan to lure private
investors, a report of the Philippine News Agency said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, PNR's plan is anchored on four pillars
-- the consolidation of PNR's control over the right-of-way and
real estate properties; concentration of development efforts on
the more lucrative commuter market; joint venture tie-ups with
private sector operators and retirement of PNR's outstanding
debts.
</P>
<P>
PNR chairman Carlos M. Borromeo was quoted as saying that PNR
is looking at joint venture arrangements with private operators to
provide a modern fleet of diesel electric trains, initially for
commuter or short haul services.
</P>
<P>
PNR also plans to earn more from the railways' 4,300 hectares
real estate assets which can generate at least 500 million pesos
(1 U.S. dollar is equal to about 40 pesos) in rental revenues.
</P>
<P>
PNR has 1,300 km railways, of which only 490 km are being used.
Its trains carry 700,000 passengers per year on its long distance
(Manila-Legaspi) route and at least four million passengers per
year on its short distance commuter trains.
</P>
<P>
However, less than 50 percent of the locomotives of PNR are
serviceable. As a result, the railway loses 75 pesos per long
distance passenger and 60 pesos per commuter, Borromeo said.
</P>
<P>
The national government subsidizes the railway at 10 million
pesos per month. PNR likewise relies on the national government to
service its 13 billion peso debt.
</P>
<P>
In terms of human resources, PNR has 2,300 employees, whom the
agency has neither the fleet nor the tracks to keep fully
employed.

<HEADLINE> New Cholera Cases Hit Kenyan Coast Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 30 new cases of cholera have
been disclosed following the onset of rains in Mombasa, a
southern coastal city, and other areas in Kenya's coast Province.
</P>
<P>
Provincial medical officer S.K. Shariff said the new reported
cases on the Mombasa Island and other areas had been admitted to
hospitals, while others admitted and discharged, the East African
Standard newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Shariff noted that there was no cholera-related death in the
province over the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"New more cases are still coming up," he said, adding that
medical workers were alert and are taking all the measures to
control the situation.
</P>
<P>
The medical officer attributed the disease outbreak to the
re-opening of the food kiosks which do not maintain health
regulations. The kiosks had been closed due to the disease
outbreak barely a month ago.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Get U.N. Food Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
announced that it will supply Kenya with 85, 000 tons of food
worth 32.5 million U.S. dollars, in a bid to support the Kenyan
government in alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
The food aid will cover the period from now up to the year
2003, the Kenya Times newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The program would cover school feeding, disaster preparedness
and community nutrition and care projects," said WFP regional
director Holdbrook Athur Friday, who is also in charge of the
agency's operations in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Holdbrook said WFP assessment showed that small-scale farmers
living in the arid and semi-arid areas remain the most vulnerable
to food shortage.
</P>
<P>
"The poor cope with food shortage by reducing what the family
eat and withdrawing children, especially girls, from school,"
said the director.
</P>
<P>
He said it was common for children to have one meal a day in
Kenya's arid areas, adding that his organization viewed the
school feeding program as an effective way of ensuring school
attendance and improved academic performance.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the full school feeding program, Holdbrook said
the program, which started five years ago, will also cover the
provision of mid-morning snack of porridge and a hot lunch of
maize and beans to an average of 300,000 primary and pre-primary
school children.
</P>
<P>
He said more attention would be focused on arid and semi-arid
areas of the country and slums in cities.
</P>
<P>
On disasters, the director said the spiralling levels of
poverty and poor infrastructure, Kenyans were more vulnerable and
their ability to cope with disasters is decreasing.

<HEADLINE> Relief Food Reaches Ethiopia's Drought Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Disaster
Prevention and Preparedness Commission said the 5,000 tons of
relief food it sent for drought victims in eastern Somali region
has arrived in Jijiga, "the Ethiopian Herald" reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a press release issued by the commission
as saying that the timely arrival would create favorable
conditions for distributing the relief food to the victims as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
The release said this is part of the 8,000 tons relief food
allocated for the year and the remaining 3,000 tons will shortly
be transported from the Nazareth warehouse.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the 4,700 tons of relief food sent
earlier to the region has been distributed to the victims.
</P>
<P>
A lack of rainfall during the two previous rainy seasons in the
Somali region has not only exacerbated food shortage but also a
serious water shortage there. Relief agencies are making efforts
to fetch water to the drought stricken areas by tanker trucks.
</P>
<P>
A large number of livestock in Jijiga and Dagahabur districts
have died for lack of water, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program has already reallocated 8,000 tons of
food aid to 640,000 drought stricken pastoralists in the region.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Says It Kills 44 Kurdish Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 44 rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed in a
cross-border offensive launched by Turkish troops, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the second reported cross-boder military operation
against the Kurdish rebels based in northern Iraq since PKK
leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured on February 15.
</P>
<P>
Some 15,000-strong Turkish troops, accompanied by 2,000
pro-government village guards, crossed into neighboring Iraq on
Tuesday to hunt down the Kurdish fighters.
</P>
<P>
The agency also reported that the Turkish troops had captured
15 PKK militants in the operation.
</P>
<P>
However, 10 soldiers of the Turkish government troops were also
killed in the conflict, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
During the offensive, Turkish warplanes bombarded PKK rebel
bases in the northeastern corner of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has frequently launched cross-border military operations
into northern Iraq in the spring after snow clears since Baghdad
was rendered ineffective in controlling the Kurdish-populated
region.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that guerrillas of the Iraq's Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP), which controls areas along the
Iraqi-Turkish border, has been supporting the Turkish troops in
fighting against the PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
The PKK led by Ocalan has been fighting a 15-year-old
guerrilla war for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern
Turkey since August 1984. Over 37,000 people, including PKK
rebels, government troops and civilians, have died in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan has been jailed on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near
Turkey's western province of Bursa on charges of treason. He may
face the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
A series of bombing attacks have been launched by Kurds in
protest of the capture of Ocalan.

SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Managers of China's two
fledgling bourses, the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, are

really can learn many things from each other in fields like
technology, management, liquidation and supervision," the source
quoted Gui as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gui also noted that the two bourses should further enhance
their cooperation to make greater contribution to China's economic

<HEADLINE> Pak Speaker Calls China Major Player on World Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China has emerged as a major
player on the international political scene and is playing a
stabilizing role for regional and global peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"The policies pursued by China have a special significance for
the developing world," Ellahi Bukhsh Soomro, speaker of Pakistan's
National Assembly, said here Saturday in his introductory remarks
before a speech delivered by his visiting Chinese counterpart, Li
Peng.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that China will continue to strengthen its
cooperation with the developing countries to promote their
legitimate rights and interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the new millennium, the entire world's focus is
on China as "it promises to emerge as a trading giant, an economic
 powerhouse and takes its legitimate place among the most
important leaders in the comity of nations," Soomro said, adding,
"This is China's destiny."
</P>
<P>
Praising the policies pursued by China, he said, "they are
founded on the immutable principles of peaceful coexistence and
mutuality of benefit."
</P>
<P>
"China has always firmly opposed the unjust use of force or
threat of use of force and stands for the peaceful settlement of
all disputes and conflicts," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan applauds China's constant opposition to regional and
global hegemonism," Soomro said, adding that "China's role in
promoting a just, fair and equitable world economic and political
order has won her universal respect and admiration."
</P>
<P>
On the Pak-China bilateral relations, the speaker said the
relations between the two friendly neighbors stand out as a model
of inter-state conduct and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The relations have withstood the test of time and remain
strong and vibrant in the face of multiple challenges and
pressures," Soomro added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and China, he said, have always stood by and supported
 each other and the two countries would continue to do so in the
coming years, said Soomro.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed China occupies the pride of place in our foreign policy
 priorities and objectives. Mutual trust and confidence are the
building blocks of this edifice," the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Soomro spoke highly of the significant contributions made by
Li, who was elected as chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress of China in March 1998, to shaping
China's enlightened domestic and international policies.
</P>
<P>
Li, who served as China's premier for a whole decade from 1988
to 1998, had also made great contributions to China's outstanding
 economic growth and development, Soomro noted.
</P>
<P>
The speaker described Li as "a trusted friend of Pakistan held
in high esteem by us." "His personal contribution to further
enhancing bilateral relations between Pakistan and China is deeply
etched in the chronicles of the history of our age-old ties." he
said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Holding Firm Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan shilling held steady
versus the U.S. dollar in trade Friday at the Nairobi Foreign
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Five leading banks posted the shilling at 65.25/45 against the
dollar, unchanged from Thursday's close, a leading Kenyan
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the currency dealers here said that the local unit was
 vulnerable and likely to drift low on sustained dollar demand.
</P>
<P>
The shilling has come under pressure against the dollar in the
last two weeks, losing slightly more than one shilling, undermined
by a surge in demand for dollars not matched by inflows.
</P>
<P>
According to dealers, the energy and manufacturing sectors were
buying dollars to cover forward positions while offshore
investors were repatriating funds from the equity market.
</P>
<P>
"The importers have seen signs of shilling weakening further
and are now buying dollars although they don't have bills to
settle at the moment," one dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya posted a shilling mean indicative
rate of 65. 29 shillings to the dollar compared to 65.00 shillings
at Thursday's open.
</P>
<P>
The shilling also opened softer against the pound and euro. The
bank posted a shilling mean indicative rate of 104.93 shillings
and 70.19 shillings respectively from 104.11 shillings and 70.10
shillings on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Kicks off Visits to Oman, UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Saturday kicked off official visits to Oman and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) in a bid to strengthen ties with the
two Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is expected to meet with Oman's Sultan Qaboos Bin Said
during his 24-hour stay in Oman before he heads for UAE on Sunday
for talks with President Sheikh Zayed Al-Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
The visits were part of Abdullah's efforts to drum up support
from the Gulf countries for Jordan's stagnant economy, which
registered a negative economic growth in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was expected to persuade leaders of the two countries
to further open up their markets to Jordanian labor. Jordan's
labor export constitute one of the three pillars of its economy
along with foreign aid and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Abdullah had paid a three-day visit to
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The monarch said upon his return from Riyadh that Jordan would
seek to further ties with the Arab states in the Gulf,
traditionally a stronghold for Jordanian labor.
</P>
<P>
His visits to the Gulf states were also aimed at amending
Jordan's ties with these countries, which were damaged during the
1990 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was isolated for its sympathy with Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait during the 1990-91 Gulf Crisis.

<HEADLINE> Multi-polarity Benefits World Peace, Stability: Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 10 (Xinhua) -- "The trend toward
multipolarization is in the interest of world peace and stability,
 and multipolarity is better than mono-polarity," visiting Chinese
leader Li Peng said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"World affairs must not be dictated by one single country or a
handful of countries," said Li, chairman of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China, in a speech
presided over by his Pakistani counterpart, Ellahi Bukhsh Soomro.
</P>
<P>
All countries, big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are
equal members in the big international family and all should be
respected, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that another important mark of the development of
multipolarization is the continuous emergence of regional
organizations and groups.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, "this is a positive phenomenon in the
international political life," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Li said the present international situation in general
continued to move toward relaxation, but local elements of tension
and tumult are on the increase and new crises keep cropping up and
in some areas have even escalated to armed conflicts and wars.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said, "the harsh facts have told us that
many contradictions covered in the past have been further
revealed and even intensified."
</P>
<P>
"The world is still not peaceful and tranquil," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the world situation is undergoing profound
changes. Countries are now readjusting relations among
themselves, centering on a series of major issues such as
regional security, the economy and finance and sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
In this context, he said, changes and impact ensuing from the
readjustment of relations among big countries have drawn extensive
 attention.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of economic globalization, Li said, "Economic
relations are an extremely important aspect of the current
international relations."
</P>
<P>
"International globalization is the inevitable result of the
worldwide flow and allocation of the essential factors of
production and hence the trend of the times," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, he said, this is conducive to international
interchange and economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, Li said, for the vast number of developing countries,
particularly those whose economic strength is still fairly
fragile, "economic globalization not only brings opportunities,
but also enormous risks and challenges."
</P>
<P>
He believed that the international community should work to
promote the establishment of "a peaceful, stable, just and
equitable new international political and economic order and a
new international financial system."
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Thursday on a four-day official visit,
made the speech before a gathering of about 500 people including
members of the Pakistani National Assembly and Senate, senior
cabinet members and foreign diplomatic envoys in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> China Ready for Deeper Ties With S. Asia: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China,
said here Saturday that China is ready to "write a new chapter of
friendly relations and cooperation" with South Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech presided over by his Pakistani counterpart,
 Ellahi Bukhsh Soomro, Li said it serves the common interests of
both China and the South Asian nations to constantly expand and
increase bilateral cooperation and exchange.
</P>
<P>
As developing countries, China and the South Asian nations are
both faced with the common task of maintaining peace and promoting
development, Li said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said, "China will, as always, uphold the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence and pursue the policy of good-neighborliness
and friendship."
</P>
<P>
Li appreciated the remarkable achievements made by the South
Asian nations in improving the quality of their people's life and
exploring a road of development suitable for their national
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that "the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) played an increasingly active role in economic
 cooperation and political coordination in this region."
</P>
<P>
China, he said, sincerely hoped that the South Asian countries
would live in harmony and enjoy long-term stability and economic
development amidst the deepening trends of multipolarization and
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between the two South Asian neighbors of
Pakistan and India, Li said China is pleased to note the
important agreements reached recently by the prime ministers of
the two countries in a bid to improve the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, through friendly talks, issued the Lahore
Declaration and other important instruments in February this year
and jointly declared that they would accelerate their efforts to
settle all issues between them, including the Kashmir issue, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that this positive development is in the
interest of peace and stability in this region," said the Chinese
leader.
</P>
<P>
He also said it is China's consistent position "to solve issues
left over from history by means of peaceful negotiation and iron
out differences among countries through friendly consultation."
</P>
<P>
China highly appraises the important agreements reached by the
leaders of Pakistan and India in a bid to improve the bilateral
relations, Li said, adding that they accord with the long-term and
fundamental interests of the two countries and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Li said he is confident that the peoples in the South Asian
region would tap their huge potential and build an even better
future.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived here Thursday on a four-day official visit to
this South Asian nation at the invitation of Soomro, made the
speech before a gathering of about 500 people including members of
the Pakistani National Assembly and Senate, cabinet members and
foreign diplomatic envoys in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is the fourth leg of Li's current six-nation tour. He
has already visited Greece, Turkey and Syria. After his visit to
Pakistan, Li will proceed to Bangladesh and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Access to Global Markets: Kenyan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Past experiences have shown that
 developing countries can attain economic prosperity not only
through reforms but greater access to international market,
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks when he officially opened a meeting of the
Economic Committee of the Global Coalition for Africa in Nairobi,
the Kenya Times paper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that reforms had led to substantial reduction in
public expenditure in some important sectors, leaving the private
sector to play an increasingly greater role in the development of
those sectors.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the changes which a number of
African countries were undertaking were a result of rapid changes
taking place in the international trading system, which forced
them to implement social and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Moi told the participants from the continent that agriculture
played a vital role in the economic development of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture not only plays a role of feeding our fast growing
 populating, but also takes a greater role in absorbing a large
population as well as generating incomes which is crucial in
eradicating poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition it provides the bulk of our exports and supplies
raw materials to our industries," the president added.
</P>
<P>
He urged participants to discuss in detail issues affecting
the agro- sector and how to improve productivity, citing weather
as a major cause of low productivity that called for planned
farming activities to fit changing weather patterns.

<HEADLINE> China Not A Threat But An Opportunity for U.S., Zhu Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
Friday reaffirmed that China's growth will pose no threat to the
United States, but will instead offer opportunities for the
United States to advance its business interests.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who is paying an official visit to the
United States, added that China is not an enemy, nor a potential
adversary of the United States, but a friend of it for now and a
long time to come.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that we will become the enemy of the United
States," Zhu said at a dinner banquet here attended by several
hundred distinguished figures including some senior former U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier argued that China's GDP (gross domestic
product) is only one tenth of the United States and its per capita
GDP many times smaller than that of the United States. Even for
decades to come, there will still be a big gap between the two
countries. "Therefore, China is going to be the biggest market
rather than a threat (to the United States)."
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time to change the fallacy of 'China being a
threat' into the belief of 'China being an opportunity'," Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
The premier, whose humor aroused laughter and applause from the
audience from time to time, urged American businesspeople not to
miss the opportunity of entering the China market.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he agrees with U.S. President Bill Clinton that China
lags far behind the United States militarily. "So why should you (
Americans) be afraid of China?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, whose remarks focused on business issues at the banquet,
said that China has a long way to go in economic development,
particularly in the areas of energy, infrastructure and
environmental protection; so there exist big potentials for Sino-U.
S. cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The United States must lift its restrictions on technology
transfer to China; otherwise it may lose enormous opportunities to
the Europeans, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The dinner was co-sponsored by the U.S.-China Policy Foundation,
the Committee of 100, the Asia Society, the America-China Society,
the Council on Foreign Relations, the National Committee on United
States-China Relations and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, the first Chinese premier to visit the United States in 15
years, is scheduled to leave Washington for Denver on Saturday.

</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech here at the Convention Center organized by
Ellahi Bukhsh Soomro, speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly, Li
said that to continue to cement the Sino-Pak friendly and
cooperative ties is an important policy of China's.
</P>

<P>
Li's speech covered the regional, international as well as
bilateral issues. He also briefed those present on China's
economic construction and its efforts to perfect its legislative
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Pak friendship is long-standing, thriving on a solid
foundation, said Li, who is chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC) of China.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries and peoples have been together through thick
and thin and shared weal and woe," Li said, adding that no matter
what happens on the international scene or in the respective
countries, the Sino-Pakistani relations have always been
developing steadily.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Pak friendly and cooperative relations built nearly
half a century ago have stood the test of time, displaying as it
does great vitality," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He also said the relationship between China and Pakistan could
be called "an example of friendship and cooperation between
countries with different social systems."
</P>
<P>
Li described the exchanges and cooperation between the NPC and
Pakistan's National Assembly as fruitful. "Such friendly
interchanges have played a significant part in developing
Sino-Pak partnership of all-round cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that there would be more contacts and
exchanges of legislative experience between people from all
circles, leaders of the legislative bodies, special committees,
friendship groups and law-makers from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said he was confident that with the unremitting efforts of
the two governments and peoples, the Sino-Pak partnership of
all-round cooperation oriented toward the 21st century would bear
even more fruits.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in his introduction speech, Soomro praised the
traditional, time-honored Pakistan-China relations and China's
economic construction. He also expressed his appreciation of the
policies pursued by China in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Present at the speech were some 500 people including members of

behind the appeal and hope Annan's words would be heeded and win
the support of the entire U.N. Security Council. Annan called on

some 100,000 refugees from Bosnia in its territory, he said the

<HEADLINE> HK Seminar Marks Basic Law Promulgation Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 people from all
walks of life in Hong Kong attended a symposium here Saturday in
commemoration of the ninth anniversary of the promulgation of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
In her welcoming remarks at the symposium on "Knowing One
Country, Realizing Two Systems", Ko Siu Wah, convenor of the Joint
Committee for the Promotion of the Basic Law, noted that since
Hong Kong's return to China, the Central Government has been firm
in observing the principles of "one country, two systems" and "
Hong Kong people running Hong Kong" with a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
While refraining from intervening into the internal affairs of
the SAR, the Central Government has been supportive to the SAR
government in running its own affairs.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has, on the other hand, enacted legislation
on its own according to the Basic Law, exercised independent
judicial power, handled its internal affairs without any
intervention, and made important decisions on matters pertinent to
the economy and well-being of its people.
</P>
<P>
She said the People's Liberation Army garrison has stringently
abide by the Basic Law and Garrison Law, and refrained from
intervening into the internal affairs of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, She said, the SAR will have to face challenges
of all kinds. In order for Hong Kong to function properly and to
maintain stability and prosperity, it is crucial that the people
of Hong Kong get to know, and thoroughly understand, the Basic Law,
she added.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
dwelt on the implementation of financial policies in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the experience of the SAR government since its
establishment shows not only that Hong Kong enjoys an even higher
degree of monetary autonomy after the transfer of power, but also
that its monetary relationship with the mainland has been handled
strictly in accordance with the "one country, two systems"
principle.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the "one country, two systems"
principle will continue to play an important role in the 21st
century, and that both the mainland and Hong Kong will stand to
reap immense benefits from it.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers at the symposium also included Kwan Wing-shing,
senior economic research manager of the Hang Seng Bank, Tsang Shu-
ki, professor of Economics Hong Kong Baptist University, and Wang
Ying Wai, chairman of the Business and Professionals' Federation
of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Group Stages Campaign to Aid Kosovars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A public campaign to aid Kosovo's
refugees has been staged in Lebanon and will continue until the
end of the month, the Daily Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched by al-Jamaa al-Islimiya, a Islamist
group in the country's southern largest port city of Sidon.
</P>
<P>
Imams who led Friday prayers urged worshippers to contribute
to the group's campaign and voiced concerns that the 800,000
Kosovar refugees displaced in recent weeks might face the same
fate as the Palestinians did more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Masri, director-general of the group, told the paper
that the group had placed newspaper ads calling on the public to
aid the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"The money will be transferred to the refugees through
philanthropic associations based in Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Contributions have been made before the campaign was
officially launched. Last week, al-Jamaa collected more than 30
million Lebanese pounds (about 20,000 U.S. dollars) from
worshippers in Beirut Mosques," he added.
</P>
<P>
With NATO intensifies its air strikes on Yugoslavia, thousands
of residents in the ethnic Albanian-predominated Kosovo are
fleeing to neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Djibouti Ruling Party Leads in Presidential Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Djibouti's ruling alliance took
a clear early lead Saturday as results streamed in from an
election for the presidency of the small Red Sea state, Interior
Minister Elmi Obsieh Wais announced.
</P>
<P>
With around half of results counted after Friday's poll,
Ismail Omar Guelleh, the candidate of the ruling alliance party,
had around 60 percent of the vote, according to reports from the
country's capital Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
Ismail Omar is running against opposition-backed candidate
Moussa Ahmed Idriss to become only the second president of
Djibouti since its independence from France in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The winner will take over from Hassan Gouled Aptidon, 83, who
joined a rare breed of regional leaders in February when he
announced he would step down from power voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
A stream of sealed glass ballot boxes arrived under escort at
city hall late friday and officials worked through the night to
collate results by the light of electric generators, while outside
armed police stood guard in the desert heat.
</P>
<P>
With just 600,000 people, Djibouti is a country whose majority
 population live in the dry and dusty capital which sprawls along
the coast from a port at the southern end of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
The port and trade with Ethiopia are vital and for years
Djibouti has been an oasis of stability next to Ethiopia, Eritrea
and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Economic support from France, which has around 3,000 troops
stationed in the country, is also critical, observers in the Horn
of Africa country said.
</P>
<P>
A western diplomat predicted Friday that the election would
likely yield an easy victory for Ismail Omar, who headed the
security services and has years of experience in government.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Trade Balance Deteriorates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The trend in New Zealand's
merchandise trade balance has deteriorated in recent months, New
Zealand Government Statistician Len Cook said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Cook explained that this deterioration is
because New Zealand's imports trend has continued to rise while
the exports trend has flattened.
</P>
<P>
"Low world commodity prices and the recent appreciation of the
New Zealand dollar appear to be hampering export growth" of New
Zealand, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the media release, for the month of February the
provisional merchandise trade balance of New Zealand was in
surplus by 9 million NZ dollars (4.82 million U.S. dollars), with
its exports standing at 1.807 billion NZ dollars (975.8 million
U.S. dollars). Over the last 10 years trade surpluses over 100
million NZ dollars (54 million U.S. dollars) have been typical
for the month of February.
</P>
<P>
"World commodity prices remain low for products such as wool
and meat. Economic difficulties in Russia have reduced demand for
butter and cheese but total dairy exports are still high. Exports
of seafood and electrical goods continued to show strong growth.
Exports of wood and wood products have shown some signs of
recovery recently," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, he said, there has been some recovery in
demand from Asia and this is reflected in increased exports to the
Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. However, he
added, imports from Asia have continued to grow strongly. "This
has resulted in the fifth monthly merchandise trade deficit with
Asia in the last seven months. Before this, there had only been
two months in deficit since 1990," Cook said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Government on Course for Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
remains on course to book a small operating budget surplus in the
year from July 1998 to June 1999.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Treasury figures for the eight months to February,
which were made public here Saturday, show an operating budget
surplus of 1.1 billion NZ dollars (594 million U.S. dollars) in
the
period, 79 million NZ dollars (42.6 million U.S. dollars) ahead of

forecast.
</P>
<P>
Local economists expect a surplus of a few hundred million NZ
dollars in the year to June 1999. This excludes the sale of state-
owned Contact Energy which is going ahead and local economists
estimate this will swell the budget surplus for the year to
between
1.5 billion and 2 billion NZ dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures, in the eight months to February the
government revenue totaled 23.28 billion NZ dollars (12.57 billion

U.S. dollars) and its expenses 22.93 billion NZ dollars (12.38
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
At present, the net debt of the New Zealand government is 24.42

billion NZ dollars (13.19 billion U.S. dollars), 24.9 percent of
the
country's GDP, down 743 million NZ dollars (401 million U.S.
dollars)
on forecast.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (22) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 22 of a
question and answer series of the ABCs of the Basic Law of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Over what acts shall the courts of the MSAR have no
jurisdiction?
</P>
<P>
According to Article 19 of the Basic Law, the courts of the
Macao Special Administrative Region shall have no jurisdiction
over acts of State such as national defense and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
State acts include decisions made or steps taken by the highest
organ of State power and the highest organ of State administration
in exercising State sovereignty, such as declaring war, making
peace, recognizing foreign government, dispatching diplomatic
envoys to foreign countries, signing treaties with foreign
countries, issuing order of official appointment and removal and
proclaiming martial law, etc.
</P>
<P>
State acts give expression to State sovereignty and represent
national interests. Therefore, while the courts of the MSAR enjoy
independent judicial power and power of final adjudication, they
have no jurisdiction over the above State acts.
</P>
<P>
Since the courts of the MSAR may not know in advance whether
cases they try involve State acts, it is stipulated in Article 19
of the Basic Law that the courts of the Region shall obtain a
certificate from the Chief Executive on questions of fact
concerning acts of State such as national defense and foreign
affairs whenever such questions arise in trying cases. This
certificate shall be binding on the courts.
</P>
<P>
Before issuing such a certificate, the Chief Executive shall
obtain a certifying document from the Central People's Government.
For example, if a person who faces criminal prosecution in the
MSAR claims he is an accredited foreign diplomat in China, it
involves the question of act of State in diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The court should obtain a certificate from the Chief Executive
on his status. If it is ascertained that he is an accredited
foreign diplomat in China, the court then has no jurisdiction over
this case.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi to Step Up Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
will intensify its efforts to combat pollution and improve the
quality of the local environment, a senior local official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"We'll spare no effort to make the sky over our heads become
bluer," said Cheng Andong, governor of Shaanxi, in an interview
with journalists from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, Cheng said, Shaanxi will mainly focus on
fighting air pollution, and thus will actively promote the use of
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage more automobiles to adopt natural gas as
their fuel, the local government has lowered the price of natural
gas for car use and built a number of natural gas filling stations,
said the governor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, natural gas pipes will extend into over 70 percent
of urban households in Shaanxi by the end of this year, and an
American company, the Jiuwun International Resources Inc., has
decided to invest 400 million US dollars to develop a clean fuel
project in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
For the area in the northern part of Shaanxi, however, the main
environmental problem is desertification and soil erosion, Cheng
noted.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Loess Plateau in north China, the area is
reputed as "the cradle of the Chinese revolution", as its regional
center Yan'an served as the headquarters of the Chinese communists
for more than a decade in the 1930s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
"Local governments in the area are planting trees along the
sides of all major highways and roads in the areas, and the forest
and grassland coverage in the regions of Yan'an and Yulin has now
exceeded 40 percent," said Cheng.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that at present there have been 67 environment
monitoring stations across Shaanxi, while 104 smog and dust
control zones have been set up in 13 cities in the province.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Plant 100m Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has started a
nationwide afforestation campaign in which 100 million trees will
be planted by next year, government officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa launched the campaign Saturday in the
Mwanza Region on the shore of Lake Victoria, while Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma and Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye are expected to
plant trees in Iringa and Rukwa regions in the southwest
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers and regional commissioners are joining the
drive in other regions to avert possible desertification in the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is facing a series of environmental problems like
desertification, loss of wildlife habitat and deterioration of
aquatic ecosystems, the Minister of State, Edward Lowassa, said at
a session of the United Nations Environmental Governing Council in
Nairobi, Kenya last February.
</P>
<P>
Desertification is threatening 61 percent of Tanzania's arable
land, putting at risk the livelihood of 17 million people out of
30 million.
</P>
<P>
Most bare lands in Tanzania today were covered with thick
evergreen forests between 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Increasing population pressure, felling of wood for charcoal,
fires, and development of industries like tobacco have made the
country lose 300,000 to 400,000 hectares of forests a year, while
less than 200,000 hectares of forests are planted annually,
environmentalists said.

<HEADLINE> Natural Vitamin E Twice as Effective as Synthetic Version: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 9 (Xinhua) -- New health studies show that
natural vitamin E -- made of vegetable oils from soybeans, corn
and sunflowers -- is twice as effective in health benefits than
the synthetic chemically-manufactured version, a U.S. research
information service reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
There have also been indications that higher dosages of vitamin
E are safe and healthy, said a research summary issued by Veris, a
non-profit corporation which provides information on the role of
nutrition in health.
</P>
<P>
Vitamin E has been found to work effectively as a major
antioxidant and fight off free radicals in the body. Free radicals
have been shown to contribute to the development of a number of
diseases such as heart ailments, cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
The Veris research summary noted that while there has been a
general scientific assumption that natural and synthetic vitamins
are equal because of similar molecular structure, "vitamin E is
the exception."
</P>
<P>
"The bioavailability of natural sources of vitamin E is greater
than that of synthetic forms," based on both human and animal
studies, the research summary concluded.
</P>
<P>
These studies have shown an obvious difference between natural
and synthetic vitamin E, and this difference is more noticeable
after absorption in the digestive tract, while natural vitamin E
is retained significantly longer in body tissue.
</P>
<P>
Previously accepted differences between natural and synthetic
versions were "underestimated," the research summary noted, and
said that the bioavailability of natural vitamin E is
approximately twice that of synthetic compounds.
</P>
<P>
Two separate reports on natural vitamin E were particularly
cited in Veris research. One is from East Tennessee State
University and the other from Oregon State University.

<HEADLINE> Major U.S. Airlines Hike Domestic Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Three major U.S. airlines have
raised leisure fares 3 percent and walkup fares 1 percent as of
Friday, a move that marked the third rate increase this year.
</P>
<P>
Continental Airlines, No.5 in the country, was the first to
increase fares, followed quickly by Delta Airlines and United
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
But Northwest Airlines Corp. said it had not raised its fares
while a spokesman for American Airlines said he did not know
whether the airline will match the increase.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Northwest failed to go along with four of
the six increases by rivals. Other airlines quickly dropped back,
cutting their fares to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
The two fare hikes that did succeed this year have already
raised leisure fares by 7 percent and business fares 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
If this one sticks, that will mean a 10 percent air fare
increase in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the fare increases to a thriving economy
that has boosted demand to record levels for many carriers.
Besides, a recent rebound from last year's plunge in fuel prices
has made it more expensive for airlines to fly their planes.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Growth May Exceed Official Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SINGAPORE, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's economy can grow by
more than one percent this year, surpassing earlier official
forecast of minus one to plus one percent, said Deputy Prime
Minister Tony Tan Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tan made the upbeat assessment of Singapore's economic situation
in the first quarter of this year in his keynote address to the
annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Council of the American Chamber
of Commerce in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"If there are no serious disturbances in the region and the U.S.
economic growth remains strong, growth for 1999 could well be
higher than the minus one percent to one percent range forecast by
the Ministry of Trade and Industry in February this year." Tan
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that industrial production rose 6.1 percent in January
and February this year and leading economic indicators such as the
Composite Leading Index which leads the economy by about nine
months, continued their upward trend.
</P>
<P>
Leading Singapore businessmen have expressed optimism on the
near-term economic growth and economists also expect a faster pace
than the official suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's economy fell into recession from the second half of
1998, shrinking by 0.6 percent in the third quarter and a further
0.8 percent in the fourth quarter as a result of the regional
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tan said that in the first quarter of this year, however, the
economy has seen some tentative signs of recovery in response to
the upturn in the global electronics cycle.
</P>
<P>
The Asian economies are beginning to bottom out of their
economic difficulties, said Tan, adding that Singapore has earned
from the crisis a sense of urgency to restructure its economy and
reassess its capabilities and growth strategies.
</P>
<P>
He also promised a continued Singapore effort to offer
attractive opportunities to investors as he warned that an Asian
recovery will depend on the accessibility of the U.S. market by
Asian economies.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Unable to Receive More Kosovar Refugees: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Prime Minister Zlatko
Matesa said his country is "unable to receive more ethnic Albanian
refugees from Kosovo," when he met with the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) mission leader in Croatia Robert Robinson
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Due to a "limited capacity," Croatia can only receive a small
number of refugees in addition to some 5,000 Kosovar refugees
already in the country, Matesa said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Croatia also has some 100,000 refugees from Bosnia
in its territory, he said the UNHCR does understand Croatia's
predicament.
</P>
<P>
Matesa stressed that Croatia has always received and settled
refugees and is willing to do all it can to provide the necessary
logistical assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said the Croatian government has decided to earmark 2.4
million U.S. dollars to help Kosovar refugees. The first shipment
of medical aid from Croatia, worth more than 400,000 dollars,
arrived in Albania on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia have so
far caused a loss of at least one billion dollars to Croatia's
economy, notably in its tourism and foreign trade sector because
of its proximity to the war zone.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, an active supporter of NATO, has come to bear the
brunt of NATO's military operations.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Urges U.S. Organizations' Support for China's WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji Friday called on U.S. organizations and enterprises to
support China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"China has made many concessions within its capability for the
entry into the WTO as a developing country," Zhu said in his
speech delivered at a dinner hosted in his honor by seven U.S.
organizations including the America-China Society, the Asia
Society and the U.S.-China Policy Foundation.
</P>
<P>
He said China's joining the WTO will not only benefit the world
trade, but also conduce to the China-U.S. trade.
</P>
<P>
It has been 13 years since the negotiations started on China's
resumption of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT)
membership and later its access to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China's concessions for its bid to joining the WTO are big
enough as a developing country, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier expressed his appreciation of U.S.
organizations and enterprises for their efforts to ask the U.S.
Congress to approve an agreement on China's joining the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived in the United States on Tuesday for an eight-day
official visit to the country, the first by a Chinese premier in
15 years.
</P>
<P>
On the deficit the United States registered in its trade with
China, Zhu said that the issue could be resolved only through
joint efforts by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States lifts the restrictions on its high-tech
export to China, I think the U.S. trade deficit will be narrowed,"
he said.

the two countries, visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu made the remarks at a dinner hosted in his honor by
seven organizations including America-China Society, Asia Society
and the U.S.-China Policy Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to narrow the trade imbalance and expand the trade
volume, it requires efforts by both sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has become China's second largest trade
partner while China the fourth largest trade partner of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, trade imbalance has become a sticking
point in Sino-U.S. trade relations.
</P>
<P>
China's 1998 trade surplus with the United States was about 21
billion U.S. dollars while the United States put the figure as
high as 57 billion dollars due to different calculation methods.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is currently paying an eight-day official visit to the
United states, urged the United States to lift its restrictions on
export to China. He said the United States only sells wheat and
citrus to China rather than computers and satellites.
</P>
<P>
"If we are able to work together in areas like energy,
environment protection and telecommunications and have good
cooperation, in a few years from now, the trade deficit may be
China's rather than America's," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But if the United States wants to impose restrictions in many
areas, it might be very hard to achieve a balance of trade, so let
us work together," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. support for China's entry into the Word Trade
Organization (WTO) is not only good for the global trade but also
good for the trade balance between China and the United States, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier pointed out that there are broad prospects
for cooperation on energy and environment protection between the
two countries, which will also help improve the trade balance.
</P>
<P>
"China's needs and the size of its markets in this sector can
be measured by billions of dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are talking about the trade deficit the U.S. has with
China, but perhaps a few years from now we will be talking about
China's trade deficit," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year witnesses the 20th anniversary of the establishment
of Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations and the signing of the Sino-U.S.
Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
China's General Customs Administration figures show a bilateral
trade volume approaching 55 billion dollars in 1998, more than 22
times the figure for 1979. From 1979 to 1998, bilateral trade was
worth 364.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. figures show bilateral trade volume growing 35 times over
the past 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Digs China's First Cross-River Pedestrian Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city Shanghai
has dug the country's first cross-river pedestrian tunnel under
the Huangpu River, which flows through Shanghai and divides the
city in two.
</P>
<P>
Excavation of the 646.7-meter tunnel, which links the Bund area
on the west side of the Huangpu River to the Oriental Pearl TV
tower in Pudong, or regions east of the river, was concluded today.
The tunnel is expected to be completed on October 1 and put in use
at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Constructors said that the tunnel, with a total investment of
500 million yuan (about 60 million US dollars), has an internal
diameter of 7 meters and will be beautifully decorated.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the tunnel can transport some 5,000 people
every hour, and it will take a pedestrian only 2.5 to 5 minutes to
cross the river by taking a special fully-automated pedestrian
carrier, they added.
</P>
<P>
Areas west of the Huangpu River constitute Shanghai's old city
proper, including the country's most famous commercial districts
like the Nanjing Road and the Huaihai Road, while Pudong is a
booming new development area with the ambition of becoming China's
financial center.
</P>
<P>
Cross-river transportation in Shanghai currently depends on
ferry steamers, cable-suspended bridges and tunnels for auto
vehicles only.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Cuts Key Rates Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank has
announced it will further cut its key rates as part of efforts to
bring down interest rates and spur borrowing by corporations and
industries.
</P>
<P>
Manila Standard newspaper Saturday quoted the Central Bank
Governor Gabriel Singson as saying that the forthcoming rate cut
will take effect on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ninth cut this year will bring the Central Bank's overnight
borrowing rates to 11.375 percent, and lending rates to 13.375
percent from the old rates of 11.75 percent and 13.75 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Singson noted the move would bring the cumulative decline in
the overnight rates to two percentage points since the start of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank also decided to slash the reserve requirement
against bank deposits by one percentage point to free an
additional 11 billion peso (1 U.S. dollar is equal to about 40
pesos) funds into the financial system. The bank also agreed to
exempt new loans from the mandatory two-percent provisioning for
probable loan losses.
</P>
<P>
"The monetary authorities have taken these steps in an
environment of falling inflation and continued stability of the
peso exchange rate, " Singson said.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in overnight rates would send a signal to banks
to lend their money to the private sector rather than to the
Central Bank given the much lower rate offered by the Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The recent move is also expected to influence the yields on the
auction for Treasury bills on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Both Singson and Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu Believed
the bellwether 91-day Treasury bill rate could go below 11 percent
this month with combined efforts by the monetary and fiscal
sectors to bring down interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Thai Senate Approves Alien Business Bill in Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's senate has approved in
principle an alien business bill which will allow foreigners to
open a variety of new businesses and even hold a majority
shareholding in a company, a TV report said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Senators late on Friday voted 76:1 for the Alien Business Bill
forwarded by the lower house on Wednesday. A 35-member panel was
set up to scrutinize it.
</P>
<P>
Senator Sen Burapa Attakorn, in response to objection to the
bill for "opening up the country unlimitedly" to foreigners, said
free enterprises by aliens would lead to competition which would
ultimately benefit Thais more than the aliens themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of countries had prospered primarily because
they had opened themselves up for broader foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The bill allows foreigners to engage in the following fields:
</P>
<P>
-- Construction of infrastructure which relies on "special"
technology and expertise if a foreigner can provide a minimum of
500 million baht (13.5 million U.S. dollars) in operating funds;
</P>
<P>
-- Brokerage in the stock market or farm futures market;
</P>
<P>
-- Accounting, legal and engineering services;
</P>
<P>
-- Milling rice and making flour from rice or other crops, and
</P>
<P>
-- Import or export businesses, with a minimum operating fund
of 100 million baht (2.7 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the bill bans foreigners from a number of businesses for
"special reasons". These businesses include:
</P>
<P>
-- Publishing newspapers and broadcasting radio or television
programs;
</P>
<P>
-- Farming, raising livestock and fruit growing;
</P>
<P>
-- Logging and making products from timber;
</P>
<P>
-- Sales of Thai artifacts and other historical objects, and
</P>
<P>
-- Fishing in Thai territorial waters.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Foils Tamil Rebel Attack on Colombo Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Navy has busted a
Tamil rebel plan to launch a simultaneous land and sea borne
attack on the Colombo port, the official Daily News reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A group of 14 rebels, belong to both their Black Tiger and Sea
Tiger Units were to have participated in this attack scheduled on
February 14, said the report, quoting naval intelligence sources.
</P>
<P>
The report said police arrested the suspected group leader
Adaikalam Anthony Amaradas, alias Aiyamanni Mohana, late last
month and had begun interrogating him.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the suspect had been decorated by the rebel
leader Prabhakaran himself for coming first among 35 competitors
in a five mile sea swim organized by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The planned attack on the Colombo port was busted when the navy
arrested a suspected Black Tiger cadre in Colombo a few months
ago.
</P>
<P>
Navy sources believe that the other members of the group are
still in the northern Wanni area controlled by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The LTTE does not send their cadres en masse to Colombo, but
instead, they are sent one by one," the report quoted navy sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
They said the rehearsals on the planned attack had even taken
place in the Wanni area under the supervision of Black Tiger
trainers.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are continuing to detect the cache of armaments
and explosives required for this attack.
</P>
<P>
LTTE rebels have been fighting the Sri Lankan government since
1983 for a separate homeland in the north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Jamaican PM Calls for Debate on Banana Issue at Caribbean Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Jamaican Prime Minister Percival
Patterson said in Port-of-Spain Friday that the implications of
the recent World Trade Organization (WTO) decision about bananas
must be discussed at the Caribbean States Association's second
summit scheduled for next week in the Dominican Republic
</P>
<P>
A WTO panel ruled that the European Union (EU) banana import
rules violate free trade regulations. It also decided that the
United States can impose trade sanctions for 191.4 million U.S.
dollars to compensate for the loss each year.
</P>
<P>
Patterson, also president of the Caribbean Community (Caricom)
Foreign Negotiations Committee, said he has held talks with
authorities of the islands affected by the WTO decision. He added
that he is seeking solutions to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
Saint Lucia Agriculture Minister Cassius Elias said he does not
think the Caribbean banana producing countries have lost their
interest in the trade war between the United States and the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said banana producers must not feel discouraged by the
regulation and should concentrate on reducing the high production
costs.
</P>
<P>
Other Caribbean leaders are also incensed over U.S. efforts to
get the WTO to revoke preferences given by some European countries
to former colonies in the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States is seeking penalties of more than 500 million
dollars on cashmere sweaters, Greek cheese and other imports from
the EU in retaliation for European regulations that discriminate
against bananas grown in Latin America by U.S. companies Chiquita
Brands International and Dole Foods.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (21) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Following is Part 21 of a
question and answer series of the ABCs of the Basic Law of the
Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
How should the independent judicial power of the Macao Special
Administrative Region be understood?
</P>
<P>
The judicial power is the power exclusively enjoyed by the
judicial organ in trying cases according to law and supervising
the enforcement of law.
</P>
<P>
Generally, as an important principle underlying the political
institutions, judicial independence exists in relation to the
executive power and legislative power.
</P>
<P>
It means that in trying cases, the judicial organ acts in
accordance with law and is free from any interference by the
executive organ or legislative organ. However, the independent
judicial power enjoyed by the MSAR as provided for in the Basic
Law is different from the principle of judicial independence in
the general sense of the term.
</P>
<P>
The "independent judicial power" in this context is not
intended to define its relations with the executive branch and the
legislative branch on a horizontal basis. Rather, it is intended
to stress that vertically, in terms of the relationship between
the Central Government and the MSAR, the judicial power of the
MSAR is not subject to the jurisdiction of the supreme judicial
organ of the country.
</P>
<P>
The affairs covered by its judicial power are entirely within
the scope of autonomy of the MSAR. It is precisely because of the
independent judicial power vested in it that the MSAR shall set up
a court of final adjudication and enjoy complete power of final
adjudication.

<HEADLINE> Almost 200,000 Thai Students Use Drugs: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Narcotics Control
Board (NCB) estimates that almost 200,000 students across the
country, or 1.4 percent of the student population, are addicted to
drugs, Jurin Laksanavisit, Minister of the Prime Minister's
Office, said.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 199,000 students using narcotics, 45.06 percent
are vocational students, 26.05 percent are from schools under the
General Education Department, 24.18 percent from schools under
National Primary Education Office, while 4.71 percent are
university students, Jurin said in remarks published by Saturday's
Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Amphetamines top the list among young drug users at 78.5
percent, while inhalant drugs account for 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Payon Pansri, secretary-general of the NCB, said
drugs are most rampant among students in the central provinces
with the number of young drug addicts accounting for 35 percent of
the total. Bangkok and northern provinces ranked second, with 24
percent each, northeastern provinces accounted for 13 percent,
with southern provinces making up 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The NCB will join up with Assumption University in conducting a
survey about drug addition among students two months after schools
reopen in the next semester.
</P>
<P>
The agency will evaluate the success of anti-drug campaigns at
the end of the year and again over the next two years by
considering three indices: areas where drugs use has severely
increased or decreased; whether the number of young (non-student)
addicts has increased or decreased; and the number of students
addicted to drugs.

<HEADLINE> Manila Says no to IMF's Budget Deficit Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
trashed prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
calling for a bigger deficit spending this year as way of
stimulating economic growth, the Philippine Post newspaper Said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu as
saying that government will stick to the existing 68.4 billion
peso (1 U.S. dollar is equal to about 40 pesos) deficit program
which remains attainable.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there is still a good chance for the
government to improve its revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
"I am very optimistic that the March collection of the Bureau
of Internal Revenue will be very good, to be improved further in
April which is the tax season," he said.
</P>
<P>
The visiting IMF mission was concerned that the Philippines
might not realize a positive growth unless the government spends
more to fuel important economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Under the standby IMF program, the country should grow by at
least 2.5 percent in terms of the gross national product and post
a two percent gross domestic production in 1999.

<P>
ROME, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government voiced support
on Friday for an appeal by United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan urging Yugoslavia to halt military action in Kosovo and
withdraw its army and militia forces from the province.
</P>
<P>
In a long telephone conversation with Annan, Italian Prime

behind the appeal and hope Annan's words would be heeded and win
the support of the entire U.N. Security Council.

and deportation" of civilians, allow the return of refugees and
the deployment of an international military force to ensure the
safety of these people and the arrival of humanitarian aid
shipments.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the premier's office said the Italian
government hopes these developments point to a way out of the
Kosovo crisis and will restore a leading role to the U.N. in the
search for a negotiated settlement leading to peace and stability
in the sensitive Balkan region.

Meanwhile, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Italy
fully approved the initiative and urged the U.N. to take a

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Election Plans Finalized: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's General Election
Commission (KPU) Friday announced his 53-member team has completed
all preparations to facilitate the implementation of the June 7
poll.
</P>
<P>
Rudini rejected pessimistic comments from several political
analysts, who say the "sluggish" performance of the KPU may delay
the general election.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also fear that recent bloody clashes in many region
may disrupt the election.
</P>
<P>
But Rudini said the KPU has done its best and ultimately the
fate of the election is in God's hands.
</P>
<P>
"Our works refer to the June 7 general election and the
preparations have now been completed. But as human beings, we can
only make the efforts, God will make the decision (on whether the
election will be delayed or not)," Rudini said.
</P>
<P>
Rudini said the election regulations issued by the KPU include
campaign rules, monitoring activities, voter registration
requirements, and numerous other matters.
</P>
<P>
He said the matter of ballots has also been agreed upon. On
Tuesday, nine printing companies with security certificates from
the National Intelligence Agency will commence printing the
ballots.
</P>
<P>
"The security of the ballot printing is vital, because it
directly relates to the credibility of the June general election.
The printing companies cannot print more than they have been
ordered to. Not even one ballot more," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ballots will be ready in the capitals of all Indonesian
provinces on May 10, Rudini said.
</P>
<P>
The total general election budget is 1.3 trillion rupiah (about
150 million U.S. dollars), including 150 million rupiah for each
party, Rudini was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Saturday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Voter registration commenced on April 5 and will close on May
5. The official campaign period begins on May 19 and will conclude
on June 4.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, voter are scheduled to elect 462 members of the
House of Representatives (DPR), who will join 38 appointees from
the Indonesian National Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
The 500 House members will later this year meet with 135
delegates from regions and 65 delegates from various groups to
form the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
The MPR will convene in November to elect the next president
and vice president.
</P>
<P>
After the June election, parties with the majority of votes in
each respective province and district, will name their cadres who

<HEADLINE> Political Solution to Be Sought for Kosovo: French FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Allied military actions were needed
in Kosovo but sooner or later a political solution will be sought,
said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine who arrived here
Friday for a one-day visit at the invitation of his Bulgarian
counterpart Nadezhda Mihailova.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference following his meeting with Mihailova,
Vedrine said Bulgaria and France have similar positions on the
Kosovo crisis. Both sides agree that people who were chased away,
traumatized and maltreated should not be driven away from their
homes a second time, he said, adding that France would provide aid.
</P>
<P>
On the future of the region, Vedrine said dialogue between
Bulgaria and France on security and stability in the Balkans will
continue.
</P>
<P>
Mihailova briefed Vedrine on Sofia's program to limit the
fallout on Bulgaria from the war in Kosovo, and called on France
to support and provide specific aid in infrastructure projects and
attracting foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine promised that the Paris Club will review the situation
resulting from the Kosovo crisis at its next session.
</P>
<P>
France has suggested that the European Union (EU) review its
relations with Yugoslavia's neighbors in order to accelerate a
speedier EU integration, Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Vedrine met with Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov on the Kosovo crisis and the refugees issue. They agreed
that NATO military operations were inevitable and legitimate, but
the two were also considering a future political solution, Vedrine
said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine reiterated France's desire to strengthen political
dialogue with Bulgaria. "We want to further develop bilateral
relations in the political, economic and cultural field," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov and
leaders of the parliamentary Committee on Foreign and Integration
Policy.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister praised Bulgaria's stand on the
Kosovo crisis and committed himself to presenting before the EU
General Affairs Council Bulgaria's program to reduce the negative
effects of the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Price Closes Slightly Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The average price of Venezuelan
crude during the week ending Friday was 12.95 U.S. dollars per
barrel, nine cents below the average price last week, the Energy
and Mines Ministry (MEM) announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
This slight drop leaves the average price for the year at 9.88
dollars per barrel, below the 10.63 dollars in 1998, and far below
the 1997 average of 16.32 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The MEM said the drop corresponds to "a correction in the
market after a strong rise in the previous weeks and to the
normalization of operations in United States refineries."
</P>
<P>
The oil prices have strengthened since the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members and independent
producers decided in March to reduce the supply and force the main
consuming nations to use their inventories.
</P>
<P>
Oil makes up 70 percent of Venezuelan exports and provides more
than 50 percent of the income for its national budget.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that for every dollar the oil price goes
up or down, Venezuela's treasury earns or loses about one billion
dollars a year.

TIRANA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Albania will recognize the "Kosovo

<P>
The self-claimed government, which consists of members of the

Before Thaci's "government," established on April 2, there had

Bujar Bukoshi as the "prime minister."
</P>

Saying it is high time to reconsider the status of Kosovo,
Majko added that the Rambouillet peace agreement reached in
February is still alive and open to discussions in this regard,

<HEADLINE> Philippines Okays '99 Investment Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Board of
Investments has endorsed the 1999 Investment Priorities Plan (IPP)
without objections, Manila Standard newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The IPP is an annual listing of government's preferred areas of
economic activity that are eligible for fiscal incentives such as
duty-free importation of equipment.
</P>
<P>
Board of Investments Executive Director Elmer Hernandez was
quoted by the newspaper as saying that the 1999 IPP aims to direct
investments in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Other objectives of the 1999 IPP are: create employment and
reduce the cost of living, increase agricultural productivity
through modernization and support the development of small and
medium enterprises, Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the previous IPPs, he noted, the 1999 IPP integrates the
priority activity of each region, which means some industries may
be eligible for incentives in one region but may not be eligible
for incentives in other regions.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of an industry is based on whether or not the
industry will be profitable based on such measures as the domestic
resource cost, the revealed comparative advantage, economic
internal rate of return and market, technical and financial
analysis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that the IPP take into account are the industry's
linkages with upstream and downstream projects and its
infrastructure requirements.

<HEADLINE> Oil Exploration Goes With Environmental Protection In Tarim Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Many overseas and domestic
environmentalists worried about the environment at the Tarim Basin
in far northwest Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region when large-scale
oil exploration began there in 1989.
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of development, however, the local environment
has been improving rather than deteriorating thanks to the efforts
of the Tarim Basin Oil Exploration and Development Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Daixuan, an official in charge of
environmental protection with the headquarters, 410 million yuan,
or 2 percent of the total investment at the site, has been spent
on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Now, eight oil fields that are in production are free from oil
pollution and 40 stations have been established to monitor air and
water quality in the oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Also, 10 million yuan has been invested for the trial
construction of an artificial oasis in this desert land, with
plants and grasses that grow well in the arid sand-dunes covered
region.
</P>
<P>
Some 230,000 trees and grasses covering an area of 150,000
square meters were planted around oil exploration areas in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
Located in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, 60 percent
of the Tarim Basin is covered by the 324,000-square-kilometer
Taklimakan Desert, the world's second largest floating desert.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "Sea of Death," the desert's annual precipitation
is only 50 millimeters, and sandstorms hit the area every four
days on average.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Basin has proven oil and gas reserves of 19.1 billion
tons and is expected to become a giant energy base in northwest
China in the next century.

MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet in
Oslo, the capital of Norway, next Tuesday to discuss the crisis in
Kosovo, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at jointly seeking a political solution to
the Kosovo crisis. The two officials are also expected to discuss
current relations between Russia and the United States, the ITAR-
Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the first formal meeting between Ivanov and Albright
since NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the State Duma (Russia's lower house of
parliament) Gennady Seleznyov said Russian President Boris Yeltsin
supported Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's request for his
country's membership in the Russia-Belarus union.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said if it joins the union, Yugoslavia would get
military technology aid from Russia while Russian troops and
fleets could be deployed in Yugoslavia.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United fans hailed the
Government's decision to block BSkyB's 623 million pounds bid to
buy the club as a "victory for football on Friday".
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Stephen Byers, ruled
against the takeover following an investigation into the deal by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA)
, which has been in the vanguard of the fight to stop the takeover,
claimed Byers' decision was not just a victory for them, but the
whole game.
</P>
<P>
IMUSA chairman Andy Walsh said: "The announcement today is not
just a tremendous victory for the fans of Manchester United, but a
victory for football.
</P>
<P>
"Back at the beginning of September when the takeover was made
public, nobody gave us a snowball's chance in hell of blocking the
bid.
</P>
<P>
"But, through a passionate belief in the need for Manchester
United to remain independent, we have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
"That is due to the overwhelming opposition of the majority of
Manchester United fans.
</P>
<P>
"United fans from all over the world have contacted us to voice
their opposition and offer their support.
</P>
<P>
"But we could not have done this on our own and we have had
support from fans all over the country, from Slough Town to
Newcastle United, and that is why this is a victory for football.
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is one of absolute euphoria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former United manager, Tommy Docherty, added his name to the
list of relieved supporters, saying: "I'm absolutely delighted and
the fans will be too.
</P>
<P>
"A football club belongs to football supporters -- not to
companies.
</P>
<P>
"Fans around the world will be celebrating, not only in
Manchester, but in Zambia, Tokyo and Germany.
</P>
<P>
"And they'll all be thrilled to bits I'm sure. My main concern
was that BSkyB would run football -- and they're not football
people,"he added.

<HEADLINE> Fowler Suspended Six Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool's striker Robbie Fowler
was suspended six matches by the Football Association on Friday
after his clash with Chelsea's Graeme Le Saux and his
controversial goal celebration against Everton.
</P>
<P>
Fowler was given a two-game ban for the incident with Le Saux
and a further four for his goal celebration in the Merseyside
derby that was thought to mimic taking cocaine after a hearing in
Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
Fowler was also fined 32,000 pounds plus costs for his actions
while Le Saux was given a one-match ban plus a 5,000 pounds fine.
The bans will take effect from April 24.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool say they intend to appeal the decision, while Chelsea
have yet to comment.
</P>
<P>
The FA's interim executive director David Davies delivered a
lengthy statement at the conclusion of the hearing.
</P>
<P>
"An FA Commission has spent more than five hours considering
charges against Graeme Le Saux and Robbie Fowler following the
Chelsea-Liverpool game on February 27 and against Robbie Fowler
alone in connection with last Saturday's Merseyside derby match.
</P>
<P>
"The latter case was considered today at the request of
Liverpool. The players both admitted the misconduct charges
against them.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission's view was that Graeme Le Saux should be
suspended for one match from April 24.
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't and wouldn't condone a violent action by any
player in any circumstances. They did accept that Graeme Le Saux
had been subjected to considerable provocation.
</P>
<P>
"Robbie Fowler was suspended for two matches in connection with
the Stamford Bridge incident and for four matches for what
happened last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The Commission believes highly paid international players are
role models. They are also human beings whose behaviour sometimes
falls below the standards expected of them.
</P>
<P>
"But mutual respect for each other is the absolute minimum
requirement. The FA has an anti-discrimination policy and a
commitment to fight drugs abuse which are well known and highly
regarded," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Wise Could Face UEFA Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea skipper, Dennis Wise, could
face a UEFA investigation after video footage from Thursday's Cup
Winners' Cup clash appeared to show him attempting to bite Real
Mallorca's Elena Marcelino.
</P>
<P>
Wise, who has already been sent off three times this season,
apparently reacted to provocation from Marcelino. But his actions
may prompt UEFA to launch an investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
The clash was missed by Dutch referee Dick Jol, while Chelsea
coach Ray Wilkins has vowed to examine TV replays.
</P>
<P>
Wilkins said: "I can't honestly say I saw that while the game
was going on.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to see the replay and see what the situation is."
</P>
<P>
Marcelino, who may have been guilty of digging his fingernails
into Wise's neck, said: "He caught me with his hand and tried to
provoke me.
</P>
<P>
"I had to be very calm but someone has told me that he also
tried to bite me. It is certainly not common but I didn't feel
anything.
</P>
<P>
"The referee also didn't see anything so he is very clever.
He's a good player but has a strong character and maybe that's his
problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> BSkyB/Man United Deal Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Trade and
Industry of Britain ruled on Friday to block the takeover deal by
the BSkyB of the leading English soccer club Manchester United Plc.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secretary Stephen Byers said that the one billion dollar
deal "may be expected to operate against the public interest and
that it should be prohibited".
</P>
<P>
The 623 million pound (999.2 million U.S. dollars) bid by BSkyB,
40 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, was referred to
Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) last October.
The MMC presented its report to Byers last month and the minister
said he had accepted its findings.
</P>
<P>
"The MMC's findings are based mainly on competition grounds,
where they concluded that the merger would adversely affect
competition between broadcasters," Byers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"But they also examined wider public interest issues,
concluding that the merger would damage the quality of British
football," he added.
</P>
<P>
The planned deal would have brought together the nation's
leading pay TV broadcaster and the biggest and most successful
English soccer club. BSkyB has live TV rights to premier league
matches under a contract which runs until 2001.
</P>
<P>
The decision was immediately greeted by Manchester United
supporters opposed to the takeover. Shares in the club dived on
the London Stock Exchange in reaction to the news.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder to Be Elected SPD Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder is due to be formally confirmed as chairman of the
ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) at the party's special
congress scheduled for next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The convention in Bonn will be attended by 450 delegates,
representing 775,000 members of the biggest political party in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The one-day congress is expected to easily and unopposedly
elect Schroeder to head the SPD, and to approve Germany's role in
NATO operations against Yugoslavia, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the German government and its policy to be
strengthened by the SPD party congress," Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping said Friday, adding that about 70 percent of the party
members backed the government's policy in Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, holding the control over the SPD since the
surprising resignation of Oscar Lafonaine both as party chairman
and Finance Minister in March, has won support of the exacutive
circle.
</P>
<P>
And, the traditional wingers in the SPD following Lafontaine,
who have been strongly against the NATO strikes, are reportedly
toning down a counter-resolution that doest not directly demand
halt to NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
The main demand of the party traditionalists will be that the
United Nations, not NATO, should secure peace in Kosovo, the
Frankfurt Allgemeine newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Rejects Ground Troops for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping Friday clearly rejected
sending NATO ground combat forces to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The German government sees no reason to change its strategy.
We have made it clear that we do not want to deploy ground
troops," Schroeder said in an interview by the German RTL
television.
</P>
<P>
Sending ground forces is not in Bonn's agenda, Defense Minister
Rudolf Scharping said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told the
ZDF television that he could not decide if deployment of ground
troops was unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know, I cannot make this decision given the current
situation," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
The interview did not mean any shift toward backing ground
troops, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A poll by Germany's N-TV channel showed that 60 percent of
those surveyed were opposed to deploying ground forces. And, they
also firmly said "no" against the possibility that German forces
take part in the ground campaigns outside Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The red line must not be crossed," former Defense Minister
Volker Ruehe of the opposition Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
said.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Close Higher On Back Of Rates Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets closed
higher Friday after a larger than expected cut in euro zone
interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 closed 0.54 percent, or 34.9 points, higher
at 6472.8, just shy of its record closing high set Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the session, the index had breached the
psychologically significant 6500 barrier for the first time,
marking its third intraday high of the week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say investors are now focusing on the seriousness of
possible Russian involvement in the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a very strong week, and now it's time to take a
breather to see where things are going," said a London trader.
</P>
<P>
German's Xetra DAX closed at 5133.92, up 66.16 points, on hopes
that the interest rates cut by the ECB will stimulate the German
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the market lost some of its optimism on reports that
Russia was targeting missiles at some European countries as a
result of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"This news broke the market's impetus," a trader said. "The
threat seems serious and we really don't know what to expect," he
added.
</P>
<P>
French share prices closed higher but off earlier highs. The
Cac 40 index finished up 32.44 points at 4363.14.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes investment on
its energy and environment projects from American enterprises,
visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. enterprises in this field are welcomed to continue their
active participation in the construction of energy and environment
projects in China, Zhu said in a speech at a roundtable session
attended by heads of over 10 famous U.S. energy and environment
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that with the further implementation of the
sustainable development strategy of China, its energy and
environment industries such as electricity, petroleum and gas,
environment protection are facing an unprecedented opportunity for
development, creating more favorable conditions for the China-U.S.
cooperation in this field.
</P>
<P>
The roundtable meeting was also attended by U.S. Vice President
Al Gore, who co-chaired with Premier Zhu the second session of the
China-U.S. Forum on Environment and Development.
</P>
<P>
The two countries Friday signed two documents of intention on
energy and environment cooperation and the Protocol to the
Agreement between China and the United States Relating to Civil
Air Transport.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States have strengthened bilateral
cooperation in energy and environment protection in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In March 1997, China and the U.S. established the forum on
environment and development. U.S. Vice President AL Gore attended
the first session of the China-U.S. Forum on Energy and
Environment in Beijing in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"They consider it a critical challenge to develop and
effitiently use energy resources, protect the global environment,
and promote environmentally sound growth and development," said a
China-U.S. Joint Statement issued in October 1997 following the
talks between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The principal areas of bilateral cooperation in this field
include clean energy, urban air pollution control, rural
electrification, and global environment issues such as climate
change, desertification and bio-diversity.
