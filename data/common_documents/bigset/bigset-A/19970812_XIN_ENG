<HEADLINE> Canada to Provide New Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced today that it
will provide 4.5 million Canadian dollars (3.2 million US dollars)
in additional food aid to famine victims in the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) will
provide food to the DPRK in the form of up to 2.5 million dollars
(1.8 million US dollars) worth of canned fish, by way of the World
Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Canadian Food Grains Bank will provide up to 2
million dollars (1.4 million US dollars) worth of Canadian grains.
</P>
<P>
"North Korea is experiencing a famine unprecedented in its
history," said Diane Marleau, Canadian minister for international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We want to do our part to ensure that North Koreans,
especially the children most severely affected, have enough to
eat," she added.
</P>
<P>
Canada decided to provide additional food aid to the DPRK after
a recent WFP appeal, which said the Asian country needs at least
330,000 metric tons of food aid to double rations for children six
years old and under.
</P>
<P>
With the new contribution, Canadian aid to the DPRK to
alleviate the effects of famine now totals over 10 million dollars
(7.2 million US dollars), according to CIDA figures.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Plans Tougher Punishment of Neo-Nazi Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The German government is planning
legislation for tougher punishment of violent neo-Nazi youths in
the country, according to a senior member of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's party today.
</P>
<P>
Bonn is also considering providing police with better means to
listen in on cell-phones being used by extremist suspects, said
Erwin Marschewski, the domestic policy spokesman for Kohl's
Christian Democratic alliance parliamentary faction.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper,
Marschewski said the number of neo-Nazis ready to use violence has
risen to 9,000 in Germany. "The bad thing is that these extremists
are increasingly arming themselves," he added.
</P>
<P>
Illegal weapons were being imported from ex-Yugoslavia, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A government report issued earlier this year reported the
figure of violent neo-Nazis at 6,400. It also showed that reported
rightist crimes in Germany totaled 8,730 in 1996, compared with
7,896 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, male youths committed majority of the
violent rightist crimes in Germany. Of the 751 people convicted of
such attacks last year, it said, over 66 percent were aged between
16 and 20 and only 4 percent were female.
</P>
<P>
Notably, there have been repeated, unprovoked attacks by
neo-Nazi youths in eastern Germany in recent years, showed press
reports.

<HEADLINE> Two German Soldiers Admit Anti-Foreigner Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Two German soldiers have admitted
setting alight a foreigners' hostel in the eastern German city of
Dresden Saturday because they hate foreigners, investigators said
today.
</P>
<P>
The two recruits, aged 18 and 20, were arrested Sunday and
admitted that they had smeared two swastikas on the building and
then torched it early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The hostel was burnt out, but nobody was injured because the
inhabitants, Italian construction workers, had gone on vacation
shortly before.
</P>
<P>
The hostel had been the target of an earlier arson attack in
December 1996. Authorities said they were investigating whether
the two soldiers were also involved in that incident.
</P>
<P>
The German Defense Ministry in Bonn meanwhile started its own
investigation into the case and said that the two soldiers would
be punished with the hardest disciplinary measures.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Tax Relations With Inland Area Elaborated (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Ministry of
Finance and State Administration of Taxation said here today that
tax laws and regulations of the inland area will not apply to the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, they said that according the
Basic Law of the HKSAR, Hong Kong is a special administrative
region of the People's Republic of China and, in line with the
"one country, two systems" principle, will continue its previous
political and economic systems.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, Hong Kong will enact laws on its
own for taxes, tax rates, tax reductions, allowances, and
exemptions and other matters of taxation.
</P>
<P>
In reply to issues on Hong Kong's agreements with foreign
countries on taxes, the officials quoted the Basic Law's Article
153 as saying, "the application to the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of international agreements to which the
People's Republic of China is or becomes a party shall be decided
by the Central People's Government, in accordance with the
circumstances and needs of the region, and after consulting the
government of the region."
</P>
<P>
They said that the current 56 tax agreements signed by the
Chinese government with foreign countries only apply in the inland
area, because they were drafted according to the characteristics
of the inland area and those of the foreign countries involved.

The officials noted that Article 151 of the Basic Law clearly
states that "the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may on
its own, using the name 'Hong Kong, China' maintain or develop
relations and conclude and implement agreements with foreign
states and regions and relevant international organizations in
appropriate areas, including the economy, trade, finance and
money, shipping, communications, tourism, culture, and sports."
</P>
<P>
After July 1, they said, the central government will continue
to welcome Hong Kong investors. Those who pay taxes in accordance
with the law will continue to enjoy preferential tax policies
given to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that Hong Kong investors and those who get
income from the inland area will continue to follow the current
tax policies of the inland area for foreign companies,
enterprises, economic organizations and individuals.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the difference between Hong Kong investors and those from
other regions, the officials said, the preferential policies
signed between China and the rest of the world are in fact not the
same as tax reductions or exemptions.
</P>
<P>
The basic idea of avoiding double taxation is to co-ordinate
or divide jurisdiction over taxes between the two countries
involved, which is a means of avoiding double taxation.
</P>
<P>
If many countries collect taxes from their citizens' domestic
and foreign incomes, both sides reserve the jurisdiction over
their own citizens while admitting the prior tax of the other
country, where their citizen's income is earned.
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers should note the double taxation jurisdictions, and
preferential treatment in one country does not indicate the
person's final taxes because the home country can still have tax
jurisdiction while the country of income can reduce or exempt
taxes, they explained.
</P>
<P>
In actual circumstances, the amount of taxes Hong Kong
investors pay is not higher than those of other overseas
investors in the inland area. Overseas investors in inland areas
are taxed by both the Chinese inland area and their home country,
while Hong Kong business people need only pay taxes to the inland
department because Hong Kong has regional jurisdiction principles.
</P>
<P>
The actual taxes of overseas investors are usually decided by
their home countries' tax policies, while Hong Kong investors'
taxes are only decided by the inland area.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Hong Kong investors and other overseas investors'
tax status should be compared according to both their taxes in the
inland area and the home country or area of residence.

<TEXT>
<P>
Trade between the inland area and the HKSAR, they said, is
regarded as between two different tariff zones of one sovereign
country after the return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In taxation, the inland area regards Hong Kong as it does in
trade with foreign companies, enterprises, and other economic
organizations and individuals, and this will continue, they said.
</P>
<P>
Import tariffs, value-added tax, and consumption tax are to be
paid on goods imported from Hong Kong to the inland area, while
goods exported to Hong Kong can be exempt from taxes or get refund
according to appropriate regulations.
</P>
<P>
The officials also talked about some basic principles in
dealing with the issue of double taxation in the inland area and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
First, an agreement to avoid double taxation that is usually
signed between two sovereign countries should not be used between
the Chinese inland area and Hong Kong because the problem should
be restricted to areas within one sovereign country but under
different systems, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Second, according to Hong Kong tax laws, Hong Kong residents do
not need to pay income tax on income earned outside the region and
there is similar articles in the inland tax laws. This basically
avoids the possibility of double taxation, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
But, double taxation may not be ruled out in certain cases,
because of differences in standards and in certain laws in the two
areas, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Individuals or units can appeal to the central government's
finance departments to settle the issue with their counterparts
in the HKSAR through consultations, they said.

<HEADLINE> Ross Continues Mediation Amid Positive Signs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Amid some positive signs,
United States peace envoy Dennis Ross continued intensive shuttle
diplomacy today aimed at restoring the stalled
Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ross held a flurry of talks with Israeli officials, Egyptian
Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny and European Union (EU) peace envoy
Miguel Moratinos in a bid to mobilize all the peace efforts to
break the ice in Israeli-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy met separately with Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai today after
succeeding in arranging a meeting between Israeli officials and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat and
Palestinian security officials overnight in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Ross met separately with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat each twice. After 11 p.m. in the
night, Ross headed back to Ramallah to hold the second meeting
with Arafat, accompanied by Netanyahu's attorney Yitzhak Molcho
and head of the General Security Service, Ami Ayalon.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Israeli and Palestinian security officials
was the first since the double bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane
Yehuda market on July 30, in which 15 people were killed and 170
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
But Ross donwplayed the importance of the meeting after his
talks with Levy, and stressed that he hoped for substantial
results.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting that took place last night and (those) will be
taking place are steps in the direction of reestablishing their
relationship. Clearly, what's important is not meetings for their
own sake, but meetings will produce tangible results," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ross revealed that he did not expect to remain much longer in
the region, indicating that both Israelis and Palestinians should
show flexibility to achieve quick results in restoring the
security cooperation. This would pave the way for a much-expected
visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side was apparently disappointed with Ross'
stress solely on Israel's security needs, and wanted the U.S. to
be more balanced by addressing the Palestinian complaints about
Israel's punitive sanctions taken following the Jerusalem
bombings, including the closure, and halt of transferring tax
revenues.
</P>
<P>
In a rare gesture, Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny
expressed support to Ross' efforts to restore the
Israeli-Palestinian security ties. "Now we are talking only about
security coordination and (how) to set up the atmosphere, and
after that Mrs. Albright will come to continue the American
efforts," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ross also met today with EU envoy Moratinos to brief him on his
meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Moratinos, who met
with Arafat early in the day, disclosed that EU was sending an
anti-terrorism expert to help the PNA fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel continued exerting pressure on the PNA to
launch a fight against terrorism. Uzi Arad, Netanyahu's adviser
on diplomatic affairs, told the American television network CNN
that the current situation remained "serious", and the PNA must
fulfil its commitments to fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the consequence would be if the PNA refuses to
accept the Israeli demand, Arad warned: "Otherwise we will have no
progress, it's as simple as that."

<HEADLINE> France Backs Resumption of Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its support
for a resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestinians, and
wished U.S. Middle East coordinator Denis Ross success in his
mediation between the two sides which began last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"A will of dialogue exists, even though the gap is
unfortunately very wide between the positions of one and
another," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He said that France "ardently supports" the mission of Ross,
which he said "appears to have a good augury."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli security officials met for the first
time Sunday in the presence of Ross, after Israel suspended its
overall contacts with the Palestinians after a terrorist bombing
attack upon a Jewish marketplace in Jerusalem on July 30.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who renewed his peace mission after a four-month
suspension, had persuaded the two sides to resume dialogue in
security matters, which was suspended by the Palestinians to
protest Israeli construction of settlements on Arab land.

approximately in the year 1215 B.C., according to the Egyptian
culture minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that the restored tombs which will be opened in
November include that of a senior statesman called Roie. The tomb
is characterized by scenes of daily life such as tilling of soil,
yielding of flax crop and such religious rituals as funerals,
sacrifices as well as religious writings.

<HEADLINE> France Again Expresses Worry Over Situation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- France today described the
situation in southern Lebanon as "more and more worrying," as
Israeli troops and pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas are continuing
their fighting there.
</P>
<P>
"The French government is following the evolution of the
situation and considers it more and more worrying," said French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen people, 14 of them Lebanese, were killed and 29 others,
three of them Israelis, wounded in the tit-for-tat attacks between
Israeli troops and Hezbollah guerrillas in one week's time.
</P>
<P>
"The number of the Lebanese victims and the fact that rockets
fell on the Israeli territories cannot but aggravate the tension,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Le Monde, Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafic Hariri said that the tension in southern Lebanon is
linked with the "impasse" of relations between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Hariri also criticized Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for
indirectly holding Lebanon responsible for the double-bombing
attack in Jerusalem at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
Citing information from Israeli security, Arafat said on
Israeli television recently that the two terrorists who made the
attack "came from abroad."
</P>
<P>
Hariri also said that it could be the Palestinians who fired
the rockets which fell in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah rejected responsibility for the rocket attack
upon Israel.

<HEADLINE> None of 150 Possible Nazis on Swiss Bank List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's center for the
investigation of Nazi crimes said today that some 150 names on the
list of dormant Holocaust-era accounts published by Swiss banks
could possibly be Nazis, but none of them were still wanted.
</P>
<P>
Willi Dressen, head of the Ludwigsburg-based organization, told
the German Press Agency dpa that the center was seeking further
information from the banks to confirm if these people were the
same as those on his files.
</P>
<P>
The center has found some 200 names on the list match those of
Nazi criminals, and some 50 of them, however, also identical with
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
Dressen noted that none of the suspected Nazis on the list were
now still being sought for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Bankers Association in July published a list of 1,756
foreigners who had invested money in Switzerland before May 9,
1945 and had not been heard ever since, with a view to helping
trace heirs to the accounts held by Nazi victims during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that the list could include names of Nazis
who secretly channeled funds to neutral Switzerland during the
war.
</P>
<P>
The dormant accounts are believed to worth 60.2 million Swiss
francs (some 40 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns Japanese Officials for Planning to Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today strongly condemned a group of
Japanese cabinet members for planning to formally and collectively
pay respect to the Yasukuni Shrine which contains cinerary caskets
of some Japanese war criminals.
</P>
<P>
A commentary carried by the DPRK newspaper "Rodong Sinmun"
termed the plan as a farce, saying that the Yasukuni Shrine is a
place compiling the history of vicious Japanese militarism.
</P>
<P>
All the Asian people who were suffered from the Japanese
invasion during World War II have been condemning the Japanese
authorities for paying homage to the Yasukuni Shrine or seeking to
do so,
</P>
<P>
Paying respect to the Yasukuni Shrine hurts the Asian people's
hearts and is an action to seek to revive the militarism, it added.
</P>
<P>
So, paying homage to the Yasukuni Shrine is a political issue
which will show the direction of the development of Japanese
politics in the future, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that the Yasukuni Shrine has become
a stronghold of the Japanese militarists who want to spread the
idea of retaliation among the Japanese people and create the
atmosphere for reviving the militarism.
</P>
<P>
But in any case, the Japanese authorities cannot make the farce
legitimate and reasonable, it noted, adding that Japan cannot be
trusted by the world unless it learns the lesson from the history
and breaks with the mistakes committed in the past.

<HEADLINE> Death Rate Gap in UK Widens to Worst for 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- People in Britain's big cities,
especially in the North, are increasingly likely to die before
people live in small towns, according to a new study of death
rates in Britain.
</P>
<P>
People living in areas with the highest mortality rates are now
almost twice as likely to die prematurely as those who live where
mortality rates are lowest -- the greatest degree of inequality.
</P>
<P>
Among the worst places are Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, and
urban Glamorganshire. The best are the small towns of Kent,
Surrey, Middlesex, Hertfordshire and Essex.
</P>
<P>
The figures have emerged in an analysis by Dr Daniel Dorling,
of the University of Bristol, in a report for the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"Many people think life chances have been getting better all
the time, so to learn that we are more unequal than we were in the
1950s may be surprising," said the author.
</P>
<P>
Tessa Jowell, public health minister, has ordered a review of
health inequality by Sir Douglas Black, who first reported on the
issue in 1980. But almost all experts agree that little can be
done about it without first tackling inequality of income.
</P>
<P>
While there have been substantial improvements in survival, the
research found that one in 12 of the population now live in areas
where premature death rates are 15 percent above the national
average.
</P>
<P>
Differences in death rates cannot be blamed on factors such as
smoking alone because death rates among children show similar
divergences, meaning that where a child is born is more important
than ever in determining his or her chances of survival.
</P>
<P>
Dorling said it was "extremely unlikely" that Britain would be
able to meet a commitment, given under a World Health Organization
program in 1985, to cut health inequality as gauged by mortality
rates by a quarter by 2000.

BRUSSELS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will inspect 35 places in
August to verify the implementation of the anti-chemical weaponry
convention.
</P>
<P>
OPCW specialists inspected another 30 places between June and
July and have planned more inspection tours for the near future,
according to an OPCW press release received here today.
</P>
<P>
The number of inspection tours was reported to the third
session of the OPCW Executive Council which took place in the
Hague from July 28 to August 1, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
OPCW specialists have up to 390 days after the signing of the
anti-chemical weaponry convention to verify the identity and
quantity of the chemical weaponry stocks to be destroyed and to
confirm such destruction.
</P>
<P>
A total of 98 countries and regions have ratified or acceded to
the convention while the Hague-based OPCW is waiting for another

<HEADLINE> UK Workers Better Off Than Employees in Most EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's average workers earn
more money back home than their counterparts in other leading
European Union (EU) countries, according to a survey published
today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, by the consultants Sedgwick Noble Lowndes and which
allows for differences in national pricing and purchasing
differences as well as tax and welfare contributions, placed
Britain in the fourth with its workers receiving the equivalent of
6.8 pounds (10.7 US dollars) an hour.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg workers are top of the league with net hourly
earnings of 7.4 pounds (11.7 US dollars). Austria is in second
place at 7.1 pounds (11.2 US dollars), followed by Ireland at
seven pounds (11 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Germany is seventh at net level with hourly take-home pay of
6.5 pounds (10.3 US dollars), and France in eighth position at 6.3
pounds (10 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The survey said that outside Europe, the average Japanese
employee earns a net 8.9 pounds (14 US dollars) hourly, while the
US average is 6.9 pounds (10.9 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Deductions from gross earnings for UK workers are assessed at
an average of 25 percent, compared with 33 percent in Germany and
38 percent in Denmark, which reduce the higher salaries of their
employees to below the UK level.
</P>
<P>
David Formosa, international research manager at Sedgwick,
said, "For many years, the general impression has been that UK
employees enjoy a lower standard of living than in other parts of
central and northern Europe. This is certainly not borne out by
the figures."
</P>
<P>
"Other countries may offer higher gross salaries but this does
not mean that their citizens are always better off," he added.

<HEADLINE> US Government Intervenes UPS Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- After a week of Teamsters
strike against UPS, the U.S. government began to intervene the
dispute today as Labor Secretary Alexis Herman called on both
sides to meet with her and find a way to get back to the
negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
"I've asked the leaders of the Teamsters union and the United
Parcel Service to meet with me today at the Labor Department and
they have both agreed," Herman said in a statement early today.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to talk with each party individually to find out what
it will take to move these talks forward and to urge greater
flexibility and a willingness to compromise to get back to the
bargaining table," she said.
</P>
<P>
Herman told NBC's "Meet the Press" Sunday, "The president
recognizes that these are serious issues: the nature of part-time
work, pension protection for American workers. These are all
issues that we care about."
</P>
<P>
UPS Vice Chairman John Alden said today on ABC's "Good Morning
America" that he could not promise anything when asked if UPS
would hire replacements for strikers.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we have no plans to hire people. We would like our
people to come back to work. I can't promise what the future will
bring," he said.
</P>
<P>
Herman asked the two sides not to "escalate this strike" and
said hiring replacements for the 185,000 striking union members
"does contribute to that escalation."
</P>
<P>
Teamsters President Ron Carey said on CBS on Sunday that "I
think he would have a problem" if the company did hire
replacements."
</P>
<P>
The dispute focuses on two issues: the company's demand to
withdraw from the Teamsters' multi-employer pension plan and the
union's call to convert thousands of part-time jobs into full-time
ones.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent of UPS employees work part time, and there
hasn't been an increase in their base wage of eight dollars an
hour since 1982, much lower than the full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
UPS normally handles 12 million parcels and letters daily. The
work stoppage's damage to small businesses' operations throughout
the country has governors and business leaders clamoring for White
House intervention.

<HEADLINE> Peace Process Not Restricted to Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa reaffirmed today that the peace process is not restricted
to the security issue.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the statement to reporters after having received a
phone call from U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross who is currently
continuing his intensive shuttle diplomacy between the Israelis
and Palestinians, according to the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that the security issue is important to both the
Palestinians and Israelis, and the implementation of the
signed agreements is also very important.
</P>
<P>
Moussa indicated that the peace process is not restricted to
the security issue, though it constitutes one of the obstacles
that have to be overcome and settled.
</P>
<P>
The peace process, he added, embraces other issues as well,
such as settlements and the final phase negotiations, because
these issues constitute the core of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also reiterated the importance of restoring confidence
between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, pointing out that
the peace process needs to regain the confidence of the whole
region.
</P>
<P>
Ross is currently endeavoring to restore confidence between
the Palestinian and Israeli sides with regard to security
issues, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright would undertake, during her forthcoming Middle
East tour which is due to take place either at the end of this
month or early next month, all aspects of the strategic peace
issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa met here today with U.S. Ambassador in Cairo
Edward Walker to discuss Ross's current mission in the region and
the ongoing efforts to resume peace negotiations between the
Palestinian and Israeli sides.

<HEADLINE> Increased UN Fund in Bosnia's Demining Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The UN Mission in Bosnia
(UNMIBH) today appealed to the international community to increase
investment in the demining activities in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
UNMIBH spokesman Alexander Ivanko said that due to the world's
"donor fatigue" towards Bosnia, there is a shortfall of 60 million
US dollars in the UN-organized demining activities in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
For the funding target of 23 million dollars this year, seven
million have been collected so far and only one tenth of the 1,200
people necessary for demining in Bosnia have been trained and
working.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely important that cash contribution comes as soon
as possible because the demining season in Bosnia is very, very
short" as snow begins to fall in early October, said Ivanko.
</P>
<P>
Since UN demining activities are concentrated in areas where
refugees are returning, the investment for the demining purpose
contributes to accelerating refugees' returns as well as saving
lives, the UN spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In the more than three years of the Bosnian war up to the end
of 1995, an estimated 3 million mines had been laid by the
country's ethnic foes and only a fraction of them have been
demined.
</P>
<P>
The remaining mines not only hinder the recovery of living in
the country, but cause 60 to 90 casualties every month, according
to UN statistics.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG,August 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will hold talks with visiting Sudanese President
Omar Al Bashir in Pretoria tomorrow, the presidential spokesman
Parks Mankahlana announced today.
</P>
<P>
But Mandela will not mediating in Sudan's 14-year civil war,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela met John Garang, the leader of the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army in December last year and had been set
to hold talks with Bashir earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's hectic schedule, which included a visit to Asia,
however, resulted in the postponement of the meeting, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a continuation of the discussions on the
situation in Sudan, he said, adding it would be premature to
suggest that Mandela would mediate.
</P>
<P>
Mandela would be guided by the Organisation
of African Unity and the United Nations on the matter, he added.

<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
all started lower today and ended mixed after regaining some
ground, mainly depressed by Wall Street's unsteady beginning.
</P>
<P>
British shares made a dramatic recovery to end above the key
5,000-point level although trading volume was thin, with the FTSE
100 index at 5,031.9, up only 0.6 point.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the market fell by more than 1 percent in the
wake of Wall Street's slide Friday and today's unsteady start.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German stocks also opened with big losses today,
but later recovered some ground, with the DAX-30 index closing at
4,333.13, down 21.02 points.
</P>
<P>
The market fell in sympathy with a sharp decline in New York
although bonds were firm, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris ended 12.83 points down at 2,983.44,

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua)-- Trade ministers of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) will meet in
Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam later this week to discuss a
proposed protocal on a free trade area.
</P>
<P>
SADC's Executive Seeretary Kaire Mbuende said today in
Windhock that the meeting will focus on tariff reduction on
goods traded within the 12-member regional organisation.

<P>
Local media quoted the SADC chief as saying that once the
agreement is implemented, goods produced in a member state
will move freely into others without tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations from the trade ministers' meeting will first
be discussed by a SADC council of ministers before submission

<HEADLINE> EU to Send Anti-Terrorism Expert to Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- In an attempt to assert its
role in the peace process, the European Union (EU) will send an
expert to help the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) fight
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with PNA President Yasser Arafat in
Ramallah, West Bank this morning, EU special envoy to the Middle
East Miguel Moratinos, raised the proposal, according to a report
of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos told reporters after the meeting that "the EU is
offering the PNA a special coordination, a special assistance for
fighting terror."
</P>
<P>
He said that a Swedish expert will be coming and assist the
Palestinians in order to get rid of violence and terrorism in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos made the overture while U.S. Middle East peace
coordinator Dennis Ross was trying hard to push the Israelis and
Palestinians to restore peace talks by pressuring the PNA to
accept security cooperation as a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians demanded that any resumption of peace
talks involve discussions on other major outstanding issues,
especially the Israeli policy of settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
When asked by reporters about the EU proposal, Arafat's
advisor Nabil Abu Redeineh suggested that they should "ask
Moratinos what is meant by sending an expert."
</P>
<P>
"We are not in need for anything," he said. "We are
fulfilling our duties and committed to them and we demand the
other party's commitment."
</P>
<P>
Later in Jerusalem, Moratinos met with Ross, who briefed him
on his discussions with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in his
shuttle diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Criticized for Cattle Rustling in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today said that the cattle rustling in northwestern Kenya
seemed to have foreign elements aimed at destabilizing the
country, the Kenya News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The president told a mass rally at Maralal stadium in Samburu
District in northern Kenya that the rustling had taken a
different dimension from the traditional one.
</P>
<P>
The cattle rustlers are now using sophisticated firearms which
are not normally available to traditional cattle rustlers, Moi
said.
</P>
<P>
He assured local people that the government will use all the
machinery available to ensure that rustling is completely wiped
out in the area.
</P>
<P>
Moi once again condemned the killing of two police officers
during last Friday's strike organized by opposition parties to
press for constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the government would intensify its efforts in
tracking down those who were involved in the incident which has
been condemned by leaders from the ruling and opposition parties
and religious bodies in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the recent events in the
country clearly demonstrated that the opposition parties were not
genuine in their demands for constitutional reforms but were only
interested in creating chaos.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Minister on Military Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev today said the effectiveness, cost and enforceability of
proposed measures and the ability to reach the highest level of
military security in Russia are the main criteria of military
reform.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Itar-Tass news agency reaching
here from Khabarovsk, Sergeyev, speaking before the officers and
command of the Far Eastern military district today, outlined the
concept of army development and military reform in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that the concept consists of "seven
interconnected parts."
</P>
<P>
The first part addresses Russia's military security, the
minister said. A strategic forecast indicates that "a direct
military threat to Russia is not probable in the immediate future
until 2005, while the state of strategic nuclear forces, provided
their combat readiness is maintained at the required level, is
sufficient to respond to the threats which may arise."
</P>
<P>
This period, Sergeyev said, should be used to carry out
military reform to make the country's armed forces efficient,
mobile, well equipped and supported and affordable for the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The second and third parts determine the optimum level of
defense spending by considering economic, demographic and other
resources, as well as combat parameters of the armed forces with a
military budget of 3.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that at the first stage of reform (up to
2000), "we will have to work in conditions of limited financing
and will have to look for ways to economize."
</P>
<P>
In 1997 and subsequent years, the army will be reduced to 1.2
million, but its combat readiness should remain unaffected,
Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
At the second stage of reform (until 2005), the armed forces
will be reorganized to leave only three fighting services covering
operations on the land, in the air and at sea.
</P>
<P>
He also outlined measures to improve the system of management,
and reorganize the structure of technical support, military
training, and social welfare support for the military.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that Russia has entered the stage of practical
implementation of endorsed measures for the military reform.

<HEADLINE> Guinean, S. Leonean Leaders to Meet on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) --The Sierra Leonean military leader
is expected to meet the Guinean president soon on the resumption
of the failed Abidjan talks between the Sierra Leonean junta and
west African countries, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Saidu Momoh, former Sierra Leonean president overthrown
in a coup five years ago, said the Sierran Leonean military
government had received an invitation from Guinean President
Lansana Conte for the meeting expected to take place within this
week.
</P>
<P>
Momoh was called back from exile by ousted President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah to help restart the peace talks which collapsed at
the end of last month in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, after the junta
leader Johnny Koroma said he would stay in power until 2001.
</P>
<P>
A British Broadcasting Company report today quoted Momoh as
saying that he had met both Conte and Koroma who are interested
to resolve the present impasse in Sierra Leone through talks.
</P>
<P>
Momoh said that President Conte had told him that he would
like to meet Koroma anywhere at any time. No matter president
Conte will go to Freetown or not, "I'm sure Koroma should be
prepared to go to the meeting", he added.
</P>
<P>
After Koroma's announcement in which he said he would stay in
power unitil 2001, the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) has tightened blockade of Sierra Leone in a bid to
remove the junta from power.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS has vowed to restore Kabbah's government through three
measures, namely, negotiations, sanctions and the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Momoh said he was totally opposed to military actions to
resolve the crisis in Sierra Leone, which would lead to
destruction rather than other results.
</P>
<P>
The former president, who has been accused of having a hand in
the May 25 coup that toppled Kabbah's government, said he hoped a
negotiated settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
It is still early to know what effect this meeting would
produce, but observers are expecting improvement in the political
situation in Sierra Leone in the next couple of weeks.

KUWAIT CITY, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Interior Minister

lingering issues, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Before ending his three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, the minister

"constructive" and all the remaining details regarding border
demarcation would be sorted out in the coming few days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Arab, who arrived in Saudi red sea coast city of Jeddah
Saturday, conveyed a letter from Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on border demarcation between

Crisis when they were driven back home for Yemen's support to
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Police forces from South
Africa and Mozambique have found and destroyed thousands of guns
and millions of rounds of ammunition in Mozambique in a joint
military operation, sources reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Rag Crewe, spokesman for the South Africa Police Service
(SAPS), said in a statement earlier that during the joint operation,
dubbed "Rachel 111" between July 21 and the end of the last week,
police discovered more than 5500 machine guns, sub machine guns
and automatic rifles.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 1177 were AK47 rifles and 78 were pistols,
sources close to the war game said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that firearms and other weapons were being
smuggled into South Africa from Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
These firearms were being used in the on-going taxi violence,
armed robberies, vehicle hijackings and other crimes, Crewe said,
that the arms caches in Mozambique had to be destroyed to curb
crimes in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Also found were 518 anti-personnel mines, four landmines, 336
grenades, 153 detonators, more than 3726 mortar bombs, 76 rocket
and mortar launchers, 2340 projectiles, 13 cannons and about three
million rounds of ammunition of various calibres and four
magazines.
</P>
<P>
Crewe said SAPS members involved in the operation were drawn
from various divisions, including the bomb disposal and research
unit, the special task force, the internal security unit, the
firearm unit and the national detective service.
</P>
<P>
"This (war game) should have a positive impact on the flow of
illegal weapons across our border," Crewe said. "Similar types of
operations will be conducted in future and may even be broadered,"
he added.

GENEVA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese human rights expert
said here today the realization of the right to development is the
only way to ensure the basic needs of most people in the world.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Shukong, an alternate member of the Sub-Commission on
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, made
the remarks at the 49th session of the organization which is under
the United Nations Human Rights Committee.
</P>

Zhong warned that there exists great inequities between
developed and developing countries. Poverty and backwardness left
over by history remain serious constraints to the socio-economic
development efforts of 78 percent of the world's people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports submitted to the session held on August 4-29 show that
the worldwide population of the poor increased to 1.5 billion in
1996. Ninety percent of them were in the developing countries,
with "an income of less than one dollar per capita per day."
</P>
<P>
Zhong accused some wealthy countries of turning a blind eye to
the miserable life of the poor populations in the world, while
criticizing their human rights conditions.
</P>

He urged the developed countries to help the developing ones
with their socio-economic development, so as to erase imbalances

<HEADLINE> New Housing Price Index Up in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The new housing price index in
Canada increased by 1.0 percent in June compared with the same
period a year earlier, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
June is the fourth consecutive month for which the index has
registered an annual increase, after 31 consecutive decreases
since July 1994.
</P>
<P>
The index increased 0.1 percent from May to June 1997, the
federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
"The general improvement in housing markets in recent months
has been attributable to higher consumer confidence and favorable
interest rates," the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the competitive nature of housing markets has moderated
price increases or caused decreases in some of the cities
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for future housing construction seems
encouraging," it added.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction intentions were up 22.0 percent for the
first six months of 1997 compared with 1996. In the meantime,
housing starts were up 26.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Real Estate Association reported that this year's
first-half resale transactions were up 17.9 percent from the same
period last year.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation at 2-Year High in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The headline annual rate of
inflation in Britain leapt to a near two-year high of 3.3 percent
in July from 2.9 percent in June, showed official figures today.
</P>
<P>
July's rise in the headline inflation rate was largely due to
rises in housing and motoring costs, the Office of National
Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed the cost of driving to have risen by 1
percent over the month, and housing inflation to have climbed 1.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The ONS also pointed to an upward pressure from seasonal food
prices. Heavy rain in June had led to a shortage of some fruit
crops, which had fed through to price rises, it added.
</P>
<P>
The office said the underlying rate of inflation, which
excludes volatile mortgage payments, jumped too. It reached 3.0
percent in July from 2.7 percent in June, well above the
government's 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, a jump in the annual rate of inflation is not likely
to lead to another rise in interest rates, analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
Simon Briscos, of Nikko Europe, said the influence of the data
on rate decision should be limited.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Bank of England said current levels of base
rates were "consistent" with the inflation target.
</P>
<P>
Roger Bootle, of HSBC, said the underlying picture showed that
inflation had hardly moved at all.

been reported to the KSA.
</P>
<P>
The nation's five major shipbuilders -- Hyundai, Daewoo, Halla,
Samsung and Hanjin -- won total orders of 1.24 million GTs for 23
vessels in July alone.
</P>
<P>
The sources predicted that South Korea would likely overtake
Japan, as it did in 1993, as the world's number one shipbuilder in
terms of new orders this year.

<HEADLINE> OAU Envoy: Separatism in Comoros "Totally Unacceptable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The special envoy of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) for the Comoros, Pierre Yere,
today told the separatists on the Comoran island of Anjouan that
it is "totally unacceptable" for them to destroy the Indian Ocean
nation.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Yere as saying that the
OAU is ready to help find a solution to the crisis in the Comoros
but not in an "insurrectional atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
A group of separatists in Anjouan last week declared their
island "independent" and asked for the return of French rule, and
the neighboring island of Moheli followed suit.
</P>
<P>
Yere, who is ambassador of Cote d'Ivoire to Ethiopia, told the
"president" of Anjouan, Aballah Ibrahim, that it is too late to
"go back in the course of history" and "return to the French
colonial period."
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the right to choose chaos and the destruction of
this country. Secession is unrealistic and totally unacceptable,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Federal Republic of Comoros consists of the Great
Comoro island, Anjouan and Moheli. The fourth island of the
archipelago, Mayotte, has been under French rule since the
independence of the Comoros in 1975.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Mayotte deputy from Mayotte of the
French National Assembly, Henri Jean-Baptiste, today asked France
to take "an initiative" supporting talks among different parties
of the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
France has condemned the separatism of Anjouan and called on
the Comorans to find a solution to their country's crisis through
talks.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Lodges Protest to U.N. over Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has formally lodged
protest to the United Nations against an agreement on partial
integration between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot regime in
Cyprus, Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The association agreement, which was signed last week during a
visit to the Turkish-controlled northern part of Cyprus by
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, calls for "gradual economic
and financial integration and partial integration on security,
defense and foreign policy matters."
</P>
<P>
It came following a recent European Union (EU) reconfirmation
that accession talks with Cyprus will begin next year.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Cyprus'
Permanent Representative to the U.N. Nicos Agathocleous stressed
that this provocative action took place only five days before
the commencement of the second round of inter-communal talks on
Cyprus under U.N. auspices in Switzerland, which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement constitutes "a policy of blackmail" and
"undermines the on-going efforts of the international community
to reach a solution to the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Agathocleous noted that "these illegal and condemnable actions
by Turkey, which are aimed at institutionalizing and
consolidating the de facto partition of Cyprus - enforced by the
Turkish occupation forces - and the integration of the occupied
areas into Turkey, are in contravention of the provisions of the
U.N. Charter and relevant U.N. resolutions and decisions on
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot ambassador also pointed out that the timing and
the manner of the Turkish move demonstrate Turkey's lack of
political will for a settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the Cypriot government's intention to take part
in the peace talks with good faith, political will and
determination to achieve a solution.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over
the northern third in the wake of a short-lived Greek Cypriot
coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> German Linked to Versace Murder Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The fugitive German owner of a
Miami beach houseboat used by the suspected murderer of fashion
guru Gianni Versace has been arrested in Germany on charges of
fraud and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
Leipzig based prosecutor Norbert Roeger confirmed today that
Torsten Reineck, 49, wanted in Germany since 1993, was arrested
when he arrived at the Frankfurt Airport on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Reineck's arrest had no connection with
Versace killing, but rather resulted from charges involving up to
111,000 U.S. dollars of fraud.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier German press reports, Reineck moved from
Hamburg to Leipzig after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and
opened a gambling house there. He also bought into the Leipzig
brewery "Leo-Braeu" which later went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the fraud charge, Reineck was also under
investigation for evasion of nearly 280,000 dollars in taxes, the
German Bild newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The suspected killer of Versace, Andrew Cunanan, shot himself
to death on Reineck's houseboat on July 24, putting an end a
three-month-long manhunt in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was reported to
have also ruled out Reineck's connection with Versace's slaying
after questioning Reineck following Cunanan's death.

<HEADLINE> Reviving China's Largest City With Deng's Theory (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In accordance with Deng's strategic decision, Jiang Zemin, in
his report at the 14th CPC National Congress, said that Shanghai
should become one of the international economic, financial and
trade centers and play a leading role in the economic growth of
regions along the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
This affirms the strategic importance of Shanghai in China's
reforms and opening up drive, and has meant momentous changes. The
city has since given priority to developing urban infrastructure,
tertiary industry, and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
It has also placed much emphasis on developing the financial
sector. In the past five years, its financial sector has achieved
extraordinarily rapid growth, and it now has a financial system
consisting of specialized banks, commercial banks, foreign-funded
banks, local banks, cooperative banks, trust companies and
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
At present, 210 foreign-funded financial institutions are
operating in Shanghai, which have provided powerful financial
support for construction and development.
</P>
<P>
As early as the 1980s, Jiang Zemin, who was then working in
Shanghai, organized several major discussions on emancipating the
minds of Shanghai people to encourage them to get rid of any
restraints.
</P>
<P>
In his last visit to Shanghai in 1994, Deng told senior
municipal leaders: "You must seize the last few years of the 20th
century. This is Shanghai's last opportunity."

<P>
The people of Shanghai regard the opening up and development of
the Pudong area east of the Huangpu River as the most significant
opportunity of the 1990s. The area has completed its ten major
infrastructure projects two years ahead of schedule, while the
economy has maintained a growth rate twice that of the Puxi,
a development area to the west of the Huangpu.
</P>
<P>
One of Shanghai's development strategy is to make full use of
resources and capital from both domestic and international sources
and explore both the domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1996, the amount of foreign investment in Shanghai
exceeded 10 billion US dollars worth, while the city's exports
kept growing faster than the GNP.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has also led the country in reforming state-owned
enterprises and introducing a modern enterprise system, which are
regarded as the primary task of establishing a socialist market
economy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Stresses on Humanitarian Aid to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- European Humanitarian
Commissioner Emma Bonino today described the correct and full
implementation of the oil-for-food program as being in the
interests of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
On returning from her trip to Iraq, Bonino told reporters that
the distribution of food and medicine was not satisfactory in
northern Iraq compared with that in the central and southern parts
of the country, though situation in the north where most of the
Kurds lived was favorable.
</P>
<P>
"Imagine how dramatic a change international donations can make
toward the day-by-day life of the Iraqi people," she said. She
cited the 214.9 million ECU European Union's (EU) humanitarian
office had contributed to Iraq since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with a population of 21 million, has so far received
humanitarian assistance amounting to 4.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the commissioner blamed uneven distribution in Iraq for
hampering the implementation of the humanitarian aid program.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council approved the 986 Resolution
in February 1996 and the oil-for-food program started to be
implemented in February this year.
</P>
<P>
"The distribution of food goes on pretty well, but the
distribution of medicine is completely another matter," said the
commissioner who found a shortage of medicine in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bonino said the aid program for the next six months had to be
well targeted.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner made the trip after the United Nations
approved a new contract for Iraq to export, over the next six
months, 2.3 billion dollars worth of oil in exchange for food,
medicine and drinking water as well as other humanitarian
materials.
</P>
<P>
She said that during their meeting in Baghdad, Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz appealed to EU countries to help have
the U.N.-imposed embargo lifted. The embargo was imposed
following Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner quoted Aziz as saying that the embargo only
benefits Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. will lift the embargo only after Iraq eliminates its
weaponry of mass destruction.

<P>
TOKYO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Most of the Japanese firms
surveyed by a influential newspaper say they believe the country's
economy is gradually recovering.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five of the 100 big manufacturers surveyed by Yomiuri
Shimbun said they believed economy was slowly improving, and only
39 manufacturers said economy remained the same.
</P>
<P>
Most of the firms attributed the improvement to a weaker yen,
bigger exports and continued low interest rates. Japanese interest
rates have been at record low for more than a year to promote
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one of the firms surveyed predicted their income and net
profits this year would increase sharply over those of last year.
</P>
<P>
The government declared in February 1996 that the nation's
economy had finally come out of the slump that followed the

<HEADLINE> Anti-Israeli Protest Continues in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Palestinians
marched in the West Bank city of Nablus today to protest against
Israeli punitive measures against the Palestinians taken after the
suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem on July 30.
</P>
<P>
During the march, organized by national and Islamic
organizations, the protesters carrying Palestinian and Arab flags
and chanting anti-Israeli slogans, proceeded from the city center
to the Nablus Govererorate, according to a report of JMCC, an
East Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service.
</P>
<P>
The angry demonstrators also burned effigies of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross. They also called for national unity.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were reportedly exasperated by what they
called Ross's pro-Israeli attitude in his current shuttle
diplomacy between Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ross made it clear that his current mission was aimed at
keeping the focus of his talks with both sides on the need
for effective security measures against terrorist attacks, while
seeking to foster "an atmosphere of partnership" between Israeli
and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, thousands of Palestinian protesters marched down
Gaza's main street and in the West Bank city of Ramallah,
thousands more demonstrated as some headed toward the Israeli
military checkpoint before being stopped by Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
The protesters in Gaza demanded Israel free prisoners and the
11-day total closure imposed since the double suicide bombing in
Jerusalem on July 30, in which 15 people were killed and 170
others wounded. They also expressed their strong support in their
slogans for Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah, some demonstrators burned the Israeli flags
during their procession.
</P>
<P>
Israel banned Palestinians or commerce from entering Israel
after the bombing in Jerusalem. A ban on travel between some
Palestinian towns in the West Bank is still in force and Israel
has refused to pass on 70 million U.S. dollars in tax revenues to
the Palestinians.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The investment prospects in
Indonesia are encouraging in the years to come, notably during the
second long-term development drive (1994-2019), a senior official
said today.
</P>
<P>
"The political, social and economic stability, as well as the
abundant natural resources in the country will support the
investment prospects," Minister for Investment Sanyoto
Sastrowardoyo said at a discussion with entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
He said the factors which would bolster the prospects are big
market in Indonesia, increasing buying power, competitive labor
wages, conducive business climate and strategic location of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector including chemical, pharmaceutical,
metal, electronic industries as well as electric devices and
agricultural products will also attract investors, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government approved domestic investors to make
2,632 projects with a total investment of 282.5 trillion rupiah

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Sell More Public Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
identified 219 public enterprises to be sold to private owners,
among which 82 enterprises would be put on sale during the current
fiscal year starting from July, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambitious program, the buyers would be free to
request the Privatization Board (PB) to float tenders for the sale
of any unit they select from this list.
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal 1996-97, the government only finalized the
sale of 17 enterprises out of a list of 61 which were put on sale
and in the last four years only 12 state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
have been privatized.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the PB, however, said that opposition by labor
unions, local political influences and vested interests of the
bureaucrats were the main problems in the way of the privatization
of the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
"The organized laborers have wrong notions about privatization
and fear loss of jobs. Much of their demands are impossible to
meet and those are intended to agitate laborers in the specific
enterprises," said Kazi Zafarullah, chairman of the PB.
</P>
<P>
"The bureaucrats are also an obstacle because they lose many
facilities if enterprises are privatized. Therefore,
over-valuation of enterprises is deliberately done to discourage
privatization," Zafarullah said.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the privatization process, the PB is expected to
be reorganized soon with the inclusion of six members of
parliament, both from Treasury and opposition bench, and
representatives from different trades and professional bodies,
said official sources.
</P>
<P>
Another move has also been taken to allow the PB to make a
final decision on the sale of enterprises worth up to 100 million
taka (about 2.2 million U.S. dollars), the sources added.

<P>
NAIROBI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police have arrested 30
suspects in connection with the killing of two police officers
during last Friday's strike called by opposition parties, the
"Kenya Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday part of the crowd attending the pro-reforms rally
at Central Park in Nairobi lynched Special Branch Constable
Gilbert Simiyu.
</P>
<P>
The second policeman was driving to his Wangige home when a
rowdy crowd hit his car with stones and was killed when his car
landed in a ditch where the killers followed him with more
stones.
</P>
<P>
Police sources at Kikuyu town, about 20 kilometers southwest
of Nairobi, told the paper that the suspects were helping police
with investigations over the stoning murder of Police Inspector
Francis Ngugi.
</P>
<P>
The "Daily Nation" today reported that four people from the
opposition National Development Party (NDP) were arrested Monday
over the killing of the policeman in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday night, police arrested a personal aide of NDP
leader Raila Odinga, Tom Adinda, who is still in custody.
</P>

Kenyan Police Commissioner Duncan Wachira last week ordered a
nationwide crackdown on all forms of lawlessness and launched a
major manhunt for the killers of two police officers.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Accuses Gov't of Selling out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) Khaleda Zia today accused the
government of selling out the country's sovereignty to its
neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
"When we speak about sell-out of our country, the government
says that a country is not a salable commodity like potatoes and
carrots. True, the land mass of our country is not being
transferred elsewhere, but its sovereignty is being compromised,"
said Khaleda.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Khaleda claimed that the
government is selling out the country in such areas as economy,
foreign relations and defense. "Finally the country's cultural
identity is being submerged with an alien culture."
</P>
<P>
She said India is still sheltering Bangladesh's insurgents and
has been engaged in an environmental aggression by denying
Bangladesh's rightful share of Ganges water and of other common
rivers.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling Awami (people's) League (AL) hurriedly signed a
Ganges water-sharing treaty that turned out to be a hoax. In the
first dry season after the inking of the treaty, Bangladesh got an
all-time low quantum of water," said the opposition leader, who
lost the general election in June last year.
</P>
<P>
The former Prime Minister also denied the AL's allegations that
her party did not raise such contentious issues with India while
in power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition leader said her party would like to
expand economic and ecological cooperation with India for common
good.
</P>
<P>
"But that cannot be one-way traffic. We want a dialogue with
India on all the contentious issues and a settlement on honorable
and equitable terms," said Khaleda.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour press conference, Khaleda claimed that
about 200 of her party's workers were killed during the past year
while thousands of opposition activists were languishing in prison
without trial or on false charges.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy is in ruins and foreign investors were
also being scared away, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, we call upon the ruling party to come
out an a clean slate and to refrain from ruination of the national
economy. Or else we shall be forced to move for change of
government through democratic process," the opposition leader
added.

<HEADLINE> Estonia Threatens Water Supply to Russian Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Estonia warned the Russian town
of Ivangorod on Monday that it would cut the town's water supply
if it did not settle a debt to the Estonian suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass news agency reported today from Tallinn, capital of
Estonia, that the warning was made by the leadership of the Narva
canal, which is within Estonia.
</P>
<P>
The Estonian suppliers required that the Ivangorod authorities
submit a schedule for the repayment of the three-month-old debt of
seven million crowns (about 473,000 U.S. dollars) to them by the
end of this week.
</P>
<P>
Ivangorod is in the Leningrad region and separated by a river
from Estonia's Narva. During the Soviet era, these two towns
shared a single infrastructure, including the water supply and
sewerage systems.
</P>
<P>
All water-intake facilities remained on the Estonian side after
the collapse of the USSR, and Ivangorod had to import drinking
water from sovereign Estonia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that at the beginning of the year, Narva had
already cut water to Ivangorod by half, and threatened to cut it
altogether.
</P>
<P>
The situation was moderated by the Estonian government, which
allocated 3.3 million Estonian crowns (about 230,000 U.S. dollars)
to pay its neighbor's debt.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation to Fall to 6 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate is
expected to fall to six percent this year after the implementation
of the new tight money policy in an effort to control sharp
fluctuation in the money market, an Indonesian official said
today.
</P>
<P>
"This year's inflation rate is expected to drop to six percent
from 6.47 percent in 1996 with the low inflation rate in the first
half of this year," chief of the Central Bureau of Statistics,
Sugito Suwito, told a seminar on human resources development.
</P>
<P>
Sugito said that a tight money policy will usually force down
inflation as there is less money in the market.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the government issued a similar policy which helped
bring down the inflation rate to below five percent.
</P>
<P>
This year's drought, on the other hand, has the potential to
fuel the country's inflation, while the impact of rupiah
(Indonesian currency) depreciation is not seen yet.
</P>
<P>
While the tight money policy would not have a negative impact
on inflation, Sugito admitted that it would affect the country's
economic growth which was expected to drop.
</P>
<P>
He declined to predict the economic growth figure, saying only
that it would depend on how long the new policy would be in force.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic growth last year was 7.82 percent.

<HEADLINE> Reviving China's Largest City With Deng's Theory (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Since 1992, Shanghai, China's
largest city, has seen the most incredible development in its
history.
</P>
<P>
In the five years since the 14th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), the city's gross domestic product
(GDP) has seen average annual growth of more than 14 percent,
double the rate for the previous five years. Per capita GNP also
surged to over 3,000 US dollars from about 1,000 US dollars five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
With new bridges over the Huangpu River, skyscrapers towering
aloft, and massive infrastructure construction underway
everywhere, Shanghai is said to be, in the words of United Nations
officials, "one of the world's most vibrant cities".
</P>
<P>
The city attributes the tremendous changes to the theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics put forward by Deng
Xiaoping, late Chinese leader who passed away in February of this
year, as well as to the leadership of the CPC Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
Following the decision in the 1980s to open a number of coastal
cities and special economic zones to the outside world, Deng began
to focus his attention on Shanghai in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting Shanghai's development is a significant step," he
was quoted as saying, and "Shanghai is our trump card, and it will
become easier for us to develop China if we first develop
Shanghai."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the center of the global economy was
shifting toward the Asia-Pacific region, and that Shanghai in the
past had been the most cosmopolitan city in east Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We must use Shanghai as a base to promote the development of
the whole Yangtze River Delta and other regions along the
Yangtze," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Weaker banking shares pushed
the Australian share market to close on a lower note today.
</P>
<P>
"The banks most definitely have driven the recent fall," Scott
Foster and Partners senior adviser Julian Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index was down 16.7 points at 2650.5,
building on Monday's 1.6 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
Gregory said that investors were taking profits in banks amid
fears that Wall Street could fall again after it dropped sharply
Friday and Monday before bargain hunters moved in.
</P>
<P>
The banks index today was 75.9 points lower at 5020.7, with the
Commonwealth diving 28 cents, ANZ Bank down 23 cents, National
Australia Bank falling 19 cents and Westpac Bank slipping 15 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index was 34.5 points lower at 4266.5 and
the all resources index was 1.8 points softer at 1390.3.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere among industrial shares, soft drink giant Coco Cola
Amatil dipped 35 cents building on a recent downward trend sparked
by concerns over the group's European operations.
</P>
<P>
The gold index lifted 13.1 points to 1302.0 while the precious
metal closed at 327.70 U.S. dollars an ounce, up from 326.25
previously.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 306.9 million shares worth 853.45
million Australian dollars (631.55 million U.S. dollars) with
falls of 599 beating rises of 468.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Finishes Firm Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
firmer today against the U.S. currency as the financial markets
cautiously awaited the words of Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)
Governor Ian Macfarlane.
</P>
<P>
The governor is to address a dinner party of the Australian
Institute of Company Directors in Perth tonight.
</P>
<P>
Westpac Banking Corp economist Katharine Hole said the speech
would be of interest as Macfarlane had made few public comments
recently.
</P>
<P>
"Of particular note will be whether the governor makes comments
aimed at encouraging or discouraging expectations for further
easing," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished firmer at 73.88 U.S. cents up
from yesterday's 73.68 cents close, but well below its day high of
74.08.
</P>
<P>
The currency began modestly higher this morning, after being
bought up to just below 74.00 cents offshore overnight on the back
of options plays by market participants.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar ended at 85.80 from
84.84 against yen and at 1.3815 from 1.3639 against marks.

<HEADLINE> China to Send More Students Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,420 people will have a
chance to go abroad to study at state expense next year, 1,000
more than this year, sources from China's State Education
Commission (SEC) say.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 23 percent will do research as senior visiting
scholars, while the others will study engineering, science, arts,
and medicine, said an official from the National Scholarship
Council for International Studies (NSCIS).
</P>
<P>
NSCIS, which handles applications for international studies on
behalf of the SEC, received a total of 40,000 applications for
next year's study at state expense.
</P>
<P>
China is using a new method of sending people abroad to study
this year, the official noted. Applications for study abroad are
reviewed by a group of experts from NSCIS, and the applicant must
sign a contract with NSCIS, he explained.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the person must pay an amount, not
to exceed 50,000 yuan (about 6,000 US dollars), in earnest money
to NSCIS, who will deposit the money in a designated bank.
</P>
<P>
The deposit and the interest will then be refunded to the
person if he or she returns within the specified amount of time
and does some service to the country. If not, the person will have
to pay the government for the study and will be fined for breaking
the contract.
</P>
<P>
The new method has been successfully tried out in Liaoning and
Hebei provinces, where 90 percent of their students studying
abroad returned on time.

<HEADLINE> Australia To Develop Minerals And Energy Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A surge in mineral and energy
resource development put Australia in a position to take advantage
of commercial and development opportunities in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
delivering the Julius Kruttschnitt Lecture in Brisbane, Federal
Resources and Energy Minister Warwick Parer said that billions of
dollars were being spent on existing and new projects across a
broad spectrum of the minerals and energy industry.
</P>
<P>
"I see a decade of impressive growth for the industries," the
minister was quoted by Australian Associated Press as saying this
evening.
</P>
<P>
The coal industry in New South Wales and Queensland had
committed one billion Australian dollars (about 740 million U.S.
dollars) to new projects, the petroleum industry had nearly two
billion dollars (1.48 billion U.S. dollars) in firm projects and
was looking at further projects valued at 30 billion dollars(22.2
billion U.S. dollars), while the copper and iron and steel
industries were spending more than two billion dollars each.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
has identified 70 other projects in various stages of planning,
which, if they go ahead, will involve more that 52 billion dollars
(38.5 billion U.S. dollars) in capital spending."
</P>
<P>
"We have aluminum smelters in Queensland and New South Wales
being expanded and major alumina capacity being added or
considered," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are major works underway in Western Australia to process
iron ore, including BHP's hot briquetted iron plant, and others in
the pipeline which will see much more value added to our iron
resources."
</P>
<P>
Parer said the government believed Australia had a world
responsibility to develop and supply its mineral and energy
resources efficiently and with as little environmental impact as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"We are stewards of great natural wealth and as such we have a
responsibility to make it available to other nations in a
competitive marketplace and with minimal environmental effect," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Arab States' Oil Income Expected to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Arab states are likely to
earn less from oil exports in 1997 because of expected lower crude
prices, an expert here said today.
</P>
<P>
Ali Akber, an oil marketing manager in Abu Dhabi National Oil
Company (ADNOC), said, "I am not optimistic about reports that the
average oil price in the world could reach 18 U.S. dollars a
barrel this year."
</P>
<P>
"I expect prices to be lower than that level because of
several factors. They include Iraq's return to the market,
slackening demand in the third quarter, and excess output by some
oil producers," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the price of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries' (OPEC) basket of seven crudes has averaged
about 19 dollars, higher than the average recorded in the same
period of 1996 but lower by nearly one dollar than the price for
the whole of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts in ADNOC said they expected prices to range
between 17 and 18 dollars in 1997 as they will likely slip in the
third quarter but pick up in the following three months when
demand recovers in the northern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
At such a price range, the six Gulf Arab countries would earn
between 71 billion dollars and 75 billion dollars compared with a
13-year high of nearly 83 billion in 1996, when the average price
was as strong as 20.5 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Arab states which include the United Arab Emirates,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar produce around 13.5
million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, of which nearly 11.5
million bpd are exported.
</P>
<P>
The output of the six states, four of which are OPEC members,
has remained almost unchanged over the past three years as they
countinued to stick to their shares in fear of a price collapse.

MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today said the government and the National Democratic Front (NDF)
rebels have initialed three out of four substantive issues, paving
the way for a peace agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said this was the latest report he received from the
government's chief negotiator Howard Dee, who was in the
Netherlands holding peace talks with the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The president described the achievement as "a big step" toward
a peace agreement. However, he added that the three issues were
still subject to refinement.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks with the NDF constituted one of the two
remaining problems the government is wrapping up to restore total
peace and stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
The other one was the ongoing negotiations with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, a breakaway group of the mainstream Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
The government signed a peace agreement with the MNLF last
September, putting an end to a 24-year-old civil war in the

<HEADLINE> ASEAN's Principle of Maintaining Consensus Faces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today that maintaining the principle of
consensus would be among ASEAN's major challenges in the future.
</P>
<P>
The test against the principle of consensus would be more
evident as ASEAN countries compete to safeguard their respective
interests especially in the economic field, he said on Malaysia's
TV1 this evening.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the different levels of economic progress among
ASEAN members might also pose problem in decision making.
</P>
<P>
However, he said ASEAN is a pragmatic organization capable of
finding solution to overcome the problem by extending assistance
to member countries concerned, taking into consideration their
development need.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), which
celebrated its 30th anniversary on August 8, now has nine members
-- Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia,
Brunei, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar, with the first five as founding
members.
</P>
<P>
The founding members together with Brunei which joined the
grouping in 1984 are economically strong while the last three,
particularly Laos and Myanmar which came into the ASEAN fold
simultaneously last month, are comparatively poorer.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah expressed the hope that ASEAN will continue to be a
relevant organization in the Southeast Asian region and continue
to progress in all fields and become more influential in the
future.
</P>
<P>
On what would bind ASEAN together in the future, Abdullah said
ASEAN would continue to be united based on the appreciation of the
principle of consensus which would see the grouping fostering
greater cooperation for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
He said one reason why ASEAN would emerge as one of the
successful organizations would be the freedom among member
countries to pursue agenda for their respective progress in spite
of the consensus.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Upbeat About Indo-Pakistan Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral said he was confident the talks between India and
Pakistan would succeed and that the two neighboring countries
would find a way out on the disputed Kashmir issue, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Since my talks with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (in
the Maldives in May), I am optimistic that we will find a way
out," Gujral said in an interview with the BBC to be telecast on
India's Independence Day on August 15.
</P>
<P>
Gujral said India last year supplied 50,000 tons of sugar to
Pakistan, which in turn has offered 30,000 megawatts of surplus
power to India.
</P>
<P>
He said his government has made a turning point in improving
India's relations with its neighbors. "Our relations with our
neighbors --Bangladesh, Nepal and the Maldives-- have moved on and
are qualitatively very different than they were a year ago."
</P>
<P>
With the South Asian region due to become a free trade area by
the year 2001 as decided at a regional summit in the Maldives in
May, the togetherness of the region would be enhanced, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs officers
seized 10.4 kg of suspected cocaine at Kai Tak Airport, an
ever-largest single seizure of the drug this year, a spokesman of
the Customs said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the seized drug from an incoming
passenger, a 40-year-old Brazilian man, is worth about 11.4
million HK dollars (1.47 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 10 p.m. yesterday, the suspect was intercepted
for baggage examination by Airport Customs Officers when he
arrived from Bolivia via Brazil transiting Tokyo. Customs
officers found the suspected cocaine concealed inside two
Electronic Modular Switching Systems inside the suspect's
suitcase.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine is believed to be for consumption in local market,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>

seized a total of 30.1 kg of cocaine. The Customs seized 4.7 kg
of the drug in 1996.
</P>

He said, "Hong Kong Customs will continue to strengthen its
intelligence network and will closely monitor any emerging trend
in combating drug trafficking activities."

<P>
HONG KONG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Better Hong Kong
Foundation today donated one million HK dollars (128,000 U.S.
dollars) to the Police Children's Education Trust and the Police
Education and Welfare Trust.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Eddie Hui accepted the donation on behalf
of the trusts at a check presentation ceremony and said he is glad
that the community is in support of the police force.
</P>
<P>
The donation is a boost to the police's morale, he said.
</P>
<P>
The police force is a key element in maintaining the rule of
law, which is essential to HK's continuing success as an
international trading and financial center, according to the
foundation, which paid tribute to the dedication of Hong Kong's
more than 27,000 police officers.
</P>
<P>
Robert Ng, trustee of the foundation, said that Hong Kong's
streets are among the safest in the world and that the city's
crime rate is low by international standards.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke of the effective role played by the police force
during the handover, in ensuring this historic transition passed
off without incident.
</P>
<P>
The two police trusts provide bursars for secondary and
tertiary education, and special assistance for the disabled and
special needs, for the children of police officers.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the trusts have granted bursars to
the amount of 27.2 million HK dollars (3.5 million U.S. dollars)
to 9,129 children of police officers.
</P>
<P>
The trusts were set up in the 1960s, and every effort has been
made to preserve capital so that the various bursars and other
benefits could be met from interest income.

According to Het Laatste Nieuws newspaper Tuesday, Kluivert,

Kluivert dismissed suggestions he might not be worthy of a

opportunities for those fundamentally opposed to change to
mobilize against it".
</P>
<P>
Total transformation, Maharaj said, means being vigilant
against active counter-revolutionary forces in his country.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past years in government, we have learned that we
should not be blinded by the fact that blacks are for the first
time occupying the highest political offices in the land. The
reality is that colonial relations in some centers of power
remain largely unchanged."
</P>
<P>
On privatization of state assets, Maharaj said the ANC's
vision of an inclusive democracy means it sees the rate and
direction of the privatization being dictated by the needs of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Maharaj also emphasised that the ANC remained in partnership
with the business circle and the labor.

<HEADLINE> SADC States Urged to Explain Low Wages in Textile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Employers and governments
throughout the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has
been urged to explain massive wage discrepancies and conditions
of employment in the region, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made yesterday in Durban by Jacu Ncgobo,
general secretary of the South African Clothing and Textile
Workers' Union (SACTWU).
</P>
<P>
"We believe a lot of money within the clothing and textile
industries, which should be going to the workers, is going to
governments in the form of high taxes," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Ncgobo told the press that the employers and governments in
SADC region did not fully appreciate the implications of a
southern African trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
African governments would no longer be able to sanction low
wage levels and mass dismissals in the wake of strikes, as had
recently been the case in Zimbabwe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SACTWU would stand by its recent decision to keep a
careful eye on labor and social clauses within the emerging
regional protocol, and push its demand that labor be included in
negotiations that would ultimately determine the overall trade
agreement, the union leader said.
</P>
<P>
Ncgobo said despite its concerns, the union was in favor of
the SADC trade bloc, especially now that Zambia demanded a
preferential trade agreement.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Free Local Sugar Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is planning to float
domestic sugar prices next year, six years before the schedule of
2004 asked by World Trade Organization (WTO), a senior Thai
official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Thailand will open its market for sugar imports
while eliminating domestic and export quota system, according to
Pramote Vidtayasuk, secretary-general of the Cane and Sugar Board.
</P>
<P>
The planned liberalization of sugar imports is expected to
benefit local customers if the baht, which has devalued
significantly since July 2, strengthens, Pramote was quoted as
saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The board on Monday froze domestic prices of raw sugar and
refined sugar at 12 baht and 13 baht (0.4 and 0.43 U.S. dollars)
per kilogram respectively until the end of this year. It is using
a cane and sugar fund to sustain local prices at a low level.
</P>
<P>
Thailand produces about 5.8 million tons of sugar a year, more
than half of which is for export. The country currently is one of
the leading sugar exporters in the world.

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Leaves Repurchase Rate Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank decided
today to leave its securities repurchase rate unchanged, ending
market speculations that the rate would be raised to check the
mark's steady decline against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The repurchase rate, applying to short-term liquidity provided
to banks which sell securities and then repurchase them at an
appointed date, has been frozen at 3.0 percent since August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Speculations about a rate hike came on July 24 when the German
central bank, Bundesbank, indicated that it would fix the
repurchase rate for just two weeks and then reassess its policy
according to developments on the markets.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the Bundesbank's latest decision to leave the
rate intact would provide an incentive for the dollar to
strengthen again after suffering slight losses against the mark
late last week.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Farmers Encouraged to Use Biopesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government urged
researchers to actively promote the use of biopesticide and
pesticides produced from plants to compete with chemical
pesticide.
</P>
<P>
"The use of biopesticide for plants has attracted more people
in the world and they tend to avoid chemical pesticide,"
Population and Environment Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said
Monday in Surabaya, east Java, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying: "the most important thing now is to
encourage farmers to leave chemical pesticide so Indonesian
agriculture products will still be attractive in the international
market."
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the use of chemical pesticide in Indonesia has
already reached its saturation point, causing degradation of land
quality and affecting crop production," the minister said at a
two-day national conference (from August 11 to 12) aiming at
encouraging the use of biopesticide.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, the government cannot ban all chemical
pesticides which are accused to be unfriendly to the environment
because the development of biopesticide is still in its premature
stage.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Get World Bank Loan for Energy Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will continue to
provide the 125-million-US-Dollar loan to kenya for the
restructuring of the energy sector, according to a "Daily Nation"
report today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Permanent Secretary of the Energy
Ministry, Crispus Mutitu as saying that the loan had not been
affected by the recent decision of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to suspend aid to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
After a high-level meeting with World Bank officials who were
in the country last week to review progress in the energy sector,
he noted that the government was currently involved in discussion
with the bank on future projects based on the reforms already
undertaken in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Mutitu said that the loan would be used to expand the power
system and upgrade the geothermal resources in the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the energy sector had been the center of
debates in donor circles with some blaming the government for not
putting in place its commitment to privatization in the energy
sector.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Energy Minister Kirugi M'Mukinha was quoted as saying
last week that the Electricity Power Bill (1997) would soon be
tabled in Parliament this month.
</P>
<P>
The Bill, among other things, is expected to set the stage for
the privatization process in the energy sector, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
However, "Daily Nation" quoted the British paper "Financial
Times" as saying Friday that World Bank's support for Kenya could
also be "substantially reduced" unless Nairobi takes substantive
efforts to tackle the issue of corruption.

<HEADLINE> 41 Thai Firms Allowed to Resume Securities Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has agreed
to allow 41 of the 58 suspended finance and securities firms to
resume their securities business, but under strict conditions, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 41 firms can deal with institutional investors and in cash
only, while brokerages and sub-brokerages must post bank
guarantees equal to the amount of money they invested in
securities, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after executives of the 41 firms Monday
met with officials of the central bank, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Stock Exchange of Thailand, who
reiterated their call for the firms to separate their finance
business from securities business.
</P>
<P>
The requirement for bank guarantees is aimed at protecting
investors against risks in the securities business.
</P>
<P>
However, some executives of the firms complained that the term
"institutional investors" are not clear enough and the decision
was not fair for sub-brokerages or brokerages with retail clients.
</P>
<P>
The authorities concerned earlier had repeatedly urged finance
firms to separate their finance business from securities business,
warning them not to use depositors' money to invest in the
securities business. But the warning was widely ignored by finance
firms.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the SEC also agreed that it will waive a rule
requiring a finance firm to hold up to 99.99 percent of its
separated securities firm for six months after the separation, but
insisting that the foreign shareholding ceiling will remain at 49
percent for securities firms.

MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of Filipinos addicted

worth of illegal drugs monthly.
</P>
<P>
Drug-related crimes and other social problems have increased
due to the drastic increase in the number of drug addicts, the PNA

<HEADLINE> Holy Place of Buddhist Sect Found in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A research team has learned that
a well-known Chinese Buddhist leader taught his disciples at the
foot of a mountain in north China's Shanxi Province, resolving the
long and heated dispute over where he preached.
</P>
<P>
The location of the grave of Master Tanluan, the founder of the
Jingtu Denomination of Chinese Buddhism, and the exact site of his
sermons, has been debated by Buddhists throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
After a period of strenuous work, Chinese archaeologists from
the Shanxi Institute of Buddhist Culture finally determined the
precise spot.
</P>
<P>
Master Tanluan, also a famous philosopher, propagated the
Buddhist principles during the Northern and Southern Dynasties of
about 1,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The place where he delivered his teachings is called the Rock
of Luangong and is regarded as holy by his followers. In its
halcyon days it attracted many visitors, but later became
forgotten as limited transportation routes kept sightseers away.
</P>
<P>
The Rock of Luangong is in Mianshan Mountain between Jiexiu and
Lingshi counties in Shanxi Province. The temple and relics in the
hidden cave were destroyed by Japanese invaders during the War of
Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
In 1920, an eminent Japanese monk found the Xuanzhong Temple,
the origin of the Jingtu Buddhist Sect.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Reports Ozone Depletion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Belgian meteorologists reported
a low concentration of ozone for the fifth time this year.
</P>
<P>
The Free Belgium newspaper said today that readings in three of
the country's 22 measuring stations showed ozone concentration at
between 186 micrograms and 217 micrograms per cubic meter of air,
well below the 360 micrograms set as a benchmark for alarms.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, however, quoted meteorologist Alain Derouane as
saying that authorities were publishing ozone readings only as a
piece of information and not as a warning.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has instructed its member states to inform
their populace whenever ozone depletion occurs.
</P>
<P>
The four previous readings of low concentration of ozone this
year were taken last weekend and on June 4 and July 12.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists explained that the frequency of ozone depletion
in the country has been on the decline as against that posted a
couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
As many as 32 below-360 micrograms concentration were reported
in 1995 and 20 registered in 1994. Meteorologists estimated that
1984 had some 30 ozone depletion occurences.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer of the atmosphere absorbs solar ultraviolet
radiation, protecting lives on the earth from harmful solar
radiation of wavelengths less than 290 nanometers.
</P>
<P>
Waste gases like automobile exhausts bear the brunt of blame
and criticism for ozone depletion.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Opposes Total Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea opposes a total ban on
anti-personnel mines, given the security situation on the Korean
peninsula, a ministry official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, however, may agree to a ban on the transfer of
anti-personnel landmines, Yonhap News Agency quoted the official
on anonymity as saying.
</P>
<P>
South Korea joined the 1995 Moratorium banning the transfer of
anti-personnel landmines and stated it will support the extension
of the moratorium, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of total ban of anti-personnel landmines, the
official said his government will persist its reservation, adding
that the U.S. government will also likely not change its position
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
When they met last month in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
U.S. Secretary of State Medeleine Albright and her South Korean
counterpart Yoo Chong-ha agreed that use of the landmines on the
Korean peninsula was inevitable under the special security
situation.
</P>
<P>
The official said that his government will not oppose
discussions on a ban on anti-personnel landmines at the Conference
on Disarmament, however, South Korea will not joint the so-called
Ottawa Process which has been pursuing a total ban on the
production, development, use and transfer of anti-personnel
landmines under no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
In a worst case scenario in which the United States joins the
Ottawa Process, only those landmines planted by the U.S. in
Demilitarized Zones will be affected, according to another
South Korean official.
</P>
<P>
"Realistically speaking, the removal of all landmines already
planted will prove difficult from a view of technical point,
although it is mandated under the agreement to be signed, " he
said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Hold Next Round of Talks with Tribal Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government and
southeastern tribal rebels are expected to held another round of
talks in Dhaka next month, in a bid to reach an agreement for a
durable peace in the troubled Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), said
informed sources.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be the sixth round of dialogue between the two
sides to hammer out a formula for resolving the two decade-old
problem in the three pro-independence hill districts.
</P>
<P>
Chief Whip Abdullah will lead the government side while the
tribal delegation to the talks will be headed by Shantu Larma,
head of the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS),
political wing of the armed Chakma rebels.
</P>
<P>
The last round of talks, also held in Dhaka in July, continued
for five days, but without reaching any final accord.
</P>
<P>
Total repatriation of the Bangladeshi Chakma refugees, now
languishing in camps in the Indian state of Tripura, is one of the
major threats to peace and stability in the three resource-rich
hill districts.
</P>
<P>
The situation worsened following an inconclusive talks a few
days ago between Dhaka and the Chakma tribal refugee leaders in
Tripura.
</P>
<P>
The talks held early this month bogged down after 10 hours of
marathon deliberations as some fresh demands were put forward by
the tribal delegation, said a member of the government delegation.
</P>
<P>
The demands include involvement of international agencies in
the repatriation process, providing financial assistance to all
returnees, including those who returned in 1994, increase of cash
and food ration from nine months to one year and rehabilitation of
all displaced persons in the hill tracts.
</P>
<P>
The government considers all these demands "unwanted and
unfortunate" at the present stage, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, some 6,000 refugees were repatriated
following an agreement was reached between Dhaka and the Chakma
refugees. The second phase of repatriation, however, was halted as
the refugees claimed that the government had not fully complied
with its commitments.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Tops Uganda's Trade List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya maintained Uganda's major
trade partner position last year, supplying Uganda with 34
percent of its imports, reported "The Monitor" daily today.
</P>
<P>
According to provisional statistics just released by the
Ministry of Planning, Uganda imported goods worth 729 million
U.S. Dollars in total in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kenya was followed by Britain, from which Uganda imported
goods worth 103 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although Uganda is steadily industrializing and blocking
imports from its neighbors, it is still dependent on Kenya for
many of its industrial imports.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Mombasa Port is also Uganda's main link to the sea.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Uganda's imports from Tanzania were worth 15.5
million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Business analysts said Uganda's trade with its southern
neighbor Tanzania could be boosted by joint railway and road
projects being undertaken by the two countries, and also by the
strengthening of the East African Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe exported to Uganda goods worth 2.3 million Dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
No other African countries are mentioned in the report.
However, it is believed that imports from South Africa, the
continent's economic giant, were on the rise.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Illiteracy Rate Alarming, UNDP Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) has warned Nigeria of its alarming illiteracy
rate, put at 46 percent of the total population, the Punch paper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Illiteracy remains a very serious problem with Nigeria, the
UNDP said in a recent report on the country, adding that only
about 62.5 percent of its male population and 39.5 percent of the
female population are literate.
</P>
<P>
The organization called for a massive and effective adult
literacy campaign in Nigeria, warning that otherwise the
situation will go beyond reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
It urged the government and the people of Nigeria to pursue
the objective of "education for all" within the next decade with
a single-minded determination.
</P>
<P>
In a country where a universal primary education was
introduced in some regions as early as 1950s and adopted at
national level over 20 years ago, there is no falling back in the
realization of this goal, the UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that in 1994, out of a total population of 45
school-age children, only 50.4 percent were receiving education.

<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians have been urged to make
contribution to the rehabilitation of the country's primary
schools, which requires nearly one billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government alone could not handle or provide the money and
would require communities, parents-teachers associations and
philanthropists to assist, a top official of National Primary
Education Commission said on Monday (NPEC).
</P>
<P>
According to NPEC Executive Secretary Ali Adamu, two thirds
out of 42,000 primary schools in the country require major
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
He said his commission also needs money to buy motor vehicles
for inspection of schools and distribution of teaching materials,
including motorcycles and boats for use in rural and riverine
areas.
</P>
<P>
Other classroom accommodations will also be bought, he said,
adding that furniture worth 170 million Naira (about two million
Dollars) will be purchased this year alone.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China Share Strategic Interests, Carter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmer
Carter has urged the United States to pursue ways to co-exist
peacefully and productively with China for the sake of mutual
strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
In a signed article carried by The New York Times Sunday,
Carter said that China and the United States continue to share
many interests: maintaining peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region, controlling weapons of mass destruction,
resolving the Korean peninsula issue.
</P>
<P>
He warned that ill-informed commentators and the forecast of
inevitable confrontation would put the accomplishments of a
quarter century at risk.
</P>
<P>
Carter echoed James Sasser, U.S. ambassador to China, who
expressed the hope that the planned summit between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton "will
establish a strategic framework."
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by the "Newsweek International" in
its latest issue, Sasser said that the summit "will establish a
strategic framework wherein the United States and China can relate
to each other in the coming years."
</P>
<P>
The former senator cites numerous areas of joint strategic
interest including maintaining peace and security in Asia, dealing
with the proliferation of both nuclear and non-nuclear weapons,
terrorism, international drug trafficking, trade issues and
environmental cooperation.

ZHENGZHOU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- An elderly woman's 30-years of
suffering caused by a huge tumor, weighing 41 kilograms (about 90
pounds), ended recently after the gigantic fluid-filled growth was
removed from her abdominal cavity.
</P>
<P>
62-year-old Li Derong, who lives in the small town of Nanyang,
central China's Henan Province, is recovering from the operation,
but her weight has dropped to 87 pounds, according to surgeons Li
Xin and Cheng Rongyuan with the Nanyang Tumor Hospital, who
performed the surgery.
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, Li felt a growth "as large as a man's fist"
in her body. Though her abdominal area was grossly distended, she
did not go to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at local hospitals refused to treat Li, saying they
lacked the medical know-how for such complex surgery.
</P>
<P>
The two doctors in Nanyang volunteered to perform the
operation.

<P>
CHONGQING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Yanghe Village will be covered
by water by 2009 when China's Three Gorges Project goes into full
operation, and over 50 percent of its villagers have moved to new
homes ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
They want to start a new life as soon as possible, and the
government has paid enough money for compensation and early
relocation.
</P>
<P>
The villagers say that their village head has given them an
attractive idea for early migration: before 2009, they can start
to cultivate new land, while continuing to work on existing
farmland.
</P>
<P>
According to local government officials, each of the resettlers
will receive some 2,000 yuan from the central government to build
a new residence, with a per-capita living space equal to that of
the old home.
</P>
<P>
At present, 78 of the 134 households in the village have moved
to the new place where per-capita living space is 25 sq m, twice
as much as the country's urban residence average.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project is the largest hydro-electric power
program in the world. A total of 36,700 ha. of land, five county
seats, and three cities will be wholly or partly submerged, and
more than a million people are expected to be relocated.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Regional Courts Demand for More Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's regional
courts and magistrates have urged the government to authorize
them more power to enable them to impose heavier sentences for
serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
Les Wilkens, chairman of the Association of Regional courts
and Magistrates of South Africa said on Monday that regional
courts wanted alterations made to the law which only allows them
power to impose sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
"This maximum is clearly insufficient with most of the serious
crimes such as murder, rape, bank robbery and vehicles hijacking
being tried in the regional courts," Wilkens told the Portfolio
Committee on Justice's public hearings on the criminal law
amendment bill.
</P>
<P>
The amended bill proposes that trial courts impose another
sentence to replace the death sentence to amend laws relating to
the death penalty and to provide minimum sentences for certain
serious offenses.
</P>
<P>
Wilkens said his organization was also calling for gender
equalization in cases of indecent assault. He said the same age
that applied for girls in cases of indecent assault should also
apply to boys at present. It is 14 for a boy and 12 for a girl.

<P>
ABU DHABI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Qatar is to issue a law
regulating activities of investment companies in the Gulf state
within weeks, Qatar Central Bank has announced.
</P>
<P>
"We are outlining regulations for investment firms and will be
issuing them within weeks," Khaleej Times today quoted Abdullah
bin Khaled, governor of Qatar Central Bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations, intended to bolster the state's growing

locally incorporated investment companies from the Ministry of
Finance, Economy and Trade to the central bank, the governor
said in an interview with the newspaper on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the new law would set a minimum capital requirement
for locally-registered investment firms, which invest mainly on
international markets, the newspaper said. Further details were

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Up in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output increased by 9.3 percent in June over the same month of
last year, helping alleviate the decline in the previous months,
which led to a cumulative decline of 1.1 percent for the first six
months of this year, the Economic Development Board (EDB) said
today.
</P>
<P>
It said that export orders boosted output of electronics
products and components by 11.8 percent against the figures of
June last year.
</P>
<P>
However, cumulative output of the electronics sector in the
first half of this year was 2.4 percent less than the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Output of the transport equipment increased by 15.2 percent as
both marine and aviation segments recorded increases in June.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative output for the first six months of 1997 gained 1.5
percent over the corresponding period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The output of the chemical industries, including petroleum,
petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and industrial/specialty chemicals
industries, increased by 26.2 percent in June, contributing to the
cumulative output growth of 9.7 percent for the first six months
of 1997 over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemicals industry expanded further as a new cracker
plant came on stream.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the June output increased by 70.9 percent, leading
to the cumulative output increase of 39.1 percent for the first
half of the year, the EDB said.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Criticizes Israeli Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Mideast peace envoy
Dennis Ross has criticized Israeli measures taken against the
Palestinians following last month's suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ross made the criticism after holding a third meeting in
Ramallah Monday night with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
leader Yasser Arafat. He described some Israeli measures as
"counterproductive toward its security and the peace process."
</P>
<P>
This was Ross's first criticism against Israel. It seemed to
be a balance act to console the Palestinian side, which
complained that Ross should not focus his attention only on the
security matters in favor of Israel while neglecting the
suffering of the Palestinian people under Israeli sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Ross reiterated that the objective of
his trip is to help resume the Israeli-Palestinian security
cooperation. He urged Israelis and Palestinians to work as
partners to fight the common threat of militant extremism.
</P>
<P>
He reported some progress in his first two day mediation,
saying that Israel and the PNA had come a step closer to revive
the security cooperation. But he added that the success should
be measured by results.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian intelligence chief Amin Hindi held a second
meeting with Israeli General Security Service head Ami Ayalon
and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attorney Yitzhak
Molcho Monday night following their first meeting Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The two meetings were attended by U.S. officials from
the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Ross held a series of talks with Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Foreign Minister David Levy,
European Union peace envoy Miguel Moratinos and Egypt's
Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny.
</P>
<P>
He was trying to mobilize all the peace forces in a bid to
resume the stalled Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation to
pave the way for resuming the political negotiations. He is
scheduled to hold the third meeting today with Netanyahu to
explore ways of breaking the ice.
</P>
<P>
Following the July 30 twin suicide bombings in Jerusalem's
Mahane Yehuda market which killed 15 people and wounded 170
others, Israel immediately imposed a total closure on
Palestinian territories, canceling the scheduled resumption of
peace talks, and halting transfer of tax revenues it collected
from the Palestinians on the PNA's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Israel conditions the resumption of peace process on the PNA's
promise to launch a long-term crackdown on Islamic militant
organizations, but the PNA insists that Israel should first lift
all its sanctions against the Palestinian people before resuming
bilateral security cooperation.

NAIROBI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Religious leaders have

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Steady Growth Still Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Can the Southeast Asian economy
survive the current currency crisis and maintain its steady growth
this year?
</P>
<P>
Most economists and analysts have given a very positive answer,
despite the currency crisis which hit most Southeast Asian nations
recently.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, triggered by Thailand's decision to let its baht
float on July 2 and speculative attacks, has forced Thailand, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore to devalue their
currencies during the past month.
</P>
<P>
At present, the foreign exchange markets have become relatively
quiet although some currencies, such as the Malaysian ringgit, are
still under pressure.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Malaysian ringgit was languishing at 2.7337 to
2.7347 to the U.S. dollar, the weakest in 42 months. Most foreign
exchange dealers expect further losses.
</P>
<P>
The crisis is not over yet, but Southeast Asia has already seen
interest rates high, price hikes, and new lay-off, which are
affecting the once fast-growing economies in the world.
</P>
<P>
Where are the "tiger economies" heading for in the second half
of the year?
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that the fast-growing cycle is definitely
over, but the growth rate of 4 percent to 6 percent is still
possible for Southeast Asian nations, except Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In the Southeast Asian region, most countries are facing
similar problems with Thailand, such as non-performing loans,
large current account deficit, slower export growth and dependence
on easy foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said that countries like the Philippines,
Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia are unlikely to suffer a
Thai-style financial crisis because their economic fundamentals
remain "solid".
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, which was described as "the next Thailand"
by some economists, the government insisted that the 1997 economic
growth target of 7 percent can be achieved while inflation will
remain at single-digit level of between 6 percent to 6.5 percent
after the de facto devaluation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
The weak peso, which has depreciated from 26.5 pesos to the
U.S. dollar to around 28.5 against the dollar now since July 11,
could make the country's export products more competitive, the
government said.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the year, the Philippines' exports
increased by 22.1 percent and the higher export growth prompted by
the peso devaluation will help the country achieve its objective,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, signs of a drop in exports, slowing investment
inflows and worries that interest rates will remain high have
prompted economists to revise downwards their gross domestic
product (GDP) forecast for this year between 7 percent and 7.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd. is by far the most pessimistic,
forecasting in a recent report that the country's GDP growth will
slow to 6.1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with that of Western countries, such a growth rate is
still very impressive. But the Malaysian economy had grown by over
8 percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic prospects could be even brighter,
according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
Dennis de Tray, director of the World Bank in Indonesia, said:
"We are projecting continued strong economy. We're projecting
exports to expand back to the type of levels of 1995, up to levels
in the 10 percent to 13 percent range. We're projecting a current
account deficit of around 4 billion dollars for the forthcoming
year. We think growth will stay up around 7.75 percent."
</P>
<P>
The size of the domestic market alone will probably ensure that
Indonesia remains attractive to foreign investors, whatever shocks
lie ahead, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the government has revised its 1997 growth target
from 5 percent to 6-7 percent after the country registered a 5.9
percent increase for the economy in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has registered its best export performance since May
1996, raising confidence in the long-awaited rebound in economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's non-oil exports in nominal terms grew 8.8 percent
in June to 5.09 billion dollars compared with a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Rising global demand for electronic goods will drive
Singapore's non-oil exports in nominal terms up 12 percent to 18
percent in the second half of the year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of its export performance, the growth
target is attainable, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the future of the Thai economy is hard to
predict. But as the International Monetary Fund and Asian nations
pledged 16 billion dollars of loans to Thailand Monday in Tokyo,
the Thai economic performance will be much better than expected,
economist said.
</P>
<P>
As the fundamentals for economic growth remain in place in
Southeast Asia nations after currency devaluation, steady increase
for their national economies are still expected.

HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will accelerate

identified for redistribution, President Robert Mugabe has said.
</P>

under the Land Acquisition Act. The program of allocating land
for their resettlement will be an ongoing exercise.
</P>
<P>
When addressing an estimated 15,000 people gathered at the
National Heroes Acre to commemorate Heroes Day, Mugabe said the
government was mindful of the plight of ex-combatants and had
enacted the War Veterans' Act and decided to create the War
Veterans' fund to finance business projects which will
economically empower war veterans in agriculture and
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said there would also be a Rural Development Fund that
would be used specifically for the provision, among other
projects, of rural roads, bore-holes, sanitation facilities,
clinics and small to medium-sized dams in rural districts.
</P>
<P>
This new approach to rural development, he said, would result
in improved infrastructure in the rural areas with a significant
impact on the social lives of the rural people.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, a group of demonstrating ex-combatants
interrupted proceedings to commemorate Heroes Day at the National
Heroes Acre, claiming the government had failed to resolve their
problems.
</P>
<P>
The group of at least 100 men and women sang, shouted slogans
and played drums throughout the ceremony. Their noise rose during
the playing of Zimbabwe's national anthem and during the address
by President Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Master of ceremonies and Minister of Defense Moven Mahachi
described the demonstration as disgraceful, wondering whether the
ex-combatants had genuine cases.

<HEADLINE> Rare Species of Plants at Three Gorges Area Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 rare species of
plants in the Three Gorges area which have been re-planted
elsewhere are thriving, with over half of them now in bloom.
</P>
<P>
There are 3,964 species of seeded plants in the region,
accounting for a seventh of the national total. Some of the plants
will be affected by the damming of the Three Gorges, said Jin
Yixin, research fellow at the Wuhan Botanical Research Institute
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Protection of rare species in the Three Gorges area attracted
worldwide attention immediately after the project was put on the
Chinese government's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1983, CAS organized a group of more than 2,000 experts
to study the project's influence on the ecosystem and to find
solutions to the problems that surfaced. The experts then decided
to move some 40 rare species out of the area.
</P>
<P>
Now, 80 percent of them are growing well in Yichang, Wuhan and
other places, Jin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Kamal
Thapa has said that the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship
between Nepal and India should be reassessed in the changing
context of regional security and new international order, the
daily Rising Nepal reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Letter of Exchange attached with the treaty,
"neither government shall tolerate any threat to the security to
the other by a foreign aggression. To deal with any such threat
the two governments shall consult with each other and devise
effective counter measures."
</P>
<P>
But Nepal was not consulted as per the provisions, Thapa said.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral has also
reiterated that India will not seek any reciprocity with any
neighboring countries in the changed context of world politics, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The 1950 treaty should therefore be reviewed as in the new
context as have reached many agreements like Trade and Transit,
SAPTA (South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement) and Power
trade, " Thapa said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty has come under sharp criticism from all sides in
Nepal in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Critics say some of the treaty's clauses infringe upon Nepal's
sovereignty and fail to reflect the present-day realities as well.
</P>
<P>
While visiting Nepal in early June, I.K. Gujral and his Nepali
counterpart agreed that at the next meeting of the foreign
secretaries to be held in two months, all issues of bilateral
interest including those related to the 1950 treaty would be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Thapa said at the meeting to be held in New Delhi on August 19,
Nepal will put forth its views on the treaty.

A consultative committee of experts coordinated by the Foreign
Ministry has been formed with a view to evolving national

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Picking Up in 2nd Quarter: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Growth momentum of the
Singapore economy picked up significantly in the second quarter
this year with the economy expanding by 7.8 percent on a
year-on-year basis, the Economic Survey of Singapore for the
second quarter, published today, said.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate recorded in the first quarter was only 4.1
percent, the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that except for business services, all sectors
registered faster growth in the second quarter, with manufacturing
showing the most significant pick-up.
</P>
<P>
After three consecutive quarters of decline, the manufacturing
sector expanded by 3.2 percent in the second quarter, largely due
to a strong pick-up in June, as growth was driven by electronics,
transport equipment and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Within the electronics sub-sector, higher export demand boosted
the output of disk drives and telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey found that the output in the consumer
electronics and printed circuit board assembly segments remained
relatively weak due to keen competition.
</P>
<P>
The financial and business services sector grew by 10.6
percent, little changed from a quarter ago, while the transport
and communications sector expanded by 9.5 percent, up from 8
percent recorded in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
A jump in entrepot trade growth to 15 percent in the second
quarter helped propel commerce sector growth to 7.9 percent, up
from 2.8 percent a quarter earlier. The construction industry
reported an 11.8 percent growth in the second quarter, up from the
ten percent in the previous three-month period.
</P>
<P>
The survey noted that the growth was largely supported by
public-sector building and upgrading activities and
infrastructural projects.
</P>
<P>
As for the prospects of economic growth in the second half of
the year, the survey said that domestically, forward-looking
indicators like the Composite Leading Index and business
expectations of the commerce and transport and storage sectors
have turned more favorable.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector is expected to continue to recover in
the second half, while the commerce sector and hub services are
also likely to benefit from the electronics recovery and stronger
trade growth, it said.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Improving Structure of Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of private
businesses in east China's Zhejiang Province decreased by 100,000
during the first half of this year, whereas their total registered
capital went up by 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
This change is attributed to fierce market competition and the
growing presence of large-scale operations. The small-scale
cottage industries have been replaced by stock companies emerging
in the sector.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Ningbo, 17,000 private firms were closed due to
slack business, while others went bankrupt as a result of poor
management. In the second quarter of this year, the province saw a
drop in the number of private businesses.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of larger scale private enterprises is
going up steadily; businesses each with over five million yuan in
registered capital have increased by 12.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has also established more than 30,000 private stock
companies as well as over 100 enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
And the investment structure of the private sector is changing,
with more capital going to agriculture and the service
sector. During the first six months, private businesses in
agriculture registered a total capital of 420 million yuan, up
nearly 50 percent, while those in industry dropped by 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
More private businesses have begun to shift their investment
priority to technology-intensive projects. In Linghai, 36 key
private enterprises spent 26.52 million yuan on technological
improvement projects in the second quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> De Beers Seeks to Set up Full Subsidiary in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- South African diamond mining
and marketing giant De Beers has applied to the Indian government
for permission to set up a 100 percent subsidiary in the country,
a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The move came just a few years after the company was allowed to
set up a 50-50 joint venture with India's reliance industries for
prospecting and mining diamonds in Madhya Pradesh in central
India.
</P>
<P>
De Beers' application clearly indicated that it is not
depending exclusively on the joint venture for its entry into
India.
</P>
<P>
A senior De Beers executive said that "at the moment, we are
not sure what kind of entity, in terms of equity holding, the
government will approve of in diamond prospecting and mining. So
while we have already had a joint venture with an Indian partner,
we are also setting up a 100 percent subsidiary to make sure that
we can participate in the tender process in whatever form the
government decides."
</P>
<P>
"We are keen to take part in the bidding process for
prospecting and mining of diamonds. However we are waiting for the
government to come out with specific norms for the tender
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Madhya Pradesh government has set up a committee to suggest
a diamond prospecting and mining policy.

non-residents and non-resident banks should be allowed to opt for
forward cover in the first phase.
</P>
<P>
The RBI reckons that it is now opportune to implement the first
phase of the plan as the forward cover rates have been weak. The
premia rates are expected to rise once FIIs start covering their
investments in debt instruments.
</P>
<P>
The authorized dealers could provide forward cover to FIIs in
respect of their investments in debt instruments. The extent of
the cover would be limited to the current market value of the
investments in debt instruments translated in U.S. dollar terms.
The tenure of the cover will not exceed the remaining period to
maturity. This suggests that the FIIs would have to have an
underlying investment in debt before booking the cover. On the
basis of this investment, the FIIs would be allowed to book the
forward contract to the extent of the current market value of its
debt investments translated in U.S. dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
The step has been welcomed by FIIs as well as foreign exchange
market players and observers as a positive signal.

WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. police have arrested 89
people and seized tons of cocaine and marijuana and millions of
dollars in recent raids on drug runners from Mexico, police
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's raids, police captured a total of 11.4 tons of
cocaine, 6.4 tons of marijuana and 18.5 million U.S. dollars in
cash. At least 28 people were arrested.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Minister to Visit Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
telephoned his Georgian counterpart today and said he would send
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to Tbilisi to help resolve the
dispute over the breakaway province of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
In the telephone conversation, Georgian leader Eduard
Shevardnadze thanked Yeltsin for his efforts to bring the two
sides together, Georgian presidential press service told the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also called Shevardnadze, telling him that he would be
in the Georgian capital on Thursday, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov will meet with Shevardnadze and other Georgian
officials during the visit. On Saturday, he held talks with the
leader of Abkhazia, Vladislav Ardzinba.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Yeltsin announced plans to bring leaders of
both sides together for negotiations aimed at resolving the
conflict, but no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
At issue is the degree of autonomy both parties will accept.
Separatists in Abkhazia drove out the Georgian army and 300,000
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 1992-93 war and proclaimed
independence. Georgia insists that the Black Sea province must
remain part of Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trained Thai Doctors Granted Privilege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will allow
Thai doctors who obtained their qualifications overseas to
practice in rural areas without applying for a certificate from
the Thai Medical Council, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made recently by the Thai Public Health
Ministry in a bid to ease the shortage of doctors in the country,
especially in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 708 community hospitals around the country face a shortage
of about 2,500 doctors and 21 of these hospitals even do not have
a single doctor stationed there, officials from the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trained Thai doctors may practice in community
hospitals for two years before they apply for a certificate, they
said.
</P>
<P>
This will enable them to familiarize themselves with Thai
medical practices and help them to obtain a Thai certificate, the
officials noted.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports Rise 23.4 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export value posted
140.5 billion baht (4.68 U.S. dollars), up 26.7 billion baht (890
million dollars) or 23.4 percent compared with July last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics by the Thai Customs Department
available today, the figure is also up 16.6 percent over the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
The export jump in July this year was mainly attributed to the
depreciation of the baht, not to the improvement of the quality of
local products or exploration of new markets, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department also said that the country's import
value totaled 159.4 billion baht in July (5.31 billion dollars),
up 5.3 billion baht or 3.5 percent over July 1996 and 5.4 percent
over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's total export value in the first seven months this
year recorded 867.2 billion baht, up 6.5 percent over the same
period of last year, while its import value totaled 1,100 billion
baht, also up 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The items enjoying the highest export values during the period
included electrical appliances and equipment, rubber and products,
seafood, pearls, diamonds, grains, garments and plastic goods.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Commerce Ministry has set an export target of 1.5
trillion baht for this year, up 10 percent over 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Labor Secretary Calls for Talks Between UPS, Teamsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman met with leaders of the United Parcel
Service (UPS) and the Teamsters Union to resume talks as the
strike by 185,000 Teamsters members entered its 8th day today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Herman said that during her separate meetings
with Teamsters and UPS leaders, she discussed in detail what it
would take to get them back to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
"I made it clear that everyone involved must show greater
flexibility and a willingness to compromise," she said.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Herman, Teamsters President Ron Carey
said he asked her to urge the company to bargain on the union's
key issues of full-time jobs, subcontracting and increased wages.
</P>
<P>
UPS' chief negotiator David Murray, emerging from a meeting
with Herman, said, "We still believe the correct solution to this
is for the Teamsters to put our people back to work."
</P>
<P>
UPS, meanwhile, sent a letter to members of Congress, intending
to pressure President Bill Clinton to intervene the strike.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich responded quickly, urging Clinton
to help resolve the dispute. "I urge you to use every effort to
help resolve this dispute as quickly as possible," Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton has been insisting that the inconveniences of the
strike do not imperil the nation's health and safety -- the
standard for government intervention under the 1947 Taft-Hartley
Act.
</P>
<P>
On the labor side, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney called the
Teamsters strike "very effective" and promised financial or any
other kind of assistance the union wishes.
</P>
<P>
The two sides dispute over several issues, but focus on
two: the company's demand to withdraw from the Teamsters'
multi-employer pension plan and the union's call to convert
thousands of part-time jobs into full-time ones.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent of UPS employees work part time, and there
has been no increase in their base wage of eight dollars an
hour since 1982, much lower than the full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
UPS normally handles 12 million parcels and letters daily. The
work stoppage has damaged small businesses operations throughout
the country.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Secures 16 Billion U.S. Dollar Aid from IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has secured at least 16
billion U.S. dollars in a rescue package for its volatile
financial system from the international community led by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to reports reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other Asian economies pledged to fulfill their
commitments to the aid package to help Thailand rebuild its
economy at a meeting initiated by the IMF in Tokyo on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and Japan will lead the way, pledging 4 billion dollars
each, while China's Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia and Singapore
each will lend 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and South Korea also will contribute 500 million
respectively and another 3 billion dollars is expected to come
from the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, China and others.
</P>
<P>
The loan package was the largest extended by the international
community to a single country since the Mexico peso crisis in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Thai newspapers said that Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya,
who attended the meeting, was pleased with the package and the
funds will be used to bolster Thailand's depleted foreign exchange
reserves and calm investors nervous about Thailand's ability to
repay its debts.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the loan package is expected to expand to more
than 20 billion U.S. dollars as Thanong is negotiating further
loans with commercial banks, including some of Japan's largest
ones.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has pledged to take necessary measures to meet the
IMF's requirements, including raising value-added tax, reducing
the size of its financial industry, and tightening the
government's expenditures.

COLOMBO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan troops mounted a
special operation in Trincomalee to foil rebel attempts to recruit
youth from among displaced people in the north, who were awaiting
return to Jaffna Peninsula.

The sources also said they were compelled to take a series of
tough measures following intelligence reports of heavy rebel
activities aimed at recruiting youth from among displaced
families.
</P>

Jaffna Peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil rebels,
who have been fighting a 14-year war for a separate state in the

JAKARTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
pledged to eradicate poverty in the country, which still sees 11
percent of its 200-million population in poverty.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on "the Integrated Guidance Program For Family
Welfare" held in Semarang, Central Java Monday, State Minister For
Population Haryono Suyono said that the government's poverty
alleviation program has reduced the number of people living in
poverty from 60 percent of the population in the 1970s to
approximately 11 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, Haryono said that development has only succeeded in
reducing poverty in urban areas but not in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the number of rural people living in
poverty decreased only from 15.1 percent of the population to

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Banking System Remains Stable in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's financial situation
remained stable in July with nearly 90 percent of cash emission
collected by the banking system, said Viktor Yushchenko, chairman
of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the banking system had allotted 4.22 billion
hryvnas (about 2.32 billion U.S. dollars) for wage payment and
social bonuses, which has become the largest allocation during
1997 and the second largest since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the same month, 3.75 billion hryvnas (about 2.06 billion
dollars) returned to the banking system. The high rate of cash
withdrawal from circulation showed the stability of the hryvnas'
exchange rate, prices and banking system as a whole, Yushchenko
said.
</P>
<P>
The average discount rate for state securities has increased
from 25.9 percent to 28 percent, which can be explained by
considerable conversion of long-term securities with one or one
and a half year term of redemption, noted the chairman.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the NBU is the only global currency buyer on
the Ukrainian stock market and has never initiated banking
support, which testifies to an increasing demand for hryvna. This
has made the NBU decide to reduce the NBU discount rate from 18
percent to 16 percent.

<HEADLINE> College Education Provided for Disabled People in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- This summer when Su Dan, a
girl with a disability, graduated from university, she was
approached by more than 30 companies.
</P>
<P>
This was in sharp contrast to just four years ago when she
graduated from middle school with high scores but was rejected by
quite a few universities.
</P>
<P>
Then Ji'nan University in Guangzhou, the capital of China's
Guangdong Province, learned of her plight and enrolled her in its
computer department.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Guangdong has made great efforts to help
people with disabilities enjoy their right to an education. After
1994, some 882 students who passed the entrance examinations went
on to further study at universities or technical schools, thanks
to the efforts of the Provincial Disabled Persons' Federation and
various departments.
</P>
<P>
The province has also built nearly 50 schools for disabled
people, enrolling more than 46,000 students, with children with
disabilities accounting for 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
It has opened dozens of job training classes to help the
disabled gain work skills. In 1988, the province set up China's
first job training center for the disabled, training some 300
blind people in massage. The Guangdong Institute for National
Minorities has opened a writers' class and offers a number of
special courses for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, various employment service centers for
the disabled have been opened in 21 cities and 100 counties in the
province, the employment rate of the disabled in the province has
increased from 55 percent in 1995 to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Su Dan has now gone on to a job in the Guangzhou Railway
Corporation, and believes that she can make a contribution to
society. "I couldn't finish my studies without the help of my
teachers and classmates. It's their love that gave me courage to
overcome my difficulties," she said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Aid-the-Poor Programs in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest city of Shanghai
has made progress in implementing a five-year plan to help the
poor in southwest China's Yunnan Province, according to a report
in today's "China Daily."
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai municipal committee of the Communist Party of
China and municipal government established an aid-the-poor leading
group and worked out the plan last September.
</P>
<P>
Funding and material support came from the city's 12 sectors,
such as industry, agriculture, education, science and technology,
culture, health and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The plan included 107 help-the-poor programs, with 732 million
yuan (87 million US dollars) in funding.
</P>
<P>
So far, the plan has aided construction of 105 primary schools
in Yunnan and helped about 12,500 drop-outs return to school.
</P>
<P>
Contributions to the assistance fund in Shanghai have reached
48.45 million yuan (5.8 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The city's Songjiang County and Yangpu District constructed
sugar cane factories to take advantage of the abundant output of
sugar cane in Yunnan's Simao and Maguan counties.
</P>
<P>
Since Shanghai became the market for the sugar, the province's
sugar and food industries have developed greatly.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Education Commission has signed 260 agreements
with its counterparts in the province to train some 2,000 local
teachers and set up two training bases.
</P>
<P>
Health departments in Shanghai also have dispatched travelling
medical teams and raised 1.14 million yuan to improve medical
service in more than 20 poor counties and villages in the
province.

<HEADLINE> Record Dry Period For Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Although the threat of floods on
the Yellow River cannot yet be completely written off, it is much
more likely that the China's second longest river will witness a
record dry period this year, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The lower section of the river has dried up for six years
mainly because of the drought in North China. It dried up last
year for a record 136 days, but the record is likely to be broken
in the next two days because there will not be enough rain to
cause the resumption of the flow of water on the lower reaches,
the paper quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The dried-up river will threaten up to 52 million people, more
than 7.4 million hectares of sown areas of crops, 40 percent of
which are irrigated high-yield areas.
</P>
<P>
One of the major factors causing the dry-up is the declining
volume of water in the river in the last few years, particularly
on its lower reaches, according to experts with the Ministry of
Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
At the Huayuankou Hydrological Station near Zhengzhou in Henan
Province on the lower reaches, only 8.8 billion cubic meters of
water flowed into the river during the first seven months of this
year, which was 50 percent lower than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of water in the river was made worse by the
ever-increasing demand for water by provinces on the lower
reaches, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
More than 460 million cubic meters of water or 49 percent of
the total volume reaching the lower section of the river in the
first flood crest early this month were diverted by Shandong and
Henan, two of the worst-hit provinces during this year's
drought. More than 90 percent of the water was used for farmland
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the water was lost either due to leakages from the
river's watercourses or large amounts of sand carried by the
water.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Newly revised technical
requirements for program-controlled switching systems will soon
go into effect, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quotes Jiang Shaobing, an official
of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) as saying
that the new regulations will require program-controlled switching
systems to have high capacity and top-quality technology to serve
digital telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
China's telephone networks are extending from the East into
Western regions and from urban to rural areas at an annual rate of
over 20 million land lines and six million mobile telephone
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 when China achieves the goal of ensuring each
village has access to telephones, there will be more than 174
million land lines and over 30 million mobile telephone
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
To support the development of domestic enterprises and joint
ventures, the MPT has decided no more program-controlled switching
systems will be imported.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that great potential remains to be tapped in China's
program-controlled switching system market.
</P>
<P>
Switching systems with a capacity of 600 million lines need to
be installed if only 30 percent of the Chinese households get
telephones. Currently the country's switching systems can only
cope with about 100 million lines, the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Prime Nebiolo, president of the
International Amateur Athletic Federation, said that the world
championships here would have been a "tragedy" as the organizers
failed to bring satisfied crowd on the stands in the opening days.
</P>
<P>
The championships could be a "tragedy" if the IAAF hadn't
stepped in to remedy the situation. "The organizing team wasn't up
to much, we found it mediocre." Nebiolo on Monday told the Greek
television channel Mega.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF Chief also mocked Athens' bid to host the 2004 Olympic
Games. Athens is competing against Rome -- backed by Nebiolo --
Stockholm, Cape Town and Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics can't resolve Greece's problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Evangelos Savramis, the head of the world championships
organizing committee, said: "The only thing Mr. Nebiolo did was to
continually create problems."
</P>
<P>
Savramis firmly put the poor crowd on the IAAF, saying that
Nebiolo refused to allow them to put the event back a month
despite it falling in the middle of the tradition Greek holiday
period.
</P>
<P>
Athens mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos complained that Nebiolo was
behaving like the honorary president of the Rome bid for the 2004
games.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is working on a
national youth suicide strategy to deal with the high number of
youth suicides.
</P>
<P>
A local press report said today that Youth Affairs Minister
Deborah Morris will issue the framework for the strategy on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Youth suicide rates in New Zealand are reported to be among the
highest in the world: 44 males for every 100,000 students, second
only to Finland and 13 females for every 100,000, the highest in
the world.
</P>
<P>
National statistics for 1995 showed that 156 people killed
themselves, and 1,310 were admitted to hospital after suicide
attempts.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of 2,000 young people in schools found that 18
percent have had some thoughts of suicide and 7 percent have
attempted it.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will stress the need of encouraging young people
to seek help when they face an emotional crisis, and a general
improvement of attitudes and understanding of emotional problems
and suicidal behavior.
</P>
<P>
It will recommend extra funding for mental health, recruiting
more mental health workers and reducing charges.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Rejects Call for Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has
rejected a call to reshuffle his cabinet as "unnecessary", a
German government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Kohl was quoted as making the remark during his vacation in
Austria after Finance Minister Theo Waigel suggested over the
weekend that the German cabinet be reshuffled this year in order
to put the governing coalition in a better position for the next
general elections scheduled for Autumn next year.
</P>
<P>
Germany's governing coalition is consisted of Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), Waigel's Christian Social Union (CSU) and
the junior partner Free Democratic Party (FDP).
</P>
<P>
Despite Kohl's opposition, CSU Vice-General-Secretary Joachim
Herrmann voiced support for Waigel's proposal.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost,
Herrmann noted that his party could be less represented in the
cabinet when the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications,
currently held by the CSU, is dissolved under a government plan by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Due to its successful policy, the CSU should not be punished by
the government reform, Herrmann said.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Thyssen, Krupp Eye Full Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's two largest steel
companies Thyssen and Krupp would begin talks next month which
could lead to a full merger, German media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Thyssen and Krupp, once arch-rivals, agreed in March to merge
their steel-making units after Krupp launched an unsolicited bid
to take over its larger rival Thyssen.
</P>
<P>
According to the German news magazine Der Spiegel, the two
companies would begin talks in September with a view to merge the
rest of their operations after their steel joint venture begins
operating at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The merger was long overdue because the two companies were
still too small by international standard to compete with U.S. or
Japanese giants in areas such as trade in raw materials or car
components, Der Spiegel said.
</P>
<P>
A full merger would not only produce an entity which would be
the world's fifth largest steel maker, but also one of the most
important supplier of the automotive industry, the magazine said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Oklahoma Bombing Defendant's Retrial Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge in Denver,
Colorado, rejected on Monday Timothy McVeigh's bid for a new trial
in the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and ordered McVeigh to appear
for formal sentencing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a motion for a new trial filed last month, McVeigh's
attorneys argued jurors were unfairly swayed by pretrial publicity
and devastating testimony from bombing survivors and victims'
relatives.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch sided with prosecutors,
who contended McVeigh received a fair trial, according to news
reports.
</P>
<P>
In June, McVeigh was convicted of murder, conspiracy and
weapons-related counts and sentenced to die in the April 19, 1995,
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma. The
bombing killed 168 people and injured more than 500. A jury
sentenced him to death by injection.
</P>
<P>
Matsch "ensured the McVeigh trial not only was fair, but indeed
was close to perfect," prosecutor Sean Connelly wrote in a brief
opposing McVeigh's motion for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
"McVeigh's conviction was the product of a fair trial in which
the evidence of guilt was so overwhelming that the jury could not
rationally have reached any other verdict," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
is ordering the immediate testing of low-altitude warning systems
in the nation's airports following disclosure that the system was
not working on Guam when Korean Air Flight 801 crashed.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration announced today that, as a
precaution, it "is directing the testing of all of the Minimum
Safe Altitude Warning Systems within next two days."
</P>
<P>
There are about 200 of the systems at U.S. airports, designed
to issue an alert if a jet is flying too low. Controllers on the
ground then warn the pilot.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board reported Sunday that
an error was apparently inserted into the Guam system's software
and it was not working at the time of the Korean Air plane crash,
which killed 226 people.
</P>
<P>
Investigators say the faulty system was not to blame for the
crash. But they say a properly working system could have allowed
air traffic controllers to direct the pilot of the Boeing 747 to
pull the plane to a higher altitude when the plane approached Guam
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The FAA is also using data taken from Flight 801 to simulate the
jet's route and figure out when the alert should have been given,
said George Black, an NTSB member.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The White House said on
Monday that President Bill Clinton is still considering making a
trip to Africa early next year, and what has not been decided is
his itinerary.
</P>
<P>
But whatsoever of his itinerary, South Africa is certain to be
included in his African travel, White House spokesman Mike McCurry
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan to visit Africa reflects his shifting much more
attention to international affairs in his second term, observers
here said.
</P>
<P>
In his first term, Clinton paid relatively little attention to
Africa and U.S. aid to that continent is only a fraction of its
14 billion U.S. dollar annual foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher traveled to
Africa last year and made some proposals including forming a task
force by African countries to deal with peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
The United States has this year sent some Army troops to the
continent to do training of some countries' troops for that
mission.
</P>
<P>
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton also made a six-nation tour
of Africa in March. And after her visit, the president joined
bipartisan congressional leaders in June to urge a series of trade
measures designed to encourage free-market reforms in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Waigel Wants to Reduce Germany's Contributions to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
has called for a reduction in Germany's financial contributions to
the European Union (EU) because Germany has become less well-off
after its reunification in 1990, a German news magazine reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel, Waigel
said: "It is not going to work in the long run that only one
country, Germany, shoulders 60 percent of the total EU spendings".
</P>
<P>
A new, more favorable burden-sharing system should be found for
the period after the year 2000, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Waigel, Germany currently contributes over 20
billion marks (11 billion U.S. dollars) a year to the EU, which is
0.6 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Germany should pay about 0.4 percent of its GDP to the EU at
most, which is six to seven billion marks (3.2 to 3.8 billion
dollars) less than the current level, Waigel said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Rebounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rallied sharply
Monday from its big pre-weekend selloff, powered by resumed
appetite for dollars and doubts that Germany is preparing to raise
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar slid 2.9 percent against the yen and 1.1
percent against the mark on Friday, when U.S. stock and bond
prices plunged.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled in New York at 116.12 yen, up from its
nearly one-month low of 114.95 yen Friday. The dollar cost 1.8634
marks, up from 1.8473. The pound cost 1.5828 U.S. dollars, down
from 1.5855 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, which lost 156 points,
rallied from a 50-point deficit late Monday to close up 30.89 at
8,062.11. The 30-year Treasury bond also reversed from a deficit
close slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
Further helping the dollar was receding speculation that the
Bundesbank would raise the short-term interest rate known as the
repo rate on Tuesday. Traders said resilient weakness in Germany's
economy made higher rates unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday:
</P>
<P>
1.5275 Swiss francs, up from 1.5103; 6.2803 French francs, up
from 6.2238; 1,814.00 Italian lire, up from 1,802.50; 1.3934

<HEADLINE> U.S. Admits Long Way to Go in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
admitted that there is still "a long way to go" in Bosnia despite
some progress has been made after a visit to the Balkans by a U.S.
special envoy.
</P>
<P>
"In Bosnia, no matter how much progress you make, you still
have a long way to go," State Department spokesman James Rubin
told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
However, when asked to assess the trip by U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke last week to the Balkans, Rubin said that "significant
progress" has been made in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at Bosnia as a motion picture and not a
snapshot," Rubin said. "We see... that progress has been made,
significant progress."
</P>
<P>
During his trip to the Balkans, Holbrooke resolved a dispute
among Bosnia's leaders over diplomatic posts and gained promise
from the Bosnian Serbs that former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic will disappear from politics.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts have noted that the trip was a failure as
Bosnia's leaders still have differences over a series of issues on
how to unite the Serbs, Muslims and Croats into one nation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Holbrooke was believed to have compromised on
dealing with Karadzic by giving Serbs a period of grace. Karadzic
was indicted as a major war criminal by Washington and regarded as
a major obstacle in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: No Linkage between Food Aid, Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department, in
response to DPRK's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)
criticism of Washington using food aid as a weapon at peace talks,
said on Monday that no linkage should exist between food
assistance and four-party peace talks on Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK foreign Ministry said on Sunday that its negotiators
were disappointed by a U.S. insistence that food aid could be
discussed only after the four-party peace talks open.
</P>
<P>
"With serious food problems, we guard against possible use of
food assistance to (DPRK) as a political weapon at the four-way
talks," a ministry spokesman told the Korean Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK Foreign Ministry's statement was interpreted here as
Pyongyang's aim at extracting as much food assistance as possible
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin reiterated that
Washington never linked the four-party talks with food aid.
</P>
<P>
"These talks are designed to improve stability on the Korean
Peninsula. They're designed to improve the situation for the
people in both sides of the divide in Korea. So we don't think
they ought to be linked to other issues," he said at a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Last week, officials from both countries of the Korean
Peninsula, the United States and China met in New York consulting
possible date, place and agenda for a future four-party peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK officials said at the meeting that the agenda for the
talks should include withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea
and a bilateral peace treaty with Washington that would exclude
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said the United States wants a general agenda that
focuses on stability, security and confidence-building measures.

<HEADLINE> White House Travel Fund Squeezed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The White House is cutting
back travel by presidential aides as its travel budget began
creeping too close to its limit for the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
After accounting for the travel cost of the trips U.S.
President Bill Clinton is expected to take between now and
September 30, when the fiscal year ends, the White House was left
with a "headroom cushion" of only 40,000 dollars, said White House
Press Secretary Mike McCurry Monday.
</P>
<P>
But McCurry said the White House wasn't worried the Clintons
would run out of travel funds before the end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy White House chief of staff John Podesta is now
personally approving each official traveler on Air Force One and
other trips.
</P>
<P>
But McCurry said Monday the measure is just a "prudent effort
to keep the size of the presidential entourage at a minimum."
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure this happens and has happened in the past," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions apply only to "White House aides, staff-type
folks" and exclude official military, medical or Secret Service
personnel, McCurry said.
