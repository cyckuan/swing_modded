<HEADLINE>  Cubs Get Closer Aguilera From Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs, in need of a closer with  
struggling Rod Beck on the disabled list and considering elbow 
surgery, acquired Rick Aguilera from the Minnesota Twins on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs sent minor league right-handers Kyle Lohse and Jason  
Ryan to the Twins in exchange for the 37-year-old Aguilera -- the 
Twins' all-time saves leader -- and minor league left-hander Scott 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some mixed emotions,'' Aguilera said. ``My heart's  
kind of hurt, knowing I'm leaving. But on the other hand, I'm 
excited about what lies ahead. It was a tough day saying goodbye to 
my teammates and (manager) Tom Kelly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera should fill the Cubs' gaping hole at closer. Beck saved  
51 games last season but has struggled all season. The burly 
right-hander was 2-4 with four blown saves and a 10.54 ERA before 
he went on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck flew to San Francisco for a second opinion Thursday on  
whether to have surgery on two bone spurs and bone chips in his 
right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to shore up the bullpen. Hopefully, Rick Aguilera can  
do that for us,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. ``We just didn't 
feel we could go forward without some experience in the bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Friday's game against the Atlanta Braves, the Cubs had  
converted only 11 of 21 save opportunities, and no reliever other 
than Beck had more than one save. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, Scott Sanders gave up a ninth-inning homer to  
Gerald Williams to squander a 5-4 lead. The Cubs eventually won 6-5 
in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera was 3-1 with a 1.27 ERA and six saves in 17 games for  
the Twins this season. He came to Minnesota from the New York Mets 
in 1989 as a starter, but converted to the role of closer in 1990, 
compiling 254 saves. He also ranks first in club history in games 
pitched with 490. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just think he's an improvement over some of the pieces in  
our bullpen,'' Riggleman said. ``He's a good pitcher who can get 
outs in the ninth inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aguilera was the last link to the Twins' World Series  
championship team in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a shame,'' Kelly said. ``It seems like a long time ago,  
I guess. I think everyone hates to see him go. He's been an 
outstanding player and he's represented the organization very well 
on and off the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Aguilera was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitcher  
Frank Rodriguez. He was re-signed by the Twins in December 1995 to 
a three-year contract as a starting pitcher after spending the 
previous six seasons exclusively as a closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite three stints on the disabled list in 1996, he made 19  
starts, posting an 8-6 record while pitching 111 1-3 innings. 
Aguilera returned to the closer role in 1997 and has 70 saves over 
the past two-plus seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He will join the Cubs in Atlanta on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Lohse, 20, comes to the Twins from the Cubs Class A team in  
Daytona, and will report to Fort Myers in the Class A Florida State 
League. Ryan, 23, has been playing for West Tenn in the Double A 
Southern League and will report to Double A New Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Downs, 23, returns to the Cubs organization after being traded  
to the Twins in November for Mike Morgan. After pitching for Fort 
Myers and New Britain, Downs will report to Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Aguilera waived the no-trade clause in his contract  
so the Twins could keep cutting their payroll. Aguilera's salary 
for this year is $3.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been talking about getting Aguilera for a long time,''  
Riggleman said. ``We'd like to have him and Rod out there 
eventually. Hopefully, we will before the season is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins, who began Friday with the worst record (13-27) in the  
AL, felt they had no choice other than trading their top reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be sorely missed here, but under the  
circumstances, we just couldn't get to him down there in our 
bullpen,'' general manager Terry Ryan said. ``I'd much rather have 
it turn out this way with us getting something than have him walk 
away and get nothing.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Beat Brazil 3-0 in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Mia Hamm entered the international record  
book Saturday night as four of her teammates helped set up her 
108th career goal in the United States' 3-0 victory over Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm's goal, which took place during injury time at the end of  
the first half, moved her out of a tie with retired Elisabetta 
Vignotto of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, international superstar Pele scored 77 in his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando native Michelle Akers began the series with a pass to  
Hamm, who sent it to Kristin Lilly, who passed to Cindy Parlow. 
</P>
<P>
	Parlow made the final one-touch back to Hamm, who had beaten  
Brazilian defender Elane on the right side. Hamm fired a shot 
behind goalie Didi to give the United States the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Team captain Carla Overbeck scooped the ball out of the goal and  
presented it to Hamm, already surrounded by her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was special to set the record on such a great goal,'' said  
Hamm, 27, who played in her 172nd game with the U.S. national team. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Hamm had a golden opportunity slip away when she  
intercepted a Brazilian pass back to goal, but her wide-open shot 
was turned away during the game played at the Florida Citrus Bowl 
before a crowd of 10,452. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly put the United States ahead 2-0 in in the 72nd minute off  
a corner kick from Tiffeny Milbrett, who added a goal 15 minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	A second ball was thrown on the field when Milbrett was  
receiving a cross from Lilly, distracting some Brazilian defenders. 
The referee threw the second ball off as play continued, and the 
United States scored seconds later. A Brazilan player was ejected 
after shoving an official. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States improved to 13-2-1 this season with its fifth  
straight victory in a nine-game tour leading up to its Women's 
World Cup opener June 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Brianna Scurry registered 10 saves.  
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, the first team to arrive in the United States in  
preparation for the Women's World Cup, threatened often in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Its best opportunity came in the 31st minute, when Nene fired a  
shot from the right side that bounced off the left post. Katia 
tried to put in the ricochet, but was stuffed by Scurry, who made 
the save sitting down.

<HEADLINE> New Operation Rebuilds Lost Breasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The topic was breasts, so no one seemed very  
surprised when the speaker clicked up a slide of a topless woman. 
</P>
<P>
	At first glance, everything about the picture on the screen  
looked ordinary enough. It showed the chest of a fit-looking woman, 
probably 40-something. Her breasts were medium size, free of sag 
and perfectly symmetrical. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience stared. That seemed natural, too, since this  
gathering was sponsored by the American Cancer Society, and the man 
at the lectern was a plastic surgeon. And on second look, something 
about the woman's right side was ever-so-slightly off. Exactly what 
was hard to say. Maybe the nipple area was a shade darker than the 
other. Or perhaps the outline of the areola was a bit too sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	For those in the room who could not see the difference, the  
surgeon offered some help: ``I'll point out the reconstructed side, 
because it's not always obvious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, reconstructed. This woman's right breast was created by the  
surgeon. It looked uncannily like its mate and undoubtedly like the 
one it replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joseph J. Disa went on, talking about circumareolar  
incisions and transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps and 
such, walking his audience through the state of the art of the 
modern mastectomy. And art it is, this reinvention of an old 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the 1980s, little thought typically was given to the  
physical aftereffects of breast cancer surgery. The standard 
operation was not much changed from the one Dr. William Halsted 
introduced in the 1890s, the radical mastectomy. It removed the 
breast and the lymph nodes in the armpit, leaving a hollowed out 
space and a scar. 
</P>
<P>
	The first big change came in 1985, when doctors proved that it  
is often enough to remove just the cancerous lump, not the whole 
breast. Now, roughly half of women with breast cancer get 
lumpectomies. But for a variety of reasons -- the size of the tumor, 
the stage of the disease and the preferences of patients and 
doctors -- mastectomies are still a common surgical approach to 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even though it is still called a mastectomy, the results in  
the hands of a skilled surgical team may bear no resemblance to the 
disfiguring operation that makes this word so dreaded by women. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past three or four years, surgeons at several medical  
centers have developed a remarkable new method of reconstruction. 
It restores the shape, the appearance and the feel of the patient's 
missing breast, using her own breast skin and other body parts as 
building material. And it leaves almost no scars. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation is becoming standard at Memorial Sloan-Kettering  
Cancer Center in New York City, where Disa works, and other elite 
medical centers. Doctors call it the complete skin-sparing 
mastectomy with immediate autologous tissue reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's what that means. First, the autologous part: In the  
1980s, plastic surgeons began reconstructing severed breasts using 
tissue salvaged from their patients' tummies. They move it from the 
spare tire to the chest, where they shape it into a breast. The 
results are often very good, but there are definite drawbacks. 
Sculpting the exact shape and droop of the other side is often 
impossible, even though the new breast looks fine under clothing. 
Naked, though, it can be a patchwork of scars and colors, since 
skin from different parts of the body does not match up exactly. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the real breakthrough is the skin-sparing aspect of the  
new approach. Instead of lopping off the entire breast, cancer 
surgeons simply hollow it out. First they cut off the nipple and 
discard it. Then they work through this opening to remove all the 
tissue inside, leaving just an empty sack, or skin envelope, as 
they call it. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, they fill up this envelope with salvaged fat and muscle,  
usually harvested from the belly but sometimes from the back or 
butt. After a couple of months, they fashion a perpetually erect 
nipple and areola with skin removed from the upper thigh, using 
stitches to make the little bumps called Montgomery glands. 
Finally, they darken it with tattooing. 
</P>
<P>
	When all goes well -- and surgeons say the results are excellent  
about 80 percent of the time -- women tend to rhapsodize about the 
results. Among those who feel this way is Celeste Oranchak, a 
fund-raiser for a theater in Englewood, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	When doctors discovered a tumor on her right breast, Oranchak  
explored all the possibilities. Eventually she chose a mastectomy. 
Because she is slender and her breasts small, taking out just the 
lump would have been disfiguring. 
</P>
<P>
	Now her reconstruction is almost complete. The last step will be  
for Disa to tattoo her newly crafted nipple, making it the same 
color as the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the real thing and feels like the real thing,''  
says Oranchak. ``When I look in the mirror, I see two breasts that 
look almost exactly the same. Clearly, I can wear everything I 
want, strapless dresses and sheer tops and all that kind of 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like many others who have had this reconstruction, Oranchak is  
eager to talk about it, to tell other women facing breast cancer 
and mastectomy that they can come through the ordeal whole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not diminishing the whole journey by any means, but women  
need to know it's not as bad as some may have perceived,'' Oranchak 
says. ``Women should know there are options that are exquisite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An exquisite mastectomy? It is so hard to believe that surgeons  
grope for superlatives to describe their results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll bet the average lay person could not tell one of these  
women has had a mastectomy,'' says Dr. Darrick E. Antell of St. 
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City. ``It's that 
good. I can't imagine it looking any better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost every doctor, it seems, has stories of patients who go  
for mammograms or checkups, only to have medical folks fail to 
recognize that their breasts are reconstructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Melvin Silverstein of the University of Southern California  
tells of a little experiment he performed recently. With a 
mastectomy patient's approval, he told a medical student he would 
undrape the woman for three seconds. Then he would cover her up 
again. The student's task: Pick out the original breast. 
</P>
<P>
	``The medical student looked and got it wrong,'' says  
Silverstein, still glowing over the encounter. ``To me, that tells 
you how remarkable this is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, with all its advantages, this kind of mastectomy is not  
right for all patients -- or for all surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation is done in two stages. First, a cancer surgeon  
hollows out the breast. Then a plastic surgeon fills it up. 
</P>
<P>
	Skin-sparing mastectomies are considerably more difficult than  
the ordinary kind. Cancer surgeons must clean out the breast 
working through a small keyhole, the missing nipple. They must 
leave just enough tissue so the skin survives, but not enough to 
hide stray cancer cells. Those who do breast cancer surgery only on 
occasion probably will not -- and probably should not -- give this a 
try. 
</P>
<P>
	For plastic surgeons, reconstruction after skin-sparing  
mastectomies is actually easier than rebuilding breasts from 
scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	``All one needs to do is fill that envelope,'' says Dr. Luis  
Vasconez of the University of Alabama. ``One matches the other 
breast in just about every case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, this is major surgery, especially when doctors  
fill the breast with living tissue rather than with a saline-filled 
implant. Often, they make a hip-to-hip slice just below the belly 
button to gather filler. They cut away a section of abdominal fat, 
but they leave it partially attached to the rectus muscle, which 
supplies the tissue with blood. Then they tunnel beneath the skin, 
sliding the piece of flesh up to the empty breast. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, though, doctors cut the tissue out entirely before  
they put it into the breast. This is even more difficult, because 
it requires microsurgery to reattach blood vessels. But it's the 
only option if the patient is too thin to give up belly tissue and 
doctors have to find flesh elsewhere, such as the back or buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever method is used, if the women's breasts are large or  
saggy, surgeons will sometimes suggest reducing the size of the 
healthy one and giving it a lift. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most difficult things to do is get symmetry,'' says  
Dr. Martin Moskovitz of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. 
``It's much easier to operate on both breasts at the same time. You 
have to ask, Why do we want to reconstruct a drooping breast?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plastic surgeons say they don't push this option since lots of  
women are perfectly happy with how they look. But coming out of 
surgery with a flatter tummy and more shapely breasts is a definite 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation often takes six to eight hours. Certainly its  
length and complexity are a consideration, and there are others. In 
a small percentage of cases, part of the transplanted tissue dies, 
possibly ruining the results. Tinkering with tummy muscles can 
weaken the stomach wall and increase the chance of a hernia. 
Furthermore, a poorly placed biopsy scar can make the procedure 
difficult or even impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation is offered only to women with early stage cancer  
that has not spread. Their tumors must be relatively small and not 
involve the skin. Really large breasts are difficult to duplicate 
simply because they require so much flesh. 
</P>
<P>
	Some women opt for mastectomies over lumpectomies because they  
cannot stand the thought of keeping a cancerous breast. Others want 
to avoid the radiation therapy and frequent exams needed to guard 
against recurring cancer after lumpectomies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many doctors believe that when possible, woman are better  
off keeping their own breasts by opting for lumpectomies. For one 
thing, even when all goes perfectly, a reconstructed breast lacks 
the sensation of the original. Women have some feeling, but the 
faux nipple is numb. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who choose mastectomy, however, the skin-sparing  
approach has clearly revolutionized the entire process. While the 
primary goal still is to cure cancer, doctors say they can now make 
appearance a priority, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to allow them to look good in a bra, a bathing suit  
and evening wear and do whatever they want to do without having to 
fiddle with a prosthesis,'' says Dr. Louis Bucky of the University 
of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Lewis, a college administrator from White Plains, N.Y.,  
imagines she would have done fine with an old-fashioned mastectomy. 
After all, life is more important than breasts. But her 
reconstruction allowed her avoid that personal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	And the result? ``I think I look fantastic,'' she says. ``But  
it's so comfortable, so natural, I don't even think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Nashold, a retired bond trader from Edwards, Colo., put  
her reconstruction to the ultimate appearance test. She went 
topless on a beach in France. No one stared. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, the biggest thing was that I never felt mutilated,''  
says Nashold. ``I remember my mother and her scar. Her body was 
mutilated. My body is intact.''

<HEADLINE> Romney Hopes To Save Utah Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In another six months, Mitt Romney hopes  
to have ``all the lines connected and the boxes filled'' in his 
quest to rebuild the Salt Lake Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the third president of the local Olympic organization --  
and the one with perhaps the toughest job -- is seeking sponsors and 
budget cuts, and learning how to say no. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say I'm looking for heroes of all stripes to save  
our bacon, to help us find ways to reduce costs and to also support 
the games,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past week, Romney has spent many hours with someone who  
knows what he's going through -- Jean-Claude Killy, the triple 
gold-medal skier and co-president of the 1992 Albertville Games who 
is now an IOC member from France. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been an eye-opening experience for Romney, the venture  
capitalist from Boston who returned three months ago to the state 
where he spent his youth. He arrived in the middle of the Olympic 
bribery scandal to try to solve problems he inherited. 
</P>
<P>
	Killy is vice-chairman of the International Olympic Committee  
task force coordinating preparations for the 2002 Winter Games, and 
Romney said his presence during a week of meetings was ``very 
powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been where I am now and he continues to give very, very  
good advice to me,'' Romney said. ``He told me how many people are 
going to come asking for more. He said. `Mitt, you have to learn 
just to say no, I'm sorry, we can't do that.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And he said, `It's tough, you're telling everyone no and  
you'll be criticized by many, many people and the public and the 
media. But when the games begin, people will appreciate what's been 
built.''' 
</P>
<P>
	What Romney wants to build is a lasting monument to Olympic  
athletes and sports, while paying the bills and making sure 
everything is neat and tidy when the games end on Feb. 24, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``People here are anxious to get on with the games and sport,  
and to stop dwelling on the administration and the failures of 
management,'' he said. ``The energy here is in regards to new 
sponsors, mascots, sport, going forward. And I had not expected it 
would be so immediate. The support has been very heartening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney is the son of one of the most celebrated couples in  
American public service, former Michigan Gov. George Romney and his 
wife, Lenora. 
</P>
<P>
	A failed challenger for Ted Kennedy's Senate seat from  
Massachusetts in 1994, Romney made his mark by reviving troubled 
companies as CEO of Bain Capital Inc. Domino's pizza and Staples 
office supplies are two of his success stories. 
</P>
<P>
	He was recruited to head the Salt Lake Organizing Committee when  
Frank Joklik, the retired chairman of Kennecott copper, resigned in 
the midst of the million-dollar scandal over improper inducements 
to IOC members from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	And in his three months on the job, the 52-year-old graduate of  
BYU and Harvard Business School has attacked SLOC's problems as he 
would those of any foundering organization -- cutting costs, looking 
for new income and changing its image. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he said, $98 million has been trimmed from SLOC's budget  
and more paring is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	And earlier this month, Romney announced deals totaling some $30  
million with three new sponsors -- the first major signings since 
the scandal broke last November, but far from the $300 million in 
sponsorships SLOC needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney and the IOC spent much of the week talking money, and the  
SLOC president said he hoped for breakthroughs soon in the ``virgin 
territory'' of sponsorships from information-technology companies, 
a growing Utah resource. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of those technology companies have not been called on,  
ever, to consider a sponsorship of the Olympics and Olympic 
teams,'' he said. ``And think of those Internet companies -- they 
weren't even here! I don't know if E-Bay existed at the time of 
Atlanta'' which played host to the games in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Such high-tech sponsors also would open the door to Romney's  
view of worldwide Olympic marketing right in your home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have pins and memorabilia and licensed products  
and maybe even tickets that get sold on the Internet,'' he said. 
``And we haven't even worked with companies like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other sponsor slots Romney wants to fill include an  
international automaker, chemical and pharmaceutical firms and 
various food products, including cereals. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also considering an approach to federal agencies to use the  
Winter Games as a platform for various programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may be able to be a demonstration project for a drug-free  
America, or a demonstration project for the Energy Department or 
the EPA,'' he said. ``We have a number of things that from my point 
of view are important from a precedent standpoint and communicate 
what can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC's image has been buffed by Romney's direct but casual  
style. He acted like a talk-show host and looked like the emcee of 
a country-music concert when he helped introduce the games' new 
mascots -- a snowshoe hare, a coyote and a black bear -- to a 
cheering audience last weekend. He invited the IOC members to his 
house for dinner, the only social function on their calendar. He 
strolls SLOC's offices with his smile on and his suit jacket off. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposed budget cuts have not always produced smiles. The  
U.S. Olympic Committee is negotiating to save $5 million in 
operating cuts for pre-games training at ski jumps, bobsled and 
luge tracks and the speedskating oval, eliminating free practice 
time it says Romney's predecessors promised. 
</P>
<P>
	The new SLOC boss says his proposal ``doesn't strike me as being  
an outrageous request,'' since SLOC spent $170 million to build the 
facilities and will still pay two-thirds of the operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney even has gone after perhaps the most sacred cow of  
Olympic finance -- the money spent on IOC members during the games. 
He's asked the committee to pick up a bigger share of the 
multimillion-dollar tab, including hotel charges. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he hasn't been told no.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been refreshing -- they haven't come here saying `We want  
more of this' or `Give us more,''' he said. ``Instead it's been, 
`How can we be helpful to the games?'''

<HEADLINE> Catinca Captures Shuvee Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Catinca was up in the final strides today to  
capture the Grade II $150,000 Shuvee Handicap for fillies and mares 
3-years-old and up at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in three years that trainer John Kimmel  
and jockey Richard Migliore had teamed up to capture the Shuvee 
Handicap. Two years ago, it was Hidden Lake who got the job done. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's 24th running of the race, Catinca captured the  
$90,000 winner's share for Robert K. Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was the third time in the Shuvee's last 10 runnings that  
Migliore rode the winner. In 1990, he was aboard for Tis Juliet's 
winning trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Act, who contended for the lead throughout, lasted to be  
runnerup in the six horse field, 1 1/2 lengths before Tap to Music. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the second in four starts this year for Catinca and  
the second straight for added money. The 4-year-old daughter of 
Storm Cat from the Saratoga Six mare, Inca Legacy, reported home 
first in Aqueduct's Grade III Bed o'Roses Handicap in her previous 
start on April 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Catinca carried highweight of 121 and Migliore one mile in 1:34  
1-5 on the fast track and returned $7.50, $3.10 and $2.40. Sister 
Act paid $3.10 and $2.30, and Tap to Music was $2.70.

<HEADLINE> Kasich Works Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINTERSET, Iowa -- (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich, chairman of the House  
Budget Committee and a presidential hopeful, said Saturday he's 
working on a plan to shore up Social Security that may call for 
``some sacrifice'' from baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in Iowa, Kasich said his proposal would allow  
private investment of at least some of the money now collected in 
Social Security taxes. But given the number of people nearing an 
age to withdraw retirement pensions, private investment might not 
be enough to keep the system afloat, Kasich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be some sacrifice involved,'' he said. ``The  
question is, when do we phase this program in. It may be that the 
baby boomers take a hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa, where February precinct caucuses make the nation's first  
candidate selections for the 2000 campaign, has the third oldest 
population in the nation. Kasich, R-Ohio, said he rejects such 
traditional Social Security cuts as raising the retirement age or 
limiting cost-of-living increases. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not offer details about his plan but said it is clear  
that some groups will have to sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still running the numbers,'' Kasich said. ``I'm  
developing a plan. It may be that sacrifice is needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move carries great political significance for Kasich. In  
addition to his Budget Committee post, he is exploring the 
possibility of a bid for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich said his plan calls for taking a portion of the Social  
Security tax and returning it to taxpayers who, in turn, would 
invest in a preselected menu of investment options. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economic projections assume a monthly 5 percent investment  
return.

<HEADLINE> Report: Knicks Met With Jackson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The president of Madison Square Garden met  
secretly with Phil Jackson nearly a month ago to inquire whether 
the former coach of the six-time champion Chicago Bulls would be 
interested in taking over the Knicks, The New York Times reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, the  
Times said Knicks president Dave Checketts made no offer to Jackson 
at the 90-minute meeting but gauged his interest in coaching the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time the meeting took place, Ernie Grunfeld was still the  
team president and general manager. He was relieved of his duties 
by Checketts shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the weeks since, the Knicks have turned around their season  
by qualifying for the playoffs, defeating the Miami Heat in the 
first round and taking a 2-0 lead over the Atlanta Hawks in the 
second round heading into Sunday's Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's resurgence has fueled talk that coach Jeff Van  
Gundy's job is safe for another year, although Checketts has said 
he will wait until the season ends before making any personnel 
decisions. Van Gundy has one more year remaining on a three-year, 
$6 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation over the possible hiring of Jackson was commonplace  
this season while the Knicks were struggling, and center Patrick 
Ewing said he would demand a trade rather than play for Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shocks me,'' Ewing said of the meeting between Checketts  
and Jackson, which the Times said was also attended by Jackson's 
agent, Todd Musburger. ``I've said it. I'm not playing for Phil 
Jackson. There's no way. They can trade me if they get Phil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New Jersey Nets are among the other teams interested in  
hiring Jackson, who took a year off from basketball after leading 
the Bulls to the championship last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts, through a spokesman, denied that any meeting with  
Jackson or his representatives took place -- as did Musburger. 
Jackson could not be reached, and Van Gundy declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Could Be Out Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mike Tyson could get out of jail as early as  
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion was granted parole Friday, with  
his release to take place no later than June 4. Indiana authorities 
could give their required approval of the decision as early as 
Monday, allowing Tyson to go home for the first time since he was 
sentenced Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland Parole Commission voted 5-1 to grant Tyson's  
release, saying it wanted to kept a tight reign on him. Had Tyson 
served out his term, he would have been placed immediately on 
probation rather than on the stricter terms of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 reason for release is to assure that Mr. Tyson will  
reintegrate safely into society and follow the general rules of his 
parole,'' the commission said. ``He needs to be supervised and held 
accountable to public standards of conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Shelley Finkel, when asked when Tyson might fight again,  
said, ``I can't tell you when until he gets out and I sit down and 
talk with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has three fights remaining on a deal with the MGM Grand in  
Las Vegas and at least three more fights with Showtime, Finkel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	With good behavior, Tyson would have been released from the  
Rockville, Md., jail in September had he not been granted parole. 
He will now be on parole until September, followed by two years' 
probation that includes 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected it,'' said Douglas Gansler, state's attorney for  
Montgomery County. ``He's being treated like everyone else would be 
treated with the same criminal history and the same criminal 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like he's now sort of scot-free. He will still be  
under parole, and he's going to be under the auspices of the 
criminal justice system for the next two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson last fought Jan. 16 and he was behind on all three cards  
before he stopped Francois Botha in the fifth round at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	He was tentatively scheduled to fight again April 24 against an  
undetermined opponent, but was then was sentenced to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	The Botha fight was Tyson's first since his license was restored  
by Nevada boxing authorities on Oct. 19. The license had been 
revoked after he was disqualified for biting Evander Holyfield ears 
June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson pleaded no-contest to misdemeanor assault charges  
following a minor traffic accident in suburban Gaithersburg, Md., 
in August. He was sentenced to one year in the Montgomery County 
jail, and 60 days were later added as punishment for violating 
probation for a 1992 rape conviction in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his sentence, Tyson spent five days in solitary  
confinement for throwing a TV in a jail recreation room. His 
lawyers said Tyson had not received his antidepressant medication 
for several days before the outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson has also undergone counseling while in jail. His  
medication was changed, and he has been studying for a high school 
equivalency diploma.

<HEADLINE> 1998 Hurricane Season One of Worst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The 1998 Atlantic hurricane season started slow, but became one  
of the deadliest on record. Of 14 named storms, nine became 
hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tropical Storm Alex (July 27-Aug. 2): Never threatened land.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Hurricane Bonnie (Aug. 19-30): Danced around the U.S.  
coastline before hitting North Carolina with wind gusts up to 100 
mph, caused $1 billion damage. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tropical Storm Charley (Aug. 21-Aug. 22): Made landfall in  
Texas, causing flooding inland and killing at least 19 people. 
Eighteen inches of rain fell in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hurricane Daniel (Aug. 24-Sept. 3.): With 100 mph winds, it  
came within 455 miles west of Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hurricane Earl (Aug. 31-Sept. 3): Dumped nearly 2 feet of rain  
on the Florida Panhandle with 80 mph winds. About $25 million in 
insured losses and three reported deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tropical Storm Frances (Sept. 8-11): Flooded more than 300  
miles of Gulf Coast from Texas to Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hurricane Georges (Sept. 15-29): A Category 4 storm with  
maximum sustained winds near 150 mph. Killed more than 500 people 
in Haiti and the Dominican Republic and destroyed $2 billion in 
insured property in four Gulf Coast states and the Caribbean. There 
was $250 million in damage to the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tropical Storm Hermine (Sept. 17-20): Never threatened land.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Hurricane Ivan (Sept. 20-26): Posed threat to the Azores.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Hurricane Jeanne (Sept. 21-30): Never moved out of the eastern  
Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hurricane Karl (Sept. 25-27): Never threatened land but was  
historic because it marked the first time since 1893 that the 
Atlantic-Gulf regions played host to four hurricanes at once. 
Georges, Ivan and Jeanne were the other three. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hurricane Lisa (Oct. 5-9): Never threatened land.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Hurricane Mitch (Oct. 22-Nov. 6): The third deadliest  
hurricane on record. A Category 5 storm with sustained winds over 
155 mph. It stalled over Honduras, causing at least 10,000 deaths 
in Central America. It reformed in the Gulf as a tropical storm and 
tracked a path through the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tropical Storm Nicole (Nov. 24): Never threatened land.

<HEADLINE> Lucci Breaks Emmy Losing Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Buy that lottery ticket and bet on the Boston  
Red Sox to win the World Series. If Susan Lucci can win, anything 
is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Daytime television's most notorious losing streak was broken  
Friday night when Lucci -- the villainous Erica Kane on ``All My 
Children'' -- was finally handed a Daytime Emmy Award for best 
actress at the 26th annual show. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen times before she was nominated and failed to win, but  
the 19th time proved the charm. She sobbed as she received a 
standing ovation 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you very much. I truly never believed that this would  
happen,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly a sentimental favorite, Lucci was thought to have her  
best chance in years after submitting to judges a tape of her 
performance in a hospital vigil over her anorexic TV daughter, 
Bianca. 
</P>
<P>
	When producers tried to cut off her acceptance speech, the  
audience at New York's Theater at Madison Square Garden howled in 
protest and Lucci plowed on. She had two decades worth of thank 
yous, most poignantly to her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't meant to get this award before tonight, because if I  
had, I wouldn't have had that collection of poems and letters and 
drawings and balloons and chocolate cake you made me all this time 
to make me feel better,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tears welling up again, she promised her fans that she would  
``try my best never to let you down. I'm going to go back to that 
studio Monday and I'm going to play Erica Kane for all it is 
worth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lucci's win overshadowed a record-setting performance by  
``General Hospital,'' which won eight awards. Rosie O'Donnell was 
named best talk show host and her program best talk show. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the sixth time ``General Hospital'' was named best soap  
opera. Anthony Geary, who won best actor in 1982 when his character 
Luke Spencer was a national sensation, won for the second time. 
Jonathan Jackson, who plays his son Lucky, won best younger actor 
for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
	And Stuart Damon of ``General Hospital,'' himself nominated  
seven times before for best supporting actor without winning, took 
home a trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got to play the oldest, fattest drug addict in the history  
of television,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Emmys capped a stressful week for O'Donnell, who had a tense  
fight with actor Tom Selleck over gun control on her show. She 
twice paid tribute to Oprah Winfrey, who took herself out of the 
running after winning best talk show host seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I one day hope to move through life with the grace and dignity  
of that woman -- Oprah Winfrey,'' said O'Donnell, as tears streamed 
down her face. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Barker, host of ``The Price is Right,'' was given a lifetime  
achievement award and ended a personal Emmy boycott. He's stayed 
away for the past two years, convinced the Emmy Awards weren't 
treating game shows with enough respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker has been on ``The Price is Right'' since 1972, and was  
host of ``Truth or Consequences'' for 18 years before that. He's 
been named best game show host a record 10 times. O'Donnell ordered 
Barker to ``come on down'' for his award. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had a refrigerator for every one of you,'' Barker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Stein and Jimmy Kimmel, hosts of Comedy Central's irreverent  
``Win Ben Stein's Money,'' won their first Emmys. It was also named 
best game show, beating more established fare like ``Jeopardy'' and 
``Wheel of Fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kimmel handed his trophy to an embarrassed Lucci, before she won  
her own. ``I can't in good conscience take this with Susan Lucci 
standing here with nothing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Young and the Restless'' won a total of six awards,  
including Heather Tom as younger actress and Sharon Case as 
supporting actress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney Presents Bill Nye the Science Guy'' won its first award  
for best childrens' series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Emmys snubbed top-rated Jerry Springer and his raucous talk  
show. The winners are selected by members of the National Academy 
of Television Arts and Sciences and the Academy of Television Arts 
and Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Unions Seek Tribal Casino Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a move reminiscent of the labor campaigns  
that empowered auto, steel and farm workers decades ago, unions are 
trying to organize employees at casinos on Indian reservations, a 
campaign that could test the limits of tribal sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian casinos have witnessed striking growth over the past 10  
years, pulling tribes out of poverty and creating jobs for an 
estimated 80,000 Indians and others. Unlike other employees, 
though, workers on reservations are not protected by U.S. labor 
law, including the right to organize, since reservations are 
nominally independent. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome of the organizing may help define a muddled concept  
that has challenged courts and lawmakers since tribal treaties were 
first signed centuries ago: What rights come with Indian 
sovereignty? 
</P>
<P>
	``These workers exist in this legal no-man's land,'' said John  
Wilhelm, national president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant 
Employees Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts are under way to organize workers in California,  
Connecticut and Wisconsin, although unions have only now begun to 
make their presence felt at some of the nation's 310 Indian 
casinos. Across the country, tribal gambling is the nation's 
fastest-growing gaming sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders say that if tribes won't let them organize, they  
may pursue federal legislation that would bring labor law -- such as 
a minimum wage -- to the reservations. Many tribes would see such a 
move as a violation of their independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilhelm, whose union is the most active, compared the effort to  
the groundbreaking campaigns in the 1930s to organize auto and 
steel workers -- creating the modern labor movement -- and in the 
1960s to organize farm workers that led to Cesar Chavez's United 
Farm Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Like those eras, the movement is trying to form unions where  
none exist. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the tribes have shown some willingness to at least  
negotiate with unions, although not with the hotel and restaurant 
workers union, which has waged a costly legal battle with a 
coalition of California tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders insist they are not opposed to unions. The Viejas  
Band of Kumeyaay Indians, for instance, agreed to let the 
Communication Workers of America organize at its casino, northeast 
of San Diego, and the majority of the food, beverage, housekeeping 
and maintenance employees voted for a union earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations are under way between that union and other tribes,  
including the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Manuel casino was the site of a scuffle in February  
between tribal security and organizers of the hotel and restaurant 
union. The organizers claim they were beaten when they tried to 
speak with workers, and have filed a civil lawsuit against the 
security officers. 
</P>
<P>
	San Manuel Vice Chairman Ken Ramirez described the lawsuit as  
frivolous. San Manuel provides employees with excellent benefits, 
``one of the most generous of any employer'' in the region, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue at hand has never been with labor but only with (the  
union) as they attempt to force our employees to submission by 
using strong-arm and scare tactics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other tribal leaders insist their employees are well taken care  
of and they resent efforts by the hotel and restaurant union to 
make the right to organize a component of the gambling agreements 
required between states and tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some disgruntled employees disagree. They echo labor leaders'  
concerns that an impartial body should look out for workers and 
handle complaints. Currently, the employer and the tribe are one 
and the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Others complain of a lack of sick leave, high costs for health  
insurance and forced overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the union can help you to stop the discrimination  
at work,'' said Isidro Ramirez, a 33-year-old dishwasher and cook 
at the Pechanga casino in Temeculah, between Los Angeles and San 
Diego. ``I want the company to respect us and to let us work in a 
free environment. The same rights that they should have, we also 
should have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez makes $7.35 an hour at the casino and speaks no English.  
He said workers have been told not to speak Spanish or to talk to 
union organizers, and he fears getting fired without recourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Macarro, Pechanga tribal chairman, did not return repeated  
phone calls from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut state Sen. Edith Prague has heard similar complaints  
from workers in that state, where the hotel and restaurant union is 
working to organize the Foxwoods Resort Casino, the country's 
largest Indian casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had workers call me and say, 'Why do I pay taxes to the  
state of Connecticut if I lose my rights when I step onto the 
reservation,''' said Prague, a Democrat. ``I'm not opposed to 
sovereignty as long as it is used as a tool and not a weapon.''

<HEADLINE> Social Security Measure Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans who control Congress are  
determined to end decades of raids on the Social Security trust 
fund by locking the money away under strict congressional control, 
the GOP said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., promised in the party's weekly radio  
address Congress would pass the so-called Social Security Lock Box 
bill this week. The legislation is intended to prevent the 
administration and others from raiding the fund to pay for other 
programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the first time that Congress has guaranteed the  
Social Security trust fund is to be used only for the popular 
national pension system, Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under current law, the president can simply issue IOUs to the  
Social Security trust fund, while he spends this money for other 
things,'' Rogan said. ``This is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP proposal would require two-thirds approval from Congress  
to use any of the $1.8 trillion in projected Social Security 
surpluses over the next decade for anything other than Social 
Security or Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a high threshold to make sure we only spend those  
dollars on real emergencies,'' Rogan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Social Security and Medicare are in jeopardy of financial  
insolvency as baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
	In Winterset, Iowa, GOP presidential hopeful John Kasich,  
chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he is working on a 
plan to save Social Security that may require ``some sacrifice'' 
from the baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, to be announced within two weeks, will include private  
investment of some money now collected in Social Security taxes, 
the Ohio congressman said. But considering how many are nearing the 
age to begin withdrawing pensions, he said, private investment may 
not be enough to save the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be some sacrifice involved,'' Kasich said. ``The  
question is, when do we phase this program in. It may be that the 
baby boomers take a hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan said the ``lock-box'' concept would be a major departure  
for Congress from its four decades under Democratic control. 
</P>
<P>
	``On their 40-year watch, not one dime was locked away. They  
spent that trust fund like a drunken sailor on shore leave,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have balked at the proposal, which they say would give  
Congress too many loopholes to get at the money. They blocked a 
similar measure in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Saturday the Clinton  
administration opposes both the House and Senate versions of the 
``lock-box'' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite rhetoric on both sides of the aisle to protect Social  
Security, Congress sent President Clinton a bill just last week 
that dips into the trust fund for $15 billion in ``emergency'' 
spending. The package included more than $12 billion for the Balkan 
war and other military purposes, or almost twice what Clinton 
requested to finance the campaign of airstrikes in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton signed the bill Friday but complained of its  
``unnecessary and ill-advised special projects'' lawmakers included 
in it. 
</P>
<P>
	Safeguarding Social Security has become a rallying cry for  
Republicans, eager to push forward an issues agenda that would 
overshadow their role in Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogan, a House manager in the impeachment trial, could face an  
election challenge next year from Democrats. He won a second term 
last year with just 50.2 percent of the vote in his Pasadena-area 
district, which voted for Clinton in 1992 and 1996.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Play Jazz Today in Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- With one missed shot, the Utah Jazz  
watched their homecourt advantage evaporate against the Portland 
Trail Blazers. Another loss, and Utah's championship homes will be 
put in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, they have played a lot better overall than we have in  
this series,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said as Utah prepared for 
today's Game 3. ``We're going to have to improve a whole lot to 
compete up there, or they're going to have to get a lot worse, and 
I don't think that's likely to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Stockton's missed drive at the end of Game 2 Thursday night  
let the Blazers escape Utah with an 84-81 victory that evened the 
best-of-7 Western Conference semifinals 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, which came after Portland nearly blew a fourth-quarter  
lead for the second time in the series, also boosted the Blazers' 
already abundant confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not go into Utah saying to ourselves, `How are we going  
to win? Can we win?' '' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said Friday 
after winning the NBA Coach of the Year award. ``We believed that 
we could win. We know we can win every game we play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland won 22 of the 25 games it played at home during the  
regular season, with one of those losses coming to the Jazz in 
mid-March, 91-77. In the playoffs, Utah has lost its last seven 
games in Portland. Its last win here was in a first-round series in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no doubt we can win one or two of those games up  
there, if we don't turn the ball over and play the kind of defense 
we're capable of,'' Stockton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers led 73-64 with 5:13 to play before the Jazz rallied  
behind Stockton and Jeff Hornacek. Their consecutive 3-pointers 
closed Utah to 82-81 with 12 seconds left. Portland's Greg Anthony 
made one of two free throws with 10 seconds left, setting up 
Stockton's miss. It appeared that he might have been fouled by Jim 
Jackson, but the officials let the play stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the shot we wanted,'' Stockton said. ``I just should  
have made it. We don't make excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sometimes hot-headed Blazers kept their cool, unlike Tuesday  
night's opener, in which Rasheed Wallace was called for a flagrant 
foul on Bryon Russell. Wallace threw a tantrum, was called for a 
technical, and the Jazz scored four points on the possession to tie 
the game at 78-all. They didn't trail again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there was a lot of growing up that happened,'' Blazers  
power forward Brian Grant said of Game 2. ``We wanted the Jazz to 
have to beat us with their offense, or for them to have to do 
something spectacular. Which they almost did, with all the 
3-pointers they hit down the backstretch. But we were able to hold 
them off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said the Blazers planned in today's game to exploit their  
quickness advantage in the paint, even though Utah center Greg 
Ostertag has played better this series after a poor opening round 
against Sacramento. In Game 1 against the Blazers, he had six 
points and six rebounds, and he grabbed 14 rebounds Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg has had two pretty good games, which is nice because  
Arvydas Sabonis is a tough matchup for him,'' Jazz coach Jerry 
Sloan said. ``He's being conscientious about his rebounding, and 
he's doing some good things on defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have to play better against Isaiah Rider, who continued  
his playoff surge with a career postseason high 27 points Thursday 
night. He's averaging 19.8 points in the playoffs, and is taxing 
the Jazz defense by hitting from the outside and driving the ball 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, I thought I played pretty good defense,''  
Hornacek said. ``I don't know how much more we could have done, 
unless it was making somebody else take the shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone, third in the league in playoff scoring at 23.9,  
behind only Allen Iverson (28.5) and Shaquille O'Neal (25.8), said 
the Jazz can't repeat their 18-turnover performance if they hope to 
win in Portland and take back homecourt advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put ourselves in a hole, and now we have to dig ourselves  
out,'' he said. ``You can't be intimidated now. They came into our 
place, they wanted to get a game, and they did. Now we have to go 
to their place. To win it, we have to win on their floor.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Areas Gird for New Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Eight months after Hurricane Georges sent  
a neighbor's fishing boat crashing through his living room wall, 
John Strock is still sleeping in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
	The waterfront cottage his father built hasn't been repaired  
since the storm rumbled through on Sept. 25, and Strock's 
neighborhood in Big Pine Key, just off the Florida Keys' Overseas 
Highway, still looks like a garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was just basically destroyed,'' said Strock, 64.  
``The water heater was found down the street. They say we're at the 
top of the list for repairs, but it's starting to get hot and the 
new season is approaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another six-month Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1, and  
some areas of the Florida Keys, Honduras, Haiti and the Dominican 
Republic hit by last year's monster storms are unprepared for 
another round that could be equally brutal. 
</P>
<P>
	After one of the deadliest seasons on record, hurricane  
forecasters say cyclical changes such as African rainfall and ocean 
temperatures could signal an upswing of storm activity not seen for 
50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	And La Nina, the weather phenomenon believed to contribute to an  
increase in hurricanes that make landfall, will continue well into 
the season. La Nina turns the Pacific Ocean waters colder and plays 
the same weather tricks in reverse -- rain where it was dry and vice 
versa. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been saying for several years we may be heading  
back to a period like the '40s and '50s when we really had heavy 
hurricane seasons -- a lot of major hurricanes,'' said Jerry 
Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``I 
think it's no longer speculation. I think we are in it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The period from 1995 to '98 yielded 53 named storms, 33 of them  
gaining hurricane status, 15 rising to the level of a major 
hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	William Gray, the Colorado State University professor noted for  
his accuracy in forecasting hurricane frequency, has never 
predicted a season with more than 11 named storms -- until this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, Gray predicts 14 storms strong enough to be named --  
nine hurricanes, four of them major. Gray will update his 
prediction the first week of June. If the forecast is accurate, the 
hope is that the big hurricanes will at least stay over water. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposite happened last season when Georges, a Category 4  
storm with maximum sustained winds near 150 mph, went 
island-hopping through the Caribbean in late September. More than 
500 people lost their lives in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, along came Mitch -- a monstrous Category 5 storm  
that stalled off the coast of Honduras. The toll: at least 10,000 
dead and 2 million homeless in Honduras and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of casualties,'' Jarrell said, ``it looks like now  
it's probably the worst year since 1780'' -- when a hurricane killed 
at least 22,000 people on Martinique, Barbados and surrounding 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nicaragua, recent spring rains uncovered the bones of those  
buried in mudslides. Many Hondurans have been left to rebuild homes 
on the banks of the same rivers that flooded and unleashed deadly 
mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people should pay attention to the sounds of the hills  
and mountains,'' said Oscar Triminio of the Honduras fire 
department. ``Only by doing that will they avoid dying covered by 
mud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Caribbean Sea in the Dominican Republic, officials'  
slow response to Georges may have cost hundreds of lives. In the 
disaster's wake, Chicago Cubs baseball star Sammy Sosa collected 
more aid money than his native country's government. He sent 
planeloads of food and medical supplies to his hometown of San 
Pedro de Macoris. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lower Florida Keys, people are still wrestling with  
insurance companies and trying to replace or repair their homes. 
Relief workers say they can only hope a hurricane doesn't find the 
lower Keys for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like to say I pray more than I used to, but I'm going  
to really pray through this hurricane season,'' said Suzanne Lex, 
coordinator of Paradise Interfaith Network which formed to help 
Georges' victims rebuild in the Keys. About 125 families are still 
receiving assistance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Keys remain one of the most vulnerable places for a  
hurricane. Georges had weakened by the time it reached the United 
States, but had it been even slightly stronger there could have 
been deaths, Jarrell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got really lucky,'' he said. ``If we had a Category 3 or 4  
storm I think we would have lost a whole bunch of people in Key 
West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the 77,000 year-round residents of the Keys,  
as well as some tourists, refused to heed the evacuation order. 
Nearly 30,000 people bore out the storm in Key West -- the 
southernmost island in the delicate chain, and a tourist mecca. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrell said people are afraid to leave for fear of being  
stranded when the storm hits on the two-lane, 110-mile Overseas 
Highway, the only highway through the Keys. He worries some people 
won't leave before the next hurricane because they had so much 
trouble returning to their homes on the clogged highway after 
Georges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we can get something done about that road we are  
destined sooner or later to kill a bunch of people,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 11 People Named National Treasures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan has recognized 11 people as living national  
treasures, among them a 90-year old woman who practices a dyeing 
and weaving technique unique to the southern island of Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Sada Yonamine, whose craft is called ``yundanza hanaui,'' became  
the oldest person to be named a living national treasure when the 
Education Ministry made the announcement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacquer artist Fumio Mae, 58, also was named a living treasure,  
becoming the youngest person to receive the designation. 
</P>
<P>
	Other artists recognized include Komanosuke Takemoto, 63, a  
singer of narrative chants to accompany traditional Japanese puppet 
theater; Reibo Aoki, 63, a player of the ``shakuhachi'' bamboo 
flute; and Senzo Nishikawa, 70, a Kabuki dancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 bring to 104 the number of living national treasures. A  
total of 265 people have been named since the recognition program 
was started in February 1955 as a way to pass on to future 
generations skills necessary preserve traditional arts. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the 11 artists will receive $16,000 a year to help them  
practice their craft and train successors.

<HEADLINE> 'Nick at Nite' Announces New Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Maude'' is back in the spotlight, and Beatrice  
Arthur thinks she knows why: It's still relevant today, she says, 
21 years after it left the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's adult, and it's literate,'' says Arthur, 73. ``And it's  
full of people who question things. Young people like anything that 
questions the old values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur joined stars from top 1970s sitcoms -- Loni Anderson and  
Howard Hesseman of ``WKRP in Cincinnati'' and John Ritter and Don 
Knotts of ``Three's Company'' -- at a luncheon Friday to introduce 
the new lineup for the nostalgia-television programming on 
Nickelodeon's ``Nick at Nite'' and its sister channel, TV Land. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maude'' begins airing in August on TV Land.  
</P>
<P>
	A spinoff of Norman Lear's lauded ``All in the Family,''  
``Maude'' ran from 1972 to 1978 on CBS. starring Arthur as Edith 
Bunker's liberal cousin, Maude Findlay. The show, though a comedy, 
became a vehicle for issues TV had long avoided, such as abortion, 
alcoholism, homosexuality and racial tension. 
</P>
<P>
	``Norman Lear was a pioneer. We had great actors --  
theater-trained actors -- and wonderful directing,'' Arthur says.

	Clinton Urges Greater Gun Control  
</P>
<P>
	IRVINGTON, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton tonight said that the  
key to reducing youth violence lies in the family and community. 
Speaking at Sons of Italy Foundation's annual dinner, Clinton 
called on parents to lead by example and show the country's 
children the evils of prejudice. He asked the audience to provide 
``every decent person a home in America'' and cited NATO's mission 
against Yugoslavia as an example of living by such values. Earlier 
today, Clinton pressed the House for swift passage of gun-control 
legislation. Senators approved legislation last week that would 
require safety locks on new handguns, ban violent juveniles from 
purchasing a firearm, and stop the import of large ammunition 
clips.

tribes today to celebrate their first successful whale hunt since 
the 1920s. On Monday, a crew from the tribe killed a gray whale 
using a harpoon and a .50 caliber rifle. The kill renewed a 
tradition guaranteed by the tribe's 1855 treaty but abandoned 
decades ago when commercial whaling decimated the species. 
Anti-whaling activists contend such hunting is illegal and fear it

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The ``Mona Lisa'' smiled to an empty room today as  
striking workers kept tourists and art lovers out of many Paris 
museums and monuments for a fourth day. The Louvre remained closed, 
as did the Arc de Triomphe and the Pantheon, the resting place of 
France's greatest minds, union leaders said. Unions representing 
the employees are set to meet Tuesday to decide whether to continue 
their walkout.

	LAGUNA HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The husband and 8-year-old daughter  
of the late Florence Griffith Joyner helped unveil a statue in 
memory of the three-time Olympic gold medalist. ``Seeing it and 
feeling it, I almost think it's her. (But) all I have is her 
spirit,'' Al Joyner, accompanied by daughter Mary, said yesterday. 
The statue depicts the world's fastest female sprinter with hands 
raised in victory as she crossed the finish line in the 100 meters 
at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

	DALLAS (AP) -- A period after having a possible goal waved off,  
Valeri Kamensky rebounded his own miss with 5:58 left to give 
Colorado a 2-1 victory over Dallas in the opening game of the 
Western Conference finals tonight. The Avalanche improved to 7-0 on 
the road this postseason and won their fifth straight since being 
down 0-2 to Detroit in the second round. The Stars had won their 
first five playoff games in Reunion Arena.

<HEADLINE> McKillop To Stay at Davidson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIDSON, N.C. (AP) -- Bob McKillop will remain men's basketball  
coach at Davidson after weighing an offer to take a similar post at 
Stony Brook. 
</P>
<P>
	McKillop said Friday he decided to stay with the Wildcats after  
being pursued by the Long Island school and athletic director 
Richard Laskowski, a longtime friend of McKillop's. 
</P>
<P>
	McKillop, a former New York resident, said he contemplated the  
situation more seriously than any other offer in his 10 seasons at 
Davidson. McKillop, who was a serious candidate for the St. John's 
opening before last season, said the chance to work with Laskowski 
was tempting. 
</P>
<P>
	McKillop did not receive a contract extension or raise at  
Davidson, but was given reassurances by school officials about the 
direction of the program and the school's financial commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely delighted not only that Bob will continue as  
head coach but that the conversation surrounding this process has 
yielded long-term stability for our basketball program and for Bob 
himself,'' Davidson athletics director Jim Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	McKillop has compiled a 154-131 record while building one of the  
strongest programs in the Southern Conference. Davidson won the 
league championship and the automatic NCAA berth in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Stony Brook will begin its first season in Division I in  
1999-2000 and does not have a conference affiliation.

<HEADLINE> Indians, Tigers Get Into Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Manny Ramirez was ejected following a brawl in  
the bottom of the sixth inning Saturday as the Cleveland Indians 
and Detroit Tigers exchanged beanballs, pushes and shoves. 
</P>
<P>
	In the top of the sixth, Cleveland starter Jaret Wright, who was  
suspended earlier this season for a brawl in Boston, hit Tony Clark 
in the helmet one batter after giving up a two-run double to Dean 
Palmer that put the Tigers ahead 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, leading off the bottom of the inning, was then hit in  
the head by Detroit rookie Jeff Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez shouted at Weaver as he slowly walked toward first base  
before dashing across the diamond after the right-hander. He was 
met on top of the pitching mound by umpire Jim Evans, who put his 
hands out like a traffic cop in an attempt to stop Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Both benches and bullpens emptied and several small skirmishes  
broke out before order was restored. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ramirez was ejected, plate umpire Chuck Meriwether warned  
both teams about any further retaliation, but that didn't stop 
Wright from coming inside with a pitch to Juan Encarnacion in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eighth, Tigers reliever C.J. Nitkowski knocked Kenny  
Lofton down with his first -- and only -- pitch and was immediately 
tossed.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Students Return to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Students returning to Heritage High School  
on Saturday to collect books, bags and jackets they left during 
last week's shooting said they encountered an eerily calm campus. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time students were allowed back since Thursday,  
when a sophomore began firing a rifle into a commons area, wounding 
six. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was sort of an eeriness that came over you, knowing that  
there was somebody in your school shooting,'' said Alexis Diamond, 
a 16-year-old sophomore who had gone to retrieve her jacket from a 
science classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile the fifth of the six shooting victims was released  
from the hospital. The only student still hospitalized, a 
15-year-old girl, was in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Heritage, the campus was a picture of calm as a platoon  
of groundskeepers with weed whackers and riding mowers were the 
only break in the silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said that investigators had left bags on classroom  
floors and coats on chairs, general disarray that contributed to 
their unease. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was weird, knowing what happened just 48 hours ago,'' Fawn  
DeRosia, 17, said after getting her books. ``I'm shaking right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims, Cania Cullins, 15, was released Saturday  
from Rockdale Hospital where she had been treated for a bullet 
wound in the back of her knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Seated in a wheelchair with a gold Winnie the Pooh bear on her  
lap, a gift from her pastor, Miss Cullins said she has no animosity 
toward Thomas Solomon Jr., the 15-year-old suspect charged in the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do forgive him,'' Miss Cullins said at a brief news  
conference, sitting beside her mother. ``I'll keep him in my 
prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Understanding didn't come so easily for senior Bonnie Jones, who  
described her school's mood as ``very melancholy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still angry,'' Miss Jones said after collecting papers she  
needed for a class. ``This kid came in and took away the last day 
of my senior year. I worked 13 years for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School administrators have made finals exams optional. Many  
students said they anticipate the school's reopening Monday will be 
a time of tears, hugs and consolation. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Cullins' church, Church in the Now, celebrates its 14th  
anniversary Sunday. Miss Cullins was to be the star parishioner, 
arriving at the services in a stretch limousine dispatched for her 
by the church's pastor, Bishop Jim Swilley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just excited I'm not planning a funeral,'' Swilley said.

<HEADLINE> Severinsen Firm on Departing Pops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Three weeks of negotiations have failed to  
change Doc Severinsen's mind about quitting the Buffalo 
Philharmonic Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	The former leader of the Tonight Show Band, citing a dispute  
with management, quit last month after seven seasons as conductor 
of the orchestra's Pops program. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some issues beyond both Doc's and the BPO's control  
which simply could not be resolved,'' Robert Greene, chairman of 
the Orchestra Society, told The Buffalo News. 
</P>
<P>
	Severinsen said last month that his differences began when the  
orchestra's new executive director, Lawrence Ribits, said he wanted 
to replace two consultants who marketed Severinsen's popular 
concerts last year with an in-house marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
	The consultants, Linda Schineller and Paula Blanchard, resigned  
at the end of April. Severinsen followed suit.

<HEADLINE> Youth Home Owner Pleads on Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASPER, Wyo. (AP) -- A man who operated a makeshift home for  
troubled families with his wife has pleaded guilty to abusing a 
10-year-old boy who authorities said was locked in a box and 
repeatedly beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis Beaugureau, 43, and his wife Robin, 38, were arrested in  
December for the alleged harsh treatment of needy children and 
parents at the couple's Emmanuel Marantha Youth Ranch, an 
unlicensed facility on four ramshackle acres of rocky, barren range 
land east of Casper. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beaugureaus shared food, shelter and religious beliefs with  
those who sought refuge there in exchange for help with chores. But 
families later told authorities that the couple were frequently 
abusive disciplinarians. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaugureau faces up to five years in prison after pleading  
guilty Friday to locking a 10-year-old boy in a small metal box in 
the couple's closet every night for a month as punishment for 
sneaking food. Authorities said the boy was also beaten repeatedly 
between July 1995 and October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Beaugureau has pleaded innocent to related charges and is  
awaiting trial pending the completion of psychological tests. 
Prosecutors allege she sometimes used a belt, a plastic bat and 
cooking spoons to beat the boy's mother, and is also charged with 
abusing a 13-year-old girl who told authorities she was hit ``too 
many times to count'' in January 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beaugureaus each remain free on $5,000 bond. A sentencing  
date for Beaugureau has not been set.

<HEADLINE> Candidate Gore Addresses Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told University of  
New Hampshire graduates today to heal their communities and work 
hard to prevent violence. 
</P>
<P>
	During speeches at the university, and later at Dover High  
School, Gore was riding high on his tie-breaking vote in the Senate 
on Thursday to tighten gun control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just a couple of days ago I cast a tie-breaking vote,'' he  
told the invitation-only audience of about 100 people at Dover High 
before being cut off by applause. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, now awaiting House action, expands criminal background  
checks to include firearm purchases made at gun shows and 
pawnshops. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said that although guns are not solely responsible for  
school violence, their danger cannot be ignored. Pupils no longer 
settle their differences with just fist fights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If kids are mad enough, it's easy to get access to guns,''  
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and students in Dover are all too well aware of what  
happens when teen-agers aren't able to control themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his efforts to tighten gun control laws, Gore said  
people hoping to stop school violence must not focus exclusively on 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The two boys who shot and killed 12 fellow students, a teacher  
and themselves in Colorado were influenced by hateful and violent 
messages, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the average American high school graduate has seen  
roughly 20,000 murders on television and in films. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of (those images) take root and bear bitter fruit,'' Gore  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But parents have powerful tools to help battle the blitz of  
media images of violence, he said, including Internet filtering 
programs and the television V-chip.

<HEADLINE> Germany Marks 50 Yrs. As Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Few nations have matched Germany's achievements of  
the last 50 years. Destroyed physically, economically and morally 
by World War II, the nation rebuilt itself as one of the West's 
strongest democracies and economies. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Germany celebrates 50 years as a democratic Federal  
Republic on Monday, half a century's successes are being 
overshadowed by events of the past two months: The decision to 
deploy fighter pilots in the air campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	An overwhelming 75 percent of Germans say they are happy with  
how their country has turned out. But their pride is being muted by 
a strain in German society over the bombing campaign and the 
memories it evokes of Hitler's brutal war. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, one of Europe's strongest  
backers of the air campaign, acknowledges the conflicting emotions 
caused by Germany's evolving role in world conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pride in our constitution, in our beloved democracy, in  
the economic, social and cultural achievements of our citizens must 
not blind us to the fact that our country faces difficult 
challenges,'' Schroeder said in a statement released ahead of 
Monday's celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Germany has a growing international responsibility to new,  
painful decisions and important tasks,'' he said. ``The Kosovo 
crisis is not the first to show that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pundits say Germany's participation in the NATO attacks mark a  
return to ``normalcy'' after decades at the fringes of power. 
Indeed, evidence of Germany's achievements are in abundance as the 
nation marks 50 years of postwar democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Across from the Reichstag, where the republic's founding will be  
celebrated Monday, steel girders outlining the new chancellory 
herald the capital's rebirth in a zone razed by Allied bombs during 
World War II and abandoned as a Cold War no-man's land between East 
and West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany is surrounded completely by friends and allies for the  
first time. Its wartime enemies have become its closest allies in 
the NATO military alliance and the European Union. The German mark 
quickly grew to be one of the world's strongest currencies and was 
the model for the new euro -- which Germany is adopting with 10 
other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision, however, has emphasized Germany's struggle with its  
renewed self-confidence as much as its role in the Kosovo crisis. 
Politicians increasingly cite Germany's special responsibility to 
prevent ethnic atrocities from being repeated in Europe to justify 
contributing pilots to the NATO force. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone accepts the argument. The Kosovo debate has  
even penetrated the election Sunday of Germany's largely ceremonial 
president in the protest candidacy of Uta Ranke-Heinemann. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranke-Heinemann, 71, is the daughter of former President Gustav  
Heinemann, and is better known as a controversial Catholic 
theologian forbidden by the Vatican from teaching because she 
questioned the virgin birth. 
</P>
<P>
	She has no chance of succeeding outgoing President Roman Herzog  
and accepted the nomination by the ex-communist Party of Democratic 
Socialism as a platform to speak out against the NATO campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's next president will in all likelihood be Johannes Rau,  
backed by both governing coalition partners. Governor of North 
Rhine-Westphalia state for nearly two decades, the 68-year-old Rau 
is running against Dagmar Schipanski, a scientist from eastern 
Germany nominated by the opposition Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranke-Heinemann's outrage is rooted in her own teen-age years  
spent among the rubble left by American bombs in her native Essen. 
</P>
<P>
	Emotions suppressed then came to the surface, she said, when she  
watched the Persian Gulf War and now the Yugoslav attacks play out 
on television. 
</P>
<P>
	While she will attend the election at the Reichstag on Sunday,  
she declined an official invitation to attend a ceremony marking 
the Federal Republic's birth on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ashamed to celebrate 50 years as long as bombs provide  
music for the ceremony,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Strikes in Editorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia is  
working and will help establish a Europe that is peaceful, 
undivided and free, President Clinton said in an opinion piece in 
Sunday's New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been criticized by some in Congress for limiting the  
action in the region to air strikes and for not making plans for a 
ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he does not rule out other military options but  
said the current strategy is working and will succeed in restoring 
the people of Kosovo to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intolerable conditions the region finds itself in today  
are the result of a decadelong campaign by Slobodan Milosevic to 
build a greater Serbia by singling out whole peoples for 
destruction because of their ethnicity and faith,'' Clinton wrote 
in an article published on the Times' op-ed page. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are haunted by the images of people driven from their  
homes, pushing the elderly in wheelbarrows, telling stories of 
relatives murdered,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO action in the region is necessary because inaction  
would have posed a risk of a wider war, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the airstrikes have broad support in the alliance  
and afford the best opportunity to forge a long-term, positive 
relationship with Russia, which has been critical of the NATO 
action.

<HEADLINE> Houston's Perrot Recovering Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three months after brain surgery, Kim Perrot is  
cheering on the Houston Comets from the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday against the New York Liberty, the Comets will play  
their first game without Perrot since she was diagnosed with lung 
and brain cancer in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot had planned to travel to New York with the WNBA defending  
champion Comets for the exhibition game at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	But she decided against the trip Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``She didn't feel good enough to travel,'' Houston coach Van  
Chancellor said. ``She's in good spirits and upbeat. She's been at 
practice inspiring us at every turn. But I think it's hard for her 
to watch us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-5 point guard guided Houston to its second  
consecutive WNBA title in September. The 32-year-old Perrot had 
surgery to remove a golf ball-sized cancerous brain tumor and 
received radiation to shrink other brain tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent MRI showed the brain tumors were gone, said Houston  
media director Megan Bonifice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone will beat it, Kim will,'' said the Liberty's Teresa  
Weatherspoon, who played against Perrot in college in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have said the fact that the cancer did not originate in  
her brain makes that part of her illness easier to treat. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on the sidelines, Perrot provides leadership.  
</P>
<P>
	``She gets on us about defense, specifically,'' league MVP  
Cynthia Cooper said. ``She's the one that provides the spark and 
motivation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Rizzotti and Sonja Henning will compete for Perrot's  
starting guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely going to miss Kim at the beginning of the  
season,'' Sheryl Swoopes said. ``I love Jennifer and Sonja, they've 
been doing a good job for us. But Kim did so much. She would create 
for somebody else, penetrate and dish or make the extra pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's meant for her to come back and play, we'll be here  
supporting her. We'll definitely welcome her back with open arms. 
We just have to hope and pray for the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot decided to postpone chemotherapy for lung cancer so she  
can work on strength and conditioning, Bonifice said.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Eager for Soap Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Jesse Ventura confesses he has a soft  
spot for soap operas, so he's tickled at the prospect of appearing 
on ``The Young and The Restless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's governor says he got hooked on soaps during his days  
as a professional wrestler. He's been asked to play a bad guy 
dealing with the show's main character, Victor Newman. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing a villain appeals to Ventura, creatively.  
</P>
<P>
	``Being a good guy's boring,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The governor sees similarities between soaps, pro wrestling and  
politics when it comes to people changing from good to evil and 
back again. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to hate you before they can love you,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	No date had been chosen for the appearance, said governor's  
spokesman John Wodele. 
</P>
<P>
	``The understanding is we'll just wait for an appropriate time  
and place,'' Wodele said. ``It's something he'd like to do.''

<HEADLINE> Astros Place Caminiti on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Houston third baseman Ken Caminiti was  
placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday because of a strained 
right calf muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti hurt himself stealing a base in Friday night's 4-3 loss  
to the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros recalled infielder Daryle Ward to fill Caminiti's  
roster spot. Ward, who was batting .339 in 42 games at Triple-A New 
Orleans, will join the Astros in San Francisco in time for Sunday's 
series final. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti, batting .292 with two home runs and 17 RBIs, was hurt  
while stealing second. He appeared to cramp up shortly after 
driving off first base and grabbed his leg in pain as he neared 
second, managing to slide around shortstop Rich Aurilia's tag to 
complete the steal. 
</P>
<P>
	Caminiti limped off the field and into the club house for  
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty sore. I'm having a hard time walking,'' Caminiti  
said after the game. ``I'm having a hard time with this because I 
wanted to come back and have a healthy year. Now this same old 
stuff, it's just kind of making me mad right now.''

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO is saying it mistakenly hit an  
ethnic Albanian rebel base yesterday. Responding to the attack on a 
hilltop border post west of Kosovo's capital, Kosovo Liberation 
Army leader Hashim Thaci was conciliatory. Thaci told Associated 
Press Television News that despite the error, ``the NATO airstrikes 
must continue, even more intensified.'' The mistake caused at least 
one KLA death. The accidental attack was the latest in a string of 
errant strikes in the alliance's eight-week air campaign.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jurors voted 9-3 to convict Julie Hiatt Steele  
and prosecutor Kenneth Starr should ``seriously consider'' retrying 
the case, the jury foreman said today. Jack Hawxhurst said the 
evidence that Ms. Steele lied in Starr's investigation of President 
Clinton was ``very persuasive.'' The foreman said the vote to 
convict Ms. Steele was the same on each of the three charges of 
obstruction and one count of lying to the FBI. Starr has until 
Tuesday to decide whether to seek a retrial of Ms. Steele on 
charges of falsely undercutting Kathleen Willey's story of an 
unwanted sexual advance by Clinton. The first trial ended in a 
mistrial.

conflict. Jackson, who traveled to West Africa last week as special 
envoy for the United States, said a lack of concern for Africa has 
allowed the war to be ``fought in the dark'' for seven years. 
Earlier this month Jackson helped secure the release of three 
American servicemen held captive by Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Win Top Pick in NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) -- After the dismantling of their dynasty and  
the worst season in franchise history, the Chicago Bulls won the 
NBA draft lottery Saturday and earned the right to pick first in 
next month's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't win a whole lot of times,'' general manager Jerry  
Krause said after the Bulls' biggest win in the post-Michael Jordan 
era. ``It feels very good and I'm happy for our fans and owner, 
Jerry Reinsdorf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's fans and owners had very little to cheer about this  
season following the retirement of Jordan and the departures of 
Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud 
Buechler and Scott Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
	That left the Bulls with very little, and they showed as much in  
falling from three-time defending champions to a hapless team that 
posted a 13-37 record that was the third worst in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Krause refused to speculate on who the Bulls would take in the  
draft on June 30 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Most experts say there isn't a can't-miss player in the draft,  
but there are a couple of exciting underclassmen in Lamar Odom of 
Rhode Island and Corey Maggette of Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Vancouver, which posted the worst record in the NBA at 8-42, got  
the second pick while Charlotte, which had only a half of one 
percent chance of moving up from the 13th spot, beat the odds and 
got the No. 3 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Clippers, who won last year's lottery, were the  
big loser this year, slipping to No. 4 despite having the second 
worst record in the league at 9-41. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto, which owns the rights to Denver's first round choice  
because of a trade for Chauncey Billups, will draft No. 5 using the 
Nuggets' pick. The Raptors also have the 12th pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota will draft No. 6 using a pick acquired from New Jersey  
in the trade that sent Stephon Marbury to the Nets. Washington will 
draft seventh and will be followed by Boston, Phoenix, Golden 
State, Cleveland, Toronto and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has the right to take Boston's pick, and it is likely  
the Cavaliers will exercise that option.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Greater Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINGTON, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday pressed the  
House for swift passage of gun-control legislation, saying children 
should not have to worry that classmates might bring weapons to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators mindful of April's fatal shootings at a Littleton,  
Colo., high school approved legislation last week that would 
require safety locks on new handguns, ban violent juveniles from 
purchasing a firearm, and stop the import of large ammunition 
clips. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the House of Representatives will pass every one of  
these commonsense efforts that the Senate has passed to protect our 
children from guns,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. 
``And I hope they'll do it before school lets out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton met privately with Senate Democrats at an Irvington inn  
Saturday afternoon to thank them for voting for the gun-control 
bill and to discuss strategy on Kosovo, Social Security, Medicare 
and the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke for more than an hour, promising to present  
his plan to shore up the Medicare system next month and asking for 
help in shepherding his nominations to approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has sent 170 nominations to the Senate during the  
current Congress, White House spokesman Jake Siewert said, and only 
34 have been confirmed. None of his 38 nominees to be federal 
judges has received a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, Clinton played a round of golf with a group  
of senators before returning to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton visited  
Littleton's Columbine High School on Thursday, one month after two 
students killed 12 classmates and a teacher before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton visited with victims' families and other community  
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning of Clinton's departure for Colorado, a student in  
Conyers, Ga., opened fire at his high school, wounding several 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``No child should have to worry that a classmate is carrying a  
loaded gun to school. No parent should have to fear sending a child 
to school,'' Clinton said in his radio address. ``No American 
should tolerate this level of violence against our children. There 
is no task more urgent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lauded House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., for his  
support for requiring background checks on sales at gun shows and 
raise the age for handgun ownership to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, said in response to  
Clinton's remarks that ``some of the steps'' taken by the Senate 
``have some merit'' and the House ``will move to consider them as 
soon as possible. He urged the administration to step up 
enforcement of gun laws and offer ``a much more comprehensive 
solution to this cultural state of emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president did repeat his challenge to parents and the  
entertainment industry to take greater responsibility for the 
influence of violent images on children. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents must pay ``attention to the shows their children watch,  
the Web pages they visit, refusing to buy products that glorify 
violence,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted the average child sees 40,000 killings portrayed  
in the media by the time he or she reaches 18. 
</P>
<P>
	He has challenged Hollywood to refrain from showing guns in  
movie ads and previews, strictly enforce its ratings system in 
theaters, and re-evaluate the content allowed in PG-rated films. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't forget the children of Columbine and all the other  
children who were lost because their culture, their society is too 
violent, their laws too lax,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Chaplain To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After more than 20 years of prayers to open  
House sessions, House chaplain James D. Ford is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Minority Leader Dick  
Gephardt, D-Mo., announced Ford's decision in a joint statement 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our efforts to dissuade him have been unsuccessful,'' they  
said. ``We wish him God's speed as he ends his distinguished career 
in the House and looks forward to retirement and new adventures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, a Lutheran pastor, joined the House in 1979 after serving  
several years as senior chaplain at the U.S. Military Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	He will continue as House chaplain until a bipartisan search  
committee co-chaired by Reps. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., and Earl 
Pomeroy, D-N.D., selects a replacement.

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Drops Internet Chat Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Raytheon Co. has dropped a lawsuit against a group  
of people it believed were spreading company secrets in an 
anonymous Internet chat room -- after the defense contractor 
obtained their names. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 21 chatters were employees, and critics say the  
company used the court's power to chill free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems that the sole objective of Raytheon was to identify  
these individuals,'' said David Sobel of the Electronic Privacy 
Information Center, a Washington-based research group. ``It raises 
questions about the legitimacy of the way the court's discovery 
procedures were used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the workers quit, and Raytheon says the rest entered  
corporate ``counseling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt like our internal investigation had accomplished what  
we wanted it to accomplish. It was time to put the matter behind 
us,'' David Polk, a spokesman for the Lexington-based company, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to protecting proprietary information from  
being communicated on a public forum. We think we've done that to a 
certain extent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Raytheon filed suit against 21 ``John Does,''  
accusing them of discussing such matters as rumored mergers and 
acquisitions, impending divestitures and possible defense contracts 
on a public Internet site. The company asked the court on Thursday 
to drop the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The chatters used aliases to conceal their identities. Raytheon  
obtained subpoenas against Internet services, and Polk said the 
company eventually learned all 21 names. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobel said the situation illustrated the need for standards to  
ensure that online anonymity is not too easily compromised. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not prepared to say that it's the responsibility of the  
Internet companies to fight these efforts, but they do need to make 
sure that their subscribers are given notice of these subpoenas,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Raytheon case, America Online received subpoenas. Under  
AOL policy, whenever it receives a subpoena in a civil case, the 
customer is notified and given 14 days to try to block the 
subpoena. Only after that time has expired will the company turn 
over the information, said AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said targets of criminal investigations are not  
given such a luxury.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Countersues ESPN for Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major league baseball, which terminated its  
contract with ESPN earlier this month over the switch of three 
September games to a secondary outlet, is now countersuing the 
cable network, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is whether ESPN broke its contract by moving three  
baseball games to ESPN2 in September so that it could show three 
NFL games -- Pittsburgh at Cleveland, New York Jets at Buffalo and 
New York Giants at New England -- in their place on the main 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball games affected are Milwaukee at Colorado on Sept.  
12, San Francisco at San Diego on Sept. 19 and Houston at Milwaukee 
on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball said it would end its relationship with ESPN after this  
season because of the switch. The cable network then sued to 
maintain its contract which runs through 2002 and baseball 
responded with its own suit on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one at ESPN has seen the suit so we don't know its  
contents,'' said Chris LaPlaca, a spokesman for the network. ``We 
were not surprised that they countersued, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cable network is in its second full season of NFL games.  
Last year, baseball took back pre-empted games and moved them to 
local outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The ESPN contract permits the network to move games, with  
baseball's approval. LaPlaca said that since 1993 when ESPN2 was 
launched, close to 15 baseball games have been moved there so that 
ESPN could show events such as World Cup soccer, Grand National 
auto racing, NHL playoffs and the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the network had offered to televise a series of Tuesday  
and Friday baseball games in September and pennant race specials, 
all to be seen on ESPN, but that baseball had rejected that option. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPlaca called NFL games ``the gold standard in sports  
ratings,'' and said that last year ESPN's average rating for NFL 
games was 8.1 and 1.8 for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN is in 76 million homes and ESPN2 in in 64 million.

often working out agreements that kept the cases from prosecutors,

seven football and basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials became involved in at least six of the  
cases, the Star Tribune reported. Three of the athletes whose cases 
never went to prosecutors later were accused of assaulting other 
women, the newspaper reported, citing police reports, university 
documents, court records and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saint Paul Pioneer Press also reported Friday on accusations  
by one of the women, tutor Rebecca Fabunmi, and the way they were 
handled by McKinley Boston, university vice president for student 
development and athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's reports were the latest in a series of revelations  
about the university's athletic department since a former tutor 
alleged in March that she did coursework for several basketball 
players over several years. Outside attorneys are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabunmi said a freshman football player masturbated in front of  
her during a tutoring session in 1995. She reported it first to 
then-football coach Jim Wacker and later to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabunmi said Boston, who was then the men's athletics director,  
pressed her for details about what happened, questioning whether 
the act really was masturbation, and made her uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	When the player continued to harass the woman, she reported the  
problem to a campus detective, who talked with athletics officials 
but didn't write a report. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Boston said he was sensitive and diplomatic in  
trying to help Fabunmi, but disagreed with her description of how 
the player acted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very confident that the complaint was dealt with in an  
appropriate manner,'' he told the Pioneer Press. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Boston denied players received special treatment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would certainly deny, at least to my knowledge, that there  
was a culture that would provide for some insulation to allow 
athletes to be treated significantly differently from other 
students on the campus,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, university President Mark Yudof said the school is  
committed to ``fair and careful handling'' of complaints of sexual 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone alleges anything from simple harassment to actual  
assault, the job of anyone in the system is to facilitate the 
complaint,'' he said. ``No coverups, no whitewashes, no 
interferences with official investigations or any of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof said he has asked for a report by July 1 from Julie  
Sweitzer, director of the university's Office of Equal Opportunity 
and Affirmative Action, and Don Lewis, one of the outside attorneys 
involved in investigating the athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweitzer will meet with the women accusers if they are willing  
to do so, and advise them of their legal options, Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other cases reported by the Star Tribune, athletics  
officials helped negotiate an agreement with a football player 
after a female athlete accused him of sexually assaulting her 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid criminal prosecution, the player signed an agreement to  
get counseling, though he denied any assault. But Wacker, who has 
since left Minnesota, said he didn't make him honor the agreement 
because he never believed the woman's accusation.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Chuck McGrady was re-elected president of  
the Sierra Club on Saturday and promised to continue campaigns to 
protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrady won an uncontested election after environmental legend  
David Brower seconded McGrady's nomination, then declined 
nomination for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Brower, 86, had expressed an interest in the post, hoping to  
energize a 550,000-member organization that he claimed had become 
preoccupied with procedure and afraid to take chances. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrady will serve his second one-year term.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am grateful for this opportunity and I look forward to  
continuing to build the Sierra Club's campaigns to protect 
America's environment, for our families and for our future,'' 
McGrady said.

<HEADLINE> 'Jesse Ventura Story' To Be Shown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Peacock is overriding The Body.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura had flatly opposed NBC's plan to  
make a TV movie on the former professional wrestler's Horatio Alger 
life story. 
</P>
<P>
	But the network stood its ground and on Sunday (May 23) at 9  
p.m. EDT will present an unauthorized canvas-to-capitol biography, 
``The Jesse Ventura Story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears they have put ratings above accuracy and honesty,''  
an angry Ventura said earlier this year. Not so, countered the 
network. NBC would ``tell his story accurately and respectfully, 
based on the public record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so the governor has learned another lesson of political  
office: Your life, all of it, is fair game for journalists, authors 
and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Like so many TV movies, ``The Jesse Ventura Story'' purports to  
be ``based on the true story.'' It begins in 1964, when Ventura is 
influenced by watching Sonny Liston box on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The story follows his careers as Navy SEAL, bouncer, bodyguard,  
pro wrestler, wrestling announcer (after leaving the ring because 
of injuries), bad-guy actor, radio talk-show host, mayor of 
Brooklyn Park, Minn., and, since January, governor of Minnesota on 
the Reform Party ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	While NBC might be taking its chances crossing Jesse ``The  
Body'' Ventura, so too is actor Nils Allen Steward in playing The 
Guv. Depicting a famous person in a movie can either be a 
star-maker or a ticket to obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, himself a former pro wrestler, shaved off his ponytail  
and flowing mustache to look more like the smooth-headed governor. 
He appreciates the movie spotlight but says he isn't dazzled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm enjoying the whole process,'' said Stewart, 37. ``It's a  
dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have three kids and a wife, Renee, and I race horses. My  
focus is my family. This is a job. It's a fun job, but I won't die 
over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota storyteller Garrison Keillor of ``Prairie Home  
Companion'' fame has termed Ventura ``a great big honking 
bullet-headed shovel-faced mutha who talks in a steroid growl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who has never met Ventura, remarks: ``To achieve what  
he's achieved, he can't be a stupid guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart is a big man (6 feet 4 inches and 270 pounds) with a  
handsome face and mild manner. He was born in Tucson, Ariz., and a 
year later his family moved to a small Florida town near Cape 
Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
	During his five years at Florida State, where he studied  
business and criminology, he got into weightlifting, and with a 
healthy diet rose to 350 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wrestled professionally for five years,'' he said in an  
interview. ``But to be successful, you have to go on the road. I 
have a family, and I didn't want to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burt Reynolds gave Stewart his first acting job as a wrestler  
and bodybuilder in ``Cop and a Half'' (1993). He has played the 
same kind of roles in ``The Mask,'' ``Coneheads,'' ``The Shadow'' 
and ``Escape from L.A.'', and in TV series such as ``Mad About 
You'' and ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is pro wrestling a sport or an entertainment?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a form of entertainment with probably the best  
group of athletes in the world,'' Stewart said. ``Maybe some say 
it's fixed, set up beforehand. Me being ignorant of a lot of 
things, I think maybe boxing is fixed and set up beforehand. They 
just don't admit it.''

<HEADLINE> NRA Leader: Gun Laws Won't Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- More gun laws won't prevent school shootings  
like the recent massacre at Columbine, and those who seek further 
restrictions on firearms ultimately want to take away people's 
right to bear arms, a National Rifle Association leader said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Littleton, those two horrible kids, homicidal maniacs, they  
broke 20 federal and state gun laws,'' Wayne LaPierre, the group's 
executive vice president, told a gathering of Georgia Republicans. 
``You could have put another 50 laws on the books and they would 
have broken those, too. In the search about those who should be 
held responsible, how about blaming the people who pull the 
trigger, set off the bombs and do the killings?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly every speaker, including five announced or likely  
presidential candidates, at the two-day convention commented on 
school violence, including the latest incident in Conyers, Ga., in 
which six students were wounded Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month 13 people were killed in Littleton, Colo., by gunmen  
Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. The pair then killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders had considered cutting LaPierre from the agenda  
after the Conyers shooting, but decided delegates wanted to hear 
the NRA view. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPierre warned that the gun restrictions are promoted by those  
who ``hate the Second Amendment'' and want to take the right to 
bear arms apart ``brick by brick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The National Rifle Association has a core, fundamental  
interest in eliminating any violence or any crime with firearms,'' 
said LaPierre, who received repeated applause from the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential candidate Steve Forbes urged Americans to fight  
school violence as they would a war. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time to declare a war against violence in our schools  
and in our society,'' said the businessman and magazine publisher. 
``There are no quick fixes, no magic cures ... But we must not feel 
ourselves held hostage by the notion that we are helpless in the 
face of evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were repeated charges from speakers that the Clinton  
administration hasn't vigorously enforced existing gun laws and 
concern about the push for more restrictions such as those passed 
Thursday by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate passed a measure requiring the sale of safety devices  
with handguns and expand a system of background checks for firearms 
purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said the bill sent to the House offers  
simple solutions to a complex problem. Such ``simplistic, 
off-the-mark'' legislation, he said, gives parents and teachers ``a 
false sense of security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' proposal included vigorous enforcement of existing laws;  
increasing discipline in schools, reinforcing values such as 
honesty and faith in schools, and helping parents have more 
responsibility for their children with school choice and 
``educational freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is it easier to bring a swastika into our schools than the  
Holy Bible?'' Forbes asked the delegates.

<HEADLINE>  Blazers Play Jazz Today in Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- With one missed shot, the Utah Jazz  
watched their homecourt advantage evaporate against the Portland 
Trail Blazers. Another loss, and Utah's championship homes will be 
put in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, they have played a lot better overall than we have in  
this series,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said as Utah prepared for 
today's Game 3. ``We're going to have to improve a whole lot to 
compete up there, or they're going to have to get a lot worse, and 
I don't think that's likely to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Stockton's missed drive at the end of Game 2 Thursday night  
let the Blazers escape Utah with an 84-81 victory that evened the 
best-of-7 Western Conference semifinals 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, which came after Portland nearly blew a fourth-quarter  
lead for the second time in the series, also boosted the Blazers' 
already abundant confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not go into Utah saying to ourselves, `How are we going  
to win? Can we win?' '' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said Friday 
after winning the NBA Coach of the Year award. ``We believed that 
we could win. We know we can win every game we play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland won 22 of the 25 games it played at home during the  
regular season, with one of those losses coming to the Jazz in 
mid-March, 91-77. In the playoffs, Utah has lost its last seven 
games in Portland. Its last win here was in a first-round series in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no doubt we can win one or two of those games up  
there, if we don't turn the ball over and play the kind of defense 
we're capable of,'' Stockton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers led 73-64 with 5:13 to play before the Jazz rallied  
behind Stockton and Jeff Hornacek. Their consecutive 3-pointers 
closed Utah to 82-81 with 12 seconds left. Portland's Greg Anthony 
made one of two free throws with 10 seconds left, setting up 
Stockton's miss. It appeared that he might have been fouled by Jim 
Jackson, but the officials let the play stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the shot we wanted,'' Stockton said. ``I just should  
have made it. We don't make excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sometimes hot-headed Blazers kept their cool, unlike Tuesday  
night's opener, in which Rasheed Wallace was called for a flagrant 
foul on Bryon Russell. Wallace threw a tantrum, was called for a 
technical, and the Jazz scored four points on the possession to tie 
the game at 78-all. They didn't trail again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there was a lot of growing up that happened,'' Blazers  
power forward Brian Grant said of Game 2. ``We wanted the Jazz to 
have to beat us with their offense, or for them to have to do 
something spectacular. Which they almost did, with all the 
3-pointers they hit down the backstretch. But we were able to hold 
them off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said the Blazers planned in today's game to exploit their  
quickness advantage in the paint, even though Utah center Greg 
Ostertag has played better this series after a poor opening round 
against Sacramento. In Game 1 against the Blazers, he had six 
points and six rebounds, and he grabbed 14 rebounds Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg has had two pretty good games, which is nice because  
Arvydas Sabonis is a tough matchup for him,'' Jazz coach Jerry 
Sloan said. ``He's being conscientious about his rebounding, and 
he's doing some good things on defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have to play better against Isaiah Rider, who continued  
his playoff surge with a career postseason high 27 points Thursday 
night. He's averaging 19.8 points in the playoffs, and is taxing 
the Jazz defense by hitting from the outside and driving the ball 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, I thought I played pretty good defense,''  
Hornacek said. ``I don't know how much more we could have done, 
unless it was making somebody else take the shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone, third in the league in playoff scoring at 23.9,  
behind only Allen Iverson (28.5) and Shaquille O'Neal (25.8), said 
the Jazz can't repeat their 18-turnover performance if they hope to 
win in Portland and take back homecourt advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put ourselves in a hole, and now we have to dig ourselves  
out,'' he said. ``You can't be intimidated now. They came into our 
place, they wanted to get a game, and they did. Now we have to go 
to their place. To win it, we have to win on their floor.''

<HEADLINE> Montana Enjoys Cutting-Horse Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Cows 1. Former San Francisco 49ers'  
quarterback Joe Montana 0. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking part in a cutting-horse demonstration Friday to help kick  
off the 1999 Pacific Coast Cutting Horse Association Derby Classic 
and Challenge, the four-time Super Bowl champ proved he can ride a 
fast-moving, quick-turning cattle horse. But this time the cows 
were just a little faster. 
</P>
<P>
	The object of the competition is for a horse and rider to  
``cut'' a cow out of herd and keep it from returning. Montana got 
interested in cutting in 1994, watching friend and former Kansas 
City Chiefs tight end Jonathan Hayes compete in Fort Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, ``OK, it'll probably be fun to watch, but it was a  
lot more exciting than I even imagined,'' Montana said. ``If people 
like horses at all, once you've tried it, you're hooked.''

	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Toshiba Corp. has developed a paper-thin  
computer chip that will help efforts to make ever-smaller 
electronic goods, a news report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The .0052 inch-thick semiconductor, which the company claims is

<HEADLINE> School Safety Dominates Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- The school violence that hit Georgia the day  
before state Republicans began their statewide convention quickly 
became a dominant topic. 
</P>
<P>
	More discussion was assured today with the decision to go ahead  
with a long-scheduled speech by National Rifle Association leader 
Wayne LaPierre. State GOP chairman Rusty Paul on Friday decided 
against halting the speech after conferring with delegates who 
agreed the party shouldn't restrict viewpoints or discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes' campaign said he would  
focus on school violence in his own speech today. Candidates 
Elizabeth Dole and Alan Keys were also scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander said the issue  
has more to do with family and moral values than with new gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``A person who has squandered his moral authority is a president  
who has a hard time leading the country to deal with moral issues. 
Most of the issues that are involved in Littleton, Conyers ... are 
moral issues. They're not government issues,'' Alexander told 
reporters after his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Both he and conservative candidate Gary Bauer said Senate  
passage of a juvenile crime bill increasing restrictions on 
gun-buying at gun shows and pawn shops steered away from larger 
issues behind school violence such as Thursday's woundings of six 
students in Conyers and last month's bloody spree in Littleton, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a real cop-out for the Congress to pretend that it has  
solved the Littleton and Conyers tragedies by passing rules in 
Washington,'' Alexander told delegates. ``The only thing that I 
know that will make a real difference is for our country to take 
seriously honoring the job of father and mother, putting the 
country back on the side of moms and dads everyway that we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said he supports ``reasonable'' gun laws, but ``what  
we have learned tragically is that laws by themselves don't do the 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed tripling child tax exemptions, increasing tax  
incentives for married parents, making it easier for parents to 
have flexible work schedules, providing new federal money for 
schoolchildren and increasing school choice, and rewarding good 
teachers while cracking down on bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said Thursday's Senate action seemed like ``legislating to  
be legislating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would take the liberal chest-beating going on in Washington  
a lot more seriously on this issue if this administration had been 
enforcing the existing gun laws,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich regaled delegates at dinner  
Friday evening with a speech offering his analysis and suggestions 
for improving today's youth, ranging from emphasis on teaching the 
Declaration of Independence to making it easier for teens to work. 
He called gun control ``a very nice, self-serving smokescreen for 
liberals'' that doesn't address ``root causes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also criticized the Clinton administration for not  
prosecuting gun felons more vigorously.

<HEADLINE> Johnson, Leyland Jaw Over Pitches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Arizona pitcher Randy Johnson and Colorado manager  
Jim Leyland don't exactly see eye-to-eye, even though they stood 
toe-to-toe behind the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-10 Johnson and the 5-11 Leyland had a brief, animated  
conversation prior to Friday night's game at Coors Field in another 
installment of the Johnson-Darryl Kile feud. 
</P>
<P>
	After about a minute, they turned their backs on each other and  
walked away. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous night, Johnson felt a fastball from Kile had come  
too close to his head. Last weekend, there had been a similar pitch 
from Kile to Johnson, and on another pitch a few moments later, 
Johnson's bat flew out of his hands and nearly clipped Kile at the 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Thursday game, Johnson said, ``He is coming awfully  
close to my head and if he does it again, I can assure you, he'll 
have a quick trip to the DL himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Kile had no response to Johnson's threat, but his  
manager eagerly waded in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't speak for Darryl Kile,'' Leyland said, ``but maybe  
Darryl feels that if (Johnson) throws the bat at him again, maybe 
(Johnson) will wind up on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't impressed with (Johnson's) comment. We weren't trying  
to hit Randy Johnson. I can promise that. In most cases, if any 
pitcher wants to hit somebody, they can hit them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the greatest pitchers in the game, without  
question. But for him to say he wasn't throwing at anybody, and 
then for him to say that our guy was? Who is he to make that 
judgment? I got guys who say he threw the bat on purpose. He said 
it was an accident. My guys don't think so and neither do I. Both 
pitchers have a right to compete, not just one. Who is he, 
president of the league?'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being told of Leyland's comments, Johnson approached  
Leyland near the batting cage, and the debate was on. Afterward, 
Johnson was asked if anything had been settled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess not,'' said Johnson, in his first full season in the  
National League in a decade. ``I don't want to be accused of 
throwing the bat, but I haven't hit in 9 1/2 years. If (Leyland) is 
trying to fire me up, great. Then I wish I was pitching again 
(Friday night). I don't need any added incentive, but I guess I 
have it.''

<HEADLINE> Romney Hopes To Save Utah Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In another six months, Mitt Romney hopes  
to have ``all the lines connected and the boxes filled'' in his 
quest to rebuild the Salt Lake Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the third president of the local Olympic organization --  
and the one with perhaps the toughest job -- is seeking sponsors and 
budget cuts, and learning how to say no. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say I'm looking for heroes of all stripes to save  
our bacon, to help us find ways to reduce costs and to also support 
the games,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past week, Romney has spent many hours with someone who  
knows what he's going through -- Jean-Claude Killy, the triple 
gold-medal skier and co-president of the 1992 Albertville Games who 
is now an IOC member from France. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been an eye-opening experience for Romney, the venture  
capitalist from Boston who returned three months ago to the state 
where he spent his youth. He arrived in the middle of the Olympic 
bribery scandal to try to solve problems he inherited. 
</P>
<P>
	Killy is vice-chairman of the International Olympic Committee  
task force coordinating preparations for the 2002 Winter Games, and 
Romney said his presence during a week of meetings was ``very 
powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has been where I am now and he continues to give very, very  
good advice to me,'' Romney said. ``He told me how many people are 
going to come asking for more. He said. `Mitt, you have to learn 
just to say no, I'm sorry, we can't do that.' 
</P>
<P>
	``And he said, `It's tough, you're telling everyone no and  
you'll be criticized by many, many people and the public and the 
media. But when the games begin, people will appreciate what's been 
built.''' 
</P>
<P>
	What Romney wants to build is a lasting monument to Olympic  
athletes and sports, while paying the bills and making sure 
everything is neat and tidy when the games end on Feb. 24, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``People here are anxious to get on with the games and sport,  
and to stop dwelling on the administration and the failures of 
management,'' he said. ``The energy here is in regards to new 
sponsors, mascots, sport, going forward. And I had not expected it 
would be so immediate. The support has been very heartening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney is the son of one of the most celebrated couples in  
American public service, former Michigan Gov. George Romney and his 
wife, Lenora. 
</P>
<P>
	A failed challenger for Ted Kennedy's Senate seat from  
Massachusetts in 1994, Romney made his mark by reviving troubled 
companies as CEO of Bain Capital Inc. Domino's pizza and Staples 
office supplies are two of his success stories. 
</P>
<P>
	He was recruited to head the Salt Lake Organizing Committee when  
Frank Joklik, the retired chairman of Kennecott copper, resigned in 
the midst of the million-dollar scandal over improper inducements 
to IOC members from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	And in his three months on the job, the 52-year-old graduate of  
BYU and Harvard Business School has attacked SLOC's problems as he 
would those of any foundering organization -- cutting costs, looking 
for new income and changing its image. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he said, $98 million has been trimmed from SLOC's budget  
and more paring is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	And earlier this month, Romney announced deals totaling some $30  
million with three new sponsors -- the first major signings since 
the scandal broke last November, but far from the $300 million in 
sponsorships SLOC needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney and the IOC spent much of the week talking money, and the  
SLOC president said he hoped for breakthroughs soon in the ``virgin 
territory'' of sponsorships from information-technology companies, 
a growing Utah resource. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of those technology companies have not been called on,  
ever, to consider a sponsorship of the Olympics and Olympic 
teams,'' he said. ``And think of those Internet companies -- they 
weren't even here! I don't know if E-Bay existed at the time of 
Atlanta'' which played host to the games in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Such high-tech sponsors also would open the door to Romney's  
view of worldwide Olympic marketing right in your home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have pins and memorabilia and licensed products  
and maybe even tickets that get sold on the Internet,'' he said. 
``And we haven't even worked with companies like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other sponsor slots Romney wants to fill include an  
international automaker, chemical and pharmaceutical firms and 
various food products, including cereals. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also considering an approach to federal agencies to use the  
Winter Games as a platform for various programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may be able to be a demonstration project for a drug-free  
America, or a demonstration project for the Energy Department or 
the EPA,'' he said. ``We have a number of things that from my point 
of view are important from a precedent standpoint and communicate 
what can be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC's image has been buffed by Romney's direct but casual  
style. He acted like a talk-show host and looked like the emcee of 
a country-music concert when he helped introduce the games' new 
mascots -- a snowshoe hare, a coyote and a black bear -- to a 
cheering audience last weekend. He invited the IOC members to his 
house for dinner, the only social function on their calendar. He 
strolls SLOC's offices with his smile on and his suit jacket off. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposed budget cuts have not always produced smiles. The  
U.S. Olympic Committee is negotiating to save $5 million in 
operating cuts for pre-games training at ski jumps, bobsled and 
luge tracks and the speedskating oval, eliminating free practice 
time it says Romney's predecessors promised. 
</P>
<P>
	The new SLOC boss says his proposal ``doesn't strike me as being  
an outrageous request,'' since SLOC spent $170 million to build the 
facilities and will still pay two-thirds of the operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney even has gone after perhaps the most sacred cow of  
Olympic finance -- the money spent on IOC members during the games. 
He's asked the committee to pick up a bigger share of the 
multimillion-dollar tab, including hotel charges. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he hasn't been told no.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been refreshing -- they haven't come here saying `We want  
more of this' or `Give us more,''' he said. ``Instead it's been, 
`How can we be helpful to the games?'''

<HEADLINE> DuPont's Acquisition of Pioneer OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Department of Justice is allowing  
DuPont Co. to proceed with its acquisition of Pioneer Hi-Bred 
International Inc., the world's largest seed corn company. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Justice raising no objections, the only remaining  
obstacles are the approval of Pioneer shareholders and the European 
Union, said Susan Gaffney, a DuPont spokeswoman on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaffney said the merger is expected to be completed this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	DuPont, which already owns 20 percent of Pioneer, will pay an  
estimated $7.7 billion for the remaining 80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer shareholders will receive $40 per share, with 45 percent  
of the shares being traded for cash and the remainder for DuPont 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, Pioneer Hi-Bred is an  
agricultural genetics and technology company that produces seeds 
and grain additives. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont, based in Wilmington, Del., hopes the merger will  
strengthen and accelerate the company's ability to develop new 
agricultural and food products.

<HEADLINE> Family Wins Heart-Surgery Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The family of a 7-year-old Oregon boy left  
blind, mute and paralyzed after a heart operation six years ago has 
won a $15.2 million malpractice suit. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury agreed Friday that a botched operation at Children's  
Hospital of Philadelphia caused permanent brain damage in Alec 
Sears. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's parents, Mark and Vicki Sears, sued the hospital,  
surgeon Dr. Marshall L. Jacobs and a hospital technician, 
contending Jacob's team cooled their son's temperature too rapidly 
before the May 1993 operation, causing permanent neurological 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The child, born with a heart defect, was 18 months old at the  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury assigned Jacobs the majority of blame for the boy's  
injuries, while the hospital and technician were held less 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital attorney Allan H. Starr said he planned to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Mutombo Is More Than Man of Blocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- There are many sides to this giant man, which  
isn't surprising when you consider his name: 
</P>
<P>
	Dikembe Mutombo Mpolondo Mukamba Jean Jacque Wamutombo.  
</P>
<P>
	He's a humanitarian, but he's not above whining to get his way.  
He's an elegant shot-blocker, but he seems quite awkward at the 
other end of the court. He's a family man, but some opponents have 
called him a dirty player. He's domineering, yet down home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a big guy with a loud voice,'' said Tyrone Corbin,  
Mutombo's teammate with the Atlanta Hawks. ``That intimidates a lot 
of people. But he's a very caring guy. He's very proud of who he 
is, what he's trying to accomplish and where he's going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When having a courtside discussion with Mutombo, there are many  
subjects to cover. 
</P>
<P>
	He might talk about his burning desire to win an NBA  
championship, which seems unlikely this season with the Hawks 
trailing New York 2-0 in a second-round series that continues 
Sunday at Madison Square Garden. Or he might give a discourse on 
the civil strife in his beloved Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	If needed, he can handle the conversation in English, French,  
Portuguese, Spanish or one of five African dialects. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Mutombo's concerns are so varied, his interests so  
widespread, his heart so large, that his coach felt compelled to 
issue a warning to his 7-foot-2 center. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has taken on some awesome responsibilities,'' Lenny Wilkens  
said. ``I told him he really needed to get his focus on his 
basketball. He had too many outside activities. What makes Dikembe 
is his basketball. If that's good, it allows him to provide for all 
the other things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Mutombo's basketball has been very good since  
he left Denver in 1996 to sign with the Hawks. Twice, he has been 
named the NBA's defensive player of the year, and he's polished his 
offensive skills to the point where he's a fairly integral part of 
the Atlanta offense. 
</P>
<P>
	But many opponents have been put off by his sharp elbows,  
responsible for three broken noses during the regular season and a 
nasty bruise to Lindsey Hunter's eye in the first round of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ridiculous,'' Detroit coach Alvin Gentry fumed after  
Hunter's injury. ``Somebody has got to do something about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkens defends his center on the issue of dirty play, but he's  
not as supportive when it comes to Mutombo's constant bickering 
about the officiating. Hardly a call is made that doesn't draw an 
angry glare, a loud roar or a befuddled look. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an emotional guy, and it's hard sometimes,'' Wilkens  
said. ``But I told him that if they're not going to change any 
calls, all you get is them watching every move you make. You don't 
want that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Off the court, Mutombo's life is equally chaotic.  
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo and his wife, Rose, have a 2-year-old daughter of their  
own and legally adopted four of his nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're driving me crazy,'' Mutombo said jokingly the other  
day, but he knew those kids would have a better chance of 
succeeding in America than in the family's native Congo, a 
war-torn, poverty-stricken land in the center of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like they say in Africa, a child is raised in a village, he's  
not just raised by his parents,'' Mutombo said. ``I have been 
productive in society, and I feel like I owe my community for what 
they have given to me. I can't turn my back on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He started a bus company to help the teeming masses get around  
Kinshasa, the capital city where Mutombo was born and raised. He 
also began a telephone company to improve the communications 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's trying to raise $44 million to build a new hospital in  
his native country. He also wants to construct a basketball arena 
and a school, the latter honoring his father, an education 
superintendent for more than three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are so many problems, more than any one man can solve  
on his own. Mutombo's deep, husky voice usually growls like a lion, 
but it grows as soft as a kitten when he ponders Africa's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just moving in the wrong direction,'' he said. ``It's  
not just in the Congo. It's all of Africa. Africa has been hit 
these past two years by all these civil wars. Somebody has got the 
answer on that. I'm not the answer. But the answer is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo wonders why the people of American and other Western  
nations were so willing to turn their attention to other problems, 
such as those in Kosovo, a tiny province compared with the massive 
African continent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very bad to see all these wars going on in Africa, all  
these people dying in Africa,'' he said. ``But nobody is really 
writing about it. Nobody is paying attention to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Congolese conflict became especially personal for Mutombo  
last summer. His mother died after being denied medical care by the 
warring factions. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mutombo was single, his mother would visit the United  
States, cooking his meals while encouraging him to get married and 
have some children. Her wish finally came true, and the couple 
named their first child Carrie Biamba Wamutombo in honor of her 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mutombo's mother died before she could see the child.  
</P>
<P>
	``It still bothers me a lot,'' he said. ``My mom didn't get a  
chance to see my daughter. That's the sad part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mutombo, who will turn 33 on Tuesday, seems too busy with  
day-to-day life to worry about his legacy in the NBA, but he's 
given it some thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, he'll never achieve the same reverence as New York's  
Patrick Ewing, the center who preceded him at Georgetown and is now 
referred to by Mutombo as ``my oldest bother.'' If Ewing is a 
smooth gemstone when he plays the game, Mutombo is an unpolished 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick will be Patrick, Dikembe will be Dikembe,'' Mutombo  
said with a shrug. ``I've always said by the time I finish playing 
this game, I just want people to say I was one of the greatest 
defensive players who ever played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so much more.

<HEADLINE> Miller, Pacers Seek To Sweep Sixers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With perhaps one last tuneup in enemy  
territory before heading to the Eastern Conference finals, Reggie 
Miller and the Indiana Pacers sense the importance of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweep the Philadelphia 76ers and their cacophonous fans aside  
and take another step toward the goal that has so far eluded them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Put them away,'' said Mark Jackson, laying out the plan for  
Game 4 Sunday with the Pacers leading 3-0 in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals. ``They're a young team that's well coached. We don't 
want to give them any life. It's important for us to put them away 
while we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers took a dramatic step toward doing so with a 97-86  
victory over the Sixers Friday night. The Pacers are 6-0 in the 
playoffs and can advance to their fourth conference final in five 
years. No team has ever squandered a 3-0 lead in the NBA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who thrives on hostility as much as any pro athlete of  
his generation, led the methodical Pacers in an unfriendly 
atmosphere. Sixers fans filled the First Union Center with the kind 
of noise and inhospitality that hasn't been witnessed in this city 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is like two Palestras,'' said one courtside observer who  
has attended every big basketball game in this city for more than 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Derisive, profane chants invoking Miller's name started 15  
minutes before tipoff. Predictably, it only drove Miller to pull 
off another of his merciless clinics in transforming loathing into 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you could ever learn that. It's somewhat  
innate,'' said Miller, who scored 29 points, including a crushing 
3-pointer that provided a late 16-point lead. ``Not everyone can 
have all the commercials and be clapped everywhere you go. There 
have to be people that you love to hate, and I just happen to be 
that person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's a master in playing that role.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know about that,'' said Miller's coach, Larry Bird,  
fairly driven by taunts and adversity in his playing days. ``I 
don't compare myself to Reggie. We're different type of players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever happens Sunday, the Sixers and their fans have awakened  
from a nearly decade-long slumber that included yearly trips to the 
NBA draft lottery. Team president Pat Croce, who has completely 
rebuilt the organization with Larry Brown as coach, ordinarily 
would have headed there Saturday to seek the latest morsel of 
salvation for a team that was virtually dead throughout the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about being swept, but I'd be crushed if we  
didn't go out and compete at an unbelievably high level,'' Brown 
said Saturday. ``But win or lose, it's not going to take away from 
what we've done all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 76ers have tried nearly everything to shake the experienced  
Pacers, including a relentless shower of shots by Allen Iverson, 
the league scoring champion. Iverson, who scored 32 points on 33 
shots Friday night, has missed 54 shots in the series -- more than 
any Pacers player has attempted. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who attend Sunday's game must wonder how to handle Miller  
this time. Miller offered this advice: Shut up. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always say silence is golden, but that'll never happen,''  
Miller said. ``I respect and I like when the fans get into the

hat. But at some point in time when it's not working in your favor, 
it has to stop.''

	Unless the New York Knicks blow their 2-0 lead over Atlanta,  
another rematch between two of the best trash talkers in sports 
appears imminent. Spike Lee, Miller's favorite courtside 
instigator, will be waiting at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>

during the 1994 conference finals would be hard to top.

<HEADLINE> NASA Computers Found Insecure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government investigation into NASA's cyber  
security found it so vulnerable to attack that hackers could easily 
disrupt command and control operations, including the tracking of 
earth-orbiting spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office said last week that its teams also  
penetrated systems that process and distribute the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration's scientific data and broke 
into many of NASA's most vital networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having obtained access to these systems, we could have  
disrupted NASA's ongoing command and control operations and stolen, 
modified or destroyed system software and data,'' said the report 
from the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials said they agreed with many of the GAO's findings  
and were working to improve security, but the report possibly 
exaggerates the extent of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with NASA personnel, the GAO arranged within the last  
year to have National Security Agency experts try to break into 
systems vital to NASA's mission. They targeted systems at one of 
NASA's 10 field centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams ``initially penetrated these systems using easily  
guessed passwords'' that provided limited access, then used that 
access to find ways of breaking through to deeper, more damaging 
areas, the report said. ``Worse still, some accounts had no 
passwords at all,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the report's findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--One hundred and thirty-five of the 155 mission-critical systems  
reviewed did not meet NASA's own risk requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	--NASA's security guidance did not specify what information can  
be posted on the World Wide Web or how critical systems should be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
	--NASA had conducted no agencywide review of its information  
technology security at its 10 field centers since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	--NASA failed to provide required computer security training and  
did not centrally coordinate responses to security incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, NASA's systems are extensively interconnected through  
the Internet ``and can be an attractive target for individuals and 
organizations desiring to learn about or damage NASA's operations, 
including would-be hackers as well as industrial spies and foreign 
intelligence agents,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who requested the GAO  
investigation, called the results troubling and unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``NASA spent more than $1 billion last year on information  
systems to support a wide range of critical missions, including the 
space shuttle, international space station and Mars Pathfinder,'' 
Thompson, chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, said 
in a statement. ``Now we're learning that the security and 
integrity of many of these computing systems is vulnerable to 
attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA official J.R. Dailey wrote to GAO officials that NASA  
agreed with many of the findings. But he said, ``Penetration 
testing of a limited number of systems at one center cannot be 
extrapolated to all of NASA's mission-critical systems at all of 
its centers.''

<HEADLINE>  Villages Flooded in Bavarian Alps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) -- Heavy rain in the  
Bavarian Alps sent streams over their banks, cutting off villages, 
roads and electricity to several towns, police said Saturday. At 
least three people were reported dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a 75-year-old man who entered his basement in  
Garmisch to get rubber boots drowned when a gush of water slammed 
the door behind him trapping him in the celler. 
</P>
<P>
	A sudden burst of water from a flooded stream in Dirlewang in  
the Unterallgaeu district also trapped and drowned an 87-year-old 
man in the basement of his home in that village, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding was also reported in neighboring Switzerland to the  
south in the Lake Constance region. A German tourist died when he 
was buried by a landslide in Switzerland's Uri district, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavarian police said the worst flooding was reported around the  
village of Eschenlohe on the Loisach river, about halfway between 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Murnau, where military trucks that had 
driven in to deliver sand sacks were trapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Other towns hit by the flooding included Oberstdorf, Immenstadt,  
Sonthofen and the Walser Valley region, where electricity was shut 
off after a transformer station was inundated with water. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency teams used boats to rescue scores of people from cars  
trapped and stalled on flooded roads. Several cars were swept away 
by the churning water, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Streams in the entire northern Alpine region, including the  
Iller, Wertach, Lech, Ammer, Loisach, Isar and Inn were flooded, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Austria to the east, the A14 super highway and connecting  
roads were declared impassible at several locations due to 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters predicted the rain would let up in the next day.

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders Boeing 727s Inspected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has  
ordered emergency tests on tubes that carry electric wires through 
the fuel tanks of Boeing 727s. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried that a mixture of fuel, air and electricity could spark  
an explosion, the FAA issued its directive Friday after workers 
found severe wear on wires and holes in the tubing on two of the 
jets. Mechanics also discovered signs of electric sparking around 
the wires. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA ordered inspections last May of a similar area of the  
727's cousin, the Boeing 737. 
</P>
<P>
	That order came after mechanics found both exposed wires and  
holes in the fuel-pump conduit on a 737. The chafing was believed 
caused by engine vibration, the holes by electric sparks. About the 
same time, the agency ordered similar inspections for Boeing 747s 
and 767s. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials believe such conditions may have been behind the  
explosion that brought down TWA Flight 800. While investigators 
still do not know what caused that Boeing 747 to explode off Long 
Island in July 1996, killing the 230 people aboard, they suspect 
electricity ignited fumes in the center fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The new inspections were triggered by findings of inspections on  
two 727s with more than 50,000 hours of flight time apiece. 
Mechanics found wear on wiring used to power in-tank fuel pumps and 
signs of electric arcing. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA ordered airlines to inspect the boost pump area for any  
sign that fuel was leaking into aluminum tubes that carry the fuel 
pump wires. On Friday, the 727's manufacturer, Seattle-based Boeing 
Co., issued a separate notice to 727 operators outlining ways to 
test the pipes and repair the wires. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA order did not immediately require wiring inspections or  
repairs, just an inspection of the tubing for leaks and necessary 
repairs. The agency said it planned to require additional 
examination of the wiring after more information becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
	The order gives airlines five days to perform the tests on 727s  
with more than 50,000 hours of flight time. On planes with less 
flight time, the tests must be made within 10 days or before a 
plane accumulates 30,000 hours of flight time, whichever is later. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 1,461 Boeing 727s worldwide, 1,081 are operated by U.S.  
carriers, Boeing spokesman Bill Seil said. The problem was 
discovered during a routine maintenance check of freight carriers 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials were unclear whether the order would affect the  
traveling public. About one-third of the planes involved are cargo 
carriers, and the inspections can be spread between five and 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Seil said: ``We see it as a reason to inspect  
the planes. It shouldn't be a disruption to services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing and FAA officials estimated that the tests would take  
about four hours per aircraft and cost $252,000 for the U.S. fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of foreign-registered aircraft are not compelled to  
conduct the tests, but foreign civil aviation authorities tend to 
follow FAA safety recommendations, as the U.S. agency does with 
suggestions made abroad.

<HEADLINE> Pisa Tower Leans Less After Fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PISA, Italy (AP) -- The Leaning Tower of Pisa is leaning a little  
less thanks to an experiment aimed at making the monument settle 
better into the ground, experts said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, workers started removing soil from under the  
tower's base. Going into the experiment, the 12th century tower 
leaned some 6 degrees -- 13 feet -- off the perpendicular. Experts 
reported Saturday that the tower has since straightened by about 
one-fifth of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results of the experimental excavation are superior than  
the expectations,'' said Michele Jamiolkowski, who heads a 
committee of experts monitoring measures aimed at keeping the tower 
from toppling over. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the digging began, two sets of steel ``suspenders,''  
anchored to giant winches dug into the ground about 100 yards from 
the tower, were attached to the monument. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the excavation threaten to make the tower wobble, the  
suspenders would be pulled tight to stabilize it. 
</P>
<P>
	The digging will continue, but Jamiolkowski said the government  
must renew funding since the money allocated for the project is 
running out.

<HEADLINE> Phillies GM Puts Heat on Schilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Now stepping into the batter's box against  
Curt Schilling: Philadelphia Phillies general manager Ed Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Schilling demanded that the Phillies spend more  
money or trade him, Wade distributed a two-page, point-by-point 
rebuttal Friday in which he said Schilling was ``self-serving'' and 
``wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Curt has a right to express his opinions,'' Wade said. ``But  
that's all they are. Much of what Curt says is irresponsible, and 
his comments often are not based upon facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every fifth day, Curt has the opportunity to go out and be a  
horse on the mound. Unfortunately, on the other four days, he tends 
to say things which are detrimental to the club and clearly 
self-serving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Schilling was the guest on major league baseball's  
weekly conference call with the national media. As Wade pointed out 
in his statement, ``Baseball uses the call to promote the game and 
its star players. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, Curt used the call as a forum to discuss the  
Phillies' finances, the team's ownership group and his personal 
feelings about the direction of the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did he ever.  
</P>
<P>
	``For us to be successful and to compete and to win, they're  
going to have to go out and get a big player. We're short right 
now,'' Schilling said. ``They told us they're not ready to pay in 
the Randy Johnson financial territory. If they signed Randy Johnson 
this winter, would we be contenders? If you bring in Randy Johnson, 
Brad Radke, Kenny Rogers, you name it, we'd be a legitimate 
contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling met with team president David Montgomery on Thursday  
night during the team's exhibition game against its Triple-A 
affiliate in Moosic, Pa. Montgomery did not return a call Friday, 
and Wade said he was told it was a ``private meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that it's necessary for me to schedule a time to  
meet with him,'' Wade said. ``I'm finished with it. I said hello to 
him last night, and he said hello to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies began the season with a $30.36 million payroll, the  
fourth lowest in the National League. Despite that, the Phillies 
were 21-18 Friday, trailing NL East leader Atlanta by 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Curt had a chance to promote his own performance and that of  
his teammates,'' Wade said. ``He had a chance to talk about Mike 
Lieberthal, Scott Rolen, Doug Glanville, Paul Byrd, and others. And 
maybe he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling did praise some teammates, notably pitcher Carlton  
Loewer, saying the right-hander is ``going to be an impact 
pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But all the positives he could have gotten out of that forum  
were negated by his comments about areas in which he is 
uninformed,'' Wade said. ``It's unfortunate that he chose to use 
the spotlight and do something other than put his best foot 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, off to a 7-1 start, has a complete no-trade clause in  
his contract, which pays him $10.8 million this year and next with 
an option for 2001 at $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said repeatedly he is willing to waive the clause to be  
traded to a contender, and frequently turns postgame interviews 
into impromptu rip sessions directed toward Montgomery and chairman 
Bill Giles. After beating Kevin Brown and the Dodgers on May 2, 
Schilling said, ``It's been six years since we've played good 
baseball on a consistent basis here. It's up to the Phillies 
ownership to get the players and put a good team out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What message does that comment send to his teammates?'' Wade  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the conference call Wednesday, Schilling elaborated on his  
comments in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're knocking on the door and they stand pat, I'd want to  
go,'' Schilling said. ``If ownership is not willing to make a trade 
or spend in July, they need to sell the team and give the 
Philadelphia fans what they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade declined to expound on his statement. Some excerpts:  
</P>
<P>
	--On acquiring more pitching: ``We've been trying to upgrade our  
rotation since the end of last season and will continue to try. We 
haven't turned down any trade for starting pitchers because of 
dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On Schilling's belief that Forbes Magazine's report that the  
Phillies made a profit in 1998 was correct, and the team's 
assertion that it lost money was not: ``I've been in all the 
ownership group's meetings since December 1997, and I've seen the 
bottom line. The team has lost significant dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On Schilling's trade demand: ``Curt does not have a `trade me'  
clause. He has a `no trade' clause, which means he can refuse to be 
traded to any team. If we ever decide we want to trade Curt, he'll 
have his say. But Curt does not have the total say in this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade insisted that the controversy would ``absolutely not''  
affect a decision to trade his ace.

<HEADLINE> NATO Blacks Out 16 Yugoslav Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes roared over Belgrade  
and much of Serbia early today, blacking out the capital and 15 
other cities in a determined attempt to pressure President Slobodan 
Milosevic to agree to a peace deal for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The widespread power outages came as NATO jets reportedly  
dropped special cluster bombs with carbon filaments that cause 
damage to wires conducting electricity, Yugoslav media reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Four missiles hit a power plant in Kolubara, 20 miles southwest  
of Belgrade, targeting its main distribution center and a nearby 
transformer station, Serb media said. That could cripple the plant 
for weeks -- a situation that will likely lead to protracted power 
shortages over a wide area. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen workers were injured in the Kolubara strike, the  
private Beta news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Repair teams managed to restore power to Belgrade early today,  
but the grid went down again a few hours later. A statement from 
Serbia's power company accused NATO of wanting to ``cause a 
humanitarian catastrophe of major proportions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other major developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- At the Macedonian border, 3,700 refugees poured out of Kosovo,  
many saying Serb forces came to their homes, ordered them out, and 
demanded money and valuables along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Washington, President Clinton signed a bill that authorizes  
$12 billion for the conflict with Yugoslavia to help Kosovo 
Albanian refugees, aid the neighboring Balkan countries and fund 
U.S. forces around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said NATO is  
simultaneously planning for two scenarios for Kosovo: A 
peacekeeping force of approximately 50,000 American and European 
troops in Kosovo and for the possibility that NATO would invade to 
restore order in the war-wracked province. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said today it attacked power installations, ammunition  
dumps, highway bridges and army barracks during its most intensive 
night of sorties yet. It also took advantage of good weather to 
strike a dozen tanks, 18 military vehicles and nine artillery 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 684 sorties were flown. Of that total, 245 were strike  
sorties and 90 were sorties attacking air defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	Strikes continued into the day. The state-run Tanjug news agency  
said NATO fired eight missiles into the southwestern Kosovo city of 
Prizren this morning, after an earlier attack Friday night. The 
southern Serbian city of Leskovac was also struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Other targets today included a fuel depot in Belgrade's Cukarica  
district, the Batajnica military airfield northwest of Belgrade, a 
television transmitter on Mount Fruska Gora. In the far north, a 
fuel depot and an industrial zone were targeted in Sombor, Tanjug 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	To the south in Kosovo, Tanjug said at least 100 missiles were  
fired by NATO at different targets between Friday and early today. 
At least 20 people were killed, more than 50 were wounded and 
``enormous damage'' was caused, Tanjug reported. It was apparently 
counting the 19 people reported killed Friday in what Serb news 
media said was an attack on a prison in the northwestern Kosovo 
town of Istok. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO air bombardment aims to force Milosevic to withdraw his  
40,000 Serb troops and special police from Kosovo, a province in 
Serbia, permit the return of nearly 800,000 ethnic Albanian 
refugees who have been expelled or fled, and allow NATO 
peacekeepers in to enforce the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Finnish President Martti  
Ahtisaari met today in Sweden to discuss the crisis in Kosovo. 
Ahtisaari has been mentioned as a possible mediator in the crisis, 
since Finland is not a NATO member and has good relations with 
Russia, a longtime Yugoslav ally. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States says it has reports of large-scale desertions  
by Yugoslav army reservists and anti-war demonstrations by 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Foreign Ministry spokesman said troops who returned to two  
central Serbian towns this week were just ``regular soldiers 
returning home'' as part of a reduction of Serbian forces in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Montenegrin town of Cetinje, some 5,000 people protested  
new Yugoslav army reinforcements around their city Friday and 
demanded that the military withdraw. The demonstration was the 
biggest protest against the Yugoslav army in Montenegro, which with 
Serbia makes up what is left of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Trinidad, De La Hoya in Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The deal for a welterweight  
unification fight between Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad is 
bogged down by a money dispute between Trinidad's father-manager 
and promoter Don King, the Puerto Rican fighter's family said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, said the fight is on.  
</P>
<P>
	``Don and the old man are squabbling over it,'' Arum said  
Saturday, referring to Felix Trinidad Sr. ``Don has assured me it 
will be no problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We signed the deal, King and I. The fight will happen.''  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Arum announced the deal had been struck for De La  
Hoya to receive $15 million and Trinidad's camp to get $10.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, said Trinidad family lawyer Nicolas Medina.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unacceptable. What King did was negotiate another  
$500,000 for himself,'' Medina told The Associated Press. ``The 
deal is stuck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said King already had agreed he would get no more than $2  
million. Under an original proposal already rejected by Felix 
Trinidad Sr., the fighter's father and manager, Trinidad's camp 
would receive $8 million and King $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	King could not be reached for comment. An answering machine at  
his office said it was closed for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first difference between King and Trinidad Sr., who  
lost a court case last year in which he argued the promoter no 
longer had contractual rights over his son. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed fight still would depend on De La Hoya beating Oba  
Carr in defense of his WBC title on Saturday night and Trinidad, 
the IBF champion, beating Hugo Pineda on May 29 in Puerto Rico 
</P>
<P>
	It would take place Sept. 18 in Las Vegas and would be televised  
on pay-per-view, according to Arum. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad Sr. said Saturday that he is demanding an additional $8  
for every cable viewer over 850,000. Trinidad has a contract with 
HBO.

<HEADLINE> Nipple Saved in Breast Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One obstacle to breast reconstruction after a mastectomy is  
doctors' reluctance to salvage the original nipple. Now researchers 
are testing the idea this may sometimes be possible. 
</P>
<P>
	During a mastectomy, doctors may painstakingly preserve the skin  
of the breast, but they almost always discard the nipple and 
areola, leaving plastic surgeons to create a look-alike 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is fear the nipple will harbor cancer. All parts of  
the breast connect to the nipple, so the tumor may extend there, 
too. Studies done in the 1970s and '80s found the nipple is 
involved in between 8 percent and 50 percent of breast cancer 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, many cancer patients would like to preserve the  
nipple as well as the rest of the surface of the breast. Now 
doctors at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in 
Dallas have cautiously begun an experiment to see if this can be 
done safely. So far, they have retained the nipples of eight women 
who underwent skin-sparing mastectomies. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of severing the nipple completely, surgeons make a  
half-moon cut around the top of the areola and use this opening to 
hollow out the breast. Then they fill the breast and stitch the 
nipple back in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just blows you away how good this looks,'' says Dr.  
Geoffrey Robb, a plastic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike those with reconstructed nipples, these women retain some  
sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors felt justified trying this approach after reviewing the  
cases of 326 mastectomy patients at the hospital in the early '90s. 
They found that the nipple is most likely to contain hidden cancer 
when the primary tumor lies in the central part of the breast or if 
the breast contains more than one obvious tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Christine Laronga of M.D. Anderson says a likely candidate  
has a small single tumor away from the center of the breast and no 
sign the cancer has spread to the nipple or lymph nodes. Her study 
suggests that in such cases there is less than a 2 percent chance 
that the nipple is cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	She says that even if cancer is left in the reattached nipple,  
it should be easy to spot early during follow-up exams, when it can 
be removed.

<HEADLINE> Hull Changes Game To Lead Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Brett Hull who knocked St. Louis out of the  
Stanley Cup playoffs was nothing like the guy who spent a decade 
trying to lead the Blues to a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	This guy thinks about checking first, defense second and scoring  
third. This guy was moved from the first line to the second and 
third lines and fought as hard as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	This guy is going to the Western Conference finals with the  
Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they brought me in, they said, `You're a checker who can  
score,''' Hull said. ``People didn't think I could do that. But I 
proved them wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull never wanted to leave St. Louis. He'd been with the Blues  
since March 1988 and he considered the city his home and the team 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
	At about his 10-year anniversary in St. Louis, the Blues offered  
him a $15 million contract, but it didn't have the no-trade clause 
he wanted. It ended up being a deal-breaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Lots of teams wanted Hull, one of the game's most prolific  
scorers, but he didn't want many of them. The Stars made his short 
list because they were a good team that was one shooter away from 
being great. Dallas saw the same thing and put Hull on its short 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	It took only two days for Hull and Stars officials to agree on a  
three-year, $17.5 million contract that included a fourth-year 
option and a no-trade clause. 
</P>
<P>
	But before he signed, he had to agree to change his game to fit  
in with the team. Scoring would no longer be a priority. In Dallas, 
forwards focus on checking and defense, with offensive 
opportunities coming when the other things are done right. 
</P>
<P>
	No problem, Hull said. If that's what it took to get a no-trade  
clause from a team that could win the Stanley Cup, he'd do it. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, so far, have been just what Hull and his new team  
hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas, which had the league's best regular-season record,  
wrapped up its second-round series Monday night against the Blues 
and advanced to the conference finals against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 2-1 Game 6 victory in St. Louis, Hull assisted on the  
game-tying goal late in the third period and on the series-winner 
in overtime. The production was especially nice considering early 
in the game he rejoined the first line for the first time in three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	But beating the Blues in St. Louis made the victory even sweeter  
for Hull. 
</P>
<P>
	Over in the home locker room, the Blues were sulking over lost  
opportunities and the finality of their season. Somewhere, team 
officials had to be wondering if things would've been different if 
Hull had been on their side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there was a sense of urgency on his part not to lose  
to St. Louis,'' said teammate Mike Modano, who scored the 
series-winner. ``It would've been real disappointing to him and St. 
Louis would've rubbed it in to him real bad. It probably would've 
affected him in a way that if we had lost, we might not have won 
the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said Hull played as if he were trying  
to prove a point. 
</P>
<P>
	``He accomplished everything offensively and defensively that he  
wanted and he did it because he got involved,'' Hitchcock said. 
``He had more turnovers in one game than he had in the other five 
combined, and he had more shots on goal. He just did everything. 
But it was all caused by his willingness to dig in deep with the 
rest of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The truth is, Stars general manager Bob Gainey wouldn't have  
signed Hull if he didn't believe Hull would fit in. It wasn't just 
Hull's promise that sold them, it was the fact Gainey saw Hull play 
a team-first approach when he led Team USA to the 1996 World Cup 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to change or he wasn't going to play here. It was  
really that simple,'' said Modano, who finally began reaching his 
superstar potential after he bought into the concept under Gainey, 
then Hitchcock. ``He's already had all the accolades -- the MVPs, 
the 1,000 points -- but like a lot of guys here, he was missing 
something very special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old Hull came into this season with the fifth-most  
goals among active players. Three of the four guys ahead of him 
have their name on the Stanley Cup. His father, Hall of Famer Bobby 
Hull, has his name on there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest Brett Hull came was in 1986, when he made his NHL  
debut in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals for Calgary. The Flames 
lost to Montreal in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	He was traded to St. Louis two years later and never got past  
the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Stars' focus this year is the Stanley Cup, Hull was  
excited about winning the President's Cup for the best 
regular-season record. Teammates didn't think much of the trophy, 
especially because the 1994 New York Rangers were the last 
President's winner to win the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The President's Cup was supposed to arrive at Reunion Arena in  
time for a pre-game ceremony April 11. It didn't show up until the 
second period, and Hull was steamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first team trophy he's ever gotten,'' Hitchcock  
said. ``He made a big issue of it and rightfully so. It meant that 
much to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As surprising as Hull's on-ice change has been, some would say  
his off-ice demeanor has changed even more. The outburst over the 
trophy was the biggest of the year for Hull, and it wasn't much of 
a fit. It's another testament to Hull's renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the season, he spouted off about needing more playing  
time, but it blew over quickly. If he were going to make some more 
noise, it would've been midway through the St. Louis series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock moved him off the front line with Modano and Jere  
Lehtinen, where he'd played all regular season and the first six 
playoff games, to a checking line with Benoit Hogue and Mike Keane. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of complaining, Hull said, ``That's what coaches are  
for. He's here to make changes to better the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this team, all we're looking at is wins and losses,'' he  
added. ``Who cares if I score, and we lose?''

<HEADLINE> Young Filmmaker Experiences Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- Sunup at Cannes. Cell phones start ringing  
at the seaside Hotel du Cap, home to the very biggest stars this 
fortnight. Soon, Mel Gibson, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and Sean 
Connery will be toweling off and sipping their morning coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Far off, in a hostel outside Cannes, Steve Race won't be  
toweling or sipping. The 25-year-old filmmaker from Oakdale, N.Y., 
on Long Island, doesn't have towels in his Spartan room, nor can he 
afford a Riviera-priced breakfast. Cold cereal and an evening 
fast-food pizza are all the budget can handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, ambitious and hungry (especially around lunchtime), Race  
is experiencing a whole different Cannes from that of the stars, 
the agents, the public relations people. Armed with a print of his 
very first film and an endless supply of chutzpah, Race knows this 
festival is his big chance. And he's making the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
	A day with Steve:  
</P>
<P>
	7:30 a.m.: Steve's fellow producer, Brian, stumbles into the  
room after a night of drinking. Steve is angry at being woken up; 
he has a meeting at 10 a.m. with a producer from London. He rolls 
over and goes back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	10:30 a.m.: Steve arrives half an hour late for the meeting,  
sweating profusely under his baseball cap. He had to run 2 1/2 miles 
to get there. No problem: He tells the producer, Beth Sanders, that 
an earlier meeting ran long. She seems to buy it. ``Besides, it 
looks good for me to seem busy,'' he says later. 
</P>
<P>
	They watch his film on a VCR. ``Labor Day,'' directed by and  
starring Steve Race, is the story of a bunch of buddies partying 
over Labor Day weekend on Fire Island -- getting together, breaking 
up, getting drunk, having sex, going home. 
</P>
<P>
	One could say it has a homemade charm. ``Casablanca'' it is not.  
</P>
<P>
	Beth tells him she's impressed with the camera work. She asks  
the budget. He dodges the question (``How could I tell her it was 
only $60,000?'' he says). 
</P>
<P>
	During the meeting, TV film critic Roger Ebert ambles by. Steve  
jumps up and introduces himself. Ebert asks: ``Do you know where I 
can buy a battery for my camera?'' 
</P>
<P>
	11:30 a.m.: Back to the hostel for a shower. Since there are no  
towels, Steve puts on his underwear and sits on the curb for 15 
minutes to dry off in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	1 p.m.: Steve is handing out postcards and posting flyers for  
his screenings on doors all over Cannes. ``Director attending!!!'' 
the flyers say. Outside one hotel, he has another big moment: He 
runs into Tim Robbins. ``I'm Steve Race,'' he says. ``I'm a 
filmmaker, here with `Labor Day.' I'd love to work with you.'' 
Robbins says nothing. Not a word. ``Well, I still want to work with 
you,'' Steve says. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve spends the afternoon canvassing the hotels, trying to get  
film company types to come to his screenings in a small basement 
room at the festival palace. But Steve has one overriding goal: to 
snag somebody from Miramax Films. 
</P>
<P>
	3 p.m.: By sheer luck, Steve gets his chance. There is a panel  
discussion featuring Harvey Weinstein, the all-powerful head of 
Miramax, and Ebert. They open the floor for questions. Steve rises. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Steve. I'm here with my first film, I'm 25. How do I get  
Harvey Weinstein to come check out my work?'' Applause erupts. 
Harvey laughs. Later he tells Steve: ``Don't worry, kid, I was in 
your shoes once.'' He says Miramax will look at the film. 
</P>
<P>
	5 p.m.: Steve is veering from his duties. Someone has offered  
him a chance to meet Jenna Jameson, a porn star. He can't resist. 
She tells him it's nice to meet someone so dedicated to his craft. 
She invites him to a party later. He tells her he'll put her in one 
of his next films. 
</P>
<P>
	7 p.m.: Hungry after an afternoon of work, Steve buys a loaf of  
bread and stick of butter. Sitting on the curb outside his hostel 
to eat it, he spies the owner looking at him. ``My favorite broke 
American,'' the owner says, laughing. He pulls out his empty 
pockets to illustrate the point. 
</P>
<P>
	2 a.m.: A long night of low-budget partying and networking is  
over. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	EPILOGUE: As the festival draws to a close, Steve still hasn't  
found a buyer. But he's made countless connections, and things are 
looking up for ``Labor Day.'' The money has held up -- kind of. 
Weinstein kept his word and asked for a tape of the film. Steve has 
even met Prince Albert of Monaco. Best of all, Kevin Smith, the 
quirky, New Jersey-born director of ``Clerks'' and ``Chasing Amy,'' 
has watched 15 minutes of the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve says that Smith told him: ``Hey man, I really liked it, it  
was funny.'' (Smith later confirms this.) 
</P>
<P>
	For Steve, that moment is the highlight of the festival.

<HEADLINE> Phillies GM Puts Heat on Schilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Now stepping into the batter's box against  
Curt Schilling: Philadelphia Phillies general manager Ed Wade. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Schilling demanded that the Phillies spend more  
money or trade him, Wade distributed a two-page, point-by-point 
rebuttal Friday in which he said Schilling was ``self-serving'' and 
``wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Curt has a right to express his opinions,'' Wade said. ``But  
that's all they are. Much of what Curt says is irresponsible, and 
his comments often are not based upon facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every fifth day, Curt has the opportunity to go out and be a  
horse on the mound. Unfortunately, on the other four days, he tends 
to say things which are detrimental to the club and clearly 
self-serving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Schilling was the guest on major league baseball's  
weekly conference call with the national media. As Wade pointed out 
in his statement, ``Baseball uses the call to promote the game and 
its star players. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, Curt used the call as a forum to discuss the  
Phillies' finances, the team's ownership group and his personal 
feelings about the direction of the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did he ever.  
</P>
<P>
	``For us to be successful and to compete and to win, they're  
going to have to go out and get a big player. We're short right 
now,'' Schilling said. ``They told us they're not ready to pay in 
the Randy Johnson financial territory. If they signed Randy Johnson 
this winter, would we be contenders? If you bring in Randy Johnson, 
Brad Radke, Kenny Rogers, you name it, we'd be a legitimate 
contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling met with team president David Montgomery on Thursday  
night during the team's exhibition game against its Triple-A 
affiliate in Moosic, Pa. Montgomery did not return a call Friday, 
and Wade said he was told it was a ``private meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that it's necessary for me to schedule a time to  
meet with him,'' Wade said. ``I'm finished with it. I said hello to 
him last night, and he said hello to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies began the season with a $30.36 million payroll, the  
fourth lowest in the National League. Despite that, the Phillies 
were 21-18 Friday, trailing NL East leader Atlanta by 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Curt had a chance to promote his own performance and that of  
his teammates,'' Wade said. ``He had a chance to talk about Mike 
Lieberthal, Scott Rolen, Doug Glanville, Paul Byrd, and others. And 
maybe he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling did praise some teammates, notably pitcher Carlton  
Loewer, saying the right-hander is ``going to be an impact 
pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But all the positives he could have gotten out of that forum  
were negated by his comments about areas in which he is 
uninformed,'' Wade said. ``It's unfortunate that he chose to use 
the spotlight and do something other than put his best foot 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling, off to a 7-1 start, has a complete no-trade clause in  
his contract, which pays him $10.8 million this year and next with 
an option for 2001 at $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He has said repeatedly he is willing to waive the clause to be  
traded to a contender, and frequently turns postgame interviews 
into impromptu rip sessions directed toward Montgomery and chairman 
Bill Giles. After beating Kevin Brown and the Dodgers on May 2, 
Schilling said, ``It's been six years since we've played good 
baseball on a consistent basis here. It's up to the Phillies 
ownership to get the players and put a good team out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What message does that comment send to his teammates?'' Wade  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the conference call Wednesday, Schilling elaborated on his  
comments in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're knocking on the door and they stand pat, I'd want to  
go,'' Schilling said. ``If ownership is not willing to make a trade 
or spend in July, they need to sell the team and give the 
Philadelphia fans what they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade declined to expound on his statement. Some excerpts:  
</P>
<P>
	--On acquiring more pitching: ``We've been trying to upgrade our  
rotation since the end of last season and will continue to try. We 
haven't turned down any trade for starting pitchers because of 
dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On Schilling's belief that Forbes Magazine's report that the  
Phillies made a profit in 1998 was correct, and the team's 
assertion that it lost money was not: ``I've been in all the 
ownership group's meetings since December 1997, and I've seen the 
bottom line. The team has lost significant dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--On Schilling's trade demand: ``Curt does not have a `trade me'  
clause. He has a `no trade' clause, which means he can refuse to be 
traded to any team. If we ever decide we want to trade Curt, he'll 
have his say. But Curt does not have the total say in this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade insisted that the controversy would ``absolutely not''  
affect a decision to trade his ace.

<HEADLINE>  NASCAR's Stewart Qualifies for Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Tony Stewart pulled off the track and kept  
going. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as the former Indy Racing League champion qualified for  
the Indianapolis 500 on Saturday, he departed with a police escort 
to the airport for a 600-mile flight to Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours and four minutes later, Stewart was on the track at  
Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., practicing for Saturday 
night's NASCAR Winston Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of good people helping me, taking care of  
things,'' Stewart said on the way to the airport from the 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where he qualified at an average 
220.653 mph. ``If you want to know, this is a lot more relaxing 
than my four-lap qualifying run just was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart started from the pole as a rookie in 1996. He started  
fifth and finished second in 1997 and started fourth last year, 
when he was the first out because of engine failure. He left Team 
Menard this season to drive fulltime for Joe Gibbs Racing in the 
NASCAR Winston Cup series but formed his own team in order to still 
race at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to drive in the May 30 race here, then take another  
quick flight to Concord for the Coca Cola 600 that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to go quicker, obviously, but we were flat-out the  
whole way around. That's all the car had today,'' Stewart said of 
his qualification run. ``We got through this part of it. We just 
have to wait and see what everybody else does from here on in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who comes from nearby Columbus, Ind., received a  
rousing reception from the fans.

	 *NO COMPETITION:* Twenty years ago, Howdy Holmes had no

<P>
	Holmes was the only first-year driver in the race, the first  
time since 1939 that only one rookie qualified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in college at the time and kind of pursued that, ended  
up getting a small Formula Ford and doing all the work myself,'' 
Holmes said Saturday, recalling his start in auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing led to another and I worked my way here and was very

	Holmes started 13th and finished seventh as a rookie and drove  
in five more races at Indy from 1982-88. His best finish was sixth 
in 1983.

from Methodist Hospital Saturday. Car owner Jonathan Byrd replaced 
Paul with Andy Michner, who was eighth as a rookie last year.

qualifying attempt because his car owner loaned his engine to 
another race team. On Saturday, as he watched from trackside, his 
son finally put a Hollansworth in the lineup.

<P>
	``I haven't thought about that too much. I'm sure that will sink

<HEADLINE>  NASCAR's Stewart Qualifies for Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Tony Stewart pulled off the track and kept  
going. 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as the former Indy Racing League champion qualified for  
the Indianapolis 500 on Saturday, he departed with a police escort 
to the airport for a 600-mile flight to Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours and four minutes later, Stewart was on the track at  
Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., practicing for Saturday 
night's NASCAR Winston Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of good people helping me, taking care of  
things,'' Stewart said on the way to the airport from the 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where he qualified at an average 
220.653 mph. ``If you want to know, this is a lot more relaxing 
than my four-lap qualifying run just was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart started from the pole as a rookie in 1996. He started  
fifth and finished second in 1997 and started fourth last year, 
when he was the first out because of engine failure. He left Team 
Menard this season to drive fulltime for Joe Gibbs Racing in the 
NASCAR Winston Cup series but formed his own team in order to still 
race at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to drive in the May 30 race here, then take another  
quick flight to Concord for the Coca Cola 600 that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to go quicker, obviously, but we were flat-out the  
whole way around. That's all the car had today,'' Stewart said of 
his qualification run. ``We got through this part of it. We just 
have to wait and see what everybody else does from here on in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who comes from nearby Columbus, Ind., received a  
rousing reception from the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable. It makes you feel good,'' he said. ``I  
know there were a lot of upset people when I left the IRL. I didn't

<HEADLINE> Immigrant Held for 9 Years by INS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An Ethiopian Jew held by U.S. Immigration officials  
for nine years while fighting deportation was released on parole 
pending a review of his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Lulseged Dhine was freed on Friday from Krome Detention Center  
west of Miami and was flown to Arizona to be released into the 
custody of friends there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling disbelief,'' Dhine said. ``It's been nine years  
and 45 days. With all the ups and downs, I'm very grateful to so 
many people who helped me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dhine has said he will be persecuted as a Jew if he is returned  
to Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
	He is awaiting a hearing on an application for relief under the  
United Nations Convention Against Torture, which prevents the 
deportation of any individual who would face torture upon return to 
a country. 
</P>
<P>
	He can apply for employment authorization, and must keep INS  
informed of his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to finally free him ``fit under law and regulations  
that provide for the release of individuals on a case-by-case basis 
for humanitarian reasons,'' said INS spokesman Michael Gilhooly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have determined that Mr. Dhine poses neither a risk to the  
public or a risk of flight at this time,'' Gilhooly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dhine was a legal refugee when he fled to the United States in  
1978 at age 14 after his family was killed because of their Jewish 
faith under the Marxist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, Dhine was convicted of seven misdemeanors, four of  
them drug-related -- including possession of marijuana. He served a 
total of several months in jail, at different times. 
</P>
<P>
	After his final conviction in 1990, the INS revoked his legal  
status and started deportation proceedings against him. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled in April 1993 that Dhine should be given  
asylum, but that decision was overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Dhine's case was covered by the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform  
and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which requires all noncitizens 
convicted of certain crimes be detained by the INS for deportation.

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Gets Stake in Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The largest-ever hostile corporate takeover in  
Europe has apparently succeeded, with Olivetti today formally 
accepting shares amounting to a 51 percent stake in Italian 
telecommunications giant Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a board meeting today, Olivetti, a typewriter and  
computer manufacturer-turned-telecommunications company, announced 
it will accept the shares collected during its hostile takeover 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Olivetti acquired 67 percent or more of Telecom, it would  
have accepted the tendered shares automatically. Below that level 
it reserved the right to accept or refuse them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boards of Olivetti and Tecnost have decided to accept the  
shares tendered in the offer and Olivetti will go ahead with its 
industrial plan for TI,'' Olivetti's chief executive, Roberto 
Colaninno, told reporters today at company headquarters near Milan, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tecnost is the Olivetti unit used as the vehicle for the  
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian stock market officials said late Friday in Milan that  
Olivetti had secured a majority stake, clearing the way for the 
completion of the hostile $64 billion takeover of Italy's No. 1 
phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Olivetti had less than 20 percent of Telecom's  
shares. But on the final day for securing shareholder backing for 
its upstart effort, most of Telecom Italia's strongest supporters 
jumped ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said today that the management handover will take  
place between ``gentlemen,'' in an absolutely ``friendly manner'' 
and not in the courts. He was expected to meet with his counterpart 
at Telecom, Franco Bernabe, on Monday when the transition phases 
will be mapped out. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said the possibility of a merger of Tecnost and  
Telecom will be the subject of many long discussions in the coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Colaninno issued a statement saying he was ``proud of  
the market response to our offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The positive conclusion ... signals the beginning of a new,  
great industrial history,'' Colaninno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The result surpassed the 35 percent threshold that Olivetti said  
it needed to press ahead with its plan to acquire Italy's former 
government-run telephone monopoly for $12.15 per share at current 
exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with a majority stake in Telecom, he is almost certain to  
push ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colaninno has put a lot into this, and he's not going to back  
out,'' said Dwayne Taylor, an analyst at the London-based Robert 
Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest disappointments for Telecom were the  
defections of almost all of its core shareholders, an investor 
group organized when Telecom was privatized in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Assicurazioni Generali, Italy's largest insurer, said it  
tendered all its Telecom shares, equal to 1 percent of the total 
number outstanding, while San Paulo IMI, a bank, turned over 0.8 
percent. Another bank, Unicredito, tendered 0.7 percent of 
Telecom's shares, and IFIL, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli 
industrial dynasty, gave up 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one core shareholder, Credit Suisse Group, said it would  
stick with Telecom's current management.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The heavyweight championship unification  
rematch between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield will be Nov. 6 
at Mandalay Bay hotel-casino, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewis-Holyfield fight will be a joint venture between the  
Las Vegas Hilton and Mandalay Bay, the Las Vegas Review-Journal 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A source told the newspaper the casinos and promoters would not  
confirm the fight because all the details have not been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, it was reported that Mandalay Bay had offered $10  
million to host the fight 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Don King has asked the Nevada Athletic Commission for  
either Nov. 6 or Nov. 13 for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis-Holyfield II would be a rematch of the controversial draw  
in New York on March 13 in what most observers thought Lewis won by 
a comfortable margin. The outcome prompted several investigations 
and proposals for reform in the scoring of boxing.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Tests Ordered on 727s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned that a mixture of fuel, air and  
electricity could spark an explosion, the Federal Aviation 
Administration has ordered emergency tests on the tubes that carry 
electrical wires through the fuel tanks on Boeing 727s. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA directive came after workers found severe wear on the  
wires and holes in the tubing on two of the jets. Mechanics also 
discovered signs of electrical sparking around the wires. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA ordered inspections last May on a similar area of the  
727's cousin, the Boeing 737. 
</P>
<P>
	That order came after mechanics found both exposed wires and  
holes in the fuel-pump conduit on a 737. The chafing was believed 
to have been caused by engine vibration and the holes were believed 
to have been caused by electrical sparks. 
</P>
<P>
	About the same time, the agency also ordered similar inspections  
for Boeing 747s and 767s. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are concerned that a cocktail of fuel, air and  
electricity could spark an explosion such as that which downed TWA 
Flight 800. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators still do not know what caused the plane, a Boeing  
747, to explode off Long Island in July 1996, killing all 230 
people aboard. They suspect fumes in the center fuel tank were 
ignited by electricity. Since then, they have been examining the 
wiring configurations on similar planes and ordering inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``telegraphic airworthiness directive'' issued by the agency  
on Friday was triggered by the findings of inspections on two 727s 
with over 50,000 hours of flight time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mechanics found wear on wiring used to power in-tank fuel pumps  
and signs of electrical arcing as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wear and arc-through condition has been attributed to  
chafing between the in-tank fuel boost pump wiring and the wall of 
the surrounding conduit,'' the agency told 727 operators. ``This 
condition, if not corrected, could result in ignition of fuel 
vapors in a fuel tank and a fuel tank explosion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA ordered airlines to inspect the boost pump area for any  
sign that fuel was leaking into the aluminum tubes that carry the 
fuel pump wires. On Friday, the 727's manufacturer, the 
Seattle-based Boeing Co., issued a separate notice to 727 operators 
outlining ways to test the pipes and repair the wires. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA order did not immediately require any wiring inspections  
or repairs -- just an inspection of the tubing for leaks and any 
necessary repairs to it. The agency said it planned to require 
additional examination of the wiring after more information becomes 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	The order gives airlines five days to perform the tests on 727s  
with more than 50,000 hours of flight time. On planes with less 
flight time, the tests must be made within 10 days or before a 
plane accumulates 30,000 hours of flight time, whichever is later. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 1,461 Boeing 727s worldwide, of which 1,081 are  
operated by U.S. carriers, according to Boeing spokesman Bill Seil. 
The problem was discovered during a routine maintenance check of 
freight carriers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials were unclear what effect the order would have on  
the traveling public, since about one-third of the planes were 
cargo carriers and the inspections could be spread between five and 
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly hope the impact will be limited, but we can't be  
sure,'' said FAA spokesman Les Dorr. 
</P>
<P>
	Seil, the Boeing spokesman, said: ``We see it as a reason to  
inspect the planes. It shouldn't be a disruption to services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing and FAA officials estimated that the tests would take  
about four hours per aircraft and cost a total of $252,000 for the 
U.S. fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of foreign-registered aircraft are not compelled to  
conduct the tests, but foreign civil aviation authorities tend 
follow FAA safety recommendations, as the agency does with 
suggestions made aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The 727-100, a tri-jet, first entered service in 1964. A longer  
fuselage version, the 727-200, entered service in 1967, with the 
last delivery being made in September 1984.

<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Paul Bravo scored twice as the Colorado Rapids  
extended their team-record winning streak to six games with a 2-0 
victory over the New York-New Jersey MetroStars on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado (6-2) goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann made three saves for  
his second straight shutout. Hahnemann has not allowed a goal in 
182 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bravo, who has five goals this season, scored on a header  
following a corner kick by Anders Limpar to give Colorado the lead 
in the 26th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Limpar had a hand in Bravo's second goal in the 76th minute as  
his corner kick sailed over the penalty box and was played back to 
the middle, where Bravo headed it past MetroStars (4-5) goalkeeper 
Mike Ammann. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado has not lost a game in regulation this season, while  
the MetroStars continued to struggle on offense. New York-New 
Jersey has scored just eight goals this season -- three coming last 
Saturday against last-place Miami.

</P>
<P>
	Ivan Gotti, the 1997 winner, was the only rider who tried to  
follow, but he could not match hi fellow Italian's climbing prowess 
in the fog and 37-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani was all alone at the finish line at Gran Sasso D'Italia,  
at an altitude of 2,343 feet. He covered the 157 miles from Pescara 
in 7 hours, 9 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain's Jose Maria Jimenez was 23 seconds behind, followed by  
Alex Zuelle and Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory pushed Pantani atop the overall standings, replacing  
Frenchman Laurent Jalabert. 
</P>
<P>
	Jalabert finished 1:05 behind Pantani on Saturday and fell to  
fifth in the standings, 55 seconds off the pace.

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Gets Stake in Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The largest-ever hostile corporate takeover in  
Europe has apparently succeeded, with Olivetti today formally 
accepting shares amounting to a 51 percent stake in Italian 
telecommunications giant Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a board meeting today, Olivetti, a typewriter and  
computer manufacturer-turned-telecommunications company, announced 
it will accept the shares collected during its hostile takeover 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Olivetti acquired 67 percent or more of Telecom, it would  
have accepted the tendered shares automatically. Below that level 
it reserved the right to accept or refuse them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boards of Olivetti and Tecnost have decided to accept the  
shares tendered in the offer and Olivetti will go ahead with its 
industrial plan for TI,'' Olivetti's chief executive, Roberto 
Colaninno, told reporters today at company headquarters near Milan, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tecnost is the Olivetti unit used as the vehicle for the  
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian stock market officials said late Friday in Milan that  
Olivetti had secured a majority stake, clearing the way for the 
completion of the hostile $64 billion takeover of Italy's No. 1 
phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Olivetti had less than 20 percent of Telecom's  
shares. But on the final day for securing shareholder backing for 
its upstart effort, most of Telecom Italia's strongest supporters 
jumped ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said today that the management handover will take  
place between ``gentlemen,'' in an absolutely ``friendly manner'' 
and not in the courts. He was expected to meet with his counterpart 
at Telecom, Franco Bernabe, on Monday when the transition phases 
will be mapped out. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said the possibility of a merger of Tecnost and  
Telecom will be the subject of many long discussions in the coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Colaninno issued a statement saying he was ``proud of  
the market response to our offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The positive conclusion ... signals the beginning of a new,  
great industrial history,'' Colaninno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The result surpassed the 35 percent threshold that Olivetti said  
it needed to press ahead with its plan to acquire Italy's former 
government-run telephone monopoly for $12.15 per share at current 
exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with a majority stake in Telecom, he is almost certain to  
push ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Colaninno has put a lot into this, and he's not going to back  
out,'' said Dwayne Taylor, an analyst at the London-based Robert 
Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest disappointments for Telecom were the  
defections of almost all of its core shareholders, an investor 
group organized when Telecom was privatized in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Assicurazioni Generali, Italy's largest insurer, said it  
tendered all its Telecom shares, equal to 1 percent of the total 
number outstanding, while San Paulo IMI, a bank, turned over 0.8 
percent. Another bank, Unicredito, tendered 0.7 percent of 
Telecom's shares, and IFIL, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli 
industrial dynasty, gave up 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one core shareholder, Credit Suisse Group, said it would  
stick with Telecom's current management.

<HEADLINE> FDA Finds Dialysis Center Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Seven more health centers have reported  
problems with dialysis machines since the government issued an 
alert about malfunctioning tubing that could expose patients to 
each other's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration issued a nationwide safety  
alert last week to all dialysis centers because of the chance that 
malfunctioning equipment potentially exposed patients to 
contaminated blood. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, four centers had reported some problem with tubing  
used extensively in the dialysis process. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the alert, another seven centers have notified the agency  
of problems, and it is continuing to investigate to determine ``the 
exact nature of the problem and what is causing it,'' spokeswoman 
Sharon Snider said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the 11 centers and hospitals have told their patients  
about the equipment problems, and said they'll conduct regular 
blood tests for exposure to hepatitis or HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	The machines are used to cleanse the blood of deadly toxins when  
the kidneys fail. There is concern because traces of blood were 
found in tubing inside the machines, Steven Niedelman, an 
enforcement director for the FDA's Center for Medical Devices and 
Radiological Health in Rockville, Md., said last week. Filters are 
supposed to prevent that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the risk that patients were exposed to blood-borne  
diseases was ``extremely remote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nipro Medical Corp., which manufactures the tubing, has  
voluntarily recalled 154,000 tubing sets. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Mary's Hospital in Tucson, one of the first centers  
identified, told its 121 dialysis patients about potential 
problems. Officials also told patients they would undergo blood 
tests for possible exposure to HIV, hepatitis or other blood-borne 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Lee Regional  
Hospital in Johnstown, Pa., spokeswoman Anne McGrath said no blood 
leaked within the dialysis machines and none of 67 patients was 
exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the other centers said anyone had been exposed to  
contaminated blood. Several did not return calls seeking comment 
and some said blood testing would be offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The other centers are Bayonne Hospital in Bayonne, N.J., Total  
Renal Care in Miami Lakes, Fla., Dialysis Clinic of Oak Ridge, 
Tenn., Maine General Medical Center in Waterville, Maine, Mercy 
Hospital Medical Center in Des Moines, Iowa, Methodist Hospital in 
Houston, Cape County Regional Dialysis Center in Cape Girardeau, 
Mo., Bay Health Medical Center in Dover, Del., and the Veterans 
Affairs Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Play Jazz Today in Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- With one missed shot, the Utah Jazz  
watched their homecourt advantage evaporate against the Portland 
Trail Blazers. Another loss, and Utah's championship homes will be 
put in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, they have played a lot better overall than we have in  
this series,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said as Utah prepared for 
today's Game 3. ``We're going to have to improve a whole lot to 
compete up there, or they're going to have to get a lot worse, and 
I don't think that's likely to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Stockton's missed drive at the end of Game 2 Thursday night  
let the Blazers escape Utah with an 84-81 victory that evened the 
best-of-7 Western Conference semifinals 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, which came after Portland nearly blew a fourth-quarter  
lead for the second time in the series, also boosted the Blazers' 
already abundant confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not go into Utah saying to ourselves, `How are we going  
to win? Can we win?' '' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said Friday 
after winning the NBA Coach of the Year award. ``We believed that 
we could win. We know we can win every game we play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland won 22 of the 25 games it played at home during the  
regular season, with one of those losses coming to the Jazz in 
mid-March, 91-77. In the playoffs, Utah has lost its last seven 
games in Portland. Its last win here was in a first-round series in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no doubt we can win one or two of those games up  
there, if we don't turn the ball over and play the kind of defense 
we're capable of,'' Stockton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers led 73-64 with 5:13 to play before the Jazz rallied  
behind Stockton and Jeff Hornacek. Their consecutive 3-pointers 
closed Utah to 82-81 with 12 seconds left. Portland's Greg Anthony 
made one of two free throws with 10 seconds left, setting up 
Stockton's miss. It appeared that he might have been fouled by Jim 
Jackson, but the officials let the play stand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the shot we wanted,'' Stockton said. ``I just should  
have made it. We don't make excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sometimes hot-headed Blazers kept their cool, unlike Tuesday  
night's opener, in which Rasheed Wallace was called for a flagrant 
foul on Bryon Russell. Wallace threw a tantrum, was called for a 
technical, and the Jazz scored four points on the possession to tie 
the game at 78-all. They didn't trail again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there was a lot of growing up that happened,'' Blazers  
power forward Brian Grant said of Game 2. ``We wanted the Jazz to 
have to beat us with their offense, or for them to have to do 
something spectacular. Which they almost did, with all the 
3-pointers they hit down the backstretch. But we were able to hold 
them off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said the Blazers planned in today's game to exploit their  
quickness advantage in the paint, even though Utah center Greg 
Ostertag has played better this series after a poor opening round 
against Sacramento. In Game 1 against the Blazers, he had six 
points and six rebounds, and he grabbed 14 rebounds Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg has had two pretty good games, which is nice because  
Arvydas Sabonis is a tough matchup for him,'' Jazz coach Jerry 
Sloan said. ``He's being conscientious about his rebounding, and 
he's doing some good things on defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz have to play better against Isaiah Rider, who continued  
his playoff surge with a career postseason high 27 points Thursday 
night. He's averaging 19.8 points in the playoffs, and is taxing 
the Jazz defense by hitting from the outside and driving the ball 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, I thought I played pretty good defense,''  
Hornacek said. ``I don't know how much more we could have done, 
unless it was making somebody else take the shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Malone, third in the league in playoff scoring at 23.9,  
behind only Allen Iverson (28.5) and Shaquille O'Neal (25.8), said 
the Jazz can't repeat their 18-turnover performance if they hope to 
win in Portland and take back homecourt advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put ourselves in a hole, and now we have to dig ourselves  
out,'' he said. ``You can't be intimidated now. They came into our 
place, they wanted to get a game, and they did. Now we have to go 
to their place. To win it, we have to win on their floor.''

<HEADLINE> Sosa, McGwire Heat Up in Homer Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A week ago, Sammy Sosa was asked about home runs. About a lack  
of them, actually. 
</P>
<P>
	Because with balls flying out of parks like crazy this season --  
it's officially the Year of the Grand Slam -- he and Mark McGwire 
weren't hitting their share. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Mark and I have started a little bit slowly, but that's  
the way we started last year,'' Sosa said. ``The numbers are going 
to be there at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How right he was.  
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Sosa hit two home runs. On Wednesday, Sosa and  
McGwire both homered. On Thursday, they did it again. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is it's a long season, a marathon,'' McGwire said,  
``and I'm ready for that journey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And next weekend, the two sluggers who thrilled the nation in  
1998 meet for the first time in 1999. Three games at Wrigley Field, 
Big Mac vs. Slammin' Sammy. 
</P>
<P>
	Really, it was just a matter of time before they got into the  
swing. Home runs are up 16 percent from last year's bombardment, 
and there is no reason to think McGwire and Sosa won't start 
catching up to Ken Griffey Jr., Jose Canseco and the other early 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Did anyone think Jay Bell (13 for Arizona) and David Bell (12  
for Seattle) would outhomer McGwire and Sosa? 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't exactly explain what's happened this year,'' said Jay  
Bell, whose career homer high is 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially when it comes to grand slams.  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, Robin Ventura of the New York Mets became the  
first player to hit slams in both games of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Fernando Tatis of St. Louis became the first  
player to hit two slams in the same inning. Nomar Garciaparra of 
Boston also hit two slams in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like there have been a ton of grand slams this  
season,'' said Mets star Mike Piazza, who hit four of them last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first 37 days of the season, there were 31 slams --  
exactly the same total as last year. But in the last week or so, 
they've been coming even more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how many runners are on base, however, Sosa and  
McGwire are marked men. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to lie to you. They've been pitching me and Mark  
a little bit different,'' Sosa said. ``Probably the pressure has 
been too much for him and myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs star had 13 homers going into the weekend,  
compared with McGwire's 10 for St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the same number of games last year, there was no hint of  
the historic race that would develop -- McGwire had 15, Sosa had 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, of course, finished with a record 70 and Sosa hit 66.  
Which is not to say that any fewer will make it a poor season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I hit 30 or 40 home runs this year, it's still a great  
year,'' Sosa said. ``Forty home runs is a great year for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, if you go to your back yard and find 40 rocks and you  
start throwing them -- one, two, three -- until you get to 40, that's 
a lot,'' he said. ``You know what I mean?'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for big numbers, McGwire rocked his 467th home run Thursday  
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be easy from here on out, the rest of my  
career,'' McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They make some good pitches on me and sometimes I swing at bad  
pitches,'' he said. ``But that's why there are six months in the 
season. I don't think everybody looks good every month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, Cardinals batting coach Mike Easler predicted  
McGwire would break loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to hit a barrage, brother, you wait. He's going to  
get a streak, and you can kind of see it coming,'' Easler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel sorry for him and Sosa. The world expects that every  
time they come up they hit a bomb.''

<HEADLINE> Sampras Tries Again To Win French </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Pete Sampras arrives at the French Open every year  
with a smile that inevitably, often quickly, turns to a tortured 
sneer. 
</P>
<P>
	He can't win, and he can't stay away. Like Sisyphus pushing a  
boulder uphill over and over through eternity, Sampras seems 
condemned to trudge helplessly on the red clay of Roland Garros 
until his playing days end. 
</P>
<P>
	The best player on the planet on hard courts and grass, he is  
reduced to an ordinary mortal on clay. He charges the net, and 
balls whiz by him. He stays back, and balls drop teasingly in front 
of him. His feet get tangled and his head spins. 
</P>
<P>
	When the French Open starts Monday, Sampras will arrive for the  
10th time. He's lost in the first round once, the second round 
three times, the third round once, and the quarterfinals three 
times. His best showing: the semis in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows all too well that a French Open victory would give him  
a career Grand Slam, and elevate him beyond dispute above all 
players in history. It was history he sought last year when he 
drove his body to the brink in quest of an unprecedented sixth 
straight No. 1 title. 
</P>
<P>
	History is all that's left for Sampras, and he began this year  
saying that the one thing he wants in the game more than anything 
else is a triumph in the French. Not a sixth Wimbledon. Not a fifth 
U.S. Open. Not a seventh No. 1 ranking. And certainly not a third 
Australian Open, a tournament he skipped in January to recharge his 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when it came time to tune up for the French at the Italian  
Open, where the clay is just as red and beguiling, Sampras found 
himself frustrated as ever. He lost in the second round to 
Brazilian Fernando Meligeni and admitted he still didn't know how 
to adjust to the softer, slower surface. 
</P>
<P>
	So, Sampras went off to practice on clay on his own, and he  
showed up in Duesseldorf, Germany, to try his stuff at the World 
Team Cup. When he won a couple of matches, he was smiling and 
sounding optimistic again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've learned a lot in the last weeks and months, especially  
that you only play good when you play a lot,'' Sampras said of his 
self-enforced vacation. ``It was good for my private life, less so 
for my tennis. But I was beginning to feel like a robot that, 
without thinking, kept hitting a tennis ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe this will be the year for Sampras at the French. Though  
probably not. He comes in seeded No. 2 to top-ranked Yevgeny 
Kafelnikov, who won the French in 1996 and the Australian that 
Sampras skipped. 
</P>
<P>
	But the main threat to Sampras doesn't come from Kafelnikov or  
the other high seeds, like defending champion Carlos Moya or 1997 
champ Gustavo Kuerten. It comes from the dozens of decent clay 
court players scattered throughout the 128-man draw. Any of them 
could beat Sampras on this surface, and leave him to trudge away 
unhappily as he does every year. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Sampras goes, so goes much of the intrigue of the  
tournament for the men. At that point, attention will shift to the 
women, where the glamour is in the game these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Will this be the Grand Slam where Venus or Serena Williams will  
break through? Where Monica Seles or Steffi Graf will make a 
comeback? 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Hingis is back at No. 1 and eager to complete her own  
career Grand Slam. The runner-up in 1997 and a semifinalist last 
year, Hingis has the style and disposition to win the French almost 
any year. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Lindsay Davenport will also be looking for her first  
French title -- she's never gotten past the semifinals -- and No. 3 
Seles will going for her third. Seles made a stirring run last 
year, when she reached the final shortly after her father's death. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory by any of them will probably upstage the men once  
more.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Club Voting on Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An icon of the Sierra Club is again seeking  
to lead the century-old environmental group, but considers himself 
a longshot for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I don't see enough votes. I'm afraid I'll miss  
again,'' said 86-year-old David Brower. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors of the Sierra Club were to vote today on whether to  
re-elect President Chuck McGrady or replace him with Brower. 
</P>
<P>
	Brower says he's running as the voice of change and wants to  
energize a 550,000-member organization that he claims has become 
preoccupied with procedure and afraid to take chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's practically no talk about what's happening to Earth,''  
he told the San Francisco Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	Brower, who served as executive director of the club for 17  
years, led the organization decades ago to a series of major 
victories, including influencing the creation of nine national 
parks and seashores, and preventing the damming of the Grand 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	But 30 years ago, the 15-member board, of which he is now a  
member, fired him after he made some decisions without consulting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrady, who runs a summer camp in North Carolina and beat  
Brower last year, said he doesn't think he and Brower are that far 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of differences in our values,'' he said. ``I  
don't think anything I support he would be against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brower's candidacy has not been greeted with universal applause  
-- there is some feeling the club has been run well in recent years 
and is heading in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that he may not be elected ``is unfortunate and in no  
way meant to minimize his accomplishments,'' said director Betsy 
Gaines of Bozeman, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Chad Hanson of Pasadena, a founder of the John Muir  
Sierrans, a subculture of the club that eschews compromise on major 
environmental issues, remains confident that Brower is just what 
the club needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This board sees itself as an administrator and is more  
concerned with governance and process than anything else,'' Hanson 
said. ``It should be out there leading, with proactive, visible 
campaigns. David offers that kind of leadership and it's 
unfortunate (that he may not get the chance).''

<HEADLINE> Leafs Not Intimidated by Dominator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Dominik Hasek is in the house, and the Toronto  
Maple Leafs are not the least bit worried. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of confidence right now,'' Toronto center Steve  
Sullivan said Saturday after the Leafs held a light workout in 
preparation for the Eastern Conference finals against the Buffalo 
Sabres and their incredible goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't faced him yet. It's not like we're down three games  
to none and haven't scored any goals. By no means are we 
intimidated right now by Dominik Hasek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most Stanley Cup playoffs, the best-of-7 series which  
begins here Sunday, most likely will be one of matchups. Buffalo's 
Michael Peca and Toronto's Mats Sundin, captains and leaders of 
their teams, are expected to be at each other's throat every shift, 
looking for that defensive lapse. 
</P>
<P>
	But all eyes will be riveted on the goalies -- Hasek, the  
league's MVP the past two seasons, and 10-year vet Curtis Joseph, 
still striving to get his name etched on the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has stopped 290 of the 308 shots he has faced so far in  
the playoffs, helping the Sabres to the conference finals for the 
second straight year. Joseph has allowed just 25 goals in 12 games 
and stopped 291 of 313 shots in leading the Leafs past Philadelphia 
and Pittsburgh and one step away from their first appearance in the 
finals since they won their last Stanley Cup in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Both goalies downplayed the oh-so-important roles goaltenders  
always assume in the postseason, when allowing a soft goal can be 
oh-so-costly in a short series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't view it as goalie against goalie,'' said Joseph, who  
will be playing in the third round for the first time in his 
career. ``There's a lot of factors that contribute to saves and 
goals. It's a team game. He's (Hasek) definitely creative in his 
style. He's come up with some different moves that other guys 
wouldn't even think about trying. He knows what he's doing and 
makes himself as big as possible. But we've got some good scorers 
on this team, and hopefully, when it comes down to it, we can put 
some goals past him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the way the goalie plays is very important for the  
team,'' Hasek said. `But there are 19 other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, who are unbeaten in five games on the road in these  
playoffs, are still without one of their key players. Miroslav 
Satan, their leading scorer during the regular season with 40 
goals, has missed the past month with a bruised right foot, injured 
in the Sabres' first-round sweep of Ottawa. He skated gingerly 
Saturday and is nearly ready to return. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Sabres have an edge, it likely is in the experience of  
last year. They upset Philadelphia in the first round, then swept 
the Montreal Canadiens in four straight and began celebrating their 
good fortune a bit too soon. They were beaten in the next round by 
the Washington Capitals in a goaltending battle that Hasek lost to 
Olaf Kolzig. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are proud we made the conference final again,'' Hasek said.  
``But last year I felt that we were over-excited just to make the 
conference final. This year we feel like it's nice to be here, but 
we want to go farther. I am positive we are a more focused team 
than last year at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This year we're a lot more humble about the situation,'' Peca  
added. ``The atmosphere around the locker room is that we haven't 
accomplished anything. We realize the opportunity that we didn't 
capitalize on. It hurt. We wanted another opportunity, and this 
year we're going to see to it that we don't let this one go.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Urges Greater Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINGTON, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton today pressed the House  
for swift passage of gun-control legislation, saying children 
should not have to worry that classmates might bring weapons to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators mindful of April's fatal shootings at a Littleton,  
Colo., high school approved legislation last week that would 
require safety locks on new handguns, ban violent juveniles from 
purchasing a firearm, and stop the import of large ammunition 
clips. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the House of Representatives will pass every one of  
these commonsense efforts that the Senate has passed to protect our 
children from guns,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. 
``And I hope they'll do it before school lets out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Panel  
said later Saturday that his panel will hold hearings on the Senate 
legislation on Thursday, but that no House vote is likely until 
after the Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the bill that the Senate passed is a good bill,'' Hyde  
said on CNN's ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields.'' ``I don't have any 
real problems with it, but we ought to hold hearings. ... It won't 
be more than a couple of weeks and we'll past a bill that I think 
will be satisfactory and the president will sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton met privately with Senate Democrats at an Irvington inn  
Saturday afternoon to thank them for voting for the gun-control 
bill and to discuss strategy on Kosovo, Social Security, Medicare 
and the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke for more than an hour, promising to present  
his plan to shore up the Medicare system next month and asking for 
help in shepherding his nominations to approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has sent 170 nominations to the Senate during the  
current Congress that began in January, White House spokesman Jake 
Siewert said, and only 34 have been confirmed. None of the 38 
nominees whose names he has submitted this year to be federal 
judges has received a hearing, Siewert said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, Clinton played a round of golf with a group  
of senators before returning to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton visited  
Littleton's Columbine High School on Thursday, one month after two 
students killed 12 classmates and a teacher before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton visited with victims' families and other community  
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning of Clinton's departure for Colorado, a student in  
Conyers, Ga., opened fire at his high school, wounding several 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``No child should have to worry that a classmate is carrying a  
loaded gun to school. No parent should have to fear sending a child 
to school,'' Clinton said in his radio address. ``No American 
should tolerate this level of violence against our children. There 
is no task more urgent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lauded House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., for his  
support for requiring background checks on sales at gun shows and 
raise the age for handgun ownership to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican, Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, said in response to  
Clinton's remarks that ``some of the steps'' taken by the Senate 
``have some merit'' and the House ``will move to consider them as 
soon as possible. He urged the administration to step up 
enforcement of gun laws and offer ``a much more comprehensive 
solution to this cultural state of emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president did repeat his challenge to parents and the  
entertainment industry to take greater responsibility for the 
influence of violent images on children. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents must pay ``attention to the shows their children watch,  
the Web pages they visit, refusing to buy products that glorify 
violence,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted the average child sees 40,000 killings portrayed  
in the media by the time he or she reaches 18. 
</P>
<P>
	He has challenged Hollywood to refrain from showing guns in  
movie ads and previews, strictly enforce its ratings system in 
theaters, and re-evaluate the content allowed in PG-rated films. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't forget the children of Columbine and all the other  
children who were lost because their culture, their society is too 
violent, their laws too lax,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Paralyzed Gymnast Visits U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Chinese gymnast Sang Lan, who was  
paralyzed during the Goodwill Games last summer, fulfilled a 
longtime wish by visiting the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanied by China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasun and a host of  
diplomats, the 17-year-old gymnast on Friday got to see the U.N. 
Security Council chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.N. symbolizes world peace,'' Sang said through an

</P>
<P>
	Sitting in a wheelchair, she also got to see Chinese sculptures  
and other gifts to the United Nations from her government. 
</P>
<P>
	Sang, a member of the Chinese national team, was injured during  
a warmup exercise at the Goodwill Games last summer in Uniondale, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	She was paralyzed from the neck down, but has regained some  
strength in her shoulders, elbows and wrists, and can raise her 
arms. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Hobbled on Road to 3,000 Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn's countdown to 3,000 hits has pulled  
up lame at T-minus 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The last thing the last-place Padres needed to see was Gwynn  
getting hurt. But there he was, grimacing as he hopped down to 
first base after straining his left calf muscle coming out of the 
batter's box in the first inning of San Diego's 5-4 win Friday 
night over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old lefty went on the 15-day disabled list Saturday.  
He's eligible to return on June 6, right around the time he 
originally was projected to become the 22nd member of the 3,000-hit 
club. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken, who all began the season with  
a chance to reach 3,000, each have gone on the DL this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic, I think,'' said Gwynn, who left the stadium on  
crutches, his lower leg in a large walking boot. ``Boggs gets hurt, 
Ripken gets hurt and now I get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing you can say, nothing you could have done to  
prevent it. It's just one of those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slumping Gwynn, who remains on hold with 2,975 hits, said  
he's taking this setback in stride. He's had to answer a lot of 
questions about his pursuit of 3,000 hits, and figures he'll at 
least get a break from that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's just the good Lord giving me a sign, `Hey, you've  
just got to concentrate on your job and just go out and take care 
of business,''' said Gwynn, whose 7-for-41 slump in his last 11 
games has dropped his average from .400 on May 4 to .333. 
</P>
<P>
	He has only one multi-hit performance in his last 17 games after  
getting two or more hits 12 times in his first 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the Reds' Brett Tomko, Gwynn hit a two-hopper to second  
base to start an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I topped the ball so I knew I had to go,'' Gwynn said. ``First  
step it grabbed me, second step, I just couldn't go. So I was 
hopping down the line. The crowd reaction to me was funny because I 
know they were following the ball to second to short to first, and 
when they threw to first, I was nowhere to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was hopping down the line, keeping all his weight on his  
right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bruce Bochy and several players joined a team training  
in rushing out to check on Gwynn, who shares the NL record for 
batting titles -- eight -- with Honus Wagner. He was helped off the 
field by a trainer and a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn said his teammates thought he tore his Achilles' tendon,  
which really would have been bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was on the disabled list last Aug. 13 to Sept. 1 with an  
inflamed left Achilles' tendon, and in 1996 missed 30 games with a 
frayed right Achilles' tendon. He still won the batting title in 
'96. He also missed time with a strained right calf in June 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the doctors started checking it right away, everybody was  
like taking a sigh of relief that it wasn't the Achilles,'' he 
said. ``It hurt almost as bad as the other one (in '93), or the 
Achilles'. I mean, it just grabbed me. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 15 days we'll see how it feels, because right now it  
doesn't feel real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being swept by the New York Yankees in the World Series,  
this season has been one big ache for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Carlos Hernandez tore his left Achilles tendon in spring  
training, sidelining him for the year, and Bochy has not had his 
original starting eight together since opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman George Arias was on the DL for 24 games early in  
the season, and slumping first baseman Wally Joyner went on the DL 
Thursday, retroactive to Monday, with a chip fracture of his left 
shoulder. Catcher Jim Leyritz is expected to be out for up to a 
week, but he might be cleared to pinch-hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just the number, but it's as much the quality of  
players we're losing,'' said general manager Kevin Towers, who 
called up Triple-A outfielder Mike Darr to fill Gwynn's roster 
spot. ``You don't replace guys like Wally and Tony very easily.''

<HEADLINE> Cops: Ga. Gunman Limited Firepower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The teen-age gunman who wounded six  
classmates when he allegedly opened fire at a Georgia high school 
had access to more firepower at home, but chose not to use it, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision -- coupled with 15-year-old Thomas Solomon Jr.'s  
apparent effort to aim low during his shooting spree Thursday -- 
suggests to some that he was trying to avoid killing his Heritage 
High School classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just trying to be heard and not trying to kill  
anybody,'' fellow student Kent Cason said Friday. ``He had his 
chance and he didn't take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who intend to try Solomon as an adult, have charged  
him with 19 felonies, including aggravated assault, illegal weapons 
possession and cruelty to children. The attack left six students 
wounded, none critically, exactly one month after 15 people died in 
the high school shooting rampage in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	If Solomon really sought to leave a trail of bodies behind, he  
could have stolen more powerful weapons from his stepfather's 
locked cabinet at their suburban Atlanta home, according to Sheriff 
Jeff Wigington. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, he chose only a .357 Magnum revolver and a  
sawed-off rifle, which he hid in the legs of his baggy jeans 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot more firepower available to him,'' Wigington  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon also apparently aimed low -- all of the victims' wounds  
were below the waist, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Cason, a 19-year-old senior, said Solomon seemed to  
show a sense of a conscience just prior to the shootings -- warning 
two students to stay away from the school building where he 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told them to stay there so they wouldn't get hurt, and then  
walked into the building,'' Cason said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the suspect -- described as a quiet, typical teen  
who grew sullen after his girlfriend recently dumped him -- was 
making a desperate cry for attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly he had the option and the weapon to do more damage,  
and in not doing that, what he was doing was a way of getting 
attention,'' said Richard Gelles, professor of child welfare and 
family violence at the University of Pennsylvania. ``He knew he 
would get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former acquaintances in Kernersville, N.C., where  
Solomon's family lived for three years until moving to Georgia in 
1997, recalled how he liked to show off his stepfather's guns and 
sometimes talked about bringing one to school. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant Morrison, who attended Atkins Middle School with Solomon,  
said Solomon became fascinated with weapons after an armed man 
tried to steal a minivan from the driveway of the family's home 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Solomon also had his own gun, which he kept in a  
dresser drawer, his friends said. He told people that it was a 
birthday present from his stepfather, said Mike Karriker, 17, who 
lives near Solomon's former home. 
</P>
<P>
	At a closed meeting of parents and students held at a church  
Friday, Solomon's distraught ex-girlfriend, 15-year-old Cara Ward, 
broke down in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said 'I want you to know I was not involved,''' said Jenny  
Stephens, a freshman who is an acquaintance of Miss Ward. ``Then 
she said she couldn't do this anymore and she ran off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those on hand for the meeting -- scheduled by Rockdale County  
school administrators to provide information and hear feedback from 
students and their parents -- said Miss Ward returned about 25 
minutes later and was consoled by friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``She doesn't want anyone to think she's the cause of all of  
this,'' Miss Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students returned today to the school for the first time since  
the shooting to pick up their book bags and other belongings. When 
classes resume Monday, school officials said those students 
satisfied with their grades will be excused from taking final 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're just all trying to get our lives back,'' said  
senior Brian Skelton, 18.

<HEADLINE> Jackson: African Conflict Ignored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Fresh from participating in Sierra Leone's  
cease-fire negotiations, the Rev. Jesse Jackson today accused the 
U.S. government and media of virtually ignoring that bloody 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who traveled to West Africa last week as special envoy  
for the United States, said a lack of concern for Africa has 
allowed the war to be ``fought in the dark'' for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We jumped in to protect the Albanians being driven out of  
Kosovo, but Africans have to defend themselves,'' Jackson told 
reporters at his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition headquarters in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month Jackson helped secure the release of three  
American servicemen held captive by Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson also blasted the Western media for neglecting its  
obligation to shed light on the situation in Sierra Leone, while 
covering every inch of the crisis in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	He called for increased aid to Sierra Leone, arguing that the  
country's soldiers have little incentive to stop fighting because 
the army is their only source of food and money. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and representatives from the United Nations and the  
Organization of African Unity convinced President Ahmed Tejan 
Kabbah and Foday Sankoh, leader of the Revolutionary United Front, 
to sign an agreement to lay down their weapons on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace talks are to start the following day.

<HEADLINE> Report: bin Laden Associate Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A sixth suspect linked to the alleged terrorist  
mastermind behind last year's U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and 
Tanzania was arrested this week on perjury charges, The New York 
Times reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ihab M. Ali, whose citizenship was not known, was charged  
Wednesday with perjury after arriving in New York, the Times 
reported. The charge was apparently leveled in an unusual closed 
hearing in federal court, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities declined comment Saturday on the Times  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not saying anything about this,'' said Joe Valiquette,  
an FBI spokesman. A call to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan was not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Public court records contain no charges against Ali, reportedly  
a resident of Orlando, Fla. It is extremely unusual for anyone to 
be charged secretly in U.S. courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Little information was available about Ali, who is thought to be  
in his 30's. The Times reported that he was probably being 
investigated in connection with a broader probe of bin Laden, and 
is not necessarily linked directly to the Aug. 7 embassy bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Ali Mohamed, a naturalized U.S. citizen and  
former Army sergeant, was accused of training members of bin 
Laden's al Qaeda terrorist organization and of helping move bin 
Laden from Pakistan to Sudan in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	He also allegedly provided training to a group of Islamic  
militants who were later implicated in the 1993 World Trade Center 
bombing and in a plot to blow up New York City landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	With Ali's arrest, six suspects in the bin Laden investigation  
are known to be in custody in the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
in New York. Another eight suspects, including bin Laden, have been 
charged but have not been apprehended. Another suspect is awaiting 
extradition from Britain.

                          *'Joe Homeless'    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man known as Joe Homeless who spent more than  
a decade living on the streets of New York City and had his story 
published, died Tuesday of heart failure at age 56. 
</P>
<P>
	The man used Joe Homeless as a pen name and, according to  
friends, did not want his real name known. He died at Columbia 
Presbyterian Hospital, according to George McDonald, president of 
The Doe Fund, Inc., a nonprofit organization that assists homeless 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a tape recorder he had fished out of the trash, Joe  
Homeless dictated his story while still living on the streets. The 
tapes were later transcribed and published by New Horizon Press 
under the title, ``My Life on the Streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He guarded his privacy jealously,'' said friend Julie Weiner,  
a health counselor who met Joe in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	She would pass him in the mornings -- she on her way to work at a  
Manhattan hospital, he in the cardboard box at 77th and Lexington 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
	``First he asked me for a quarter. Then he said, 'Hey, you know  
any typists?''' Weiner said. That caught her attention. Weiner, 
along with several other volunteers, later helped him transcribe 
the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his own account, Joe grew up on the Lower East Side  
of Manhattan, and was evicted from his parents apartment in 1979, 
some 10 years after they had died. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years before his death, Joe was able to turn things  
around, and used his mechanical skills to start his own 
refrigeration repair business, according to the Doe Fund.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Pitcher Hits Three Straight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Anaheim knuckleballer Steve Sparks  
tied a major league record by hitting three straight batters in the 
third inning Saturday night against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, two 
of them with the bases-loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Sparks also hit Jose Canseco in the first inning, giving him  
four overall to tie the major league mark for a nine-inning game 
since 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander hit Paul Sorrento to load the bases with two  
outs in the third. He then hit the next two batters, Miguel Cairo 
and Kevin Stocker, to force in two runs that gave Tampa Bay a 3-2 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time in modern history a pitcher has hit three  
consecutive batters. The others were Houston's C.J. Nitkowski 
(1988), the Chicago White Sox's Wilbur Wood (1977) and Pittsburgh's 
Dock Ellis (1974). 
</P>
<P>
	Sparks became the first AL pitcher since Bert Blyleven on April  
22, 1988, to hit four batters in a game.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Charmer Wins at Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Favorite Olympic Charmer won by  
1 1/4-lengths over Dianehill Saturday in the $150,000 Railbird Stakes 
for 3-year-old fillies at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	With jockey Chris McCarron returning to action after sustaining  
a hairline fracture of his left heel two weeks ago, Olympic Charmer 
ran seven furlongs in 1:21 -- three-fifths of a second off the track 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Never worse than second in five previous starts, Olympic Charmer  
took the lead from Lacquaria soon after the start, disposed of her, 
then resisted the challenge of Dianehill through the final three 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic Charmer, who carried 115 pounds, paid $3.40, $2.60 and  
$2.40. Dianehill, ridden by Alex Solis at 115 pounds, paid $6 and 
$4.20. Fee Fi Foe, with Gary Stevens aboard at 116 pounds, paid 
$5.20 to show.

<HEADLINE> Plan May Keep Newspaper Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Activists in the black community hope a new  
financing arrangement for the Defender will bring stability to the 
94-year-old newspaper and help it remain faithful to its crusading 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Defender is the only daily newspaper that tells our  
story,'' said the Rev. Al Sampson, who heads the Citizens Committee 
to Save the Chicago Defender. ``It has told our story throughout 
the black liberation movement, and we need it to keep telling that 
story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit businessman Don Barden announced an agreement in  
principle Thursday with Sengstacke Enterprises Inc., which 
publishes the Defender and three other black-oriented newspapers. 
Terms of the deal were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Defender has suffered in recent years, but I think we have  
an opportunity to get back on track,'' Robert Sengstacke, 
great-nephew of the newspaper's founder, said Friday. ``There are 
reasons why the Defender is 94 years old, why it has survived; it 
still provides a service to this community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being a fixture in Chicago since 1905, the  
Defender was read by thousands in the South, where it was 
distributed by Pullman porters and sold by newsboys who risked 
being lynched for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The early Defender inflamed southern whites by encouraging  
blacks to leave the Jim Crow laws and cotton fields of the South to 
take jobs in northern factories. It also became home to black 
writers ignored by the white press, including Langston Hughes and 
W.E.B. DuBois. At its peak in the 1930s, the Defender had a 
circulation of 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defender's future was put up for grabs after John  
Sengstacke, nephew of the paper's founder Robert Abbott, died in 
1997 at 84. In 1975, he placed Sengstacke Enterprises Inc. in trust 
with instructions that it be sold upon his death; his heirs had no 
say in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Some feared Northern Trust Co., Sengstacke's trustee, would sell  
the newspaper and its sister papers -- the Michigan Chronicle, the 
Pittsburgh Courier and the Memphis Tri-State Defender -- without 
concern for their activist history. 
</P>
<P>
	Barden -- who owns the Majestic Star riverboat casino in Gary,  
Ind., five Illinois radio stations and other businesses -- said his 
goal was to maintain the company legacy as well as provide growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Diego Gutierrez scored two goals against his  
former team as the Chicago Fire defeated the Kansas City Wizards 
3-1 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire (6-3) kept its hold on first place in the Western  
Conference of the MLS, snapping a two-game losing streak. Kansas 
City remains in the cellar at 1-8. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez scored in the 27th and 76th minutes. The midfielder  
appeared in 28 games for Kansas City in 1996 before suffering a 
devastating knee injury in 1997. Chicago picked up Gutierrez in the 
eighth round of the MLS expansion draft, and he became a key 
component of the Fire's 1998 title run. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez scored his first goal on the rebound of a Ante Razov  
shot that struck the left post and dribbled to the top of the 
Wizards penalty area and ripped a 22-yard shot into the left corner 
of the net for his second. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Wolff scored the Fire's first goal of the night, slashing  
through the penalty area to reach a pass from Jerzy Podbrozny and 
slip a shot past Wizards goalkeeper Chris Snitko in the 17th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo Johnston scored the lone goal for Kansas City, netting a  
header on a cross from Jake Dancy in the 57th minute. Preki also 
assisted on the play.

<HEADLINE> Panic May Have Hit Gore Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At this point in his presidential campaign,  
the thing Al Gore has most to fear is fear itself. It can be 
contagious, and turn headaches into hazards. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president has his political problems. But he has a long  
lead in the polls of Democratic support for the 2000 nomination, an 
even wider one in fund raising, endorsements from across the party 
hierarchy and the advantages of office. Vice presidents seeking to 
be nominated for president seldom are denied. 
</P>
<P>
	Which is not to suggest that it is a role without difficulties.  
Any vice president faces a challenge in showing himself to be his 
own man, not just the supporting player in the current job 
description. Presidents have more often been silent than actively 
supportive of their No. 2 men. 
</P>
<P>
	Not President Clinton. He's an aggressive Gore campaigner, so  
determined to promote him that he telephoned The New York Times to 
volunteer that he wasn't alarmed at the state of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	And to volunteer that ``it's in a lot better shape now than it  
was eight weeks ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was widely reported to be irked at Clinton's intervention  
and awkwardly public advice. ``If he did not advise me to loosen 
up, he would be the only person in the United States who didn't,'' 
Gore said in a Newsweek interview. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been an easy season for the Gore campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	There are polls suggesting slippage. Congressional Democrats are  
said to be restive about his ability to rally the party behind a 
2000 ticket, with House control within reach. Commentators were 
calling it sluggish and top-heavy with competing senior aides, 
before Clinton ventured his own commentary for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	As though it were remarkable, media and campaign analysts came  
on the discovery that former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's challenger 
for the Democratic nomination, is a real candidate, one who can 
raise the money and enlist the support to make a race of it next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore contributed his own gaffes, most notably his claim in a TV  
interview that in Congress, he ``took the initiative in creating 
the Internet,'' which actually dates from 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk of internal bickering, and that the  
candidate-vice president was miring himself in detail work. Gore 
has just appointed Tony Coelho, a former congressman and veteran 
political manager, to head the campaign. Clinton suggested to the 
Times that ``he'll really take a lot of the burdens off the vice 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has raised more campaign money than any other 2000  
candidate, $8.9 million in the first three months of the year, more 
than twice as much as Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Democratic polls, he runs far ahead of Bradley, both  
nationally and in the early primary states, although he can't boast 
about it without undercutting his own argument that polls showing 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush or Elizabeth Dole both ahead of him are 
meaningless because it is so early. 
</P>
<P>
	He's just begun a series of policy speeches to start telling  
voters what he would do as president, the first on education. He 
called his proposals revolutionary, although they were essentially 
an expansion of Clinton administration proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	That gets to the chronic problem of vice presidents running for  
promotion. They have to demonstrate both loyalty and independence. 
After a term or two of submerging themselves, they have to emerge 
with their own proposals and promises. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents aren't always helpful. Dwight D. Eisenhower said he  
couldn't remember a major idea Richard M. Nixon had contributed to 
his administration, but given a week, might think of one. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyndon B. Johnson wouldn't give Hubert H. Humphrey running room  
in 1968, when the hint of a Vietnam peace gesture might have turned 
the election he lost. 
</P>
<P>
	No president has more actively supported his vice president for  
nomination than Clinton for Gore in 2000. That help comes with 
special baggage after the sex-scandal impeachment of Clinton, with 
Gore devotedly pronouncing him a great president anyhow, while 
condemning his personal misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Leftover scandal fatigue could still be a problem for Gore.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans think so.  
</P>
<P>
	``One of Mr. Gore's biggest challenges is that he's been head  
cheerleader at Bill Clinton's pep rallies, and people are finding 
that a serious error in judgment,'' said Lamar Alexander, running 
for the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But cheerleading goes with the job Gore holds. His test now is  
to move beyond it in campaigning for the job he wants. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 'Sure-Fire' Products Became Flops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Let's hop into the Edsel, pop the top off a  
Crystal (clear) Pepsi and stick some Menudo in the eight-track 
player as we take a trip down Memory Lane, in search of products 
lost on the road to the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Century's end seems a good time to take a look at some  
``sure-fire'' consumer goods that made a splash, only to litter the 
pages of history as high-profile, and often high-priced, flops. 
</P>
<P>
	What will we encounter while touring the Land of Misfit  
Products, besides a hamburger made with a seaweed derivative, a 
``smokeless'' cigarette, and an Apple Newton (which was supposed to 
decipher handwriting, remember)? How about a crank to start a Model 
T? 
</P>
<P>
	All this stuff has one thing in common: It was everywhere once,  
and it's nowhere now. 
</P>
<P>
	``These products all sounded like good ideas, but you never  
really know because you're dealing with the consumer,'' said Bobby 
Calder, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's 
Kellogg Graduate School of Management. ``The minute you think 
you've got consumers figured out, you're in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing experts say 80 percent of all new products fail upon  
introduction and serve only to provide fodder for trivia magazines, 
Web sites and stories like this one. Another 10 percent disappear 
within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 25,000 new products were introduced in the food, beverage,  
beauty and health care market last year alone. There were 5,500 new 
toys, hundreds of new car models. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far easier for a product to fail nowadays than it is to  
survive,'' says Robert McMath, a former Procter &AMP; Gamble marketing 
executive who now runs the New Products Showcase and Learning 
Center in Ithaca, N.Y. ``Any one of a million things could go 
wrong, including the wrong packaging, the wrong price or an awful 
taste. A lot of it is that it's the wrong product at the wrong 
time, or too many of the same products at one time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Sony's case, the Betamax was regarded as far superior in  
sound and picture quality to VHS formats, but consumers turned 
their noses up on the price. Folks also soured on Frito-Lay's 
lemonade, and had no sweetness in their hearts for the 
sugary-tasting New Coke, which tasted a lot like the old Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
	Among famous stinkers, Ford's Edsel was an icon. It was named  
for Henry Ford's son and introduced as the car of the future in the 
fall of 1957 after the company spent $250 million on development 
and consumer surveys on what to name it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the two years before its introduction, Ford employed its  
marketing might in teaser ads and leaked information to position 
the car as unlike anything ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've never had it like this before,'' one ad said.  
</P>
<P>
	Few wanted it.  
</P>
<P>
	Ford executives had hoped to sell more than 200,000 in the first  
year but ended up selling only 63,107. In its entire three-year 
run, only 110,847 Edsels were sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-ton behemoth -- actually seven different Edsel models in  
the first year -- came with push-button gear selector systems in the 
steering wheel and ``horse collar'' grills. But to the 2.5 million 
Americans who crowded into showrooms the week of Sept. 4, 1957, 
they appeared to be nothing more than expensive, odd-looking 
versions of cars already on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted, Ford treated Americans on Oct. 13 to ``The Edsel  
Show,'' a one-hour CBS special in place of ``The Ed Sullivan 
Show,'' with hosts Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and other stars. 
</P>
<P>
	There was even a chance to win a free pony if you'd just come in  
for a test drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Still no sell.  
</P>
<P>
	Might the Edsel have done better with another name? Hard to say,  
considering the alternatives. Among the 6,000 names proposed for 
the wonder car: the Utopian Turtletop, the Pastelogram and the 
Mongoose Civique. 
</P>
<P>
	What went wrong? Automotive historians say Ford goofed by  
pitching the Edsel as revolutionary, while consumers thought it 
merely revolting. Its introduction also came during a recession 
that caused automobile sales to tumble and consumers to shy away 
from larger cars. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Edsel quickly developed a reputation as a lemon because  
workers at Ford and Mercury plants hated the fact the Edsel models 
were produced on the same assembly lines as other cars. They often 
``forgot'' to apply special Edsel parts out of different bins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Edsel served as a textbook example of corporate  
presumption and disregard for market realities,'' says Anthony 
Young, a writer for Automobile Quarterly magazine. ``It also proved 
that advertising and pre-delivery hype have their limits in 
inducing consumers to buy a new and unproved car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer dislike also quickly snuffed out RJR Nabisco Holdings  
Corp.'s smokeless cigarette, a $325 million project first called 
the Premier. 
</P>
<P>
	One person who tried it immediately declared the cigarette  
``tasted like (expletive).'' And he was the company's chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Back to the drawing board. A $100 million reformulation led to a  
brand-new product called Eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
	It quickly lived up to its name and was pulled off the shelves.  
</P>
<P>
	``It took them a while to figure out that smokers actually like  
the smoke part of smoking,'' McMath notes. ``The only people who 
loved the product were nonsmokers, and they somehow weren't the 
market RJR was trying to reach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other products became victims of technological evolution.  
</P>
<P>
	You'd be hard-pressed now to find an abacus, or a Dictaphone or  
even a manual typewriter. And 33 rpm LP record albums? You can find 
those, millions of them: Just look in the basements and garages of 
people over 40 who ``just know'' they're going to listen to them 
again someday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ernie Hovland, 73, remembers the days when he watched relatives  
start the Model T with a crank. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life was a little slower in the old days,'' he acknowledges,  
``but new technology was just as exciting then as it is today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some products were ahead of their time. Apple's Newton  
electronic personal assistant fell far from the tree and 
disappeared after the product had problems living up to its selling 
point: the ability to read the user's handwriting and store that 
data. 
</P>
<P>
	Once universal but gone now, too: home fallout shelters, a  
backyard must at the height of the Cold War. They've now gone the 
way of the ice truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Some products may have fallen by the wayside because of  
government taxes on imports or restrictions on sales. Other 
inventions evolved, and not a moment too soon. Hydraulic elevators 
that had an alarming failure and fatality rate in early skyscrapers 
were quickly replaced by electric versions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, consumers must deal with the idea of planned  
obsolescence. A Wall Street Journal writer once encapsulated the 
term's meaning: 
</P>
<P>
	``The marvels of modern technology include the development of a  
soda can which, when discarded, will last forever -- and a $7,000 
car, which, when properly cared for, will rust out in two or three 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A shameless example of limited upside potential was The Nothing  
Box, a $25 item in a 1964 Hammacher Schlemmer catalog that promised 
to do exactly as it advertised. 
</P>
<P>
	``This box does something; it blinks and that's all,'' the ad  
says. ``Let us warn you that unless you use an ax, you can't turn 
it off. It will keep winking its eight eyes in no recognizable 
pattern and for no apparent reason for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then it's as dead as a mackerel and you can't get it fixed.''  
</P>
<P>
	You also could get an accompanying Nothing Rock for the same  
price. This product, likely a cousin to the Pet Rock, was 
self-explanatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the Autoskate, a sort of curved skateboard on  
wheels that you could purchase for $24.95 in 1949, slip under your 
flat tire and use to coast to the nearest service station. 
</P>
<P>
	But if you're thinking of consigning these things to the Flops  
Forever list, think about this: 
</P>
<P>
	The Lava Lamp, once left for dead on the junk heap of life, is  
back and it's groovy. 
</P>
<P>
	And you can once again be cool by squeezing into Capri pants.  
</P>
<P>
	Entrepreneurs note: Think Baby Boomer nostalgia. The future may  
be in the glory days behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Which brings us back to that laughingstock, the Edsel.  
</P>
<P>
	Collectors of the nearly 8,000 models left worldwide participate  
almost monthly in clubs and shows. A well-maintained model that 
cost between $2,200 and $6,500 new can bring $5,000 to $24,000 now. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Kleckner of Danville, Ca., bought a convertible in 1978, and  
now he's vice president of the Edsel Owners Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, you go down the roads and get thumbs-up by so many  
people,'' Kleckner says. ``I guess we'll have the Edsel to the time 
when we can no longer drive.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes Reflect NRA Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirty-two of the 34 senators who supported  
the NRA this week on each of four key gun control votes received 
money for their last election from the gun industry lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
	And only two of the 38 senators who opposed the National Rifle  
Association on the same four votes received contributions from the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign contributions from the NRA are proving to be an  
accurate barometer of how individual senators would vote on gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a 51-50 vote to require background checks for firearms  
buyers at gun shows and pawn shops that clearly reflected the 
momentum toward tighter regulations in the aftermath of recent 
school shootings. Only two of the 50 senators who supported that 
amendment received NRA money. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Miller, director of the advocacy group Public Campaign,  
decried the connection between NRA contributions and votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be no better example than this one,'' said Miller,  
whose group wants to change campaign finance laws. ``You have the 
public clearly on one side, wanting strong gun control, and a 
resistant Congress in the pocket of the gun lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA opposed efforts to add gun control provisions to the  
juvenile crime bill in the wake of school shootings in Colorado and 
Georgia. The bill passed the Senate late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and chief lobbyist  
James Baker defended the votes, saying, ``Everyone knows this won't 
stop the crisis in our schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people want existing gun laws enforced and their  
Second Amendment freedoms protected,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the five senators who received the most money from the  
NRA between 1993 and 1998 all sided with the gun lobby as it tried 
to defeat several amendments, led by GOP Sen. Rick Santorum of 
Pennsylvania, who has received $19,600 since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Another senator who supported the NRA down the line this week  
was Republican Slade Gorton of Washington, who has received $11,400 
from the gun lobby since 1993. Last Saturday, while the bill was on 
the Senate floor, he held two fund-raisers in his home state 
featuring NRA President Charlton Heston. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton told his supporters that Congress couldn't solve the  
problem of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could tell you the government could pass a law that  
can prevent this from happening,'' Gorton said. ``But the evil in 
Littleton is beyond the scope of the federal government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA opposed two amendments by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,  
to require background checks on all firearms purchases at gun 
shows. The earlier Lautenberg amendment failed, 51-47, but a recast 
measure passed, 51-50, when Vice President Al Gore cast the 
deciding vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 senators who voted against the second Lautenberg  
amendment received an average of $7,377 from the NRA. Only two of 
the 50 senators supporting the provision -- Democrat Kent Conrad of 
North Dakota and Republican Mike DeWine of Ohio -- received any NRA 
contributions. Conrad got $2,000; DeWine, $4,900. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are responsible checks to prevent guns from getting into  
the hands of felons, the mentally ill and kids,'' Conrad said. 
``Frankly, the NRA has become extreme. They're out of step with 
mainstream America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that the requirement to follow the Brady gun-check law  
should apply to everyone at a gun show and that's what this 
amendment did,'' said DeWine said. ``It basically closed a loophole 
in current law; I did not find it to be an unreasonable 
requirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., and Thad Cochran, R-Miss., were the  
only two NRA supporters who did not receive any contributions from 
the organization. But the NRA did give $4,950 to Cochran's 
leadership political action committee.

<HEADLINE> Korean War Remains To Be Exhumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year after DNA technology put a name to the  
Vietnam War pilot buried in the Tomb of the Unknowns, the Pentagon 
prepared to try the same means to identify remains of Americans 
buried as unknowns from the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 sets of remains may be disinterred at the National  
Memorial Cemetery in Hawaii, the Pentagon announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cemetery, commonly called the Punchbowl, holds 864 remains  
of unidentified soldiers turned over to the United States by North 
Korea after a cease-fire ended the conflict in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 70 are considered candidates for DNA testing because the  
records associated with them, such as military unit or recovery 
location, suggest a name, Pentagon spokesman Larry Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Name associations are vital because the DNA technique for  
positive identification requires a comparison blood sample from the 
maternal bloodline. 
</P>
<P>
	The names were not released. Greer said not all of the families  
had been contacted. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Dunton of the Korean War/Cold War Association of the Missing  
said her organization and others have lobbied the Pentagon for 
years to use DNA testing more aggressively on Korean War remains. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an excellent thing,'' she said in an interview. ``It  
needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's announcement follows the successful identification last  
year of Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Blassie, the former Vietnam War 
unknown from the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National 
Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Blassie's remains were disinterred in May and identified in June  
using the same mitochondrial DNA technology that will be applied to 
the Korean War cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The work will be done by forensics experts at the military's  
Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii. The Pentagon certified 
the use of mitochondrial DNA testing as a reliable forensic tool in 
1995 and has used the technique to identify some Korean War remains 
turned over by North Korea in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer said no firm timetable had been set for beginning the  
disinterments at the Punchbowl cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The records associated with each of the unknown remains in the  
Punchbowl cemetery will undergo rigorous evaluation before a 
decision is made to disinter,'' the Pentagon said in its 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 864 sets of remains at the Punchbowl are among the  
approximately 8,200 men listed as unaccounted for from the Korean 
War. Most of the rest are in North Korea, and the Pentagon has been 
working with the North Korean government in recent years to recover 
remains at former battle sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually the Pentagon may disinter remains from World War II  
cemeteries, Greer said.

<HEADLINE>  Olivetti Gets Stake in Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Olivetti agreed to a 51 percent stake in Telecom  
Italia SpA on Saturday, completing its David vs. Goliath attempt 
for control of the telecommunications giant. 
</P>
<P>
	After a three-month takeover bid, Olivetti settled for the  
narrow majority stake in Italy's No. 1 phone company -- even though 
the firm had hoped to win 67 percent of Telecom, which is five 
times larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti, a typewriter and computer manufacturer that has moved  
into telecommunications, held a meeting Saturday at its 
headquarters near Milan, where the company's board approved the 
deal, Europe's largest-ever hostile corporate takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan stock market officials had announced the 51 percent figure  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boards of Olivetti and Tecnost have decided to accept the  
shares tendered in the offer, and Olivetti will go ahead with its 
industrial plan for TI,'' Olivetti's chief executive, Roberto 
Colaninno, told reporters Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tecnost is the Olivetti unit used as the vehicle for the  
takeover of the former state-run monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Champagne flowed Friday night at Mediobanca, the merchant bank  
that backs Olivetti, Italian news reports said. Applause could be 
heard coming from inside the usually staid bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said that the management handover will take place  
between ``gentlemen,'' in an absolutely ``friendly manner'' and not 
in the courts. He was expected to meet with his counterpart at 
Telecom, Franco Bernabe, on Monday, when the transition phases will 
be mapped out. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Olivetti had less than 20 percent of Telecom's  
shares. But on the final day for securing shareholder backing, most 
of Telecom's strongest supporters, including the IFIL holding 
company of the Agnelli industrial dynasty, jumped ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover bid by Olivetti, which was being dragged down only  
a few years ago by its personal computer division before it moved 
into telecommunications, was particularly bold, going up against 
one of the world's largest telecommunications companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti had said it needed at least a 35 percent stake to press  
ahead with its plan to acquire Telecom for $12.15 at current 
exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's success appeared to doom Telecom's proposed defensive  
merger with its German counterpart, Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said the possibility of a merger of Tecnost and  
Telecom will be the subject of many long discussions in the coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Into next year, the Italian government, as part of the  
arrangement that privatized Telecom, holds a so-called golden 
share, a 3.43 percent stake in the phone company that it allows it 
veto power over major changes such as new control or ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	But it appeared doubtful that the Italian government, which  
didn't exercise the veto power during the takeover bid, would try 
now to thwart new management. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco indicated he didn't see any  
reason for the golden-share mechanism to come into play, the 
Italian news agency AGI reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything played out in a transparent matter,'' Visco was  
quoted as saying, after calling now for a ``credible industrial 
plan with international alliances.''

<P>
	WINDSOR, Calif. (AP) -- A hot-air balloon crash-landed this  
morning near a creek in California wine country, injuring 15 people 
aboard. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Villages Flooded in Bavarian Alps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) -- Heavy rain in the  
Bavarian Alps sent streams over their banks, cutting off villages, 
roads and electricity to several towns, police said Saturday. At 
least three people were reported dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said a 75-year-old man who entered his basement in  
Garmisch to get rubber boots drowned when a gush of water slammed 
the door behind him trapping him in the celler. 
</P>
<P>
	A sudden burst of water from a flooded stream in Dirlewang in  
the Unterallgaeu district also trapped and drowned an 87-year-old 
man in the basement of his home in that village, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flooding was also reported in neighboring Switzerland to the  
south in the Lake Constance region. A German tourist died when he 
was buried by a landslide in Switzerland's Uri district, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavarian police said the worst flooding was reported around the  
village of Eschenlohe on the Loisach river, about halfway between 
Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Murnau, where military trucks that had 
driven in to deliver sand sacks were trapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Other towns hit by the flooding included Oberstdorf, Immenstadt,  
Sonthofen and the Walser Valley region, where electricity was shut 
off after a transformer station was inundated with water. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency teams used boats to rescue scores of people from cars  
trapped and stalled on flooded roads. Several cars were swept away 
by the churning water, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Streams in the entire northern Alpine region, including the  
Iller, Wertach, Lech, Ammer, Loisach, Isar and Inn were flooded, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Austria to the east, the A14 super highway and connecting  
roads were declared impassible at several locations due to 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters predicted the rain would let up in the next day.

<HEADLINE> Lucci Finally Breaks Emmy Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The streak that made her famous is over, but  
Susan Lucci won't miss it a bit. Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 18 years of losses came to overshadow Lucci's acting as the  
villainous Erica Kane on ABC's ``All My Children'' and the Daytime 
Emmys itself before she finally won the best actress trophy Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she can start a winning streak.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have had some laughs along the way,'' Lucci said backstage.  
``Because what else could I do, you know?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran actress admitted to being slightly bewildered when  
presenter Shemar Moore of ``The Young and the Restless'' shouted 
that the streak was broken and announced her name as the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `What? What streak?'' she said. ``I didn't  
understand, and I usually go a little numb ... I couldn't believe 
they really said my name. So I asked my husband, `Did they really 
say my name?' and he assured me they had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Experts had considered this year to be one of Lucci's best shots  
to win, for her performance at a hospital vigil over her anorexic 
daughter, surrounded by various ex-husbands. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape she submitted to judges showed some nuanced acting,  
said Thomas O'Neil, author of Variety's book, ``The Emmys.'' Too 
many times in the past, Lucci offered a tape with histrionic, 
over-the-top performances that judges couldn't understand in 
context, and someone who showed more range would inevitably beat 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her failure to grasp the judging system -- to know how to play  
the game -- was really to blame,'' O'Neil said. ``This year is the 
first time ever she's gotten it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Lucci poked fun at her losing streak in the past, even in  
a commercial for a sugar substitute, it was never truly 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	It loomed over the Emmys to such a point that recent best  
actresses were celebrated less for their own work than for having 
bested Lucci, said Carolyn Hinsey, executive editor of Soap Opera 
Digest. 
</P>
<P>
	Ending the streak is good for the industry, Hinsey said. ``From  
now on, no matter who wins, it's your award and your night,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A genuinely happy audience leapt to its feet when Lucci's name  
was announced and howled in protest when producers tried to cut off 
her acceptance speech. Lucci wasn't about to be stopped, though. 
Rosie O'Donnell cried harder for Lucci than for her own award for 
talk show host. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucci already has a place for her trophy: ``It's going right in  
the living room, right on the mantle, right there. Smack in the 
middle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now people can't say she's a ``19-time loser,'' she said.  
``Now they will say `Emmy winner.'''

<HEADLINE> Trinidad, De La Hoya in Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The deal for a welterweight  
unification fight between Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad is 
bogged down by a money dispute between Trinidad's father-manager 
and promoter Don King, the Puerto Rican fighter's family said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, said the fight is on.  
</P>
<P>
	``Don and the old man are squabbling over it,'' Arum said  
Saturday, referring to Felix Trinidad Sr. ``Don has assured me it 
will be no problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We signed the deal, King and I. The fight will happen.''  
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Arum announced the deal had been struck for De La  
Hoya to receive $15 million and Trinidad's camp to get $10.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, said Trinidad family lawyer Nicolas Medina.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's unacceptable. What King did was negotiate another  
$500,000 for himself,'' Medina told The Associated Press. ``The 
deal is stuck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said King already had agreed he would get no more than $2  
million. Under an original proposal already rejected by Felix 
Trinidad Sr., the fighter's father and manager, Trinidad's camp 
would receive $8 million and King $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	King could not be reached for comment. An answering machine at  
his office said it was closed for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first difference between King and Trinidad Sr., who  
lost a court case last year in which he argued the promoter no 
longer had contractual rights over his son. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed fight depended on De La Hoya beating Oba Carr in  
defense of his WBC title on Saturday night, which he did when he 
stopped the challenger in the 11th round. Trinidad, the IBF 
champion, must beat Hugo Pineda on May 29 in Puerto Rico 
</P>
<P>
	It would take place Sept. 18 in Las Vegas and would be televised  
on pay-per-view, according to Arum. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad Sr. said Saturday that he is demanding an additional $8  
for every cable viewer over 850,000. Trinidad has a contract with 
HBO.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After President Clinton took office, the  
Energy Department allowed two of its most sensitive nuclear weapons 
labs to halt background checks on foreign guests to cope with 
soaring numbers of visiting Chinese and Russian scientists. 
Officials now concede the move was a security blunder. 
</P>
<P>
	While direct evidence has not emerged of espionage by the  
visitors, congressional investigators found at least 13 scientists 
with suspected foreign intelligence ties were allowed into the labs 
without proper CIA or FBI scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of those scientists were allowed into the Sandia lab at  
Albuquerque, N.M., while eight visited the Los Alamos lab, also in 
New Mexico, that U.S. officials believe has been a target of 
Chinese espionage for more than 20 years, congressional 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Security checks, mandatory before 1994, were reinstated last  
November amid growing Clinton administration worries about Chinese 
espionage at the government's premier weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. officials have no evidence that nuclear secrets were  
lost to any of the 4,409 Russian and Chinese visitors between 1994 
and late 1998, when background checks were reinstated, they have no 
guarantee information did not escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I am concerned, the exemptions (for background  
checks) should never have been given,'' said Ed Curran, a veteran 
FBI official who last year took over counterintelligence at the 
Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to have the information to make a decision (on  
access). The lab director has to know who is on his site,'' Curran 
said in an interview with The Associated Press 
</P>
<P>
	The administration made it a priority after the Cold War to open  
up the once highly secretive weapons labs and expand their 
nondefense research programs. The surge in Russian visitors stemmed 
from an urgent need to help improve Russia's safeguards on nuclear 
material to keep it from terrorists or antagonistic states. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in Chinese visitors was attributed largely to the  
labs pushing to expand nonweapons research and broaden links to 
scientists not only in the United States but abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	According to government officials and documents, the request to  
end security checks originated in the fall of 1993 from the labs, 
which at the time were inundated with visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the number of Chinese visitors to the Los Alamos and  
Sandia labs more than doubled, from 146 to 329, according to Energy 
Department figures. The number of Russian visitors rose from 201 to 
364. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of foreign visitors was increasing, and in some  
cases it was taking months for the checks to get done,'' Energy 
official Joan Rohlfing said. ``It was such an inefficient system 
that it simply was not enabling any of the programs to move 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Energy officials agreed to the labs' request to end the  
background checks. Rohlfing said the exemption was supposed to be 
``only for visitors who were going to unclassified areas of the 
laboratory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, the investigatory arm of  
Congress, first found problems with the termination of background 
checks in a 1997 report. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO documented ``13 instances where persons with suspected  
foreign intelligence connections were allowed access without 
background checks -- eight visitors went to Los Alamos and five went 
to Sandia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Available records also indicated that eight other persons with  
suspected connections to foreign intelligence services were 
approved for access to Sandia during the period; however, DOE and 
Sandia lacked adequate records to confirm whether the persons 
actually accessed the facility,'' the GAO added. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO auditor Victor Rezendes said suspending background checks  
only invited trouble. ``The safeguards you put on windows and doors 
may not stop a burglar, but you don't want to sleep with your door 
open,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson reinstated the background  
checks in November as a congressional committee was finishing an 
investigation into reports of Chinese theft of U.S. technology, 
including alleged espionage at the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a longtime Los Alamos scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired  
and remains under suspicion of providing secrets to China. The FBI 
is investigating, but Lee denies any wrongdoing and has not been 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO repeatedly decried potential losses, even though  
visitors, with rare exception, are not allowed into the most secure 
sections of the research labs and are supposed to be monitored 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO investigators in 1997 found classified or sensitive material  
in areas frequented by visitors. In one example, six boxes, marked 
``sensitive material'' in red letters, were found in the hallway of 
a lab where foreign visitors walked. Classified information also 
was found in a newsletter available to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the problem was little spending for  
counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, according to GAO, Los Alamos spent $100,000, or $111  
per Russian or Chinese visitor, to monitor possible espionage. That 
was less than one-fifth the amount spent by another lab, Lawrence 
Livermore, which had about half as many visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked recently whether foreign visitors posed a threat, John  
Browne, director of the Los Alamos lab, replied, ``Yes, a potential 
threat. The potential is there.'' Still, he defended the visitor 
program, saying it is important to interact with international 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	While reversing the decision on background checks, Richardson  
also has been an advocate of the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be careful that we don't penalize the foreign  
visitors program that so far has not been the source of the 
problem,'' Richardson said. ``If we cut our foreign visitor 
program, it will hurt our national security.''

<HEADLINE> TV Changes Forever Alaskan Tribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCTIC VILLAGE, Alaska (AP) -- This was a gift from the Creator,  
like the caribou or the snow: A plane from Fairbanks was bringing 
the Gwich'in tribe a strange black box with aluminum antlers -- a 
thing, they'd heard, that never stopped talking. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Indians stood in the snow and waited until the  
twin-propellered bird dropped out of the sky and met the Earth. A 
white man hopped out, threw open a cargo door and pulled out the 
thing everybody was so curious to see. 
</P>
<P>
	TV.  
</P>
<P>
	More precisely, a 12-inch, black-and-white Zenith. A milestone  
in 1,000 generations of Gwich'in history, a leap out of the then 
and into the now. 
</P>
<P>
	The proud owner was Gideon James, a member of the tribal  
Council. He rushed his talking box straight home, where a throng 
had squeezed into his log cabin. James fiddled with the rabbit 
ears, and within moments they saw Johnny Carson, grainy but live 
from some place called Burbank, Calif., uttering jokes no Gwich'in 
quite grasped. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, no one left until Channel 9, the only station available  
150 miles north of the Arctic Circle, went off the air at 2 a.m. 
Four hours later, when the box started talking again, the crowd 
returned. They watched and watched and watched. Twenty straight 
hours. Six straight days. 
</P>
<P>
	It was January 1980. Two-and-one-half years before a satellite  
dish went up behind the Council office; three years before Gwich'in 
tots began zapping Atari space invaders with joysticks; four years 
before the first VCR brought Rambo to the northernmost Indian 
village in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, all 67 cabins in Arctic Village, population 96, have at  
least one television. Gwich'in young are so drawn by television 
that they have no time to learn ancient hunting methods, their 
parents' language, their oral history. They dream of becoming 
professional football players, though none has ever touched a 
pigskin. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the elders, meanwhile, are learning what has been  
missing in their lives: Denim wear. Farberware. Tupperware. 
Four-wheelers. Touch-tone phones. Can openers. Canned soup. Canned 
peaches. Cabinets (for all the cans). 
</P>
<P>
	Their shortcomings, they are coming to understand, stem from not  
being like the families they see on the screen. They get plenty of 
advice on how to correct these inadequacies, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	Their boxes never stop talking.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Before the coming of the tube, the Gwich'in lived much the way  
their ancestors did for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
	They were a people toughened by immense sweeps of tundra where  
the cold chased even the hares underground. They ate raw caribou, 
roast caribou, caribou stew, caribou-hoof broth. They wore caribou 
skins, slept in caribou-hide tents, paddled caribou-skin kayaks. 
They fashioned utensils from caribou antlers, weapons from caribou 
bone. They told caribou tales, prayed caribou prayers, sang caribou 
songs, danced caribou dances. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the Gwich'in, the People of the Caribou.  
</P>
<P>
	Over time, they were touched by the coming difference: Sugar,  
metal fishhooks, tobacco, alcohol, gunpowder. None of these things, 
however, altered their subsistence outlook, their fundamental 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	Theirs was a way honest to Earth Mother, the family, the  
spirits. True, life expectancy was low, diet was limited, and the 
best hope against disease was often hope itself. But the Gwich'in 
had independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when every other aboriginal group in Alaska agreed in 1971  
to give up their land claims in return for $1 billion and a tenth 
of state territory, the Gwich'in wanted no part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7,000-member tribe held on to 1.8 million acres of ancestral  
land and, for a time, kept outsiders away from their highwayless, 
fenceless, wireless universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Zenith came to town.  
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't sleep I was so excited by that TV,'' says Albert  
Gilbert, a 43-year-old Gwich'in who, at 25, got his first hit of 
late-night comedy the day the future dropped out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to watch it and watch it and watch it,'' he said. ``I  
woke up at 6 a.m. to watch it more. I did this for two weeks. When 
I went out in the country to hunt, all I could hear was the TV in 
my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the boxes multiplied, mothers stopped making ice cream from  
caribou-bone powder and river slush, in deference to Ben &AMP; Jerry's. 
They stopped preparing ``tundra tea'' with alpine spruce needles in 
favor of Folger's instant coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Kids began chomping Bazooka bubble gum rather than dried caribou  
meat. They no longer waited for the elders to finish eating before 
starting a meal. Old legends told around campfires could not hold 
them when Bart Simpson was talking. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, beaded moccasins were outmoded by Nike sneakers, the sled  
dog by the gas-powered Ski-Doo Alpine, the wood stove by the 
microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
	The well-to-do came to be envied for their home entertainment  
centers. The average Gwich'in -- living on unemployment, welfare, 
Social Security, food stamps, Alaska dividend checks or handouts 
from the Bureau of Indian Affairs -- made do with 20-inch Sonys. 
</P>
<P>
	Several elders cautioned against the excesses of the tube, but  
listening to the old ones had fallen out of vogue. 
</P>
<P>
	``For these natives, like anyone else, television is a cultural  
nerve gas,'' explains Dr. Michael Krauss, director of the Alaska 
Native Language Center at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. 
``It's odorless, painless and tasteless. And deadly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah James, a Gwich'in artist who runs a committee that works  
to preserve tribal customs, believes the tube has done what no 
invader could: kill the Gwich'in's primal soul. 
</P>
<P>
	``The TV teaches greed. It shows our people a world that is not  
ours,'' James says. ``It makes us wish we were something else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Cora Christian trudges up the dirt trail and huffs to a stop.  
Beneath caribou antlers nailed to the front of a cottonwood-log 
cabin hangs a hand-painted sign: 
</P>
<P>
	GiLBERT'S GROCERY. ARCTiC ViLLAGE, AK.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they're not out of M &AMP; M's,'' she says. ``My  
granddaughter will scream if she doesn't get some today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She pushes the door open and sees Julie Hollandsworth, a short  
woman who lives down the road. Hollandsworth is holding a few bags 
of microwave popcorn. She says her husband just put up their very 
own satellite dish. He paid $635 for it, plus another $215 for 
shipping on the Frontier Airlines DC-3 that makes the 200-mile 
flight from Fairbanks once a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets 320 channels,'' Hollandsworth says. ``I counted them  
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian is impressed. Her five daughters would love it, she  
says. Her family is finding it a little tiresome watching just the 
one channel, KUAC-TV, hour after hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian scans Gilbert's shelves: Canned wax beans, Sun-Maid  
Raisins, condensed milk, Pringle's, cartoned fruit juice, paper 
towels, microwave popcorn, Tide detergent, buttermilk pancake mix, 
yeast, rock salt, Mr. Goodbars, Dr. Pepper, Marlboro cigarettes 
and, there they are, M &AMP; M's. That's all there is, except for the 
two walls of videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian picks up the M &AMP; M's and hikes a quarter-mile across a  
purple-and-green quilt of reindeer moss, lichens and sedge tussocks 
studded with baby spruce. The big trees are gone. Cut for firewood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Woodcutting is the only way to make money here in winter,''  
she says. ``The young guys charge you $30 for three days' worth of 
logs. Another $10 to split it, the cheats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She slides a key into the back door of her two-bedroom frame  
house. ``We started locking it ever since someone stole our chain 
saw a month ago,'' she says, remembering the time before TV when 
Gwich'in didn't need locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside is a room crammed with convenience: propane range, can  
opener, two televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is all this modern stuff good for me?'' The 43-year-old woman  
chews her lip, then recalls how her uncle, Albert James, a few 
months earlier charged her $40 to haul two couches home from the 
airstrip, a half-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have the money right away,'' she says, ``so my uncle  
let them sit out there for a month, until my federal relief check 
came. My own uncle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she says, ``nobody will give you a stick of wood for free  
anymore. All anybody wants is money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Davy Peter, a 9-year-old Gwich'in in an oversized Chicago Bulls  
jacket, is excited. After school, he raced over to Gilbert's and 
nabbed three ``Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles'' videos, and he can't 
wait to watch them. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocky John, a pudgy 12-year-old with a wad of Snickers bar in  
his cheek, and Walter Nollner, 9, are going along. Rocky wants to 
be a wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers when he grows up. 
Davy wants to be Michael Jordan. Walter, a hunter. Check that. 
Scottie Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	None has ever played a down or shot a free throw. They can't  
stop to explain. ``We gotta watch all of these movies by tomorrow 
morning,'' Davy says. 
</P>
<P>
	James John watches the youths scatter like waterfowl. ``Kids,''  
he mutters. ``All they do now is play board games, watch TV, act 
like they've done it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John is 37. He's got that wiry look, like a scarecrow made of  
cables. He wears camouflage pants, black army boots. A white 
eagle's feather dangles from his mane -- for ``spiritual power,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	One of 14 children, he considers himself trapped between two  
generations, those of his forefathers and the ``MTV wimps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the summer, John cuts wood and repairs TV sets. When he  
accumulates $350, he orders ammunition, then disappears into the 
Brooks Range for weeks at a time. He hunts and traps caribou, 
moose, lynx, wolf, fox, beaver. 
</P>
<P>
	His cabin, where he waits out the winter, is not quite four  
steps by six. The television talks from its stand. A 55-gallon-drum 
wood stove and a bunk fill much of the room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the TV, we were a tough people,'' he says. ``Not  
anymore. Now people only go hunting if they have a four-wheeler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His friend, Dennis Erick, 39, laughs. ``These modern kids go out  
there and kill anything they see,'' he says. ``They don't know 
which is a bull and which is a cow. They don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once, Gwich'in tracked caribou hundreds of miles into the  
Canadian Yukon. Today, Erick says, they follow the herds via 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two signs tacked to a bulletin board outside the  
Gwich'in Council office. One reads: PRIDE. COURAGE. TRADITION. 
</P>
<P>
	The other: FOLLOW THE SEASONAL MOVEMENTS OF THE PORCUPINE  
CARIBOU HERD. 
</P>
<P>
	Below these words hang eight satellite photos of the Arctic  
National Wildlife Refuge. ``10 cow caribou have been fitted with 
satellite collars,'' the announcement continues. ``Locations for 
these caribou are received each week ... Good hunting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the caribou come within a few miles of town, the Gwich'in  
fire up their four-wheelers or snowmobiles and rumble off for a 
shootfest. 
</P>
<P>
	``The satellite pictures help save gas,'' says Gideon James, the  
council member. He owns a Dodge pickup. ``Gas costs $5 a gallon up 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Sikvayugak and his live-in girlfriend, Marie John, own a  
piece of Arctic Village's future. 
</P>
<P>
	They have what's called a ``HUD House'' -- a 20-by-24-foot,  
plywood A-frame built with 14,000 federal dollars. It's the only 
painted dwelling in a 200-mile radius. ``I told the government guys 
I'd never seen a colored house in Arctic Village,'' Sikvayugak 
says. ``So they painted mine lemon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple added a few touches: A meat drying rack made from the  
shoulder blade of a moose, a caribou-skin rug. And, of course, 
three TV sets. Two VCRs. A Sony PlayStation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boy, Jerrald, he needed a second TV in his room so he  
could watch his shows while playing compact-disc video games,'' 
Sikvayugak says. 
</P>
<P>
	In the den is a third television, a 28-inch Samsung TV/Video  
combo. ``It's never turned off,'' Marie says, without looking up 
from a movie about a huge ship that sinks in the Atlantic after 
hitting an iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
	They have a lot of time for the tube. They are the conscribed  
components of a distant system known as the dole. Marie, 37, 
receives $821 each month from the BIA's Temporary Assistance 
Program, plus $300 in food stamps. Each year, the Arctic Slope 
Native Corp. sends an $1,800 ``subsistence'' check to Sikvayugak, a 
31-year-old Inuit. And this year, the state sent all three family 
members $1,540.88 ``dividend'' checks -- the annual payout each 
Alaskan receives from the state's $26 billion oil-royalty savings 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	Sikvayugak collects firewood, hauls buckets of water from the  
Chandalar River. Then it's time for ``Wheel of Fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so easy to sit around and watch movies every day,'' he  
says. ``Now Jerrald comes home, eats, plays Nintendo a couple hours 
with his friends, watches TV, a video movie, then goes to bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Is Gwich'in spoken in the home? ``It would be nice,'' Marie  
interjects. ``But Jerrald wants to learn about the Western culture. 
He wants to learn to fly a plane, play football. We want him to 
know English well. That way, he will be more successful than we 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Arctic Village has a landing strip. It has a tower filled with  
chlorinated river water. It has a bulldozer. It has a 1906 Russian 
Orthodox steeple. It has a school with 58 students, 13 Garfield 
posters, nine Apple computers, one bilingual instructor. It has a 
youth center with a pool table. It has a 25-foot satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
	It has no garbage plant. No plans for one.  
</P>
<P>
	So when a GMC pickup lost its muffler a year ago and the owner  
couldn't afford to order a new part from Fairbanks, the truck was 
abandoned on the side of Mountain Road. It sinks a little each day. 
The Gwich'in figure the marsh may swallow it all in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the WASHETERIA, a laundry center, 12 Maytags sit in the  
mud. They look new. But they need new gaskets, new lint trays, 
maybe a loose wire tightened. Kids play on them. 
</P>
<P>
	The rutted roads are a garbage picker's dream. A bicycle with a  
flat tire here. A chain saw with a severed starter cord there. 
</P>
<P>
	Either no one knows how to fix these things or no one has the  
tools or patience to do it. There are no televisions lying about, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
	``They get fixed,'' says Leonard John, 21, who then gives a  
Mountain Dew can a drop kick into a mountain creek. 
</P>
<P>
	Occasionally, the village council will haul refuse out past  
Lilly's Lake and dump it in a ditch straddling the airstrip. When 
planes lift off, plastic bags, foam cups, soiled toilet paper take 
flight in their wake. 
</P>
<P>
	A window of Isaac Ross' cabin frames a postcard view of the  
typical Arctic Village yard: empty Chef Boyardee tins, bales of 
fiberglass insulation, Hills Bros. coffee cans, shotgun casings, 
plastic Pepsi bottles, oil drums, dry-rotted tires, grease guns, a 
gas range, Pennzoil jugs, propane tanks, plastic forks and spoons, 
two discarded chain saws, a sink, two stripped bicycle frames and 
two snow machines in different stages of dismantlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of that junk comes from the city, from down below,'' Ross  
grouses. Down below is Fort Yukon, 150 miles south, the outpost 
where he was born 45 years ago. He lights a Marlboro, adjusts the 
red headband that confines his bear-black hair. 
</P>
<P>
	``The white man should come here and collect all this junk and  
take it away,'' he says. ``Hey. Wait a minute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross clicks up the volume on his 13-inch Symphonic TV and stares  
bug-eyed at a 30-second ad for the new Honda all-terrain vehicle, 
which retails for about $6,500. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a bad price,'' he says. ``Who knows? Maybe next year.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. United 3, Fusion 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Major League Soccer scoring leader  
Roy Lassiter had two second-half goals and Marco Etcheverry added a 
spectacular finale, giving D.C. United a 3-1 win over the Miami 
Fusion Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter has 10 goals in only eight games this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Etcheverry scored in the 90th minute on a shot over goalkeeper  
Jeff Cassar from just inside the midfield line. Cassar had moved 
forward as the Fusion pressed for a late tying goal. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. improved to 6-3 with its third straight victory. Miami lost  
its fourth straight, falling to 3-7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion missed a chance to score the game's first goal with  
30 seconds remaining in the first half, when Mickey Trotman shot 
into the side netting with goalkeeper Tom Presthus out of position. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams managed only one shot on goal in the half.  
</P>
<P>
	United entered the game as MLS's highest scoring team with 18  
goals, but didn't put a shot on goal until Lassiter scored in the 
62nd minute. Lassiter won a short cross from D.C. midfielder Richie 
Williams in front of Cassar and easily beat the goalie inside the 
6-yard box. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter made it 2-0 eight minutes later, after intercepting a  
Fusion backpass intended for Cassar from defender Pablo Mastroeni. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami pulled within 2-1 on a Diego Serna goal in the 80th  
minute. Serna's fifth goal came on a header as he deflected a kick 
by John Maessner over the D.C. defense.

<HEADLINE> NASA Computers Found Insecure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government investigation into NASA's cyber  
security found it so vulnerable to attack that hackers could easily 
disrupt command and control operations, including the tracking of 
earth-orbiting spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office said last week that its teams also  
penetrated systems that process and distribute the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration's scientific data and broke 
into many of NASA's most vital networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having obtained access to these systems, we could have  
disrupted NASA's ongoing command and control operations and stolen, 
modified or destroyed system software and data,'' said the report 
from the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials said they agreed with many of the GAO's findings  
and were working to improve security, but the report possibly 
exaggerates the extent of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with NASA personnel, the GAO arranged within the last  
year to have National Security Agency experts try to break into 
systems vital to NASA's mission. They targeted systems at one of 
NASA's 10 field centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams ``initially penetrated these systems using easily  
guessed passwords'' that provided limited access, then used that 
access to find ways of breaking through to deeper, more damaging 
areas, the report said. ``Worse still, some accounts had no 
passwords at all,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the report's findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--One hundred and thirty-five of the 155 mission-critical systems  
reviewed did not meet NASA's own risk requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	--NASA's security guidance did not specify what information can  
be posted on the World Wide Web or how critical systems should be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
	--NASA had conducted no agencywide review of its information  
technology security at its 10 field centers since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	--NASA failed to provide required computer security training and  
did not centrally coordinate responses to security incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, NASA's systems are extensively interconnected through  
the Internet ``and can be an attractive target for individuals and 
organizations desiring to learn about or damage NASA's operations, 
including would-be hackers as well as industrial spies and foreign 
intelligence agents,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who requested the GAO  
investigation, called the results troubling and unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``NASA spent more than $1 billion last year on information  
systems to support a wide range of critical missions, including the 
space shuttle, international space station and Mars Pathfinder,'' 
Thompson, chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, said 
in a statement. ``Now we're learning that the security and 
integrity of many of these computing systems is vulnerable to 
attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA official J.R. Dailey wrote to GAO officials that NASA  
agreed with many of the findings. But he said, ``Penetration 
testing of a limited number of systems at one center cannot be 
extrapolated to all of NASA's mission-critical systems at all of 
its centers.''

<HEADLINE> Sherpas Rock at World Trade Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Known around the world as Mount Everest guides,  
a band of Sherpas with a goat trekked to the highest point in the 
Big Apple for a record-breaking, high-altitude demonstration not of 
mountaineering but rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
	Group members played their roles with enthusiasm. They used  
picks and poles to climb the stairs of the World Trade Center on 
Friday. Once they got to the roof, they planted the flag of Nepal -- 
in mock victory at reaching the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing traditional Sherpa garb, they sang both in Nepalese and  
English as they belted out a mix of songs punctuated by what 
sounded like yak screams, including, of course, ``Ain't No Mountain 
High Enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The performance, held 1,377 feet above the sidewalk on the trade  
center's helicopter pad, was billed as the world's highest rooftop 
concert. It was taped as a pilot for the VH1 cable TV program 
``Rock N' Roll Record Breakers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fledgling rock band members are used to transportation dilemmas,  
but most wouldn't be willing to haul their drums, a keyboard and 
guitars up that high. It was just another high-altitude hike for 
the Sherpas though, whose audience was a few tourists who made the 
trek for the views of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Doing the show was educational for the Sherpas hoping to hit the  
big time in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they called from VH1 I thought it was another community  
gig ... I'd never heard of VH1,'' confessed L. G. Khambache Sherpa, 
36, a cab driver from Brooklyn dressed in a fur and silk cap, 
bulging backpack and colorful boots. ``I really didn't realize 
until now this would be so big.''

<HEADLINE> Peanut Growers Debate Promotion Fee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Peanut growers begin voting Monday on whether  
to assess themselves a fee to help promote their product. The plan 
could fail because of a dispute with the Agriculture Department 
over using some of the money for research. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally am not nearly as comfortable with it being what  
we as growers need,'' said Billy Griggs, a farmer in Dooly County, 
Ga., who is chairman of the Georgia Peanut Commission. ``We need a 
program that works for growers. I'd hoped that this would be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilbur Gamble, chairman of the National Peanut Growers  
Association, had similar reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our board has taken a position that. . . each farmer on his  
own will make the decision. We're not saying we won't support but 
we're not out there trying to push it,'' said Gamble, who farms 160 
miles outside Atlanta. ``I personally don't think I can support 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal basically establishes a checkoff program similar to  
existing ones for everything from beef, pork, popcorn, milk and 
watermelons, in which farmers pay to help promote their product. 
</P>
<P>
	The referendum is open to all farmers who grew peanuts between  
Aug. 1, 1997, and July 30, 1998. The mail-in referendum will run 
from Monday through June 11. The Agriculture Department last week 
sent out 13,901 ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	Approval only requires a simple majority of those farmers who  
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed assessment, equal 1 percent of the sales price of  
peanuts, would generate an estimated $10 million annually for a 
program to increase both domestic consumption and exports of 
peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
	For holders of government-issued quotas in major  
peanut-producing states like Georgia and Alabama, the assessment 
would amount to about $6.10 for each ton of peanuts sold. 
</P>
<P>
	For growers of peanuts produced outside the quota system, mainly  
for export, the cost would run about $1.30 per ton. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved, farmers would begin paying the assessment for the  
first time on the 1999 crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan came last year from 20 farm groups in the nine major  
peanut-producing states. 
</P>
<P>
	But farmers from Georgia, Alabama and Florida have complained  
the final proposal approved by USDA would bar any of the money 
raised through the assessment from being used for production 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	The original plan submitted by growers allotted 20 percent for  
that purpose in hopes of finding ways to lower production costs and 
increase profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The research is vitally important in this,'' said Griggs, the  
Georgia farmer. ``They (USDA) knew how important those areas were 
to us and yet they chose to change it anyway. I'm extremely 
disappointed. Right now I'm not looking at it very favorably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gamble believes the proposal will face trouble among farmers in  
Texas, Alabama and possibly Florida, while growers in Virginia and 
the Carolinas probably will support it. 
</P>
<P>
	A new National Peanut Board would administer the program under  
the Agriculture Department's direction. The program would be in 
addition to any state checkoffs already in place in the nine major 
peanut-producing states -- Georgia, Texas, Alabama, Florida, South 
Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	The board would have 20 peanut growers -- 10 members and 10  
alternates. Each member would represent a peanut-producing state, 
although the member's vote would be weighted by the value of 
production in that state. For instance, Georgia's vote would count 
as 38 percent because that state had that amount of the nation's 
peanut crop last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the nine big peanut states would have one board member.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Eds: Any eligible farmer who did not receive a ballot should  
call 888-720-9917.

	WEMBLEY, England (AP) -- Manchester United kept alive its bid for  
an unprecedented triple sweep in soccer by beating Newcastle 2-0 
Saturday to win the F.A. Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Teddy Sheringham and Paul Scholes scored the goals.  
</P>
<P>
	United, unbeaten in 32 games, earlier won the Premier League  
title. It can become the first to win all three major European 
trophies in one season by beating Bayern Munich in Barcelona on 
Wednesday in the European Champions Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheringham scored in the 10th minute from 16 yards, just 90  
seconds after he went into the game as a substitute for injured Roy 
Keane. Scholes added the final goal from 18 yards out in the 53rd 
minute on a defensive error by Nicos Dabizas. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was the season finale for English soccer and drew a  
capacity crowd of 80,000 to Wembley in north London. 
</P>
<P>
	The F.A. Cup was the Reds' record 10th and gave coach Alex

<HEADLINE> Makah Celebrate Whale Hunt Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- Makah Indians joined with neighboring  
tribes today to celebrate their first successful whale hunt since 
the 1920s, hailing as heroes the whalers who revived their ancient 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds watched as the Makah whaling crew led a parade of a  
dozen floats down the reservation's main street. Several meals -- 
some using meat from the slain whale -- were being served over the 
course of the party, interspersed with songs and dances from guests 
and hosts. Many waited in line to snap photos with the eight 
whalers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the crew paddled its canoe off the country's  
northwesternmost tip to kill a 30-foot gray whale using a harpoon 
and a .50 caliber rifle. The kill renewed a tradition guaranteed by 
the tribe's 1855 treaty but abandoned decades ago when commercial 
whaling decimated the species. 
</P>
<P>
	The Makahs moved to resume whale hunts when gray whales were  
removed from the Endangered Species List five years ago. In 1997, 
the tribe was given permission to hunt 20 whales through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-whaling activists contend such hunting is illegal and fear  
it will lead to a worldwide renewal of commercial whaling. Two were 
arrested during Monday's hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often, the history of Indian treaties has been a history  
of broken promises,'' tribal chairman Ben Johnson said Saturday in 
a statement. He thanked Americans who have ``demonstrated 
understanding and tolerance for the ways of Indian culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was celebrating. Two protest boats sat offshore,  
and demonstrators vowed to continue on at the small reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want them to know we're still here,'' said Jonathan Paul of  
the Sea Defense Alliance, whose group had two boats seized last 
week. ``We're not leaving just because they killed this first 
whale. They want to kill more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of protesters also gathered about 20 miles east of the  
reservation to caravan to the edge of the Makah reservation -- a 
weekly routine begun before the hunt. A low-key, peaceful memorial 
for the whale was also planned.

</P>
<P>
	TILTON, N.H. (AP) -- Damon W. Hall, who recently received the  
French Legion of Honor for his service in World War I, died Tuesday 
at age 105. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Sangerville, Maine, on June 29, 1893, Hall worked for  
the Boston &AMP; Maine Railroad and owned and ran an Amoco station in 
Bellows Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, French Consul-General Maurice Portiche presented  
Hall with France's highest military honor at a ceremony. To 
celebrate the 80th anniversary of the end of the war, France began 
honoring foreign soldiers who helped liberate France from German 
occupation in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, officials said Hall was one of 300 surviving  
American veterans who qualified for the medal because they were 
stationed on French soil during the war.

	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Retired Gen. James E. Hill Jr., a  
former commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command 
and a force behind the U.S. military's push into space, died 
Thursday of cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill's 37-year military career began the day after the surprise  
attack on Pearl Harbor, when he enlisted in the Army Air Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was a P-47 fighter pilot and flew 128 missions in World War  
II, shooting down five enemy planes and earning the title of 
``ace.'' He also flew in Korea and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving as commander of NORAD's Alaska region, Hill became  
commander of NORAD and Air Defense Command in 1977. He retired from 
that position in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander, Hill strongly advocated a separate space command  
but was rebuked by others who disagreed, said retired Brig. Gen. 
Bill Lindeman, a former deputy chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	After his retirement, Hill served as president of the Colorado  
Springs Area Chamber of Commerce and helped found the nonprofit 
Space Foundation, which promotes space-related business and 
educational efforts.

	SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Daryl LaPointe, the chairman of the  
Winnebago Tribe, died Thursday of complications from a heart 
attack. He was 48. 
</P>
<P>
	The Winnebago Tribe's reservation is centered in Thurston  
County, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPointe, who served four years on the tribal council about  
seven years ago, was elected chairman in October. He had served the 
tribe in many other ways, including director of the Winnebago 
Native American Head Start program, and as part of a task force 
that established a tribal college.

</P>
<P>
	DOLGEVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Lyndon Waldo Lyon, developer of 800  
varieties of African Violet including the double-pink and star 
flower, died Wednesday at age 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyon's passion for the purple-flowered plant was sparked in 1949  
with the gift of a single African Violet leaf from his niece. 
Shortly after, he set up an African Violet nursery under artificial 
lights in his own house where he studied the plant and experimented 
with hybridization. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1955, Lyon had built a greenhouse with 5,000 plants and had  
created 80 new varieties, including the double-pink which created a 
sensation at the 1954 national convention of the African Violet 
Society of America. 
</P>
<P>
	He built another greenhouse in 1956 and in the same year  
successfully bred the star flower, where the five petals are about 
the same size. Normally, the flowers of African Violets have three 
lower petals which are larger than the upper two. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1982, Lyon had created about 800 varieties and was selling  
over 100,000 plants a year in a retail-wholesale business. That 
same year he sold the business to his grandson, Paul Sorano.

more than 40 films, including the classic ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' 
``A Hard Day's Night'' with the Beatles, the World War II epic 
``The Longest Day'' and ``A Night to Remember'' about the Titanic 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	In 1960, Tomizza wrote his first novel, ``Materada,'' named  
after his hometown in Istria, the northwest Croatian peninsula 
formerly under Italian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200,000 ethnic Italians were forced to flee Istria after  
World War II when Italy lost its jurisdiction over the territory, 
and the book focused on how natives were uprooted and sent 
searching for a new motherland.

                          *'Joe Homeless' 	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man known as Joe Homeless who spent more than  
a decade living on the streets of New York City and had his story 
published, died Tuesday of heart failure at age 56. 
</P>
<P>
	The man used Joe Homeless as a pen name and, according to  
friends, did not want his real name known. He died at Columbia 
Presbyterian Hospital, according to George McDonald, president of 
The Doe Fund, Inc., a nonprofit organization that assists homeless 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a tape recorder he had fished out of the trash, Joe  
Homeless dictated his story while still living on the streets. The 
tapes were later transcribed and published by New Horizon Press 
under the title, ``My Life on the Streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He guarded his privacy jealously,'' said friend Julie Weiner,  
a health counselor who first met Joe in the late 1980's. 
</P>
<P>
	She would pass him in the mornings -- she on her way to work at a  
Manhattan hospital, he in the cardboard box at 77th and Lexington 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
	``First he asked me for a quarter. Then he said, 'Hey, you know  
any typists?''' Weiner said. That caught her attention. Weiner, 
along with several other volunteers, later helped him transcribe 
the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to his own account, Joe grew up on the Lower East Side  
of Manhattan, and was evicted from his parents apartment in 1979, 
some 10 years after they had died. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years before his death, Joe was able to turn things  
around, and used his mechanical skills to start his own 
refrigeration repair business, according to the Doe Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1990 interview with Newsday Magazine he said: ``Most  
homeless people don't live too long, and most of them are not what 
you see on the streets or in the shelters -- they are in Potter's 
Field, in the graveyard.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Beck Has Arthroscopic Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Chicago Cubs closer Rod Beck underwent  
arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow Saturday and will be out 
from 6-12 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck, placed on the 15-day disabled list Monday, had two bone  
spurs and several chips removed during the operation by Dr. Warren 
King in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only time will tell how successful the surgery went,'' said  
Chicago general manager Ed Lynch, in Atlanta where the Cubs met the 
Braves on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Six to 12 weeks is a lot of leeway. We're happy Rod feels  
better that the problem has been treated,'' Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Cubs acquired reliever Rick Aguilera from  
Minnesota. Aguilera, 37, was 3-1 with six saves in eight 
opportunities and a 1.27 ERA in 21 1-3 innings with the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch, however, said Beck 's situation had nothing to do with  
trading for Aguilera. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Aguilera decision had been in the works for some time,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs optioned left-handed reliever Ray King to Triple-A Iowa  
to make room for Aguilera. King made his major league debut Friday 
night against the Braves and gave up a run in two-thirds of an 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck had previously said surgery was inevitable but expressed  
hope he could postpone it until the offseason. He changed his mind 
Tuesday and sought out a second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck is 2-4 with seven saves in 11 opportunities and a 10.54  
ERA. He was booed Sunday at Wrigley Field, when he retired just one 
of four Atlanta batters in an 8-5 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The bone spur is an old injury that dates back to when Beck was  
with the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs Manager Jim Riggleman has said the club knew about it when  
they signed him to a one-year, $4 million deal before last season. 
After Beck's 51 saves helped Chicago to the NL wild-card berth, he 
signed for two more years at $9.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Beck said he never considered having the problem corrected  
between seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go see doctors just to see doctors,'' Beck said. ``You  
don't say when you've saved 30 games a year, `Let's go fix it.' If 
you're effective, you don't mess with it. But now I'm not 
effective.''

	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- To the delight of cheering, flag-waving  
supporters, Army Spc. Steven Gonzales today cut down the last 
reminder that he had been held as a prisoner of war in Yugoslavia: 
the faded, weather-beaten yellow bow on a courthouse tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a large smile and his Army dress uniform, the  
22-year-old Gonzales hugged his parents, Rosie and Gilbert 
Gonzales, before handing the memento over to his mother, who had 
placed the ribbon on the tree nearly two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``A great relief,'' a grinning Gonzales declared as he took his  
seat of honor in the back of a 1963 Rolls-Royce convertible for a 
homecoming parade held Saturday in downtown Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a far cry from his situation a month ago, when he was in  
captivity with two other U.S. soldiers for 32 days by Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,500 people lined Huntsville's streets, festooned in  
American and Texas flags to give Gonzales a hero's welcome home. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son was a marine, so he reminds me of him sometimes,'' Erma  
Stuart said. The 64-year-old traveled some 70 miles from the 
Houston area with her daughter to be a part of Gonzales' 
homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Taylor of Huntsville watched the parade with Charlotte  
Farkas of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to welcome Steven Gonzales home and support his  
family, let him know that we love him and that we're happy that 
he's here,'' said Ms. Taylor, 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales, a cavalry scout with the 1st Infantry Division, was  
captured March 31 on the Macedonian-Yugoslavian border with staff 
sergeants Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., and 
Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic released them in early May after an appeal from the  
Rev. Jesse Jackson and other American clergy.

<HEADLINE> Rosie's Rant Sparks Calls to Kmart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell's rant against the National Rifle  
Association during an on-air debate with Tom Selleck sparked a rash 
of angry telephone calls to Kmart, a store chain the talk show 
hostess does commercials for that also sells guns. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell apologized to Selleck, who has filmed a commercial for  
the NRA, after heated exchanges on O'Donnell's show last week. But 
the apologies didn't keep more than 200 people who oppose gun 
control from calling to complain, Kmart spokesman Steve Pagnani 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the calls, Kmart said it has no plans to fire O'Donnell  
as celebrity spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've discussed the issue ... with her and we know her  
stance,'' Pagnani said. ``We believe in safe and responsible sales 
and she has a right to express her opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kmart stopped selling handguns in the early 1970s and currently  
stocks a limited selection of rifles and shotguns at its stores. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell sees no contradiction in representing the Troy,  
Mich.,-based chain because ``she understands about hunting; she's 
very strong for gun locks. But she's also about `Do we need Uzis to 
go hunting?''' O'Donnell spokeswoman Lois Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Strawberry in Plea Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry will plead no contest to a  
felony cocaine charge and misdemeanor solicitation count in a deal 
that will spare him a criminal record, The Daily News reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry is due in court Wednesday to be arraigned for his  
April 14 arrest in Tampa where he allegedly propositioned an 
undercover policewoman. After the arrest, 0.3 grams of cocaine 
wrapped in a $20 bill were found in his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
	The News said that in exchange for the plea, the court will  
``withhold adjudication,'' which means there will be no criminal 
record. As part of the agreement, Strawberry will remain in a drug 
treatment program, perform community service and be placed on 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Ficarrotta, Strawberry's lawyer, told WTVT-Fox news in Tampa  
that he was ``very optimistic,'' that his client would play 
baseball again. Ficarrotta did not immediately answer a phone 
message from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who underwent colon cancer surgery last October, was  
working at the New York Yankees spring training facility, hoping to 
rejoin the team when he was arrested. He was released on $6,000 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	He faced a maximum five-year prison sentence on the drug charge  
and up to 60 days in jail on the solicitation charge.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Urges Greater Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINGTON, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday pressed the  
House for swift passage of gun-control legislation and prepared to 
propose that states be allowed to spend unemployment funds on paid 
leave for parents so they can spend more time with their new 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators mindful of April's fatal shootings at a Littleton,  
Colo., high school approved legislation last week that would 
require safety locks on new handguns, ban violent juveniles from 
purchasing a firearm, and stop the import of large ammunition 
clips. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the House of Representatives will pass every one of  
these commonsense efforts that the Senate has passed to protect our 
children from guns,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. 
``And I hope they'll do it before school lets out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary Panel  
said later Saturday that his panel will hold hearings on the Senate 
legislation on Thursday, but that no House vote is likely until 
after the Memorial Day recess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the bill that the Senate passed is a good bill,'' Hyde  
said on CNN's ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields.'' ``I don't have any 
real problems with it, but we ought to hold hearings. ... It won't 
be more than a couple of weeks and we'll past a bill that I think 
will be satisfactory and the president will sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, aides said Clinton planned to unveil on Sunday in  
Grambling, La., a new administration study showing that the 
increasing responsibilities of the workplace were cutting deeply 
into America's family time. In conjunction with release of the 
study, he was directing the Labor Department to formulate 
regulations that would allow states to legislate changes under 
which surplus unemployment funds -- which are operated by the states 
-- could be used for parental leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of a lot of changes in the last 30 years, people are  
working harder and are under a lot more stresses,'' said White 
House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed. ``Government and business 
need to do anything they can to help parents spend more time with 
kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Clinton was responding to inquiries from Maryland,  
Massachusetts, Vermont and Washington State in issuing a directive 
that would allow the paid leave for new parents, including those 
who adopt. 
</P>
<P>
	The new study from the White House Council of Economic Advisers  
found that over the last 30 years, the quality time parents can 
spend with their children has decreased by 14 percent, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton met privately with Senate Democrats at an Irvington inn  
Saturday afternoon to thank them for voting for the gun-control 
bill and to discuss strategy on Kosovo, Social Security, Medicare 
and the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke for more than an hour, promising to present  
his plan to shore up the Medicare system next month and asking for 
help in shepherding his nominations to approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has sent 170 nominations to the Senate during the  
current Congress that began in January, White House spokesman Jake 
Siewert said, and only 34 have been confirmed. None of the 38 
nominees whose names he has submitted this year to be federal 
judges has received a hearing, Siewert said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the meeting, Clinton played a round of golf with a group  
of senators before returning to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the evening, Clinton told an Italian-American group  
that the key to reducing youth violence lies in the family and 
community. He said responsible parenting can counteract the 
thousands of violent images children see in the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at Sons of Italy Foundation's annual dinner, Clinton  
called on parents to lead by example and show the country's 
children the evils of prejudice. He asked the audience to provide 
``every decent person a home in America'' and cited NATO's mission 
against Yugoslavia as an example of living by such values. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important job of any society is not in the creation  
of wealth, but in the richness and wholeness in the lives of the 
children,'' Clinton said. ``There is no more important work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton visited  
Littleton's Columbine High School on Thursday, one month after two 
students killed 12 classmates and a teacher before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton visited with victims' families and other community  
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning of Clinton's departure for Colorado, a student in  
Conyers, Ga., opened fire at his high school, wounding several 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``No child should have to worry that a classmate is carrying a  
loaded gun to school. No parent should have to fear sending a child 
to school,'' Clinton said in his radio address. ``No American 
should tolerate this level of violence against our children. There 
is no task more urgent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton lauded House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., for his  
support for requiring background checks on sales at gun shows and 
raise the age for handgun ownership to 21. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said parents must pay ``attention to the shows their  
children watch, the Web pages they visit, refusing to buy products 
that glorify violence,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has challenged Hollywood to refrain from showing guns in  
movie ads and previews, strictly enforce its ratings system in 
theaters, and re-evaluate the content allowed in PG-rated films. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't forget the children of Columbine and all the other  
children who were lost because their culture, their society is too 
violent, their laws too lax,'' Clinton said.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Carr Doyle, an Emmy-winning television  
producer who helped launch ``The Huntley-Brinkley Report'' and the 
National Geographic Society's TV nature specials, is dead at age 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	He died Friday at Suburban Hospital of pneumonia.  
</P>
<P>
	Doyle won an Emmy Award for his work on the NBC-TV show that  
paired anchors David Brinkley in Washington and Chet Huntley in New

	During his years with NBC from 1946 to 1953 he was involved with  
the first broadcasts of national political conventions and had

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Greater Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is urging House Democrats to  
insist on passing gun restrictions beyond those approved by the 
Senate, administration and Democratic aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't settle'' for the Senate's limited restrictions,  
such as mandatory background checks for all firearms transactions 
at gun shows and pawn shops, Clinton told 18 House Democrats 
Friday, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the group the House should pass additional  
provisions that would raise from 18 to 21 the legal age for 
possessing and purchasing handguns, semiautomatic assault weapons 
and high-capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	The aides said Clinton delivered that message to the House  
Democrats during a private White House meeting to plot strategy in 
the gun control debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, Clinton is urging the House to pass the new  
restrictions approved by the Senate, including mandatory background 
checks on all firearms transactions at gun shows and pawn shops. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address today, Clinton urged the House to  
``immediately'' approve the restrictions in the Senate bill and 
reject the House Republican plan to let the explosive debate cool 
off until next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call on the House to take immediate action,'' Clinton said.  
He pressed the House to approve ``every one'' of the Senate bill's 
new restrictions on gun control, which were propelled to passage 
Thursday in the wake of high school shootings in Colorado and 
Georgia. In his prepared remarks he made no mention of the 
provisions he discussed with the House Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't once again let the gears of politics as usual grind  
our urgency into dust,'' Clinton added. 
</P>
<P>
	As lawmakers headed home for the weekend, there was no consensus  
over which provisions to press for in the House. But hoping to 
benefit from the momentum of the Senate's juvenile justice bill, 
Democrats were united in pushing for House action on those issues 
by Memorial Day, at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Republicans refused to budge from their plans for  
Judiciary Committee hearings on the matter Thursday and floor 
debate in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make sure that we do this in a reasonable,  
rational and responsible way, and that requires us to go through 
the ... Judiciary Committee,'' said John Feehery, spokesman for 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the families of the victims of the Columbine High  
School shooting in Colorado and those shot Thursday in Georgia 
deserve quicker action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not take a Memorial Day recess until we pass a  
proper memorial for the slain students in Littleton, Colo., and 
other school gun tragedies,'' said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, 
the Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans were eager to let the issue cool off after it  
caused a public relations meltdown for their party during two 
volatile weeks of Senate debate. To that end, they were expected to 
change the subject in their weekly radio address from guns to 
proposals that would limit the ways in which Congress can spend 
Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Public sentiment and Democratic pressure in the wake of the  
Colorado shootings prompted Senate Republicans to retreat on gun 
policy several times before lawmakers included new firearms 
restrictions in the final bill that passed Thursday, 73-25. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a member of the board of the  
National Rifle Association, Republicans initially defeated a 
Democratic amendment that would require background checks on all 
firearms purchases at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a half-dozen Republicans complained to Craig only a  
few hours later, Republicans agreed to make those checks mandatory. 
By the final vote, senators of both parties also approved 
provisions that would require background checks for all gun 
transactions at pawn shops and all handguns to be sold with trigger 
locks. 
</P>
<P>
	In an additional defeat, public pressure to pass a juvenile  
justice bill forced Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to 
back down on his threat to kill the bill outright. 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning climax just hours after the shootings in suburban  
Atlanta, Vice President and White House hopeful Al Gore broke a 
tie, casting the deciding vote in favor of a Democratic amendment 
imposing still more restrictions on guns that the Senate had 
rejected a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, more Republicans voted for the underlying bill,  
sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, than opposed it. Lott was 
among those who voted for it.

<HEADLINE> Once Again, Jazz Backed Into Corner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan wonders  
whether his team has the energy or the will to come back from 
another 2-1 playoff deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just showed up. I can't accept that,'' Sloan said Saturday  
after the Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Jazz 97-87 to go up 
2-1 in their best-of-7 series. ``I don't know what we'll come out 
with (in Game 4 Sunday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz, struggling to get back to the NBA Finals after playing  
runner-up to the Bulls two straight years, lost two of three to 
Sacramento in the first round and were on the verge of elimination 
before winning the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Jazz are two games away from being knocked out  
in this series, a similar recovery may be tougher against the 
Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Kings, Portland plays a nasty, grabbing defense to go  
with speed and athleticism on offense. Led by backup point guard 
Greg Anthony, the Blazers used strong halfcourt pressure to force 
nine turnovers in the second quarter alone. Anthony had four steals 
as the Blazers held the Jazz scoreless for 9:01 starting with about 
four minutes left in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do a better job of getting into our offense,''  
Utah's Karl Malone said. ``They're forcing us away from the spots 
we need to be. I've had opportunities, but didn't make them. It's 
not one guy, it's all of us, but I need to lead them by my play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone scored 25 points, but the Jazz had little else going.  
With muscular Brian Grant able to guard the Mailman by himself, the 
Blazers are able to focus on defending Utah guards John Stockton 
and Jeff Hornacek, and on exploiting their size advantage inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers had 11 offensive rebounds in the first half, and  
center Arvydas Sabonis hit three inside shots with Greg Ostertag 
guarding him in the last 1:18 of the first quarter. Sabonis scored 
eight points in a 19-0 run from which the Jazz didn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah' biggest problem, however, is that the Blazers seem to be  
growing wise to the tried-and-true plays -- the devastating screens 
and smooth pick-and-rolls -- that have been the staples of Jazz 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't call it a big surprise that this happened,''  
Hornacek said in the quiet Jazz locker room. ``We're pretty 
predictable in what we do. We're running the same plays we have for 
years. They're doing a good job of anticipating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz may still have another run left, and a win Sunday would  
give them a fresh start -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one game can knock their confidence back,'' Shandon  
Anderson said of the Blazers. ``If we come out and take care of 
business, the momentum's back in our favor.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Forecaster Looks Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- Although he has become famous as the  
nation's preeminent hurricane forecaster, Bill Gray thinks that 
will only be a footnote in his biography. 
</P>
<P>
	``My most important work is the graduate students I've had and  
turned out,'' said the Colorado State University researcher. ``A 
lot of them are leaders in the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Friday, former director of the National Weather Service,  
says Gray ``has made some of the most important contributions to 
the study of how tropical storms develop in varying climactic 
regimes. And he did it before those kinds of connections were 
understood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It all started with a wild ride through a hurricane 30 years ago  
at 1,500 feet in the nose bubble of an Air Force bomber. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Air Force officer and University of Chicago Ph.D.  
speaks plainly despite a slight stutter. There's nothing fancy 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	He likes classical music, country and western and drives a beat  
up 1979 Chevy Malibu. At age 69, the slender, 6-foot-5 scientist 
still runs in 10-K races at this mile-high altitude. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to pinpoint the biggest prediction success he's had,  
Gray says, ``I'm surprised any of it worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's been studying hurricanes for 40 years. From his perch in  
the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, he has produced an annual 
forecast that is eagerly awaited on the Atlantic Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	And not just by the public. The National Hurricane Center, the  
National Weather Service and local officials like Billy Wagner, 
emergency manager for the Florida Keys, give it considerable 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He tries to target the potential of hurricanes hitting land,''  
the chief concern of officials and the growing number of people 
living along the Atlantic Coast, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray has been running his forecast operation, which is separate  
from his teaching at Colorado State, on a shoestring. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he says, the funding may run out. The insurance  
agencies that formerly helped pay his costs now can get his 
predictions free online. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agencies are rejecting requests for funding for Gray's  
hurricane forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the best climate team anywhere dollar for dollar''  
before he had to begin cutting back. Still, he isn't likely to 
quit. ``It's just a question of how much of my house I'd 
mortgage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray opts for forecasts based on statistics from observations of  
past weather. Numeric modeling projections from existing conditions 
dominates in the weather prediction business these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray argues too many forces are at work over oceans to project  
what will happen without looking at the past. He also has convinced 
skeptics that conditions elsewhere, including rainfall over West 
Africa, help determine how many hurricanes will develop each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray is credited with showing that El Nino, while wreaking havoc  
elsewhere, cut down on hurricanes along the Atlantic. He learned 
that painfully, after the phenomenon resulted in his 1997 forecast 
being the least accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	This year he is predicting 14 storms powerful enough to be named  
-- nine hurricanes, four of them major, with a 54 percent 
probability at least one will hit the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray is worried that the public has been lulled into a sense of  
complacency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young people and retired people who moved to Florida in  
recent years don't understand the threat because there haven't been 
many major storms since 1960,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with thousands of new homes built along the coast, Gray  
says the region is entering a period of more intense storms. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we are going to see more hurricane damage than ever  
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gray says, ``I think people wanting to live along the  
coast is fine. They just must be willing to pay for it.''

<HEADLINE> Safety Plans Didn't Stop Ga. Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- Jim Borland came home from a business trip  
last month to find his 18-year-old son, Graham, gripped by news of 
carnage at a high school in Littleton, Colo. ``You know, this could 
happen in our school system,'' the teen-ager recalls warning his 
dad. ``We need to take more precautions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Borland agreed. As a school board member for Rockdale  
County, he was in a good position to respond. Safety measures 
already were in place, and administrators quickly reinforced them. 
</P>
<P>
	But that couldn't stop a 15-year-old from opening fire Thursday,  
wounding six students and adding Heritage High School to the list 
of campus bloodbaths that have shocked and frustrated the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting in Rockdale County, a semirural setting of 68,000  
mostly white, comfortable and churchgoing inhabitants, 25 miles 
east of Atlanta, suggests that even an elaborate safety system may 
not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Under measures adopted a few years ago, Rockdale schools already  
employed armed police during school hours, according to schools 
spokeswoman Susan Paul Smith. Video cameras already watched kids on 
school buses and in the schools. Trained dogs periodically came to 
sniff for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, when Thomas Solomon Jr., the youth now  
charged in the shooting, reportedly brought a gun to school, the 
allegations were followed up and recorded, though they could never 
be substantiated, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	After two teen-agers at Columbine High killed a teacher, 12  
students and themselves, security measures in Rockdale, where 
Conyers is the county seat, were reviewed. Teachers got a list of 
steps to take, like keeping rooms secure in an emergency, and 
taking the attendance roll. Superintendent Don Peccia sent parents 
a letter promising investigations and a police response to any 
``rumors, threats or allegations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Strict disciplinary consequences will be assigned to any  
student and to anyone else exhibiting such behavior,'' Peccia 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Children were encouraged to help.  
</P>
<P>
	``The kids were told, `Anything that doesn't seem right, speak  
up,''' said Mary Kommeth, an English teacher at Salem, one of three 
Rockdale high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham Borland, the school board member's son, said that one  
schoolmate who had often boasted about ``blowing up graduation'' 
was followed constantly by staff members, and never allowed to be 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland's father, a leasing company executive, heads a committee  
to review safety in the school district, which serves more than 
13,000 children including preschoolers. The panel includes about 35 
parents, business people, members of law enforcement, and even an 
FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bloodshed at Heritage High School could have been worse.  
</P>
<P>
	The shooter used a rifle that was missing its stock and shot  
from the hip, said Rockdale County Sheriff Jeff Wigington. That may 
explain why the gun was aimed downward, lessening the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also used the word 'blessed' many times,'' Borland said  
after a school board meeting Thursday, the day of the shooting. ``I 
think we were very thankful to God. I think he was looking out for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among parents gathering for the meeting, which had been  
scheduled before the shooting took place, there was a hint of 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that you could prevent it 100 percent,'' said  
Paul Lee, a Conyers father of two teen-agers. ``They have 
terrorists all over the world. In the Capitol, that guy broke in 
and killed two guards,'' he said, referring to last July's killings 
in Washington. ``It could happen anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borland and others say they had striven until now to strike a  
balance between adequate security and not turning the schools into 
fortresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Now school officials are talking about mandating clear book  
bags, or no bookbags, a dress code, even metal detectors -- ideas 
that until now had been soundly rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland's group will be reviewing the schools' inch-thick crisis  
management book. One situation the book doesn't deal with, Borland 
said, is what to do when a student has a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	That could change too.

<HEADLINE> Malone Said To Be Winner of NBA MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz has won the  
NBA's Most Valuable Player award, The Salt Lake City Tribune 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune, which did not attribute the source of its story,  
said Malone outpolled Miami center Alonzo Mourning in the voting by 
118 media members who cover the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	The award will be formally announced in late May or early June.  
</P>
<P>
	The MVP award would be the second in three years for Malone, who  
averaged 23.8 points and 9.4 rebounds while helping the Jazz to a 
37-13 record in the regular season. Utah currently trails Portland 
2-1 in the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone won the MVP in 1997 before finishing second to Chicago's  
Michael Jordan last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard anything,'' Malone told The Tribune Friday.  
``But if it happens, it would be a great honor. It's not my biggest 
worry right now. We're still trying to get to the next round (of 
the playoffs). But if it happens, I would say it's for the fans of 
Utah, who supported me during kind of a tough year, and for my 
teammates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz officials would not comment on the MVP vote because the  
league has not announced the winner. The voting for all NBA awards 
was completed earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven players have won three or more MVP awards, led by Kareem  
Abdul-Jabbar with six. Jordan (five), Bill Russell (five), 
Chamberlain (four), Moses Malone (three), Larry Bird (three) and 
Magic Johnson (three) are also on that list.

	Russia Says NATO Undermining Peace  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia accused NATO today of undermining its  
efforts to find a peaceful settlement to the Kosovo conflict and 
said the alliance was trying to evade responsibility for bombing 
civilian targets. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told CNN that as 
Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin arrived in the Yugoslav capital, 
Belgrade, ``the intensity of the bombing reaches its peak.'' NATO 
forces mistakenly hit an ethnic Albanian rebel base, the alliance 
said today, the same day its jets and missiles knocked out power to 
much of Serbia and destroyed a residence of President Slobodan 
Milosevic.

	China Unveils Embassy Attack Exhibit

	BEIJING (AP) -- Anger flared anew in Beijing today as visitors  
toured an exhibition of photos chronicling NATO's May 7 attack on 
the Chinese Embassy and the damage wrought by the alliance's 
continuing air campaign against Yugoslavia. The exhibition at the 
National Art Museum adds to an anti-NATO, anti-U.S. government 
propaganda campaign. Images at the exhibition portrayed the Chinese 
and Yugoslav people as common victims of NATO aggression.

	Clinton Urges Greater Gun Control  
</P>
<P>
	IRVINGTON, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton today pressed the House  
for swift passage of gun-control legislation, saying children 
should not have to worry that classmates might bring weapons to 
school. Senators mindful of April's fatal shootings at Columbine 
high school approved legislation last week that would require 
safety locks on new handguns and ban violent juveniles from 
purchasing a firearm. ``I hope the House of Representatives will 
pass every one of these commonsense efforts,'' Clinton said. ``And 
I hope they'll do it before school lets out.''

	NRA Says Gun Laws Won't Help  
</P>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- More gun laws won't prevent school shootings  
like the recent massacre at Columbine, and those who seek further 
restrictions ultimately want to take away people's right to bear 
arms, a National Rifle Association leader said today. ``In 
Littleton, those two horrible kids, homicidal maniacs, they broke 
20 federal and state gun laws,'' Wayne LaPierre, the group's 
executive vice president, told Georgia Republicans. Presidential 
candidate Steve Forbes urged Americans to fight school violence as 
they would a war. Speakers at the gathering charged repeatedly that 
the Clinton administration hasn't vigorously enforced existing gun 
laws.

	Hurricane Areas Gird for New Season  
</P>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Another six-month Atlantic hurricane  
season starts June 1, and some areas of the Florida Keys, Honduras, 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic hit by last year's monster storms 
are unprepared for another round that could be equally brutal. 
Forecasters say cyclical changes could signal an upswing not seen 
for 50 years. ``People have been saying for several years we may be 
heading back to a period like the '40s and '50s when we really had 
heavy hurricane seasons,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the 
National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``I think we are in it now.''

	Pisa Tower Leans Less After Fixing  
</P>
<P>
	PISA, Italy (AP) -- The Leaning Tower of Pisa is leaning a little  
less thanks to an experiment aimed at making the monument settle 
better into the ground, experts said today. In February, workers 
started removing soil from under the tower's base. Going into the 
experiment, the 12th century tower leaned some 6 degrees -- 13 feet 
-- off the perpendicular. Experts reported today that the tower has 
since straightened by about one-fifth of an inch.

Indians 6-2 in a game featuring a bench-clearing incident touched 
off by beanballs in the sixth inning. Indians outfielder Manny 
Ramirez was the only player ejected after Cleveland starter Jaret 
Wright (4-2) and Weaver (5-3) took turns hitting batters in the

the final of the Strasbourg Open. The 23-year-old American took 59 
minutes to down the second-seeded Likhovtseva 6-1, 6-3, completing 
a straight-sets sweep of the tournament. The victory was a 
dramatic, positive step in Capriati's comeback and boosted her 
prospects for next week's French Open.

<HEADLINE> Pitchers Live on Edge -- of Plate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In pitching, just like in real estate, the three most important  
factors are location, location and location. Live on the corners 
and a pitcher will thrive. Come in over the plate and the ball 
could wind up in the next zip code. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitchers, being smart guys, learn that formula early on.  
Applying it, however, is quite another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux have won six Cy Young  
awards between them this decade because of their success with that 
recipe. Neither of them blows batters away with high-octane stuff. 
Instead, they win with savvy and skill, a finesse style of 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	So, how come this season they've suddenly turned sour?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think for both of us, our location has not been good,''  
Glavine said, ``Location is what separates good pitchers from 
mediocre pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had good stuff but my mechanics have been off. I can sit  
here all day and tell you that I have to be on the edge. When I've 
been good, that's the way I've pitched. It's easy to say. 
Sometimes, it's not easy to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what makes baseball such a compelling and confounding  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the introduction to his new book, ``Baseball For Everybody,''  
Glavine writes of baseball, ``No one fully understands it. Baseball 
is mystical and baseball is perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux and Glavine, however, have been something short of that  
and their struggles have been alarming for Atlanta, especially now 
that John Smoltz is on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	After opening the season at 4-0 for the first time in his  
career, Maddux got caught in a downward spiral. In his next three 
starts, he went 0-3 with an 8.66 ERA, giving up 17 runs and 36 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Cubs on Thursday night, Maddux was spared losing his  
fourth straight start, something he has not done since a 
career-worst eight-game losing streak in 1990. Still, the four-time 
Cy Young winner was stuck with a 5.02 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux gave up nine hits, including consecutive homers by Sammy  
Sosa and Mark Grace in the first inning, and allowed five runs. He 
has given up a major league-high 88 hits in 57 1-3 innings, and 
opponents are batting .351 against him, worst in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine started 0-3 but then seemed to have straightened out,  
allowing only two earned runs in his next 20 1-3 innings. Then he 
got burned by the Chicago Cubs for five runs and seven hits in 5 
2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Go figure.  
</P>
<P>
	All they could do was get ready for their next starts. The great  
thing about baseball is there's always another chance, even if it 
takes pitchers five days to get to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Things seemed better for Glavine against Pittsburgh on Wednesday  
-- 7 innings, 5 hits and 3 earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not where I want to be yet,'' he said. ``Now, it's just  
one bad inning or one bad hitter or one bad sequence. That's a 
whole lot better than it was early on. I'm getting there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Was the changing strike zone a problem for the two struggling  
Braves? 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' Glavine said. ``If anything, I think we're  
throwing too many strikes over the heart of the plate. You can't 
live in that area. I'm missing over the plate. If you throw good 
pitches there, they get hit. If you throw bad ones there, they get 
hit really hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the puzzle this early season has been, Glavine managed  
that rarest of commodities, a complete game, one of only two the 
Braves' staff had produced going into this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-inning pitchers are becoming baseball dinosaurs. Through  
the season's first 530 games, there were just 39 complete games. A 
year ago, at about the same time, there were 56. Ten years ago, 
major league pitchers completed 23 percent of their starts. Right 
now, they're at about 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference is the care and, some people claim, the coddling  
of young arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Younger guys have restrictions on what they're able to do in  
the minors,'' Glavine said. ``They're limited on pitch counts. Then 
you have the specialization of bullpens. Everybody's got a plan 
with long relievers and closers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to have inning-eaters. We've always had three  
starters who could eat 220 innings a year. If you're going to the 
bullpen all the time, what is the bullpen going to be like in 
August?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's relief corps suffered two major setbacks when closer  
Mark Wohlers suddenly lost the ability to throw strikes and his 
successor, Kerry Ligtenberg, went down with a season-ending injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Braves depend on a staff of young relievers and older  
inning-eaters. They just have to get past the indigestion Maddux 
and Glavine have been experiencing lately.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Painkiller Vioxx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans suffering from arthritis, severe  
menstrual discomfort or other acute pain soon will have a new 
choice in painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration has approved Vioxx, produced by  
Merck &AMP; Co. The manufacturer said the drug, to be available by 
prescription only, should be in pharmacies by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	The dosage is once a day, and the cost of the prescription  
medication is expected to be between $2.38 and $2.52 per tablet. It 
will also be available in liquid form. 
</P>
<P>
	In tests on acute pain, Merck officials said the drug worked  
well on patients who had wisdom teeth extracted or hip or knee 
replacements or who suffered severe menstrual pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx is a type of drug known as a Cox-2 inhibitor, the second  
such drug on the market. The other, Monsanto's Celebrex, went on 
sale last year for arthritis sufferers, and more than 2 million 
prescriptions were written in the first three months it was on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the FDA recommended approval of Vioxx last month.  
</P>
<P>
	The newly developed Cox-2 inhibitors relieve aches and  
inflammation with fewer stomach-damaging side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of people depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and  
other pills called ``nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,'' or 
NSAIDs, to relieve pain. 
</P>
<P>
	But NSAIDs can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other  
gastrointestinal side effects, especially in long-term users. They 
are blamed for sending 107,000 people to hospitals every year and 
for killing 16,500. 
</P>
<P>
	NSAIDs target an enzyme called cyclo-oxegenase, which is  
responsible for much inflammation, but it exists in two types. 
Cox-2 is believed to cause inflammation, while Cox-1 protects the 
stomach lining. NSAIDs attack both. So scientists developed more 
specific drugs to target just Cox-2. 
</P>
<P>
	While Vioxx is the second Cox-2 inhibitor, it could prove to be  
a formidable competitor, especially since it was approved for more 
uses than Celebrex. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx will include a label noting that rare instances of  
gastrointestinal bleeding were reported among users during trials 
and urging physicians to watch for the possibility.

<HEADLINE> Olivetti Gets Stake in Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Olivetti agreed to a 51 percent stake in Telecom  
Italia SpA on Saturday, completing its David vs. Goliath attempt 
for control of the telecommunications giant. 
</P>
<P>
	After a three-month takeover bid, Olivetti settled for the  
narrow majority stake in Italy's No. 1 phone company -- even though 
the firm had hoped to win 67 percent of Telecom, which is five 
times larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti, a typewriter and computer manufacturer that has moved  
into telecommunications, held a meeting Saturday at its 
headquarters near Milan, where the company's board approved the 
deal, Europe's largest-ever hostile corporate takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan stock market officials had announced the 51 percent figure  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boards of Olivetti and Tecnost have decided to accept the  
shares tendered in the offer, and Olivetti will go ahead with its 
industrial plan for TI,'' Olivetti's chief executive, Roberto 
Colaninno, told reporters Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tecnost is the Olivetti unit used as the vehicle for the  
takeover of the former state-run monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Champagne flowed Friday night at Mediobanca, the merchant bank  
that backs Olivetti, Italian news reports said. Applause could be 
heard coming from inside the usually staid bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said that the management handover will take place  
between ``gentlemen,'' in an absolutely ``friendly manner'' and not 
in the courts. He was expected to meet with his counterpart at 
Telecom, Franco Bernabe, on Monday, when the transition phases will 
be mapped out. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Olivetti had less than 20 percent of Telecom's  
shares. But on the final day for securing shareholder backing, most 
of Telecom's strongest supporters, including the IFIL holding 
company of the Agnelli industrial dynasty, jumped ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover bid by Olivetti, which was being dragged down only  
a few years ago by its personal computer division before it moved 
into telecommunications, was particularly bold, going up against 
one of the world's largest telecommunications companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti had said it needed at least a 35 percent stake to press  
ahead with its plan to acquire Telecom for $12.15 at current 
exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti's success appeared to doom Telecom's proposed defensive  
merger with its German counterpart, Deutsche Telekom. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said the possibility of a merger of Tecnost and  
Telecom will be the subject of many long discussions in the coming 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Into next year, the Italian government, as part of the  
arrangement that privatized Telecom, holds a so-called golden 
share, a 3.43 percent stake in the phone company that it allows it 
veto power over major changes such as new control or ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	But it appeared doubtful that the Italian government, which  
didn't exercise the veto power during the takeover bid, would try 
now to thwart new management. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco indicated he didn't see any  
reason for the golden-share mechanism to come into play, the 
Italian news agency AGI reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything played out in a transparent matter,'' Visco was  
quoted as saying, after calling now for a ``credible industrial 
plan with international alliances.''

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Hobbled on Road to 3,000 Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn's countdown to 3,000 hits has pulled  
up lame at T-minus 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The last thing the last-place Padres needed to see was Gwynn  
getting hurt. But there he was, grimacing as he hopped down to 
first base after straining his left calf muscle coming out of the 
batter's box in the first inning of San Diego's 5-4 win Friday 
night over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old lefty went on the 15-day disabled list Saturday.  
He's eligible to return on June 6, right around the time he 
originally was projected to become the 22nd member of the 3,000-hit 
club. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken, who all began the season with  
a chance to reach 3,000, each have gone on the DL this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic, I think,'' said Gwynn, who left the stadium on  
crutches, his lower leg in a large walking boot. ``Boggs gets hurt, 
Ripken gets hurt and now I get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing you can say, nothing you could have done to  
prevent it. It's just one of those things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slumping Gwynn, who remains on hold with 2,975 hits, said  
he's taking this setback in stride. He's had to answer a lot of 
questions about his pursuit of 3,000 hits, and figures he'll at 
least get a break from that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's just the good Lord giving me a sign, `Hey, you've  
just got to concentrate on your job and just go out and take care 
of business,''' said Gwynn, whose 7-for-41 slump in his last 11 
games has dropped his average from .400 on May 4 to .333. 
</P>
<P>
	He has only one multi-hit performance in his last 17 games after  
getting two or more hits 12 times in his first 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the Reds' Brett Tomko, Gwynn hit a two-hopper to second  
base to start an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I topped the ball so I knew I had to go,'' Gwynn said. ``First  
step it grabbed me, second step, I just couldn't go. So I was 
hopping down the line. The crowd reaction to me was funny because I 
know they were following the ball to second to short to first, and 
when they threw to first, I was nowhere to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was hopping down the line, keeping all his weight on his  
right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bruce Bochy and several players joined a team training  
in rushing out to check on Gwynn, who shares the NL record for 
batting titles -- eight -- with Honus Wagner. He was helped off the 
field by a trainer and a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn said his teammates thought he tore his Achilles' tendon,  
which really would have been bad news. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was on the disabled list last Aug. 13 to Sept. 1 with an  
inflamed left Achilles' tendon, and in 1996 missed 30 games with a 
frayed right Achilles' tendon. He still won the batting title in 
'96. He also missed time with a strained right calf in June 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the doctors started checking it right away, everybody was  
like taking a sigh of relief that it wasn't the Achilles,'' he 
said. ``It hurt almost as bad as the other one (in '93), or the 
Achilles'. I mean, it just grabbed me. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 15 days we'll see how it feels, because right now it  
doesn't feel real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being swept by the New York Yankees in the World Series,  
this season has been one big ache for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Carlos Hernandez tore his left Achilles tendon in spring  
training, sidelining him for the year, and Bochy has not had his 
original starting eight together since opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman George Arias was on the DL for 24 games early in  
the season, and slumping first baseman Wally Joyner went on the DL 
Thursday, retroactive to Monday, with a chip fracture of his left 
shoulder. Catcher Jim Leyritz is expected to be out for up to a 
week, but he might be cleared to pinch-hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just the number, but it's as much the quality of  
players we're losing,'' said general manager Kevin Towers, who 
called up Triple-A outfielder Mike Darr to fill Gwynn's roster 
spot. ``You don't replace guys like Wally and Tony very easily.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Say Clinton Owes $33,737 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- President Clinton's lawyers say he owes only  
a fraction of the $500,000 that Paula Jones' lawyers are asking for 
under a judge's ruling that found the president in contempt of 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount Clinton owes in legal reimbursements is no more than  
$33,737, his lawyers argue, giving rise to a dispute that most 
likely will have to be decided by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright found Clinton in contempt last month for giving  
intentionally false testimony about his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky during his January 1998 deposition in Mrs. Jones' sexual 
harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge then ordered Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones' lawyers any  
``reasonable'' expenses they incurred as a result of his false 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers and The Rutherford Institute recently asked  
for almost $500,000, but Clinton's lawyers said in filings Friday 
that the request was ``unreasonable'' and ``bears no relationship 
to the actions that gave rise'' to the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers noted that Wright asked for $1,202 for  
expenses she incurred in attending Clinton's deposition in 
Washington and said that amount ``provides a useful benchmark for 
the reasonableness'' of other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's lawyers said Clinton ``does not concur with the  
findings of the court'' but will not challenge the judge's April 
order and will pay the $1,202. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' attorneys have interpreted the judge's order far too  
broadly, and their request included innumerable fees and expenses 
``that bear no relationship to the conduct sanctioned'' by the 
court, Clinton's lawyers said in their filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rutherford Institute's request for $58,533.03 in fees and  
expenses should be rejected outright because the institute was not 
specifically included in the judge's order, Clinton's lawyers 
argued. The institute is a conservative legal group that paid for 
some of Mrs. Jones' legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The filing said fees and costs totaling $17,861.85 appear to be  
the only costs that fall under the order. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court were to determine that some portion of the legal  
fees incurred during the president's deposition should be 
reimbursed, then the maximum should be $3,348, or about 20 percent 
of the time spent by Mrs. Jones' attorneys, the filing says. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers contended that Mrs. Jones' attorneys could be  
entitled to another $12,527.50 if the court decided that the costs 
for submitting their statement of fees and expenses is included in 
the order. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Jones' lawyers, in seeking the higher amount, have  
argued that the president ``must be sanctioned not only to redress 
his contemptuous misconduct but also to deter other litigants who 
might ... harbor the impression that a party to a federal lawsuit 
may willfully disregard'' court orders. 
</P>
<P>
	They submitted itemized bills for $437,825 incurred by the  
Dallas law firm that represented her and an additional $53,333 
incurred by the Rutherford Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Any payment would be in addition to the $850,000 Clinton has  
already paid Mrs. Jones to settle the sexual harassment case 
without admitting wrongdoing. Clinton denies any wrongdoing and has 
said he settled the case simply to bring an end to a public crisis.

<HEADLINE> Accomplice Gets Jail in Gay Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The girlfriend of a man who pleaded guilty  
to killing gay college student Matthew Shepard has been sentenced 
to up to two years in prison for helping to cover up evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasity Vera Pasley, 20, cried repeatedly Friday as she was  
sentenced to 15 months to two years in prison for being an 
accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasley said she was sorry for helping to dispose of bloody  
clothing her boyfriend, Russell Henderson, wore during the Oct. 7 
attack on Shepard, 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed to face up to what I did,'' Pasley said. ``I can't  
bring him back. I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, posed as  
homosexuals and lured Shepard out of a bar before taking him to a 
remote area, pistol-whipping him and leaving him tied to a fence in 
the cold. He died five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasley faced up to three years in prison.  
</P>
<P>
	Henderson pleaded guilty last month to kidnapping and felony  
murder and was sentenced to consecutive life prison terms. McKinney 
has pleaded innocent and is scheduled to stand trial in August. He 
faces the death penalty if convicted of murder.

<HEADLINE> Hartwig, Price-Smith Enjoy US Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. (AP) -- A rare chance to compete close to home  
brought out the best in pole vaulter Jeff Hartwig and shot putter 
Connie Price-Smith Saturday in the U.S. Open track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
	``About half the people on this side of the stands are my family  
and friends,'' Hartwig said. ``I was excited just to come out and 
have a chance to jump for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig, ranked No. 2 in the world, won at 19 feet 1-4 inch, and  
Price-Smith, ranked No. 3, won by more than two feet at 62-8 1-2 -- 
the best in the world this year. Both are from nearby St. Charles, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Price-Smith, 36, a three-time Olympian, actually had the best  
heave of her life at the end of warmups. Competing in the St. Louis 
area for the first time since the 1994 Olympic Festival, she had a 
65-foot effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig, 31, topped 19 feet for the second time outdoors this  
year despite a difficult cross wind. He didn't come close to three 
shots at 19-4 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it doesn't feel that strong, when you're holding a  
17-foot pole, that thing catches wind like a sailboat mast and it 
just blows around,'' Hartwig said. ``You're trying to control it 
while you're trying to run full-speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anna Jakubczack of Poland also set a world best this year in the  
1,500 mets, winning in 4:08.77. Larry Wade of HSI tied his own 
world best in the 110 high hurdles for the third time in 13.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheri Kenah of Reebok Enclave had the best American time this  
year in the 1,500, finishing second in 4:09.33. Jearl Miles-Clark 
won her outdoor debut in the women's 800 with a late kick.

<HEADLINE> Nipple Saved in Breast Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One obstacle to breast reconstruction after a mastectomy is  
doctors' reluctance to salvage the original nipple. Now researchers 
are testing the idea this may sometimes be possible. 
</P>
<P>
	During a mastectomy, doctors may painstakingly preserve the skin  
of the breast, but they almost always discard the nipple and 
areola, leaving plastic surgeons to create a look-alike 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason is fear the nipple will harbor cancer. All parts of  
the breast connect to the nipple, so the tumor may extend there, 
too. Studies done in the 1970s and '80s found the nipple is 
involved in between 8 percent and 50 percent of breast cancer 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, many cancer patients would like to preserve the  
nipple as well as the rest of the surface of the breast. Now 
doctors at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in 
Dallas have cautiously begun an experiment to see if this can be 
done safely. So far, they have retained the nipples of eight women 
who underwent skin-sparing mastectomies. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of severing the nipple completely, surgeons make a  
half-moon cut around the top of the areola and use this opening to 
hollow out the breast. Then they fill the breast and stitch the 
nipple back in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just blows you away how good this looks,'' says Dr.  
Geoffrey Robb, a plastic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike those with reconstructed nipples, these women retain some  
sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors felt justified trying this approach after reviewing the  
cases of 326 mastectomy patients at the hospital in the early '90s. 
They found that the nipple is most likely to contain hidden cancer 
when the primary tumor lies in the central part of the breast or if 
the breast contains more than one obvious tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Christine Laronga of M.D. Anderson says a likely candidate  
has a small single tumor away from the center of the breast and no 
sign the cancer has spread to the nipple or lymph nodes. Her study 
suggests that in such cases there is less than a 2 percent chance 
that the nipple is cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	She says that even if cancer is left in the reattached nipple,  
it should be easy to spot early during follow-up exams, when it can 
be removed.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes Reflect NRA Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirty-two of the 34 senators who supported  
the NRA this week on each of four key gun control votes received 
money for their last election from the gun industry lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
	And only two of the 38 senators who opposed the National Rifle  
Association on the same four votes received contributions from the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign contributions from the NRA are proving to be an  
accurate barometer of how individual senators would vote on gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a 51-50 vote to require background checks for firearms  
buyers at gun shows and pawn shops that clearly reflected the 
momentum toward tighter regulations in the aftermath of recent 
school shootings. Only two of the 50 senators who supported that 
amendment received NRA money. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Miller, director of the advocacy group Public Campaign,  
decried the connection between NRA contributions and votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be no better example than this one,'' said Miller,  
whose group wants to change campaign finance laws. ``You have the 
public clearly on one side, wanting strong gun control, and a 
resistant Congress in the pocket of the gun lobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA opposed efforts to add gun control provisions to the  
juvenile crime bill in the wake of school shootings in Colorado and 
Georgia. The bill passed the Senate late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and chief lobbyist  
James Baker defended the votes, saying, ``Everyone knows this won't 
stop the crisis in our schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people want existing gun laws enforced and their  
Second Amendment freedoms protected,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the five senators who received the most money from the  
NRA between 1993 and 1998 all sided with the gun lobby as it tried 
to defeat several amendments, led by GOP Sen. Rick Santorum of 
Pennsylvania, who has received $19,600 since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Another senator who supported the NRA down the line this week  
was Republican Slade Gorton of Washington, who has received $11,400 
from the gun lobby since 1993. Last Saturday, while the bill was on 
the Senate floor, he held two fund-raisers in his home state 
featuring NRA President Charlton Heston. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton told his supporters that Congress couldn't solve the  
problem of gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could tell you the government could pass a law that  
can prevent this from happening,'' Gorton said. ``But the evil in 
Littleton is beyond the scope of the federal government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA opposed two amendments by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,  
to require background checks on all firearms purchases at gun 
shows. The earlier Lautenberg amendment failed, 51-47, but a recast 
measure passed, 51-50, when Vice President Al Gore cast the 
deciding vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 senators who voted against the second Lautenberg  
amendment received an average of $7,377 from the NRA. Only two of 
the 50 senators supporting the provision -- Democrat Kent Conrad of 
North Dakota and Republican Mike DeWine of Ohio -- received any NRA 
contributions. Conrad got $2,000; DeWine, $4,900. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are responsible checks to prevent guns from getting into  
the hands of felons, the mentally ill and kids,'' Conrad said. 
``Frankly, the NRA has become extreme. They're out of step with 
mainstream America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that the requirement to follow the Brady gun-check law  
should apply to everyone at a gun show and that's what this 
amendment did,'' said DeWine said. ``It basically closed a loophole 
in current law; I did not find it to be an unreasonable 
requirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., and Thad Cochran, R-Miss., were the  
only two NRA supporters who did not receive any contributions from 
the organization. But the NRA did give $4,950 to Cochran's 
leadership political action committee.

<HEADLINE> Kids Finding Ways To Get Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From his grandfather's house, 12-year-old  
Andrew Golden got the guns he used to shoot up his Jonesboro, Ark., 
classmates. In Colorado, Dylan Klebold had his girlfriend buy guns 
for him because she was just old enough to make a legal purchase 
and he wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are typical of the ways youngsters in America fairly easily  
can put their hands on guns, according to some of the first 
research into the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want a gun, you're going to get a gun,'' says John  
Cummings, a 17-year-old high school junior from Sherman Station, 
Maine, a small town where hunting is common. 
</P>
<P>
	With more than 200 million guns estimated in circulation in the  
United States -- many in homes for hunting or protection -- it is 
hard to keep guns effectively locked away from or inaccessible to 
children, many experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year-old accused of wounding six classmates Thursday in  
Conyers, Ga., got a rifle and .357 Magnum revolver by breaking into 
a locked cabinet in his family's basement, officials say. His 
stepfather kept guns for hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has preoccupied many Americans since the Littleton,  
Colo., school shooting a month ago. It also has gotten lawmakers' 
attention as the House debates whether to tighten gun laws, 
including raising the minimum age to buy a handgun to 21 from 18 or 
requiring child-safety locks on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Many gun-rights groups, as well as Cummings, the Maine  
teen-ager, say it is youngsters' personalities and cultural 
influences, not access to guns, that determine whether they commit 
violence. Teaching children about gun safety is vital, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because I have access to a gun, that doesn't mean I'm  
going to go out and kill somebody,'' said Cummings, who took a 
safety course before receiving a state hunting license. ``Anyone 
who does that, they've got to be messed up in the head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only in the past few years have government researchers studied  
how young people illegally obtain guns. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released this winter by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco  
and Firearms found that contrary to long-held belief, only 35 
percent of the guns juveniles used in crimes were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	One-third to one-half were bought from licensed dealers by  
someone acting as a ``straw'' intermediary, such as a girlfriend or 
an illegal gun trafficker, the ATF found. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Littleton case, authorities contend that is what  
happened. Three guns were bought legally by the 18-year-old 
girlfriend of Klebold, who was 17, then were given to him and 
friend Eric Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth weapon was bought by a 22-year-old man, who now faces  
charges of providing a handgun to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado authorities say they are treating the girlfriend as a  
witness. Federal authorities refuse to comment on whether she could 
be prosecuted under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun groups say such cases prove federal authorities do not do  
enough under existing law to crack down on illegal traffickers or 
prosecute children found illegally with guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation has a zero-tolerance policy against young people  
bringing guns to school, notes James Baker, chief lobbyist for the 
National Rifle Association. Yet the federal government over the 
past two years prosecuted just eight children for that. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, responding to such complaints, said  
last week that juvenile crime more appropriately is handled at the 
local level. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun restrictions like the Brady Law background check on  
potential gun buyers are intended as preventative measures, rather 
than as prosecution tools, Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Accidents are another major worry. About 200 children are killed  
and more than 1,000 injured each year in gun accidents. The Senate 
last week approved a measure that would require gun safety devices 
sold with all handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Jonesboro school attack, victims' families sued gun  
makers and the young shooters' families. The lawsuit charged that 
the guns Andrew Golden and a friend took from Andrew's 
grandfather's house were not secured in a gun vault and were 
defective because they did not include safety locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet even some gun-control groups say safety devices are not a  
full solution. Many devices can be bypassed by a teen-ager with a 
little ingenuity, says Kristen Rand of the anti-gun Violence Policy 
Center. Also, some of the most popular are flimsy plastic, which 
even a child could crush.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sarah Michelle Gellar learned a few moves  
smooching on the playground she can use now in on-screen love 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making out in parks is a very big thing to do in high school

<HEADLINE>  Indians, Tigers Get Into Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Manny Ramirez was ejected following a brawl in  
the bottom of the sixth inning Saturday as the Cleveland Indians 
and Detroit Tigers exchanged beanballs, pushes and shoves. 
</P>
<P>
	In the top of the sixth, Cleveland starter Jaret Wright, who was  
suspended earlier this season for a brawl in Boston, hit Tony Clark 
in the helmet one batter after giving up a two-run double to Dean 
Palmer that put the Tigers ahead 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, leading off the bottom of the inning, was then hit in  
the head by Detroit rookie Jeff Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez shouted at Weaver as he slowly walked toward first base  
before dashing across the diamond after the right-hander. He was 
met on top of the pitching mound by umpire Jim Evans, who put his 
hands out like a traffic cop in an attempt to stop Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Both benches and bullpens emptied and several small skirmishes  
broke out before order was restored. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ramirez was ejected, plate umpire Chuck Meriwether warned  
both teams about any further retaliation, but that didn't stop 
Wright from coming inside with a pitch to Juan Encarnacion in the 
seventh.

Lofton down with his first -- and only -- pitch and was immediately

<HEADLINE> Boat Qualifies on Indy Front Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Billy Boat finally had something to smile  
about. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis 500 pole-winner a year ago, Boat crashed three  
times in the past week, including once on Saturday as he warmed up 
for his first qualification attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Morning rain, a drop in temperature and high humidity produced  
slippery track conditions. Boat lost traction for just an instant, 
but that was enough to send his car spinning first to the left, 
then to the right and into the Turn 2 wall with heavy damage to the 
right side. 
</P>
<P>
	Car owner A.J. Foyt, watching from trackside, slammed a green  
signal flag to the ground in disgust, then ran back to the garage 
to get his crew started repairing Boat's Dallara-Aurora. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-and-a-half hours later, with the rebuilt car, a relieved  
Boat completed four laps at an average 223.469 mph, putting him on 
the outside of the front row, next to Arie Luyendyk and Greg Ray 
for the May 30 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a stupid incident,'' Boat said. ``You've got to look at  
yourself in the mirror and say, `What's going on?' They just said, 
`Don't worry about it.' I knew we had the race car, and I knew we 
had the setup, but it's been a long week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boat first crashed on May 16, the second day of practice,  
causing heavy damage to the left side and rear. The next day, he 
crashed again, this time damaging the right side. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a really tough week,'' he said. ``I don't think you  
can appreciate qualifying for this race until you go through 
something like this. There's nothing given to anybody here, and my 
boss told me that better than anybody. I really have to thank the 
whole A.J. Foyt crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never once did he say anything negative to me. He's been there  
for me. I'm very fortunate he believes in me,'' Boat said of his 
car owner, a four-time Indy winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Boat qualified on the pole last year at 223.503 mph and led the  
first 12 laps. He finished 23rd after a bad drive line knocked him 
out after 111 laps.

<HEADLINE> Statue Erected in Memory of Joyner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGUNA HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The husband and 8-year-old daughter  
of the late Florence Griffith Joyner helped unveil a statue in 
memory of the three-time Olympic gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seeing it and feeling it, I almost think it's her. (But) all I  
have is her spirit,'' Al Joyner, accompanied by daughter Mary, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue depicts the world's fastest female sprinter with  
hands raised in victory as she crossed the finish line in the 100 
meters at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioned by Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, where  
Griffith Joyner once was a patient, the statue is meant as a 
permanent tribute to a woman who symbolized ``grace, integrity and 
originality,'' said Barry S. Arbuckle, the medical center's chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue was unveiled Friday, eight months to the day after  
the woman the world came to know as ``FloJo'' was found deadat age 
38. She died at her Mission Viejo home in September of asphyxiation 
during an epileptic seizure. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith Joyner won gold medals in the 100 and 200 and the  
400-meter relay at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, 18-year-old Ashley Furst was named winner of a  
Griffith Joyner memorial scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	Furst, a Laguna Hills High School senior, was last year's Orange  
County champion in the 400 meters and boasts a 4.03 GPA. Furst met 
Griffith Joyner at an indoor track meet more than a year ago. Furst 
will attend Harvard in fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``FloJo is the standard, both as an athlete and as a human  
being, by which I measure myself,'' Furst said.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Ewing Coping With His Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Patrick Ewing was a man of few words Saturday,  
although the one sentence the aging warrior uttered did offer a 
glimmer of insight into his stormy state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it's been a rough year,'' Ewing said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was a gloomy choice of words from a player whose spirits  
should be soaring. Ewing's New York Knicks are is ahead 2-0 over 
Atlanta in the second round, have already defeated rival Miami in 
the first round and may have a chance to go up against their other 
chief antagonist from this decade, the Indiana Pacers, in the next 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	So why the long face, Patrick?  
</P>
<P>
	The answer is as complicated as Ewing is complex.  
</P>
<P>
	After 14 years with the same team and not a championship to show  
for it, Ewing's career of unfulfilled expectations looms large in 
the minds of Knicks fans -- and with Ewing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never met one person who doesn't care what other people  
think about him,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``In general, he's 
more appreciated outside New York than he is within New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you're around somebody for so long, you start to  
focus in on the one or two percent of things that are wrong instead 
of the 98 percent of things that are right. It can become a cycle 
of negativity,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach couldn't have summed up any better the feelings this  
championship-starved city holds for the franchise player who was 
expected to bring New York its first title since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	From shaking up the front office to skewering the point guards  
to questioning the coaching, this has been a season of pointing out 
what's wrong with the Knicks -- and Ewing has not escaped the 
dissection. 
</P>
<P>
	There are those who think he still has too much of a role on  
offense, who overlook his defense and who shrug off the array of 
injuries that have slowed Ewing so much this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everyone knew his frustration with not winning, and how  
much he puts into winning, I think they'd see him as a beacon -- a 
guy who's trying to get them that opportunity,'' Van Gundy said. 
``I don't think there's anybody more frustrated with not winning 
than Patrick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the Knicks holding a sturdy lead over the Hawks,  
there's a palpable sense around New York that fans are proceeding 
with caution before jumping on any bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Having seen their team come up short so many times over the past  
decade, Knicks fans won't be overconfident when the big fellow 
lumbers onto the Madison Square Garden court Sunday for Game 3 
against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ewing goes to the foul line in the final minute, they'll  
wonder whether he'll clank the first or clunk the second as he has 
done so many times throughout his career? 
</P>
<P>
	If the game comes down to the final shot, they'll ponder whether  
the ball will go to the shooter, Allan Houston, the slasher, 
Latrell Sprewell, or to the same place it's been going since 1986? 
</P>
<P>
	``Here in New York, people are going to criticize you regardless  
of what you do, good or bad. If you do good, they don't want to 
focus on that. They like to focus on the negative things, and when 
you're down they try to keep you down,'' teammate Charlie Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing always makes it a point to say he doesn't read the  
newspapers, but much of what is written and said gets back to him 
through conversations with teammates and his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been clear this season that Ewing has heard some of the  
comments -- everything from players on other teams questioning his 
leadership of the union to callers on all-sports radio screaming 
``Cut him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism has been tempered somewhat lately by the team's  
late-season success. After struggling to make the playoffs, it 
seems to have hit its stride in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have guys like Spree, a three-time All-Star, and  
Larry (Johnson), a two-time All-Star, we've got guys around him who 
have proven themselves in the playoffs,'' Houston said. ``Everybody 
on this team is capable, so I think he's in a situation where he 
realizes we're all going to do this together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody is going to carry this team on his shoulders.''  
</P>
<P>
	That's a difficult concept for Ewing to accept, given that he's  
always been the main man on the Knicks ever since he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates say Ewing's quiet acceptance of a reduced role --  
especially on offense -- is one of the most overlooked contributions 
he has made to the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Ewing is averaging almost 13 shots per game in the  
playoffs after attempting slightly less than 15 per game during the 
regular season. Five years ago, he averaged 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's sacrificed a lot this year, more than any other year,''  
Ward said. ``Playing hurt, not shooting the ball as much as he did 
in the past, not being the offense every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell is New York's leading scorer in the playoffs with a  
20.4 average, while Houston is second (16.0) and Ewing third 
(13.9). 
</P>
<P>
	The team has been able to run more than it did in the past, and  
the buzz generated in the building by Sprewell and Marcus Camby has 
added a layer of excitement to the Knicks that has been missing for 
a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Hawks nearly on the verge of elimination and the Pacers  
perhaps unprepared for the energy of the newest Knicks, maybe -- as 
much as Knicks fans refuse to believe it -- this could be the year 
when Ewing finally gets the title that seems so overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, Susan Lucci won an Emmy last night after 19 nominations.  
What if Susan Lucci would have given up when people were talking 
about her?'' Ward said. ``It's all about being patient. You never 
know when it's going to happen.''

<HEADLINE> `Star Wars' Crowds Pack Theaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- According to Yoda: ``Size matters not.''  
</P>
<P>
	Except, of course, at the box office, where the ancient, green  
sage might have expected a little more. 
</P>
<P>
	After a strong midweek opening, ticket sales for the ``Stars  
Wars'' prequel fell short of some predictions Friday with a take of 
$18.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still doing terrific business, no question about it,''  
said Paul Dergarabedian, an entertainment analyst with Exhibitor 
Relations Co. ``It's just that the first day was so high that 
anything coming after is going to seem low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sci-fi epic opened with $28.5 million Wednesday, and  
garnered $13.2 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expected the first non-school night showing of ``Star  
Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' to draw hordes of children 
and shatter box office records. 
</P>
<P>
	But rather than help the film, the hype may have hurt it.  
</P>
<P>
	Many people may have avoided the film Friday because they  
thought the shows would be sold out, Dergarabedian said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They turn on the television and see all the long lines and the  
people in costume, and parents and those who aren't really 
voracious fans decide to try seeing the film next week instead,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' was expected to rebound Saturday because  
fewer people have to work and many may realize there are plenty of 
available tickets at the film's 2,970 venues. Saturday figures and 
Sunday estimates were expected Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have predicted the film will gross $120 million to $140  
million by Monday, but 20th Century Fox distribution chief Tom 
Sherak said people are placing too many expectations on the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let the picture play now,'' Sherak said. ``People have written  
that it is disappointing ... It's a great number!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around-the-clock showings of the movie Wednesday helped ``The  
Phantom Menace'' set a new one-day record for box office receipts, 
beating previous title holder ``Lost World: Jurassic Park'' whose 
one-day earnings totaled $26.1 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Box office comparisons are not adjusted for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Newcastle Soccer Fans Confront Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWCASTLE, England (AP) -- Disappointed Newcastle soccer fans who  
had watched their team lose the FA Cup to Manchester United on pub 
televisions Saturday, gathered in the city center until they were 
dispersed by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police reported several small fights but no serious incidents.  
There were ``one or two'' arrests for disorder and a few people 
suffered minor injuries, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing serious but it's bubbling a bit,'' said acting  
Sgt. Brian Maxwell of Northumbria Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 450 of the fans massed in a central marketplace of this  
northern city. Some smashed telephone booths and threw bottles. 
Police dog handlers and mounted officers joined a line of police 
who forced the chanting crowd back and made the fans disperse. 
</P>
<P>
	At London's Wembley Stadium it was a higher-spirited celebration  
for Manchester United fans, whose team completed its third League 
and Cup double of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said at halftime there had been 16 arrests, all for minor  
public order or breach of the peace matters. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manchester, thousands of joyful fans packed pubs and clubs to  
cheer on their hometown victors. Drivers hooted their car horns and 
fans poured on to the streets after the final whistle blew.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Seniors Graduate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo. (AP) -- With the snowcapped Rockies as a  
backdrop, Columbine seniors wearing blue-and-silver gowns marched 
single file Saturday in a graduation ceremony that mixed 
celebration and sorrow for classmates slain in last month's 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated 440 students filed into an amphitheater near the  
school and took their seats while a Columbine band played 
traditional commencement music. 
</P>
<P>
	Tears of joy mixed with the many tears of anguish shed since  
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold scattered gunfire and bombs at 
Columbine, killing 12 students and a teacher, before committing 
suicide themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to move on and get past this,'' said Megan Kelley,  
18. ``We needed this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several students who were wounded in the April 20 attack drew  
applause as they walked or were taken in wheelchairs across the 
stage to collect their diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered as senior Lauren Townsend's mother held up the  
slain student's blue-and-silver gown and kissed it on-stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawn Anna, who also is the school's volleyball coach, was joined  
in the tribute by other family members. Three of Miss Townsend's 
siblings accepted her diploma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't cried a lot but when I saw them up there, holding  
her gown, I cried,'' said Krissa Eggert, 18, who escaped from the 
school's weight room uninjured during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of another slain senior, Isaiah Shoels, did not  
appear at the ceremony. The names of the two gunmen, who were also 
both seniors, were not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us will carry the spirit of (teacher) Dave Sanders,  
Isaiah Shoels and Lauren Townsend into the future,'' said Principal 
Frank DeAngelis. 
</P>
<P>
	Graduate Brandon Bronson, 18, said the commencement helped ease  
the grief of many students, but ``a lot of people are still 
hurting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keynote speakers Sara Martin and Jennifer Wallick asked  
classmates to let go of their grief but not forget the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we remember them all, then they can never leave us,'' said  
Miss Wallick, recalling a vacation to London she took with Miss 
Townsend and others. Miss Martin said she hoped the lessons learned 
in the suffering would ``make us more complete humans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Michelle Markert said, ``We're going to have a special  
bond, even though we're moving on. We'll still have that thing, 
that we all survived something together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seniors were prohibited from wearing blue-and-silver ribbons  
on their gowns, which have been adopted as a symbol honoring the 
Columbine victims. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge on Friday upheld the Jefferson County School  
District's ban on gown adornments because he was concerned one kind 
of ornament would open the door to others that could be offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony ended when the seniors tossed their blue mortar  
boards in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine has been closed since the shooting as investigators  
work on the crime scene. Students are finishing the school year at 
nearby Chatfield High School. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate development, investigators have determined a man  
spotted on the school's roof during the attack was a maintenance 
worker, not a third gunman, as some witnesses have said. It was 
another step in determining whether Harris and Klebold acted alone 
or had help both before and during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	At the graduation, Miss Martin told classmates the tragedy  
``will make us more complete humans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have learned more in this last month than I have in all my  
years of schooling,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Said To Limit Firepower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The teen-age gunman who wounded six  
classmates when he allegedly opened fire at a Georgia high school 
had access to more firepower at home, but chose not to use it, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	That decision -- coupled with 15-year-old Thomas Solomon Jr.'s  
apparent effort to aim low during his shooting spree Thursday -- 
suggests to some that he was trying to avoid killing his Heritage 
High School classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just trying to be heard and not trying to kill  
anybody,'' fellow student Kent Cason said Friday. ``He had his 
chance and he didn't take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who intend to try Solomon as an adult, have charged  
him with 19 felonies, including aggravated assault, illegal weapons 
possession and cruelty to children. The attack left six students 
wounded, none critically, exactly one month after 15 people died in 
the high school shooting rampage in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	If Solomon really sought to leave a trail of bodies behind, he  
could have stolen more powerful weapons from his stepfather's 
locked cabinet at their suburban Atlanta home, according to Sheriff 
Jeff Wigington. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, he chose only a .357 Magnum revolver and a  
sawed-off rifle, which he hid in the legs of his baggy jeans 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot more firepower available to him,'' Wigington  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon also apparently aimed low -- all of the victims' wounds  
were below the waist, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Cason, a 19-year-old senior, said Solomon seemed to  
show a sense of a conscience just prior to the shootings -- warning 
two students to stay away from the school building where he 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told them to stay there so they wouldn't get hurt, and then  
walked into the building,'' Cason said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the suspect -- described as a quiet, typical teen  
who grew sullen after his girlfriend recently dumped him -- was 
making a desperate cry for attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly he had the option and the weapon to do more damage,  
and in not doing that, what he was doing was a way of getting 
attention,'' said Richard Gelles, professor of child welfare and 
family violence at the University of Pennsylvania. ``He knew he 
would get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former acquaintances in Kernersville, N.C., where  
Solomon's family lived for three years until moving to Georgia in 
1997, recalled how he liked to show off his stepfather's guns and 
sometimes talked about bringing one to school. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant Morrison, who attended Atkins Middle School with Solomon,  
said Solomon became fascinated with weapons after an armed man 
tried to steal a minivan from the driveway of the family's home 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Solomon also had his own gun, which he kept in a  
dresser drawer, his friends said. He told people that it was a 
birthday present from his stepfather, said Mike Karriker, 17, who 
lives near Solomon's former home. 
</P>
<P>
	At a closed meeting of parents and students held at a church  
Friday, Solomon's distraught ex-girlfriend, 15-year-old Cara Ward, 
broke down in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said 'I want you to know I was not involved,''' said Jenny  
Stephens, a freshman who is an acquaintance of Miss Ward. ``Then 
she said she couldn't do this anymore and she ran off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those on hand for the meeting -- scheduled by Rockdale County  
school administrators to provide information and hear feedback from 
students and their parents -- said Miss Ward returned about 25 
minutes later and was consoled by friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``She doesn't want anyone to think she's the cause of all of  
this,'' Miss Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the meeting, teens hugged in the parking lot. They were  
expected to gather again today for a counseling session at the 
school, and classes were scheduled to resume Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're just all trying to get our lives back,'' said  
senior Brian Skelton, 18.

<HEADLINE> Jury Convicts Julie Hiatt Steele </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jurors voted 9-3 to convict Julie Hiatt Steele  
and prosecutor Kenneth Starr should ``seriously consider'' retrying 
the case, the jury foreman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Hawxhurst said the evidence that Ms. Steele lied in Starr's  
investigation of President Clinton was ``very persuasive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has until Tuesday to decide whether to seek a retrial of  
Ms. Steele on charges of falsely undercutting Kathleen Willey's 
story of an unwanted sexual advance by Clinton. The first trial 
ended May 7 in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	The foreman, speaking publicly for the first time, said in an  
interview the vote to convict Ms. Steele was the same on each of 
the three charges of obstruction and one count of lying to the FBI. 
His remarks were the first by a juror in which the jury vote was 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawxhurst also said that one of the jurors who voted for  
acquittal ``refused to keep an open mind. When jury deliberations 
began, he said there was no way he was going to change his mind,'' 
said Hawxhurst. ``I felt that there was real bias there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawxhurst is a retired Naval officer who works for Vredenburg, a  
management consulting firm in Reston, Va. ``I'm a Republican and 
somewhat conservative, but I believe I fairly listened and 
considered the evidence and rendered a fair verdict,'' said 
Hawxhurst. 
</P>
<P>
	A juror who voted to acquit Ms. Steele, Thomas Brown, said he  
felt the prosecutors' chief witness, Mrs. Willey, had ``zero 
credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've met liars before, but this is the first time I've met one  
with papers to prove it,'' said Brown, a career civil servant at 
the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown pointed to testimony in this month's trial that after Mrs.  
Willey was granted immunity from prosecution by Starr's office, she 
was caught lying to prosecutors about a relationship she had with 
another man. Starr's investigators subsequently promised in writing 
a second time that Mrs. Willey wouldn't be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown also said Starr's case was ``petty and mean-spirited.  
</P>
<P>
	``After hearing most of the evidence, I got to thinking this was  
the government taking the Thursday afternoon bridge club to federal 
court,'' said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawxhurst said that among the most compelling evidence in the  
case was a videotape of Ms. Steele's appearance on CNN's ``Larry 
King Live'' in which she described a lengthy call from Mrs. Willey 
on a cell phone. Records introduced at the trial show the call 
lasted for less than a minute. In her TV appearance, Ms. Steele 
said Mrs. Willey told her for the first time in that phone call of 
an unwanted sexual advance by the president and asked her friend to 
lie about it to Newsweek magazine. Ms. Steele said she reluctantly 
went along after some discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no way they could have talked about something that  
important in that short a time,'' said Hawxhurst. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey testified that she confided the alleged sexual  
advance by Clinton to Ms. Steele hours after the encounter occurred 
in 1993, not in the 1997 phone call from Mrs. Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawxhurst said three witnesses who testified that Ms. Steele  
told them she'd known for a long time about the sexual advance gave 
``extremely strong testimony. Two of the women didn't even want to 
be there testifying, yet I think they felt an obligation to tell 
the truth, even though it hurt their friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said what ``swayed me'' to vote for acquittal was that  
there were ``too many alternative ways'' all the witnesses and Ms. 
Steele could have learned of the alleged sexual advance by Clinton 
on Mrs. Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The witnesses were acquaintances of both the defendant and her  
accuser, so it would be impossible to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt who told them,'' said Brown. Three prosecution witnesses 
testified they were told that Ms. Steele knew prior to 1997 about 
the alleged encounter between Clinton and Mrs. Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	Loretta Geck, a juror who voted to convict, said ``I thought''  
Mrs. Willey ``was a good witness'' and ``I thought she handled 
herself very well on the stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Geck said she didn't find it implausible that Mrs. Willey  
was unable to recall many details of the alleged sexual advance in 
January 1998 during the Paula Jones case, while providing 
meticulous detail weeks later to Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey explained that she had been badgered by the  
president's lawyer and threatened by an unidentified jogger two 
days before she testified in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case 
against the president. Mrs. Willey also said she was too upset by 
her husband's disappearance to remember that she had confided the 
alleged incident with Clinton to Ms. Steele just hours after it 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, things were confusing, but heaven forbid that all of a  
sudden such things should happen to us,'' said Mrs. Geck. ``She was 
approached'' by Clinton ``and she was threatened. I'd be frightened 
for my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele did not testify at her trial.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us thought that she should have been on there  
testifying,'' Mrs. Geck said of Ms. Steele.

<HEADLINE> Remains of Pueblo Ancestors Reburied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PECOS, N.M. (AP) -- Wind whistled through trees and clouds  
darkened the sky as a closing prayer celebrated the reburial of 
nearly 2,000 skeletal remains of Jemez Pueblo Indian ancestors on 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains, which were excavated from Pecos Pueblo between 1915  
and 1929 by archaeologist Alfred V. Kidder, were returned last week 
from Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that this was the right and dignified thing to do,''  
said Jemez Gov. Raymond Gachupin at the weathered adobe ruins in 
Pecos Pueblo, which was home to the tribe's ancestors and is now 
part of the Pecos National Historical Park. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 Jemez Pueblo Indians -- clad in moccasins, ceremonial  
dresses and traditional ribbon shirts -- paid their last respects at 
the ceremony in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, 25 miles southeast 
of Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
	The ancestors have been ``freed to roam the mountains, hills and  
valleys of their birthplace,'' Gachupin said during the prayer 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains of other tribes across the country will also  
eventually be returned to their homelands under the 1990 Native 
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The return of the Pecos remains and funerary items, which  
represent a wealth of scientific knowledge of the American 
Southwest, is the largest and perhaps most significant transfer 
under the act. 
</P>
<P>
	A century before Kidder's digging, Pecos Pueblo was a thriving  
trading center of plains Indians, other towns and Spanish settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians of Pecos eventually abandoned the town in 1838 after  
it was devastated by war and disease. The Pecos people made a 
100-mile journey westward to what is now Jemez Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, hundreds of Jemez Indians retraced their  
ancestors' footsteps, to meet a tractor-trailer rig bearing the 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Their journey ended Saturday with the unloading of more than 130  
crates. The remains were ceremonially reburied in a 600-foot long 
plot amid juniper and pinon trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lovely place to return home,'' said Barbara Isaac,  
director of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at 
Harvard. ``This is the end of many journeys and it is also the 
beginning of many more journeys.''
