<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Ministers Look to Union's Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the 15
member countries of the European Union (EU) met here on Tuesday to
discuss reforms of European institutions and prepare for the
informal EU summit scheduled for Friday in the Dutch seaside town
of Noordwijk.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are to focus on topics such as the composition of
the European Commission, the EU's executive body, and the role of
the European Parliament, said Dutch government officials, whose
country at present holds EU's rotating six-month presidency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in The Hague is the second phase of talks this week
on revising the union's Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday and Saturday, Dutch Foreign Secretary Michiel
Patijn convened personal representatives of the 15 foreign
ministers in Maastricht in an informal session, and discussed the
responsibilities of the bloc to combat unemployment it faces.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Patijn also proposed giving Britain and Ireland
special status in the Schengen agreement, which aims to eliminate
internal borders between most EU members.
</P>
<P>
The third step in the negotiations follows on Friday in
Noordwijk, where heads of EU states will attend the extraordinary
European Council.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are expected to furnish political guidelines on
issues such as defense and institutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Only after these consultations, diplomats said, would the Dutch
presidency present the draft texts of the revised EU treaty,
produced during the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) which
began last March.
</P>
<P>
This would be shortly before the EU's Summit on June 16-17 in
Amsterdam, a landmark meeting in which the EU was to prepare for
its planned enlargement.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein to Hold Meeting with British Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army's
political wing, Sinn Fein, is expected to meet British officials
on Wednesday to push forward the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein and Labor government officials will meet in the
Northern Ireland capital of Belfast, the first such talks since
the IRA ended its 17-month ceasefire in February last year and
relaunched terrorist actions on the British mainland.
</P>
<P>
The talks were possible after British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who came to power early this month after the May 1
election, eased a ban last week on official contacts with Sinn
Fein in a bid to put new life to the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has been fighting against the British rule in Northern
Ireland for the past 28 years. Both Britain and Ireland banned
official contacts with Sinn Fein after the IRA quit the truce last
year.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's delegation was likely to be led by Martin
McGuinness, its chief negotiator, who won a seat in the British
parliament along with party president Gerry Adams in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Later this week Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo
Mowlam, will visit Washington for discussions with United States
government officials about giving the peace process in Northern
Ireland a new start.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's 60 percent Protestant majority want to stay
British, but the 40 percent Roman Catholics, some of whom support
the IRA, want to merge with Ireland in a united country.

<HEADLINE> Kasparov Asks For Rematch Against "Deep Blue" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, May 20 (Xinhua) -- World chess champion Garry
Kasparov Tuesday insisted to have a rematch against the IBM
supercomputer Deep Blue.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Russia is in Israel to open the International
Kasparov Chess Academy.
</P>
<P>
However, his request was refused by the Deep Blue designers.
</P>
<P>
"A rematch must be played, because from a pure sporting point
of view, this month's match proved very little." said Kasparov.
</P>
<P>
The Russian felt offended as the IBM team took the match
between he and the machine as "a win-or-lose contest at any price".
</P>
<P>
"This attitude created a hostile atmosphere and I was surprised
by the animosity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kasparov said he wanted to play a regulation 10-game match with
Deep Blue, playing every other day instead of every day and there
should be a panel of independent specialists instead of a
referee.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Calls for Bigger EU Role in Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak today called on the European Union (EU) to play a bigger
role alongside the United States to help revitalize the Middle
East peace process, the German Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
During talks with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Mubarak
said he was worried and becoming increasingly disappointed over
the deadlock in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the resumption of constructive talks over peace in the
Middle East was possible only after Israel stopped building Jewish
settlements in Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German business daily, Das
Handelsblatt, (Tuesday issue), Mubarak said Israel should suspend
its Jewish house project at least until the start of negotiations
on the permanent status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Both the Israelis and the Palestinians claim Jerusalem is their
capital.
</P>
<P>
"The problem now is Jerusalem and it gives us a lot of
headaches. If the Israelis were willing to suspend the
construction of settlements until the start of negotiations on
Jerusalem, maybe for six months, things could look quite
different," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He also told the German newspaper that he was deeply
disappointed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who,
as he said, only paid lip service to the implementation of the
Oslo agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Israel must fulfill the agreements reached by Netanyahu's
predecessors, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we can still find a solution to the current
situation in order to bring new movement into the peace process,"
Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who arrived in Bonn Monday for a two-day visit, also
met German President Roman Herzog and Chancellor Helmut Kohl this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kohl told Mubarak that Germany and its EU partners would do
everything possible to support the peace process in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also encouraged Mubarak to continue to play "his very
important role" in the peace process, a German government
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Cipollini Takes Fourth Stage in Giro d'Italia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Mario Cipollini outsprinted the pack
Tuesday to capture his third stage victory in four days in the
Giro d'Italia.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Pavel Tonkov retained the overall leader's
pink jersey, holding a narrow one-second lead over fellow Russian
Eugeni Berzin.
</P>
<P>
Cipollini dominated a crowded sprint following a 156-kilometer
ride from San Marino to Arezzo displaying the impressive power and
speed on the final straight which earned him the nickname of
``Super Mario.''
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Italian edged countryman Endrio Leoni and
Spain's Angel Edo Alsina at the finish.
</P>
<P>
Cipollini, who had won the two first stages of the Giro over
the weekend, lost the pink jersey to Tonkov on Monday following an
uphill individual time trial won by the Russian.
</P>
<P>
Tonkov is seeking to give Russia its third victory in the
Italian tour in four years.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's fourth stage, through a hilly course crossing from
the Marche to the Tuscan region, was marked by several spills in
the final kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The casualties included Colombia's Celio Rocancio, Italy's
Gabriele Colombo and Russian Vladislav Bobrik, who was bruised but
completed the stage.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's fifth stage ending in Terminillo features the first
tough mountainous stage of the 22-leg marathon.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi has pulled out of the
French Open because of an injury in his right wrist, organizers
announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two-time French Open finalist withdrew from the German Open
in Hamburg two weeks ago citing the same injury.
</P>
<P>
The French Open, the only Grand Slam tournament Agassi has
never won, starts next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Agassi has dropped to 28th in the latest ATP
Tour rankings and would not have been seeded in Paris, where he
reached the finals in 1990 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
He won his last Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in
1995. He also took the 1994 U.S. Open and 1992 Wimbledon titles.
</P>
<P>
Agassi's withdrawal came a day after Boris Becker pulled out of
the French Open for the fourth time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Pete Sampras, the top-ranked player in the world, is still
uncertain after having to retire with a thigh injury in a match
Monday at the World Team Cup in Dusseldorf, Germany.

<HEADLINE> HK VIPs Welcome Chief Justice Recommendation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A number of Hong Kong VIPs issued
statements welcoming the recommendation of Andrew K.N. Li as the
Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong
Special Administration Region (HKSAR), which was announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Anson Chan, deputy to the Governor of the HK government, said
in a statement: "I welcome the announcement that the Judicial
Officers Recommendation Commission (Designate) has recommended
that Mr. Andrew Li be appointed as the chief justice of the CFA of
the HKSAR and that Mr. Tung Chee Hwa would accept such a
recommendation and appoint Mr. Li to the position on July 1,
1997."
</P>
<P>
She described Li as "a very distinguished member of the Hong
Kong Bar" and having "an outstanding record of public service".
</P>
<P>
Justice Power, acting chief justice, said in his statement that
the announcement "is noted with great pleasure by all in the
Judiciary."
</P>
<P>
"A smooth transition of the Judiciary is of fundamental
importance for the HKSAR. All members of the Judiciary will give
unstinting support to the new chief justice when he assumes office
on July 1, 1997," Power stated.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the JORC's recommendation earlier today, HKSAR Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa said: "Mr. Li is an outstanding lawyer
with exceptional personal qualities who is very highly regarded in
legal and judicial circles."
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to accept the JORC (Designate)'s recommendation
on his appointment as Chief Justice of the CFA," Tung stated.
</P>
<P>
Andrew K.N. Li was born in Hong Kong on December 12, 1948. He
holds the degrees of Master of Arts and Master of Laws from
Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
He acted as Deputy District Court Judge in August 1982 and as
Deputy High Court Judge in June 1991. After his appointment to
the Executive Council in October 1992, it was not appropriate for
him to accept any temporary appointment with the Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
He was a member of the Executive Council and steward of the
Hong Kong Jockey Club. He served as Chairman of the University
and Polytechnic Grants Committee and the Land Development
Corporation. He served as member of the Law Reform Commission and
the Securities Commission. He is Vice-Chairman of the Council of
the HK University of Science and Technology.

BUDAPEST, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian President Goncz Arpad
held talks with visiting Supreme Head of State of Malaysia Tuanku Jaafar
here today on further strengthening cooperation in science,
culture and sports.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian President's spokesman said the two leaders also

<P>
Tuanku arrived in Budapest on Monday and was scheduled to meet
Gyula Horn during his five-day stay.
</P>
<P>
Economic ties between Malaysia and Hungary have advanced

<HEADLINE> Kabila Postpones Visit to Kinshasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo Laurent Kabila postponed his scheduled visit to
capital Kinshasa today as local citizens and journalists waited
in vein on the main road leading to the city proper.
</P>
<P>
Many papers carried headlines such as "welcome, Kabila",
"hello, Kabila", "bring prospect to Kinshasa, Kabila" and so on
while others made wild guesses over the constitution of the new
government to be formed.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's spokesman in Kinshasa did not give exact reasons for
the delay. Earlier, local media reports said Kabila is expected
to arrive at Kinshasa from his military headquarters in the
southern city of Lubumbashi today to announce his new government.
</P>
<P>
His officers cited security reasons for the delay.
</P>
<P>
"We are making security arrangements in the presidential
palace and other key places. We are trying to improve the
security situation in the city," said one of his officer who
declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
About 600 soldiers of the Alliance of the Democratic Forces
for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) chaired by Kabila,
entered mass-populated Kinshasa on may 17 meeting very little
military resistence from Mobutu's former elite presidential
guards.
</P>
<P>
However, massive looting was done overnight that day by
Mobutu's defeated and scattered soldiers as Kabila's troops, who
only narrowly managed to occupy and guard some key buildings,
facilities and military camps of Mobutu's forces, could not spare
more men to crack down on the looters.
</P>
<P>
More troops entered the city teemed with a population of five
million people to boost control and enhance security. But still,
thousands of gunmen from Mobutu's former government forces turned
underground, posing a major threat to the security situation in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lift of curfew in the city, the streets were
deserted during the night as local citizens, espicially
foreigners, dare not go out.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Beats South China in Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Fresh from their 2-0 FA Cup final
triumph over Middlesbrough three days ago, the British club of
Chelsea scored a 3-2 win over Hong Kong's South China team in an
international exhibition here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Led by former Dutch star Ruud Gullit, Chelsea brought about
almost the same FA Cup final side when they met Hong Kong champion
South China today.
</P>
<P>
South China, a long-time dominant side in Hong Kong's senior
football league, had lost the chance to defend their HKFA Cup
title this year, following their loss to Sing Tao days ago.
</P>
<P>
Having set a target of less goals against and a satisfying
match to local fans, South China had been reinforced today by two
key players from local clubs Sing Tao and Golden.
</P>
<P>
But the first half proved the gap of strength between the two
sides as the visitors led South China 3-0 at the break.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea's Italian international and forward Gianluca Vialli
scored two consecutive goals within five minutes in the half.
</P>
<P>
His fellow countryman and mid-fielder Roberto di Matteo added a
goal in the closing minutes of the half.
</P>
<P>
A reshuffled South China side brought more speed into the game
as they launched more aggressive offensives in the second half. A
header by Shum Kwok Pui found the net and Cheng Siu Chung added
another goal in the dying minute of the match.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls Halt to Paratroop Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
ordered today to halt the cutting of Russian paratroop forces
because, he said, cuts to would diminish the strength of the elite
troops.
</P>
<P>
His press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced this today.
</P>
<P>
Hasty reduction and restructuring of Russia's air forces would
"objectively lead to the fall in the role and potential of the
force," Yeltsin was quoted as saying in a letter to the prime
minister, the defense minister and the chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
He called the paratroops a major strength to carry out
peace-keeping missions, and as reserve forces in peace time.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin asked Defense Minister Igor Rodionov, Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin and the chief of staff to put up a new plan.
</P>
<P>
The original reorganization timetable reduces the paratroopers
from 46,000 men to 34,000 by June 1, and leaves only three
divisions, two training centers and a special regiment.
</P>
<P>
The slashed personnel would go to the ground forces. However an
Interfax report said the Russian Defense Council was to decide at
a meeting on Thursday where precisely the troops would go.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials have been divided over the reform of the
army, which suffers from severe money shortages, poor training and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Particularly controversial is the reduction to the paratroops'
so-called "blue berets" force which is considered one of the most
valuable branches of the Russian forces ready for service.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's dismissal of the paratroops' chief last October was
seen as showing his determination to go ahead with the
military reform. The sacked General Yevgeny Podkolzin had been
opposed to troop cuts.

reform the taxation system and adopt the budget to new taxation
principles,"
</P>
<P>
He said the 1997 budget should not have been drafted before the
rescheduling of ancial debts, improving the bankruptcy procedure,
balancing the national budget and overhauling the social benefit
system had been addressed.
</P>
<P>
"If these issues have not been well addressed, the budget will
not work, and domestic manufacturers will not get real support.
Neither will there be substantial progress in the effort to end
the socio-economic crisis," Kinakh said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the deputies, Kinakh agreed to
coordinate the UUIE's efforts with Parliament to ensure the
adoption of the 1997 budget, and the country's new taxation laws.

<P>
HARARE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A three-day 28th Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association (CPA) Africa region conference started
today in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to discuss the role of
parliamentarians in resolving regional conflicts, the impact of
hiv/aids on development in Africa, the role of opposition in a
multi-party democracy and enhancing women's participation in
politics.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said Africa's opposition political parties should not aim to
overthrow ruling parties as the two should instead co-exist in
order to resolve the bulk of problems afflicting the continent.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some ruling parties had not treated the
opposition fairly.
</P>
<P>
"Some opposition parties believe that they must undo the
government in power by whatever means and that has not really
portrayed our opposition parties in good light," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said, "in some cases our own government parties have not
treated opposition groups in that manner which can cultivate
them."
</P>
<P>
"Even though we are in opposition, we belong to each other, we
are one country, we have one national anthem, we fly the same
flag and we have one nationality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "although some modern democratic concepts were
greatly influenced by the developments in Europe and America,
democracy has never been the preserve of the west."
</P>
<P>
He said the continent's marginalisation was due to the
mistaken notion that mere elections could restructure supposedly
faltering political systems.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif today welcomed Iran's positive response to Pakistan's
proposal of holding a five-nation conference for peace in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing better than the neighboring countries sitting
together for peace in Afghanistan," he said when replying to a
question in a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has proposed a conference of five countries including
Iran, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to find a common
strategy for peace and stability in strife-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Mohammad Mehdi Akhoundzadeh said
Monday that Iran appreciates Nawaz's proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan and Iran should discourage fighting between Afghan
factions," and "both countries should try to bring them to the
negotiating table," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All efforts should be made for an early restoration of peace
and stability which are vital to the development of the region,"
said the Iranian Ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Critical Development Partner: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela today said Zimbabwe is a critical development partner
with whom his country would like to increase cooperation and
trade.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally at the great Zimbabwe national monuments in
Masvingo province, about 300 km south of Harare, Mandela said
measures were already being taken to open up the South African
market to Zimbabwean goods by increasing free trade.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is an extremely important trade partner of South
Africa. It is our number one trade partner in Africa and number
eight in the world. Boosting trade between us is important for
creating growth, more jobs and balanced development," said
Mandela, who is on a three-day state visit to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries were also increasing ties in other
areas like tourism, defence and sport.
</P>
<P>
Freedom in Southern Africa, he said, had created a chance for
the region to realise its dream of cooperation for peace,
development and prosperity through the Southern African
Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa, which currently chairs SADC, would
ensure that regional economic integration did not only benefit
the richer and more powerful members of the group.
</P>
<P>
Mandela thanked Zimbabweans for their support in the struggle
against apartheid, saying South Africans, who gained black
majority rule in 1994, were free partly because the government
and people of Zimbabwe had considered their own freedom
incomplete while their neighbours were still oppressed.

three-set affairs, once in 1987 and another in 1991. It was in
Federation Cup competition at the time and Hy-Boulais was
representing Hong Kong in 1987 before gaining Canadian citizenship
and playing for the Canadian team four years later.

<HEADLINE> FAO Predicts Food Shortage in Great Lakes, East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) has predicted serious food supply
problems in the Great Lakes and East African regions due to a
prolonged drought and civil strife.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report of "Food Supply and Crop Prospects in
Sub-Saharan Africa", FAO said that the food situation facing
Rwandan refugees in Eastern Zaire was grave with hundreds dying
of starvation and disease.
</P>
<P>
In Burundi, the report issued here today noted, the food
supply situation remained tight following a poor 1997 first
season harvest due to the intensified civil strife in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Rwanda, the 1997 first season food production remained
below the pre-civil strife average with about 2.6 million people,
or one third of its population, are in need of food assistance.
</P>
<P>
The report prepared by FAO's Global Information and Early
Warnings System said that severe drought and floods in Eastern
Africa in recent months had led to serious food supply problems.
</P>
<P>
More than three million people are threatened with the food
shortage in large parts of Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, Ethiopia,
Eritrea, Sudan and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, the food supply situation is critical in the
northeastern and Eastern provinces and parts of Central and Coast
provinces affected by drought during the 1996/97 "short rains"
season.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has declared the drought a national
disaster and appealed to the international community for
emergency assistance until the next harvest in July.
</P>
<P>
The report stated that large parts of northern Tanzania,
eastern and southeastern Ethiopia, southern Somalia and eastern
Uganda were also seriously affected by the drought.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted, a good harvest is in prospect in
southern Africa, particularly in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the good cereal harvest in 1996, the southern
Africa's overall food supply situation at the end of the 1996/97
has considerably improved compared to the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that even though the aggregate food aid
needs of Sub-Saharan Africa in 1997 were expected to be about 20
percent lower than 1996, they remained high, estimated at about
1.9 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The decline, it added, was attributed to good harvest in
western Africa and parts of the Horn of Africa in 1996, as well
as the favourable harvest outlook for southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report called for the international community to focus its
attention on extreme suffering of Rwandan refugees in eastern
Zaire and the precarious food supply situation in East Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.N.to Deploy 200 More Observers to Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is to deploy 200
additional short-term observers to Liberia for the country's
legislative and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
They will join the 36 U.N. civilians and military observers already
in Liberia, Tuliameni Klomoh, special representative of the UN
Secretary-General, said today in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the observers now in Liberia conduct daily
reconnaissance missions to the 13 counties of the country to gather
information on road conditions and population distribution patterns.
</P>
<P>
They also report on the activities of political parties in the
interior part of the country and the movement of refugees in the
border areas, Klomoh said.
</P>
<P>
They would be instrumental to verifying voters' registration which
is a crucial aspect of the electoral process, he added.
</P>
<P>
On voter education, he said, a professional radio programer
employed by the UN observers mission is developing a coherent program
that would ensure voters receive neutral and factual information on
the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the UN development program has been providing Liberia's
seven-member indepenent electoral commission with logistic assistance,
while the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has started a voluntary
repartriation program for the Liberians who fled the country during
the seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The polls in Liberia was earlier scheduled for May 30 but has been
shift to July at the request of some political parties who insist that
a postponement will give enough room for better preparation.
</P>
<P>
West African leaders are to meet tomorrow in Abjua to decide a new
date for the elections.
</P>
<P>
On the new election date, Kalomoh advised against a prolonged delay
in the elections, saying "ECOWAS has invested so much in Liberia and
it would be disastrous if all the noble sacrifices made were
compromised merely because of lack of extension of the election date
by a few more days."

LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Aer Rianta, Ireland's state-owned
airports authority, is to set up 12 duty-free shops in Hong Kong's
new Chek Lap Kok airport, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Aer Rianta, the world's fifth biggest duty-free company, has
successfully won the deal worth about 200 million US dollars a
year in a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Aer Rianta was reported as saying the latest
deal to manage the duty-free shops in Hong Kong was a further
evidence of Aer Rianta's global ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Aer Rianta has duty-free outlets in Moscow, Bahrain, Kuwait,
Cyprus, Kiev, Beirut and Damascus as well as at both ends of
Channel Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts say that the booming Irish duty-free
industry is likely to be hit as the European Commission is
considering to eliminate duty-free sales within the European
Union by 1999.

<HEADLINE> German Firm Admits Melting Down Holocaust Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The German chemicals corporation
Degussa today said its wartime files showed that the company
"apparently" melted down gold and silver looted by Nazis from Jews
during the Holocaust, said reports reaching here from Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said the documents did not specify origins
of the metals and Degussa officials were currently discussing ways
of making this point clear.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made in response to a report today by
Germany's ARD public television claiming that dental gold and
jewelry from Holocaust victims were delivered to the company.
</P>
<P>
The TV report came after the United States and Britain called
for holding of an international conference to help the Tripartite
Gold Commission identify and distribute the treasures looted by
Nazi Germany and held in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
The commission consisting of Britain, France and the United
States first met in 1946 and proposed that neutral countries such
as Switzerland, where the Nazis stored much of their loot, return
to governments and individual victims or their heirs the property.
</P>
<P>
New evidence however showed that the Swiss banks might have
deliberately held back some of the assets.
</P>
<P>
In light of this, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a joint statement
in Washington, "The Tripartite Gold Commission should complete its
work as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
They proposed to convene an international conference in London
before the end of this year to discuss the new evidence.

NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The General Motors of the U.S.
reached an agreement with the Chinese government to make the No.1
auto maker the leading candidate to win a car-making project in
China, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for GM said that if the company's participation was
confirmed, the venture initially would build 50,000 vehicles a
year. But he said production could be increased to as much as
100,000 units annually down the road, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper said GM's Germany-based Adam Opel AG unit would
operate the project and would use the plant to build small
passenger cars. The model GM will build was not identified, but it
is likely to be variant of the Opel Corsa or Astra or possibly an
ultrasmall car planned for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the venture will likely be located in
Guangzhou in southern China, where there is already a joint
venture manufacturing Peugeot cars with a French partner.

BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Despite increasing overseas
competitions, in particular from Asia, Germany still leads the
world in organizing trade fairs, with six of the world's top-ten
fair organizers with the largest turnovers now headquartered in
the country, a German newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual report issued by the Exhibition and

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Improvement of Bathing Water Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Still one out of three fresh water
bathing zones in the European Union (EU) countries is
insufficiently monitored or does not meet the minimum quality
requirements, says a report published here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, on quality of bathing water in EU member countries,
covers about 13,000 seaside beaches and 6,000 fresh water areas.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Ritt Bjerregaard, EU commissioner for environment,
therefore urged everyone and every country concerned to make every
effort in improving the quality of fresh water zones, while
continuing the efforts already made and preserving the good
quality at seaside.
</P>
<P>
She called particularly on Germany, France, the Netherlands,
Spain and Portugal "to prove over the next bathing season that
they are able to improve the situation."
</P>
<P>
"They have shown that they are able to do it for their seaside
beaches, so I am confident that they can do it for their fresh
water bathing areas as well," she said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner explained that it was not only the health
aspect that attracted people to go to the beach, but the
"aesthetic" aspect of the water should also be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the European Commission, the EU's executive body,
adopted a proposal for a revised directive on bathing water
quality, which was aimed at further improving the water quality in
bathing zones of EU member countries.

<HEADLINE> Kabila in Kinshasa to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Guo Ming)
</P>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Head of State of the Democratic
Republic of Congo Laurent Kabila tonight arrived in the capital
Kinshasa from his military base in Lubumbasi with the mission to
form "a broad-based unity government".
</P>
<P>
Kabila did not make any formal statement at the airport and
drove directly to the city under the escort of his security men.
</P>
<P>
Local Kinshasa citizens and hundreds of foreign journalists
had been waiting for a whole day in the airport, along the main
road leading to city proper and at the entrance of the
intercontinental hotel where he is supposed to stay.
</P>
<P>
Later reports said he had postponed the mission for security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Declaring himself to be head of state and changing the country
name of Zaire to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kabila is
expected to announce a "broad-based" salvation government
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Although Kabila had declared earlier that the mobutists,
followers of toppled President Mobutu Sese Seko, would be
excluded from the new government, diplomats said a couple of
"light-weight" cabinet positions might be reserved for them only
to show that the government is really "broad-based" and
democratic.
</P>
<P>
But one thing is sure that various opposition parties
including the Sacred Heart Alliance led by twice Former Prime
Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, would be given places in the
government.
</P>
<P>
"The new government will take up the challenge left by
Mobutu's decaying regime to re-build this country which has been
crushed to pulp," said Grattas Bugera, General Secretary of the
Alliance of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo-Zaire (ADFL) chaired by Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Bugera, Kabila's second man, arrived in Kinshasa on Monday to
prepare for Kabila's entry.
</P>
<P>
So did Kabila's Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha, who arrived
here this afternoon and was mistaken for Kabila himself by some
foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has promised to hold the general elections in the
central Africa's largest nation within two years, arguing that
the Zairean people will have to be senticized about and prepared
for democracy first.
</P>
<P>
On May 17, the Congo People's Liberation Army, under the
leadership of Kabila's ADFL, caputured Kinshasa, the last
"liberated" city in the mineral-rich African country.
</P>
<P>
The 3.45-million-square-meter territory of the country fell to
the hands of Kabila's revolting troops within only seven months.
</P>
<P>
And Mobutu, who was in the Togolese capital of Lome on Sunday
and Monday, is believed to be flown to Morocco in Exile.

<HEADLINE> Germany Registers Major Growth in Patent Applications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- German patent authorities received
64,894 patent applications for innovations and new production
proceedings in 1996, up nearly 25,000 from the level of 1990,
German Research Minister Juergen Ruettgers said in a newspaper
today.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Germany's patent applications at the
European Patent Office also grew from 60,754 to 64,033, said
Ruettgers in the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
Calling the growth a "true innovative advance" and an
"extremely encouraging development", Ruettgers also admitted that
German researchers should still make great efforts.
</P>
<P>
Germany has been lagging behind the United States and Japan in
the number of patent applications in the past few years. To make
up the gap and to ease patent application, German government has
taken a number of measures, including successfully pressing the
European patent authorities to reduce patent application fees by
20 percent from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The German Patent Office has also been asked to speed up its
patent approval procedures.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, German government also launched an
initiative to offer financial support of up to 15,000 German marks
(8,900 U.S. dollars) to encourage small and medium companies to
apply for patents. According to Ruettgers, this initiative had
already achieved positive results: 215 small and medium firms in
the country had made use of the support to apply for their first
patent so far.
</P>
<P>
According to Ruettgers, the government is planning to earmark
about 8.5 million marks (about five million dollars) for this
purpose until 1998.

LUANDA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 6,800 UNITA soldiers have
been disbanded in the first phase of the implementation of the
rapid disbandment plan in Angola so far, a UN source said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Rosa Malingo, an official from the UN Humanitarian Aid
Coordination Agency, told reporters that the disbandment work is
still under way in several quartering camps scattering in Huambo
Province in central Angola and there are also 5,000 UNITA
soldiers waiting for their disbandment.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the implementation of the rapid
disbandment plan will be started on June 2. In this stage, 10,000
UNITA soldiers will be disbanded, she added.
</P>
<P>
The UN official also noted that the number of deserters who
have left the camps without authorization among the UNITA
soldiers is still increasing, which is adding more difficulties
to the selection of soldiers into the unified army of Angola.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that the number of the deserters has reached more
than 25,500 so far, adding that all the 15 assembling camps are
make efforts to persuade the deserters to return to their
camps.

<P>
BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- German Research Minister Juergen
Ruettgers today urged the European Commission to make it a top
priority to upgrade the transmission speed of the European
research computer network so as to remove "artificial national
boundaries" within Europe in computer networking.
</P>
<P>
Ruettgers made the remarks on the occasion of the enlargement
of the European research network through the TEN-34
(Trans-European Network), which went into operation Tuesday in
Cambridge, Britain.
</P>
<P>
TEN-34 links the national research networks in Europe and
improves European researchers' access to data-banks in other
countries. However, it has only a data transmission speed of 34
megabit per second, a far cry from the current German research
network with 155 megabit per second.
</P>
<P>
European research cooperation needs efficient transmission
possibilities across national borders, Ruettgers said. If the
European network cannot keep pace with national ones, European
computer world will have to deal with artificial national
boundaries which have just been removed by road traffic, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Strives to Settle Refugee Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Nengbiao)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The refugee problem is a big
headache to African countries, but they are making their efforts
to cure it.
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 million people across the world who come under the
concern of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more
than nine million are Africans, accounting for 35 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Among the people are refugees and others in a similar
situation, as well as returnees and certain groups of people
displaced within the borders of their own country.
</P>
<P>
Of the about 13 million refugees throughout the world, 5.6
million are Africans, constituting 42 percent of the total. In
addition to these refugees in the continent, there are 1.3
million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and two million
returnees who are still under the concern of UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Most African countries have become ones of asylum and some of
them are countries of origin as well as asylum.
</P>
<P>
So far 1.7 million Rwandan refugees remain in Burundi,
Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire, 750,000 Liberian refugees in Guinea,
Cote Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria, 446,000 Somali refugees in
Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Yemen, 424,000 Sudanese refugees in
Uganda, Zaire, Kenya and Ethiopia, 324,000 Angolan refugees in
Zaire, Zambia, Congo and Namibia, and 320,000 Sierra Leonean
refugees in Guinea and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Since the war broke out in Zaire, 300,000 refugees, including
the Rwandan and Burundi refugees who fled to the country earlier,
have fled from the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Armed border conflicts between countries over territorial
disputes, civil wars and internal ethnic feuds are root causes
leading to the influx of the African refugees.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic conflicts often break out in such countries as Rwanda
and Burundi. More than 700,000 Burundi refugees fled to Rwanda,
Tanzania and Zaire in 1993 when a bloody ethnic conflict broke
out. 500,000 Tutsis were massacred by Hutus in a short period of
several months in that year.
</P>
<P>
After Tutsis defeated the government led by Hutus, about two
million Hutus fled to the neighboring countries in fear of
retaliation. So far 1.7 million Burundi refugees remain in the
neighboring countries including Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Howerver, African countries have been making great efforts to
remove the root causes of the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
Since the civil war broke out in Zaire in October in 1996,
Kenyan President Denial arap Moi has sponsored three regional
summits, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held a special
summit in March this year and central African countries also held
a regional summit to try to seek a peaceful solution to the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The OAU as well as Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Tanzania have
been striving to help realize ethnic reconciliation in another
Great Lakes country of Burundi. The annual OAU summit to be held
next month will also discuss the refugee problem and try to seek
a last solution to it.
</P>
<P>
Once wars end, situation stabilizes in African
countries, both the countries of origin and asylum
coordinate their efforts under the international assistance to
repatriate and resettle the refugees.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, 240,400 Rwandan refugees returned to their home
country from Uganda, Zaire, Burundi and Tanzania, 159,000
Mozambican refugees were repatriated voluntarily from Zimbabwe
and South Africa, 35,200 Ethiopian refugees from Djibouti, Sudan
and Kenya as well as 21,500 Eritrean refugees from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Although a lot of the African countries face
shortages of drinking water, food, firewood and medicines, they
provide as much assistance as possible for refugees.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, although poor, has accommodated 13,000 refugees from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
A three-man joint team of the OAU and UNHCR praised Zambia for
caring and accommodating more than 3,000 Zairean refugees despite
its economic and financial constraints after touring recently
Maheba refugee camp in North-Western Province of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the camp, farming is the main pre-occupation, the refugees
are living a normal life and bringing up children, some of whom
are attending school.
</P>
<P>
The team expressed its satisfaction with the development plan of
the refugee camp, and pledged to sell the idea in other parts of
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's PM Courts EU Investors For MSC Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad outlined here today his plans to create the world's first
digital state that will enable companies to explore the limits of
multimedia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Imperial Collete, the Prime Minister focused on the
MSC and the opportunities it will create for Western investment
and expertise.
</P>
<P>
The Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) is a 15 by 50 kilometer
zone extending south from Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, to the
new Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The MSC will offer a unique environment, combining
world-leading IT and physical infrastructure with a comprehensive
package of incentives and support, in which multimedia companies
can develop new technologies and applications.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's future capital city of Putrajaya and the new city of
Cyberjaya, the world's first IT city designed from ground up, will
form the nucleus of this Multimedia Super Corridor, according to
Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
The MSC will have seven "Flagship Applications", each designed
to pioneer the strategy behind specific aspects of the electronic
economy.
</P>
<P>
Standards and solutions for each area are already being
developed by the Malaysian government working in partnership with
Microsoft, Sun, Netscape, EDS and IBM, the Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure timely implementation and smooth the way for
companies interested in using the MSC for their operations, the
Malaysian Government has set up the Multimedia Development
Corporation that functions as a high-powered one-stop shop for the
MSC.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 potential investors from EU countries attended
the open conference on the Multimedia Super Corridor.

<HEADLINE> First National Remote Medical Treatment Network to Be Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's first nationwide remote
diagnosis network is expected to become operational by the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
The Health News reported that the first group of hospitals to
be connected to the satellite network will be 20 hospitals in 10
provinces and prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the network is led by the Ministry of
Health. The network will link up with another 60 hospitals in
various provinces by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, more than 80 percent of China's
population live rural areas while more than 80 percent of
hospitals have been built in large or medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
Residents in remote areas have many difficulties in receiving
advanced medical service. Many of them have to make a long journey
to big cities to have their diseases diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
The satellite network can not only offer high-level diagnosis
of difficult and complicated cases and work out treatment plans
for patients in rural areas, it can also arrange Sino-foreign
academic exchanges for hospitals or medical colleges and
universities.

<HEADLINE> German Minister Concerned About Companies' Neglect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Concerned about dwindling
opportunities for young people to get vacational trainings, German
Youth Minister Claudia Nolte has proposed to punish those
companies which do not offer vacational trainings.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper Express, Nolte said
those companies which do not train young people should not be
allowed to get government research promotion funds and should be
denied of government contracts, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
If appeals cannot make enough impact, such measures should be
considered, Nolte said, adding that it is unacceptable for a
number of large enterprises to duck their social responsibility
for training.
</P>
<P>
Plagued by a sluggish economy and record-high unemployment in
the country, German companies are increasingly reluctant to
conduct vacational training. According to a survey published
earlier this month, lack of apprenticeship is among the top
concerns shared by German youngsters from 12 to 24 years old.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Gears up Relief Work in Cyclone-hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The relief activities were going on
in full swing in the cyclone-hit areas under the direct
supervision of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today, said a high
official of the Bangladeshi government.
</P>
<P>
Jawadul Karim, press secretary to the prime minister, told
newsmen that the prime minister today rushed to the affected areas
in Hatiya, Swandip, Teknaf and Banskhali to see for herself the
sufferings of the people in those counties.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, a devastating cyclonic storm struck the
coastal belt of Bangladesh at a frightful speed ranging from 180
to 200 kilometers per hour, tearing and twisting everything that
came in its way.
</P>
<P>
Jawadul Karim denied a report in some local newspapers that
about 500 people were feared killed by the storm, saying only 95
so far were killed, two persons missing and 7,844 injured.
</P>
<P>
He said the relief and rehabilitation coordination center in
the Prime Minister's Secretariat has been maintaining the constant
contact with the control rooms in the district headquarters as
well as those in different ministries to monitor the post cyclone
activities.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,899 cattle were lost during the cyclone, he said, adding
that crops on 29,951 hectares of land were damaged.
</P>
<P>
The storm also damaged 75 bridges, 153 kilometers of roads and
embankment, 608 educational institutions and 718 cyclone shelters,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary said 2.55 million Taka (about 63,750 U.S.
dollars) in cash has been allocated from the Prime Minister's
Relief Fund for distribution among the cyclone-hit people.
</P>
<P>
Besides, about 34,000 pieces of clothes, 39,000 pieces of old
clothes, 50,600 pieces of plates and glasses, 400 tons of wheat,
2,100 tins of biscuits have been allocated for distribution in the
cyclone-hit areas, he added.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Urges Big Budget Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian new government
urged the parliament Wednesday to back a plan demanding drastic
spending cuts to bring the budget into line with the poor revenue.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin made the call in his
accounts for the first four months.
</P>
<P>
The government, reshuffled and rejuvenated by President Boris
Yeltsin two months ago, is expected to present a bill calling for
spending cuts of 108 trillion roubles (19 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Russia gathered only 64.4 percent of
the tax revenue budgeted for the first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said the GDP (gross domestic product) was keeping
the same level as the same period last year. Industrial production
was improving despite the six percent inflation in the first
four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
There were rises in automobile production, textiles and other
industry products.
</P>
<P>
He also said real income had gone up by four percent, and
unemployment had leveled off.

<HEADLINE> UAE Official: Iraq's Return to Arab Ranks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's return to the Arab forces
will contribute to the security in the Gulf region, said a leading
UAE military official whose speech was published here today.
</P>
<P>
Lt. General Sheikh bin Zayed al Nahyan, chief of staff of the
UAE Armed Forces, pointed out "There is a lack of strategic balance
in the Gulf area, especially due to the absence of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The situation is difficult to be changed at present or in the
near future even if Iraq comes back with its full force, but
Iraq's return to the Arab and international forces is still vital
to the stability of the region, the general added.
</P>
<P>
Military experts here said the general's speech is likely to be
a hint to strengthen Gulf Arab countries' military power along
with Iraq's come-back to face Iran, a long-term potential threat
claimed by most of the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Iran's military power has been reinforced since the 1991 Gulf
war and its recent mock battles have caused serious concerns among
the Gulf states, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
On May 11, Iran began a several-day military exercise in
the Gulf and the Sea of Oman, close to the Strait of
Hormuz which is an important thoroughfare for oil exporting
from the region.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here believed the military power of the Gulf states
is obviously not enough to encounter Iran due to their limited
human resources.
</P>
<P>
"A Peninsula Shield is never able to halt moves by millions of
Iranian troops," they said.
</P>
<P>
To defend the security of the region, the Gulf states set
up coalition forces named Peninsula Shield in early
1990. The troops are composed of less than 20,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said that before the 1990's Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, the Gulf countries could protect themselves through
supporting Iraq, a major military contender for Iran in the
region. The two sides tied in an eight-year war which broke
out in 1980.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq's military machine has been paralyzed
under the pressure of U.N. arms destruction resolutions and trade
sanctions since the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf countries are depending on a large foreign presence,
particularly that of the U.S. and its western allies, to face
Iran's threats, experts said. But it is only a makeshift
arrangement, they added.
</P>
<P>
The UAE chief of staff said that the westerners will sooner or
later withdraw from the Gulf region due to economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
More than 65 percent of the world's oil is exported daily from
the Gulf region, thus linking the interest of the world to the
area, he said. Foreign presence in the Gulf will disappear as
soon as their interests cease to exist, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They came to the area because of economic reasons and
will leave also due to economic reasons," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sixth Regional Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) of the
Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China ended its fifth session
here today.
</P>
<P>
Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, chairman of the CPPCC Tibet Regional
Committee, said in his closing speech that maintaining social
stability in Tibet is an important guarantee for the smooth
advancement of the reform, opening up, and modernization drive in
the region.
</P>
<P>
It is an important task of CPPCC organizations and members
across Tibet to expose and denounce the Dalai Lama's crimes of
splitting the motherland and doing harm to Tibet and to the
Tibetan Buddhism, said Pagbalha, who is also vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all CPPCC members in Tibet must maintain a
clear mind and take a firm and clear-cut stand in the struggle
against the Dalai's separatist activities, and should use facts
and truth to help the people immune against the deception of the
Dalai clique.
</P>
<P>
During the session, CPPCC members from all seven prefectures
and cities in Tibet discussed how to promote material, ethical,
and cultural progress for the autonomous region, and how to
enhance the democratic supervision over and involvement in
regional political and government affairs by the CPPCC.

BONN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras
Wednesday withdrew from the World Team Cup Tennis Championships in
Duesseldorf due to injury.
</P>
<P>
However, the American said he would play in the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who retired from his opening match against Australia's
Mark Philippoussis on Monday after straining his upper left thigh
muscle, was ruled out of the U.S. tie with Croatia. He had hoped
to play on Friday, but the doctors advised him to rest the leg.
</P>
<P>
Despite the injury, Sampras said he was confident about his
chances of winning the French title, the only grand slam to elude
him.
</P>
<P>
He played his best-ever French Open last year reaching the
semifinals before losing to eventual champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
Sampras leaves for the French capital on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras's clay-court campaign this season has been affected by
injuries and the World Team Cup was only his third event after

<HEADLINE> Nepali Youth Climber Scales Mount Qomolangma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali climber today reached
the summit of Mount Qomolangma through the southern route, Nepal's
Tourism Ministry announced here.
</P>
<P>
Danuree Sherpa, 36, who reached the 8,848-meter peak at 1:00 PM
(local time) today, belongs to a six-member Nepali Youth
Expedition which left here nearly one month ago for the expedition.
</P>
<P>
The team had been stranded in a camp at a height of nearly
6,000 meters for over 10 days despite its earlier plan to make
their final attempt in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The youth expedition was sponsored and organized by a Nepali
youth organization to show Nepali youth's commitment to world
peace and herald the 14th World Youth and Student Festival, which
is to be held in Havana, Cuba in July this year, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four members of an international Qomolangma
expedition led by British climber Jonathan Tinker and two Nepali
mountain guides also successfully scaled Qomolangma via the south
face, the ministry said, adding that so far the names and others
details of the summitters are not available.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Parliament Elects New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's parliament today approved
as prime minister Ivan Kostov, the leader of the Union of
Democratic Forces (UDF).
</P>
<P>
Kostov won the nomination with 179 votes to 54, with no
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Kostov, 48, was finance minister in the Dimiter Popov
government in 1991 and the Filip Dimitrov cabinet in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Kostov, a former professor of economics, became head
of the UDF, which defeated the ruling Socialists and won the
legislative elections last April 19.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Kostov introduced new cabinet ministers and the
guidelines of his government policies to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Economic reforms and luring more foreign investment would be
the government's most urgent tasks, Kostov said.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to privatize all industrial and commercial
enterprises, including most infrustructure projects, by 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kostov said the new government would also focus on cracking
down on crime and corruption and seeking entry to the European
Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
The UDF reached consensus on these guidelines with Bulgaria's
major political parties after its victory in the April 19
legislative elections, and the Bulgarian parliament also made a
national reconciliation announcement.
</P>
<P>
This laid a solid foundation for Kostov and his party, which
are expected to receive broad support from political parties and
common people.
</P>
<P>
Kostov named three deputy prime ministers, who will be in
charge of the economy, regional development and public affairs,
and ideology and institutional reforms respectively.
</P>
<P>
The new government inherited three ministers from the caretaker
cabinet among its 14 ministries.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian parliament is now debating the government's
policy guidelines, after which it will vote on the new cabinet.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Namibia announced
today that it will relax foreign exchange control measures.
</P>
<P>
In its statement issued in Windhoek, the bank said it had
decided to abolish indicative limits on current account
transactions "except where limits are retained to make the
remaining restriction on capital outflow effective."
</P>
<P>
Namibians travelling abroad would be allowed a maximum of
80,000 Namibian dollars (18,000 U.S. dollars) and 25,000 ND (5682
dollars) per child under 12 each calendar year. This increased
from ND60,000 (13,636 dollars) allowed previously.
</P>
<P>
"The previous distinction between neighbouring and other
countries has been dispensed with," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding capital account transactions, the limits for direct
foreign investment have been increased from ND20 million (4.5
million dollars) to ND30 million (6.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Namibian corporates will now be allowed to raise financing
abroad on the strength of their local balance sheet, while, in
the past, offshore financing had to be obtained without any
recourse to or guarantee from Namibia," the bank said. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- K.Y. Amoako, executive
secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), today said ECA attaches much importance to the
strengthening of Africa's information capacities.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement at the seventh meeting of the
Coordina- ting Committee on African Statistical Development
(CASD) at Africa Hall here, Amoako described the information
development in Africa as "very unsatisfactory", saying that "the
state of information development in Africa is characterized by
lack of or poor quality of data, weak or inadequate
telecommunication systems, lack of a critical mass of trained
personnel, and laws and regulations that impede information
flows."
</P>
<P>
The ECA chief said the rehabilitation of Africa's statistical
infrastructure has continued to be a priority area for ECA in
order to assist in the development of sustainable national
statistical systems.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that all African countries, and in particular their
national statistical offices, will be linked to ECA and other
international organizations, to enable speedier transfer of
development information.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will listen to report to the CASD by the
secretariat, consider proposed task forces and discuss
"mobilization of resources for the implementation of CASD
activities".
</P>
<P>
CASD was established in 1992 in response to the recognition of
the need to ensure the success of technical cooperation at both
national and regional levels through proper coordination of
various statistical development activities in Africa. According
to the mandate of the CASD, it acts as coordinating body for
statistical development activities in Africa and monitors overall
implementation of the Addis Ababa Plan of action for statistical
development in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of Continued Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite the recent slowdown in the
stock market, the Philippine government remained optimistic that
the economy will continue to grow and the 7-8 percent growth
target for this year will be attained.
</P>
<P>
Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said here
today that early economic indicators all point to a continued
robust overall growth in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The month-on-month manufacturing growth presents "an
encouraging picture", with the output growing by an average of
over 7 percent in January and February this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural growth was also very "encouraging" by registering
a 22 percent growth during the first quarter in stark contrast to
the 3.4 percent in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Habito also disclosed that sales earnings of major companies
have expanded, while the country's inflation rate and the growth
in the merchandise trade deficit continued to slow down.
</P>
<P>
"We, therefore, see the full-year Gross National Product growth
target of 7-8 percent to be attainable at this point," Habito
said, adding that the economy would improve further in the latter
quarters this year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Stock Exchange suffered several sharp plunges
this month amid fears that the country's economy had become
"overheated" as in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Arafat Holds US Responsible for Peace Process Impasse (I) (by Huai Chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat hit the nail on the head
when he pointed out Monday that the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian
peace process is exacerbated by a lack of U.S. pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian journalists told Xinhua that although Arafat was
reluctant to openly point an accusing finger at the U.S., yet
what he said holds water.
</P>
<P>
No one in the U.S., including President Bill Clinton,
prevented Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu from scoring
what he considered to be a major achievement on issues related to
the final status of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements in the
occupied Palestinian territories. He successfully defied both
U.S. advice and the harsh Arab and international opposition to
construction of a new settlement at Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. efforts to reverse the deterioration, sparked by the
beginning of construction at Har Homa and the subsequent Hamas
suicde bombing attack in Tel Aviv that killed three Israeli
women, have followed prescriptions established by the hardline
Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
These prescriptions do not include reconsideration of the scope
of "further redeployment" or of the decision on the Jewish
settlement construction on Har Homa. On the contrary, they urge
Palestinian efforts, in secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
approving words, to "dismantle the infrastructure of the
(Palestinian) terrorist organizations."
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the United States in early April,
Netanyahu did not accept any U.S. proposals for Israeli
confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also declared that Israel does not intend to
procceed with the second "further redeployment," scheduled to
take place in September, if his proposal for accelerated final status
negotiations is accepted and, contrary to U.S. expectations, this
second redeployment will be no larger than the first -- that is,
the transfer to Palestinian control of a further 2 percent of the
West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Arafat Holds US Responsible for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ha'aretz, a leading Hebrew daily in Israel, reported on April
9 that "Clinton did not specifically request that Netanyahu stop
construction at Har Homa, or in settlements in general, but
asked that Israel refrain from taking unilateral decisions as
long as negotiations continue and that it notify the U.S. in
advance about all construction in the occupied territories."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Albright took a more forceful line at
her meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in
Washington. The meeting was described by an Israeli official as
"uncomfortable."
</P>
<P>
Albright reportedly explained that the settlement expansion
imperils chances for dialogue, asked for an explanation of
Mordechai's recent approval of new construction in various
settlements, and demanded a freeze on all settlement
construction.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials were subsequently informed by U.S. Middle
 East peace coordinator Dennis Ross that the United States cannot
halt settlement construction at Har Homa to meet one of the
Palestinians' central demands. The idea of a settlement freeze
has been incorporated in a more general U.S. effort to persuade
Netanyahu to refrain from taking unspecified unilateral measures.
</P>
<P>
U.S. efforts to reverse the Har Homa decision or to win
an Israeli pledge to freeze settlements have not been pursued
with vigor or with any apparent confidence of their success.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, by its long-standing support for
the settlements' "natural growth," recognized this element of the
process. The U.S. refusal to view settlement expansion as a
unilateral action that prejudices negotiations of a final status
issues was based on the same reasoning.
</P>
<P>
The problems that have dominated the headlines, however, have
not affected the strategic interests binding U.S.-Israeli
cooperation. As the Israeli newspaper Globes pointed out, "Even
as Albright was making her demands, Mordechai was being assured
by American officials that the present high level of
U.S.-Israeli defense cooperation would continue unabated, with or
without regard to the unfolding developments at Har Homa or in
the West Bank.:
</P>
<P>
Indeed, according to reports from Washington, American
support for the Israeli-developed Arrow anti-missile system will
now be substantially increased, other defense aid will not be cut
back, and current levels of intelligence sharing between the two
countries will remain very much intact.

<HEADLINE> PKK Kidnaps 5 Workers in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the illegal Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) today kidnaped five workers when they
attacked a coal mine near Sirnak province of southeastern
Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A group of PKK militants threatened the workers out of
the mine with weapons at noon and gathered them, said the
agency, adding that the PKK guerrillas later took them straight
to the Cudi mountain.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels launched various attacks in southeastern
Turkey as a Turkish contingent of about 25,000 to 50,000
troops has crossed the border into northern Iraq, trying to
eradicate all the PKK militants based there.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels blocked Sunday night for several hours the
southeastern Mardin-Sirnak main road by burning two oil tanker
trucks, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, the PKK militants launched a dozen
of rocket attacks against the government buildings on the town
of Derik in nearby Mardin province without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the PKK rebels also ambushed village
guards in Kahramanmaras in southeastern Turkey Monday evening,
killing one and wounding four others.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security forces are continuing the cross-border
military operation in northern Iraq, which started on May 14
and so far, at least 1,300 PKK rebels have been killed in
the operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel told
reporters here today that Syria should bear important
responsibility over supporting the PKK, which has been fighting a
nearly 13-year-old separatist war, claiming more that 23,000
lives, including PKK rebels, civilians and government troops in
eastern and southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Stock Speculation by State Enterprises, Listed Companies Banned (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's central economic and
financial authorities has issued a regulation to ban state-owned
enterprises and listed companies from stock speculation.
</P>
<P>
Jointly issued by the State Council's Securities Committee, the
People's Bank of China, and the State Economic and Trade
Commission recently, the regulation noted that over-speculation
and activities against state rules are rampant in the country's
fledgling securities market.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the regulation said, capital from the state-owned
commercial banks has been flowing into the stock market
continuously and through various channels.
</P>
<P>
To speculate in stocks, some state-owned enterprises put bank
loans or their own development fund on the stock market, while a
number of listed companies invested with bank loans or money
raised from the issue of shares.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of phenomenon has both stimulated speculation in the
stock market and put the state assets at high risk," said the
regulation.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring into play the function of the socialist stock
market and maintain a normal market order, the regulation noted,
the speculation on the stock market by state-owned enterprises and
listed companies should be halted.
</P>
<P>
It required that the state-owned enterprises should not be
involved in stock speculation or provide funds for other
institutions to speculate in stocks, nor should they use money
loaned from state banks to purchase stocks.

<HEADLINE> Two More U.S. Athletes Test Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Two more U.S. athletes failed in
doping tests, according to the sources of the International
Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The scandal came just days after the emergence of cases
involving leading American track stars Sandra Farmer-Patrick and
Mary Slaney.
</P>
<P>
Athletics sources said that the U.S. Track and Field
Association was expected to report the new cases to IAAF in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
Source close to the cases revealled that there are two new
positive tests. They are not big-name athletes but definitely from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The banned substances involved in the cases or when the
athletes were caught were still uncertain. But the emergence of
the positive tests is a further blow to American athletics.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Track and Field authorities were criticised by the IAAF on
Tuesday for their procedures over the cases of Farmer-Patrick and
Slaney who tested positive several months before last year's
Atlanta Olympics in August.
</P>
<P>
Farmer-Patrick was allowed to take part in the Olympics and has
only been banned for four years for steroid abuse.
</P>
<P>
The Slaney case has yet to be concluded almost a year after she
was found to have high levels of the banned substance testosterone
in the body during a test at the U.S. trials.

It also banned all listed companies from using bank loans or
money raised from the issue of shares to buy stocks, or financing
other institutions to engage in stock speculation.
</P>
<P>
"Any state-owned enterprises or listed companies that hold
listed stocks for the purpose of long-term investment should
report to the securities exchanges, and each of them is allowed to
open only one A shares account at the exchange in the name of the
legal person," it added.
</P>
<P>
It demanded that governments at all levels, stock exchanges,
and securities management institutions across the country make a
full check of local state-owned enterprises, listed companies, and
existing stock accounts, and report the results to the central
securities supervisory bodies.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that any state-owned enterprises and listed
companies that continue with stock speculation after the issue of
the regulation, if found out, would be fined, and their illicit
incomes confiscated.
</P>
<P>
"Enterprises that used bank loans for the purchase of stocks
shall get no more loans, and must return the misused money within
a limited period of time," it added.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulated that principal and direct responsible people
of the state-owned enterprises that violate the regulation should
be dismissed by their competent departments, while managers of the
listed companies breaking the rules would be denied market access
by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.

NEW DELHI, May 21 (XINHUA) -- The Indian government has fixed
this year's export growth target at 20 percent to achieve 40
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Plan Launched to Aid Minors in Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Youth League (CYL) of
China launched a plan here today to give a helping hand to minors
suffering special financial hardship.
</P>
<P>
The first "Heart of Love Plan to Protect Minors" aid will go to
300 children in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the
provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Shandong, Henan,
Guizhou, Sichuan and Shaanxi, according to an official of the CYL.
</P>
<P>
The aid recipients include handicapped children who struggle in
adverse conditions, children of displaced workers, children whose
parents who were killed in the line of duty, and minors whose
legitimate rights and interests have been infringed upon. Each
child receives 500 yuan (60.24 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The initial fund is valued at one million yuan (120,000 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, volunteers will be recruited from the
public to help the minors. An election of outstanding citizens to
protect the minors will be held late this year.
</P>
<P>
Approximately one third of the 1.2 billion Chinese are aged
under 18. China formerly promulgated the law for the protection of
minors in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Rages Afghan Northern Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Islamic militia Taliban
and forces loyal to northern warlord Rashid Dostum today were
engaged in fierce fighting around Sheberghan, capital of northern
Jowzjan province, Pakistan Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who have launched a two-pronged offensive against
Dostum-controlled areas, are now advancing towards Mazar-e-Sharif,
Dostum's headquarters, about 300 kilometers northwest of Kabul,
PTV said.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Dostum's forces are presently strengthening
their defense positions in Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Following the revolt by Dostum's right-hand man, general Abdul
Malik, the defense line of the Dostum's forces has collapsed, PTV
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the anti-Taliban alliance, which is
composed mainly of forces of Dostum and Ahmad Masood, former
military chief of the ousted Afghan government, held crisis talks
after Malik's defection.
</P>
<P>
The advance of the Taliban can only be stemmed if the emergency
negotiations persuade Malik to rejoin the forces of Dostum, a
spokesman of the anti-Taliban alliance was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"High level negotiations are still going on with Abdul Malik,
and this is a very sensitive and critical situation for us," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The defection of Malik and the loss of so much ground is a
very big setback, but there is a chance he can be convinced to
change his mind," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malik, who was a senior commander in Dostum's forces, Monday
switched allegiance to the Taliban, taking with him two provinces
and allowing the Taliban to march into another he had cut off.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, taking advantage of the revolt in the alliance
ranks, launched a major offensive Tuesday making crucial gains in
central and northern Afghanistan, although issuing conflicting
reports on the extent of its gains.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Meet on Peace Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today met with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak as the deadlocked peace process shows no trace of a
breakthrough, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here at noon on a lightning visit, had a
tete-a-tete with Mubarak before it went into an expanded session
involving Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, PLO Executive
Committee chief Mahmoud Abbas, Palestinian Minister of Planning
and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath and other senior aides.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to review outcome of their recent
contacts to salvage the faltering peace process which came to a
standstill after Israel started the construction of a new
settlement in East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda will be Arafat's recent meeting with EU
Mideast peace envoy Miguel Moratinos who made a shuttle diplomacy
in the Mideast, following U.S. Mideast trouble-shooter Dennis
Ross's futile mediation for a breakthrough in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Israel held secret crisis talks overnight Tuesday with the
Palestinians, which failed to ease a two-month-old deadlock
because Israel refused to discuss freezing Jewish settlements on
occupied lands, according to a PNA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a German newspaper Tuesday, Mubarak said
that a six-month suspension of Jewish settlement building in Arab
Jerusalem could restart the stricken peace process.
</P>
<P>
The president said if Israel observed the Oslo accord, a broad
interim agreement that promised security for Israel and self-rule
for Palestinians, the Palestinians would be ready to find a
compromise formula to settle Jerusalem status.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been deeply involved in the Mideast peace process
since it made peace with Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Israel refuses to budge on its settlement building in Jerusalem
which it wants to have as future capital while the Palestinians
insist on stopping the project before resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After U.S. Mideast coordinator Dennis Ross left the region
empty-handed last weekend, Arafat blamed the lack of American
pressure on Israel for a breakdown of the "core bargain" of the
1993 Israeli-PLO Oslo deal.
</P>

Disappointed with Ross' performance during the nine-day

However, prospects for a breakthrough remain daunting, as

Palestinians see the U.S. tilting toward Israel.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Supreme Leader Pledges No Vote Rigging in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today pledged no vote rigging in the presidential
elections slated for May 23.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that two bodies, the Interior Ministry and the
Guardians Council as well as he himself, will watch against any
fraud in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader made the remarks on the eve of the
presidential elections in a bid to dispel the wide and strong
suspicion held by his citizens over the fairness of the election,
the vote-reading in particular.
</P>
<P>
A great number of eligible voters, including university
students, professors, bookshop keepers and taxi drivers, are
gossiping their worries over the possible vote rigging on the
coming Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing high-ranking officials and families of prisoners of
war and the missing in action during the 1980-1988 war with
Iraq, he assured the people of the whole country by saying, "I
myself will be watchful and will not let any one to commit any
fraud in the elections."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement by President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani last Friday, Khamenei said that the president's
"compassionate" statements have been misinterpreted by foreign
media which misled some analysts and friends of Iran to think
that the Friday elections will be rigged.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader also called on the people to actively take
part in the elections and defeat the plot by what he called
foreign enemies of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Rafsanjani openly warned Interior Ministry
officials against any kinds of cheating at ballot boxes and
called on election observers to maintain strict impartiality.
</P>
<P>
"Any effort to rig the elections should be seen as a grave sin
and inexcusable treason," he addressed a large crowd of people on
the Tehran University campus.
</P>
<P>
The topic of the possible vote rigging has also come to the
headline of the local press.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Salam urged Rafsanjani to firmly enforce
his sublime supervision over the process of the presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians are preparing to go to the polls in three days
in what is described by all observers here as the closest
election contest since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premiers Qian Qichen
and Wu Bangguo, and State Councillor Luo Gan today met with
representatives attending a meeting in recognition of their
efforts to supply fresh and frozen foodstuff to Hong Kong and
Macao using three express trains.
</P>
<P>
Qian encouraged them to work harder and supply more of such
commodities to Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by Premier Li Peng, Qian, on behalf of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council,
extended his congratulations to all the participating staff who
have performed arduous, daily and significant work over the past
35 years.
</P>
<P>
The three express cargo trains have operated smoothly under the
leadership of the veteran Party and state leaders, especially with
the attention and support of late Premier Zhou Enlai, Qian
said. Many people have dedicated their youth and energy to this
work, and the ministries of foreign economic relations and trade
and railways have also done a great deal.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 35 years, he added, the three express trains have
transported countless fresh and frozen foodstuff to Hong Kong and
Macao, to meet the needs of their life, facilitating economic
prosperity and social stability there and contributing to the
return of the two regions to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the support from China's interior areas
provides a powerful guarantee to the stability and prosperity in
Hong Kong and Macao, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are 41 days remaining until China resumes its
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, Qian said, adding that
after its return, efforts should be continued by departments
concerned.

MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Peacemakers from the Philippine
government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
today decided to extend their talks for another day to May 22.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks held in Cotabato City, the southern
Philippines, should have ended today. However, the two sides had
not yet reached consensus on the issues being discussed.
</P>
<P>
Foremost in their agenda is the repositioning of troops in
Buldon, Maguindanao, where the situation has remained tense since
a number of clashes occurred earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Reports said government troops and MILF rebels in Buldon are
only separated by some 400 meters away from each other.
</P>
<P>
Professor Monir Bajunaid, acting chair of the MILF cessation of
hostilities committee, said, "The talks are moving slowly but
surely to peace."
</P>
<P>
"As long as we maintain this momentum, we are optimistic that
we will reach into something," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bajunaid said the two sides decided to extend their meeting for
another day due to "some points of contention which they would
like to resolve."

<HEADLINE> Feature: Kinshasa Jubilant at Kabila's Arrival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Kinshasa, capital of the
newly-born Democratic Republic of Congo, was permeated with a
jubilant atmosphere this morning as citizens turned out to
welcome its "liberator", Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
News spread throughout the teeming city that Kabila, president
of the new republic who just arrived last night, would make a
public show the first time in the capital and might just as well
swear in his new national salvation government today.
</P>
<P>
Political maveouvres are at the hight of activities in the
capital among various political groups. "All of the former
opposition parties, even those which had gathered around Mobutu
during the old days, are trying to make contacts with Kabila and
his men to carve a niche in the new government," said a political
observer.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's troops of the Alliance of the Democratic Forces for
the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) on May 17 captured the
teeming capital of Kinshasa to topple former president Mobutu
Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
And Kabila proclaimed himself the new president on the same
day when Mobutu flew to Lome, Togo before seeking political
asylum in a not-yet-known destination.
</P>
<P>
Today, in the capital's two major hotels of Inter-Continental
and Memling, political figures, foreign journalists are in every
corner waiting for interview by Kabila and his men.
</P>
<P>
And Kabila, who has been staying at the residence of exiled
former prime minister Likulia Bolongo in suburban Kinshasa since
he arrived in the capital late last night, is still talking with
major political leaders and discussing the formation of his
"broad-based" national salvation government.
</P>
<P>
Everywhere in the street, "Kabila" is the only word on
everyone's lips.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is talking about Kabila. What's he going to do to
govern the country? What's he going to do to unite all the ethnic
groups? What's he going to do to ensure peace and prosperity in
the warn-torn country? and above all, what's he going to do to
fight wide-spreading corruption?" said a political observer.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this man will give us a good life prospect," said a
poor single mother with four children.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to see him here," said a local newspaper
peddler. "He brings us good business."
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa is the last major city in Africa's third largest
country "liberated" by Kabila army.
</P>
<P>
And three days after the entry of his army in the capital,
Kinshasa citizens were staying out the night waiting for
definitely something nice but not really knowing what it was
going to be like.
</P>
<P>
"He is welcomed because his army never looted civilians, as
Mobutu's army did," said an old man who lived throughout the
years ruled by Mobutu Sese Seko, the exiled Zairean president.
</P>
<P>
May 17 saw Kabila's well-disciplined troops marching along the
streets of the capital without doing any harm to local civilians
while many Kinshasa residents had suffered from a nightmare of
wide-scale looting carried out by soldiers of Mobutu's defeated
army.
</P>
<P>
Public security improved during the last couple of days as
Kabila sent more troops to Kinshasa and took severe measures to
crack down on looting and any other forms of criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
"Kabila, Welcome to Kinshasa" is the headline carried by most
of today's local newspapers in the capital.

BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian met
here today with a delegation from Japan's Forum on China's
Politics and Economy.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was led by Terashima Taizo, president of Japan's
Fujitsu System Integration Laboratories Ltd..
</P>
<P>
Chi, also a state councillor, said that China and Japan are
neighbors separated by a strip of water, adding that China is the
largest developing country in the world, and Japan is the largest
developed country in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"So, advancing a long-term, stable and sound relationship
between the two countries is significant to peace and
stability in Asia, and in the world as a whole," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the war of aggression against China
launched by Japanese militarists brought a catastrophe to the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the past, if not forgotten, provides
guidance for the future."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Japan can draw on a lesson from history and take
the road of peaceful development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chi also expressed his appreciation for the forum's efforts to
boost bilateral friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Terashima Taizo said that delegations from the forum have had
fruitful outcomes each time they visited China, noting that the
two countries should establish relations of mutual trust to ensure
peace and stability in east Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese visitors arrived here Monday at the invitation of
the China Association for International Friendly Contact.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today approved the takeover by the Armed Forces of the Philippines
of the anti-kidnapping operations in Central Mindanao, the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos also ordered Southern Command Chief General
Romeo Padiernos to conduct effective actions against kidnapping
gangs in the entire Mindanao region.
</P>
<P>
Ramos issued the orders after being informed by Interior and
Local Government Secretary Robert Barbers that the spate of
kidnappings in Central Mindanao "has taken a turn for the worst".
</P>
<P>
Barbers recommended the transfer of the anti-kidnapping task
from the hands of the police who made only minimal success in the
past few years due to the lack of manpower and resources.
</P>
<P>
It was also widely believed in the country that some policemen
were kidnappers themselves or protectors of kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The military has the manpower, resources, especially aircraft
and expertise for effective actions to address the serious
kidnapping problem in the country, Barbers said in his report.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rumors, Suspicion Spread Across </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Rumors and suspicion are spread
across Tehran, the capital of Iran, as the countdown of the 7th
presidential election is getting closer to May 23.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is now filled with various kinds of rumors and a strong
suspicion over the fairness of the tense election game, the vote
reading in particular.
</P>
<P>
A great number of eligible voters, including university
students, professors, bookshop keepers and taxi drivers, are
gossiping their worries over the possible vote rigging on coming
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Conservative Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and
open-minded former cultural and Islamic guidance minister
Mohammad Khatami are the two main contenders during the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The two rivals are represented by two major factions -- the
traditional and conservative camp backed by Iran's Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei and the moderate and liberal camp supported
by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri is facing powerful challenge from Khatami who is
gaining more and more support from the intellectual circles and
citizens in big cities.
</P>
<P>
A specialist predicted that Nateq-Nouri would win 60 percent
of the votes in rural areas and small cities while Khatami would
get 60 percent of the votes in big cities.
</P>
<P>
The victory of either presidential candidate would produce
different kind of political and economic impact upon the
political horizon in Iran.
</P>
<P>
That is why a great number of people with independent thinking
have been mobilized in the presidential election campaign in a bid
to have something new in the country.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Jaffari, a bookstore keeper in downtown Tehran, said that
vote rigging is not just rumor but it is a possible practice,
otherwise, President Rafsanjani would not touch upon the issue and
alarm the public of the imminent danger.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Rafsanjani openly warned Interior Ministry
officials against any kinds of cheating at ballot boxes and called
for strict impartiality of election observers.
</P>
<P>
"Any effort to rig the elections should be seen as a grave
sin and inexcusable treason," he addressed large crowd of people
on the campus of Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the change of public votes would have very
negative impact on the society. The people will lose their trust
in the system. This treason will be unforgivable."
</P>
<P>
The severe warning by the 64-year-old president had brought
the speculation into the air across the country, which has been
widely spreading among people in various cities.
</P>
<P>
In response to Rafsanjani's statement, Ayatollah Ali Janati,
Secretary of the powerful Guardians Council, said Tuesday that any
violation of election rules by anyone must be countered
indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar of supervising boards of the council
and inspectors of the Interior Ministry, he warned against going
beyond the limits in the elections and stressed that limits must
be observed.
</P>
<P>
"We are duty bound to prevent violations and counter
violators," he stressed, adding that the system is founded on
Islam and ethics.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the supervisory teams of their grave responsibility
in the process of elections and said "you are responsible for
healthy elections."
</P>
<P>
A political analyst noted that all supervisory teams are
dispatched by the Guardians Council and the Interior Ministry,
which are closely controlled by Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Many supporters of Khatami accused the Guardians Council of
violating its neutrality in announcing the list of the four
candidates by putting Nateq-Nouri at the top of the list since
the normal practice in every election has been to cite the
candidates in alphabetical order. Listed in alphabetical order,
Nateq-Nouri would come last and Khatami first.
</P>
<P>
Iranians are preparing to go to the polls Friday in what is
described by all observers as the fiercest election contest since
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The race is a crucial test for the Islamic rule and involves
an orderly transition of power from current President Rafsanjani
after two consecutive four-year terms to the new president.
</P>
<P>
Although Nateq-Nouri seems to be ahead of his top rival
Khatami, most political observers hold that the elections will go
to a second round.

<HEADLINE> Frechmen Killed, Causing Security Concerns in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Two French businessmen were
killed in Kinshasa by armed looters last night, three days after
Laurent Kabila's troops captured the Zairean capital.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said today the killing occurred in the residential
areas in uptown Kinshasa as looters, believed to be soldiers of
the former government troops of exiled president Mobutu Sese
Seko, broke into their house and opened fire at them before they
robbed the valuables.
</P>
<P>
The looters fled and soldiers of Kabila's liberation army are
conducting investigations.
</P>
<P>
However, local residents said it is hardly possible to find
out the looters as many of Mobutu's soldiers went underground
with the arms after they were defeated by Kabila's troops.
</P>
<P>
Troops of the Alliance of the Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), led by Kabila, entered the
capital on May 17 without meeting much military resistence, only
to find many former soldiers of Mobutu's army fleeing with their
guns.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale looting occurred overnight that day in Kinshasa,
done by the defeated soldiers of Mobutu's army.
</P>
<P>
After that, Kabila sent more troops to the capital to boost the
security.
</P>
<P>
"The security is definitely improving. But these armed Mobutu
loyalists are causing big concerns over the public security in
Kinshasa," said a local Kinshasa resident.
</P>
<P>
Kabila later issued an order for the former government troops
to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
Some of Mobutu's soldiers did shift their stance and joined
Kabila's liberation army, but most of the Mobutu men were
rejected. Some were even arrested for their bad records in
killing Kabila's men and looting the civilians.
</P>
<P>
"That's why they looted again and fled," said a foreign
diplomat in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"There are simply too many of them in Kinshasa today," said
local residents.
</P>
<P>
During the night, despite the lift of curfew, there is nobody
in the street, except a couple of Kabila's soldiers here and
there at some strategic places in the capital.
</P>
<P>
"Take good care of your life and property," that's the advise
provided to foreigners, especially journalists, by many foreign
embassies in Kinshasa.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister: Iran Continues Arming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese Muslim militia
Hezbollah has been receiving large quantities of arms and
ammunition from Iran by air via Syria in the past few months,
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today quoted the defense minister as saying that
Israel was examining reports that these arms to the fundamentalist
guerrilla may have included improved, long-range Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks during a visit Tuesday to the
Israeli self-styled security zone of 1,000 square kilometers in
south Lebanon, where he was briefed by senior officers, including
Northern Command Amiram Levine and Israeli army commander in
Lebanon Eli Amitai.
</P>
<P>
His visit came amid a marked escalation of fightings. On Monday
morning, a suicide bomber, from Lebanese militia of the Amal
Movement, attempted to destroy an Israeli Navy gunboat. In a clash
north of the buffer zone last Thursday night, three paratroopers
were killed and seven other soldiers wounded.
</P>
<P>
"There is a constant air activity, which I have remarked upon
many times, of planes flying in equipment and weapons from Iran to
Damascus (of Syria) and from there to the Bekaa Valley and to
Lebanon," Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
"Some of this equipment is for civilian needs, and some for
military requirements, which includes anti-tank weapons,
ammunition, arms, and a variety of different equipment in order to
give Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations on Lebanese soil
better fighting capabilities."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said he was investigating reports that the weapons
flied to Syria may have included Katyusha rockets with a
long-range capability that would theoretically enable them to
reach the beach areas at the Israeli northern coastal city of
Haifa.
</P>
<P>
He accused Iran of giving Hezbollah financial and military
aid, as well as ideological backing, and charged Syria with
aiding the anti-Israeli militant group. Nevertheless, Mordechai
reiterated his call to Syria to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai visited an outpost in "the security zone" and later
an observation point on top of the joint headquarters of
Israel's client militia South Lebanese Army in south Lebanon,
and the Israeli army's Lebanese liaison unit.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that initiated military operations, in which the
Israeli army had scored what he termed as some notable successes
in the past two months, would continue.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, which is allegedly backed by Iran ideologically,
economically and militarily, frequently launches cross border
attacks against the northern part of the Jewish state to fight
the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Followers Celebrate Buddha's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Buddhist followers
gathered at the Guangji Temple here today to mark Visakha, or the
Buddha's Day.
</P>
<P>
Visakha, a full moon celebration in May, is held by Buddhist
believers in most countries and regions including those belonging
to the Tibetan and Pali-language family in China. They believe
that the Buddha was born, received his Enlightenment, and passed
away on the full-moon day in May.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist followers belonging to Chinese-language family,
however, hold every Eighth day of April in lunar calendar (or
seven days before Visakha) as the birthday of the Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Responding to advocacy by Zhao Puchu, chairman of the Chinese
Association of Buddhism, the Chinese Buddhist followers also began
in 1990 to hold rites on Visakha.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Meets Hungarian National Assembly President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today that China respects the road of development chosen by the
Hungarian people and is willing to further expand co-operation
between the two countries in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said during a meeting with Gal Zoltan, president of the
National Assembly of Hungary, that such co-operation will be based
on the principle of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,
and mutual non-interference into each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Gal Zoltan, Jiang expressed the belief
that his current visit will help deepen mutual understanding and
trust, and push forward bilateral friendly cooperation
continuously.
</P>
<P>
Hungary is a country of great influence in Eastern Europe, and
in recent years, its government and people have made relentless
efforts and made remarkable achievements in safeguarding social
stability, developing its national economy, and improving its
people's living standard, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China is glad about this and sincerely hopes that the Hungarian
people will make fresh progress in their natinal construction, he
added.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang cited China and Hungary as friendly countries
with their friendship traced back to ancient times, and reiterated
that the two countries have no basic conflicts of interests and
there are no obstacles to the further expansion of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, leaders of both countries have kept close
contact, and bilateral ties have witnessed steady growth with
cooperation continuously deepening in the political, economic and
trade, technological, and other sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that contact between the Chinese National
People's Congress (NPC) and the Hungarian National Assembly
constitutes an important part of bilateral ties, expressing the
hope the two organizations will further enhance their cooperation,
and play an active role in reinforcing Sino-Hungarian friendship
and improving bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Gal Zoltan said that Hungary and China have always maintained
smooth political relationship, voicing the hope the two countries
will gain relatively rapid progress in their economic and trade
coordination.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian National Assembly attaches importance to the
development of Hungary-China relations, and will continue
expanding the contacts with the Chinese NPC and its relevant
committees, Gal Zoltan said, expressing the conviction such
contact will help promote bilateral cooperation in all spheres.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Rumors, Suspicion Spread Across </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Rumors and suspicion are spread
across Tehran, the capital of Iran, as the countdown of the 7th
presidential election is getting closer to May 23.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is now filled with various kinds of rumors and a strong
suspicion over the fairness of the tense election game, the vote
reading in particular.
</P>
<P>
A great number of eligible voters, including university
students, professors, bookshop keepers and taxi drivers, are
gossiping their worries over the possible vote rigging on coming
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Conservative Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and
open-minded former cultural and Islamic guidance minister
Mohammad Khatami are the two main contenders during the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
The two rivals are represented by two major factions -- the
traditional and conservative camp backed by Iran's Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei and the moderate and liberal camp supported
by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri is facing powerful challenge from Khatami who is
gaining more and more support from the intellectual circles and
citizens in big cities.
</P>
<P>
A specialist predicted that Nateq-Nouri would win 60 percent
of the votes in rural areas and small cities while Khatami would
get 60 percent of the votes in big cities.
</P>
<P>
The victory of either presidential candidate would produce
different kind of political and economic impact upon the
political horizon in Iran.
</P>
<P>
That is why a great number of people with independent thinking
have been mobilized in the presidential election campaign in a bid
to have something new in the country.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Jaffari, a bookstore keeper in downtown Tehran, said that
vote rigging is not just rumor but it is a possible practice,
otherwise, President Rafsanjani would not touch upon the issue and
alarm the public of the imminent danger.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Rafsanjani openly warned Interior Ministry
officials against any kinds of cheating at ballot boxes and called
for strict impartiality of election observers.
</P>
<P>
"Any effort to rig the elections should be seen as a grave
sin and inexcusable treason," he addressed large crowd of people
on the campus of Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the change of public votes would have very
negative impact on the society. The people will lose their trust
in the system. This treason will be unforgivable."
</P>
<P>
The severe warning by the 64-year-old president had brought
the speculation into the air across the country, which has been
widely spreading among people in various cities.
</P>
<P>
In response to Rafsanjani's statement, Ayatollah Ali Janati,
Secretary of the powerful Guardians Council, said Tuesday that any
violation of election rules by anyone must be countered
indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar of supervising boards of the council
and inspectors of the Interior Ministry, he warned against going
beyond the limits in the elections and stressed that limits must
be observed.
</P>
<P>
"We are duty bound to prevent violations and counter
violators," he stressed, adding that the system is founded on
Islam and ethics.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the supervisory teams of their grave responsibility
in the process of elections and said "you are responsible for
healthy elections."
</P>
<P>
A political analyst noted that all supervisory teams are
dispatched by the Guardians Council and the Interior Ministry,
which are closely controlled by Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Many supporters of Khatami accused the Guardians Council of
violating its neutrality in announcing the list of the four
candidates by putting Nateq-Nouri at the top of the list since
the normal practice in every election has been to cite the
candidates in alphabetical order. Listed in alphabetical order,
Nateq-Nouri would come last and Khatami first.
</P>
<P>
Iranians are preparing to go to the polls Friday in what is
described by all observers as the fiercest election contest since
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The race is a crucial test for the Islamic rule and involves
an orderly transition of power from current President Rafsanjani
after two consecutive four-year terms to the new president.
</P>
<P>
Although Nateq-Nouri seems to be ahead of his top rival
Khatami, most political observers hold that the elections will go
to a second round.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Allows Foreign Wives Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait, a country with more
foreigners than locals, has up to now given nationality to a total
of 20,000 foreign women married to Kuwaiti citizens, but 30,000
more are still on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammed Al-Khaled Al-Hamed
Al-Sabah said, while replying a question at the Kuwaiti National
Assembly (Kuwaiti parliament) on Tuesday night, that up to 20,000
foreign women married to Kuwaitis were naturalized, according to
the Nationality Law.
</P>
<P>
The cases of 30,000 others were under official consideration,
added Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
He said the law stipulates that expatriate wives with a
specific period of marital status are entitled to have Kuwaiti
citizenship if they apply for that.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister said the law is also applicable to a
divorced or widowed foreign woman if she had child by her Kuwaiti
husband during a specific period of marriage.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Kuwaiti Nationality Law says foreign wives can
only be naturalized with a five-year-old marital state from the
date of her application for the citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Currently an estimated 40,000 foreign wives, mostly from Arab
countries and south Asian states, are yet to be granted the
Kuwaiti citizenship in the country, with a quarter of them not
even applying for the nationality.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti citizens now only make up 40 percent of the country's
158 million population with foreign nationals plus 1.25 million
expatriate workers taking up the rest .

understanding of China when they travel to different parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade relations between the two countries are

leaders that China places great importance on expansion of its
ties with his country. And he expressed the hope that the two

<HEADLINE> Nagano Winter Games' Downhill Course Shortened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- 1998 Nagano Winter Olympic Games will
see the shortest downhill skiing course in the Olympic history,
Makoto Kobayashi, director general of the Nagano organising
committee (NAOC) said on Wednesday in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International
Ski Federation (FIS) dropped demands to extend the downhill run
due to environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
Makoto Kobayashi said that the Japanese authorities made clear
their opposition to raising the start of the course in view of
environmental considerations while the IOC and the FIS are no
longer questioning them on this subject. "It's finished," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nagano run, 2,923 meters for the men and 2,654 meters for
the women, will be around a third shorter than any other downhill
in the history of the Winter Games. The start is at 1,680 meters
altitude, and has a drop of 840 meters, with an average run
expected to take just 90 seconds.

LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia's national football coach
Terry Venables has been taken to court by former Portsmouth
director Terry Brady.
</P>
<P>
Brady, who left the Portsmouth board last October, intended to
recover a 150,000 pound loan he made to the division one club. He
had been a director at Fratton Park for only eight months.
</P>
<P>
However, Venables, the ex-England coach and current Portsmouth
chairman, said that the money was not a loan but an investment to
buy shares. Venables bought the club in February.
</P>
<P>
The Venables-Brady case has already appeared briefly before the
Chancery Division of the High Court in London but was adjourned
for a second hearing.
</P>
<P>
Now the two sides are set for a behind-closed-doors meeting to
try and sort out the dispute over the money.

<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zhonglin (China Forestry)
Industrial Development Group (ZIDG) was launched by eight major
forestry enterprises today here, in a move to introduce a modern
enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun wrote an inscription for the birth
of the new industrial group.
</P>
<P>
The eight forestry enterprises are the China International
Forestry (Group) Corporation, China National Forestry Materials
Supply and Marketing Co., China National Forest Products Trading
Co., China National Tree Seed Co., China Forest Food and Medical
Materials Co., China Forest Import and Export Co., China
International Forest Travel Service, and the Beijing National
Timber Exchange Market.
</P>
<P>
"The group has a total assets worth 940 million yuan (118
million US dollars) and scored a turnover of 960 million yuan
(nearly 120 US dollars) in 1996," a source from the Ministry of
Forestry said.
</P>
<P>
The source added that the group has opened more than 20
domestic and international sub-branches.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Youfang, the Minister of Forestry, China is
rich in forestry resources and the potential for this sector is
very enormous.
</P>
<P>
He said that the establishment of ZIDG will promote the
competitiveness of China's forest enterprises in the market,
especially now that more and more large foreign enterprises have
broken into China.
</P>
<P>
During the recent years the Ministry of Forestry has sped the
reform of the Ministry-attached enterprises. Last year, another
group company, the Foma (China Forestry) Machinery Group Company
was set up.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's textile industry reduced
losses and scored a substantial increase in exports during the
first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics from the China National Textile
Council, during that period the industry posted a total turnover
of 165.2 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 5.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it also earned 8.72 billion US dollars from exports,
up 35.6 percent over the same period last year. Clothing exports
surged by 41.4 percent to nearly 5.9 billion dollars, and those of
textiles by 24.6 percent to 2.82 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
State-owned textile enterprises reduced their losses by 380
million yuan than the same period last year. Of the total, 59
percent of them are still operating at a loss, down 2.65 percent
from the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Also, the textile industry in Shanghai and Inner Mongolia have
already earned net profits in the first quarter.
</P>

A textile expert attributed the rebound to the better cotton
supply in the domestic market and lower raw material costs. The
woollen and chemical fiber sectors, however, still suffered
serious losses owing to the price hike of the raw
materials.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing Explains China's Stand on WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing
delivered a keynote speech here today at the Pacific Basin
Economic Council (PBEC) meeting, explaining China's stand on its
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the future of Hong
Kong and other important issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 30th General Meeting of the PBEC this
afternoon, Li said that China stands firm to oppose trade
protectionism and supports the WTO to actively play its role in
international economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
"China is ready to join WTO. However, China, being a developing
country, adheres to the principle that rights and obligations
should be in balance, and can not commit itself to what exceeds
its capacity and ability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China needs WTO, and WTO also needs China. Without China, the
World Trade Organization can not fully exert its influence," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Hong Kong, the Chinese vice premier said that
China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in
just 40 days, and it is an important historic event.
</P>
<P>
As a special administration region of China, Hong Kong will
enjoy a high degree of autonomy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The existing capitalist system and the present life style in
Hong Kong will remain unchanged for a long time, and Hong Kong
people will fully enjoy the rights stipulated in the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's
Republic of China," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's status as a center of international
trade, banking and finance, transportation and tourism, and as a
free port, information center and independent tariff zone will not
be tempered, but will be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully confident in Hong Kong's smooth transition and
its future prosperity and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government whole-heartedly supports the further
development of Hong Kong. It is certain that Hong Kong will make
new contributions to the prosperity and development of both the
Asia Pacific region and the world," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li also said: "We have noted that President (Bill) Clinton
recently announced his decision to renew the Most-Favored-Nation
(MFN) status to China without preconditions. We welcome his
decision."
</P>
<P>
"The MFN status is a mutually beneficial treatment," he said.
"The annual review of the MFN status to China by the United States
has an ill impact on the development of Sino-U.S. economic and
trade relations."
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his hope that the U.S. government and Congress
will take into consideration the overall interests of the two
countries, the development of bilateral trade and economic
relations in particular, to solve the problem once and for all.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Tuesday for delivering the keynote speech at
the PBEC meeting, which ended this afternoon.

committees at district, divisional and locational levels be formed
to help create awareness among the local people at the
grassroots.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today his deputy's acting role as prime
minister during his long absence from the country was not a
preparation for him to hand over his power.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement while responding to a question from
participants at the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) Investors'
Conference in London, according to the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama today.
</P>
<P>
But Mahathir, who began with a emphatic "No", conceded that the
time would come "at some stage" when he would have to end his role
as prime minister of Malaysia, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
"No, it is not true I'm preparing to hand over power, but the
fact still remains at some stage I have to stop being prime
minister either by natural cause or voluntarily," Mahathir was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's deputy Anwar Ibrahim has taken over as acting prime
minister of the country since May 19 after Mahathir left the
country on May 18 for London to begin his two-month-long leave
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said more than once that his deputy would be his
successor.
</P>
<P>
The one-day conference in London was the highlight of
Mahathir's five-day visit there to promote the Malaysia's MSC
scheme designed for hi-tech development.

<HEADLINE> India's Janata Party to Protest Against Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- India's Janata Party President S.
Swamy said here today that his party would hold black flag
demonstration against the Queen of England and the British prime
minister if they visited the country to attend the 50th year
independence celebrations.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that this was to lodge its protest
against the British government not returning the crown jewels
which are on display in London Tower over the Thames river.
</P>
<P>
The crown jewels were taken away from India by the British, who
ruled the country for more than two hundred years. India won
independence in 1947 after a long-standing struggle against the
British colonial rule.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Hides, Skins Exports Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania earned about 2.7
million U.S. Dollars last year through exports of about 1,500
tons of raw skins and hides, compared with some 3.3 million
Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Salim Chandoo, the General Manager for the Africa Trade
Development Co. Ltd (ATD), told reporters here on Tuesday that
the price fluctuations led to decreased earnings on the products
last year.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Brazil confined in 1995 their sales of skins and
hides in their local markets, causing a drop in the supply of the
commodity in the world market and pushing up prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Brazil returned into the world market last year,
leaving prices to lower levels.
</P>
<P>
Chandoo said there was a great potential for the export of
skins and hides by Tanzania, the third largest producer in Africa
following Ethiopia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's raw skins and hides usually export to Pakistan,
Hong Kong, Spain, Italy and India. Pakistan is its largest
importer. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's gold exports have
increased by about 84 percent to 64.56 million U.S. Dollars as of

</P>
<P>
The figure stood at 35.15 Million Dollars in the 1995/96
financial year.
</P>
<P>
According to the local newspaper People today, the rise is due
to the more licensing of gold dealers. Some traders reportedly
travel from Kenya and Burundi to buy gold in Uganda. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zambia Resumes Cement Export to Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has resumed cement export to
Burundi in the wake of a decision made by a regional summit held in
Tanzania last month to ease sanctions against that country.
</P>
<P>
The first shipment was made some 10 days ago and currently about
500 to 700 tons of cement are exported to Burundi a week.
</P>
<P>
Zambia enjoys a 50 percent share of the cement market of Burundi
against Tanzania and Zaire, according to Patrick Gorman, Chief
Executive of Chilanga Cement Corporation, the sole cement producing
corporation in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The nine-month sanctions on Burundi cost the corporation 20,000
US dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Zambia and some other countries in the region imposed the sanctions
on July 31 last year after Burundian military leader Pierre Buyoya
took power in a military coup on July 25 from Hutu civilian President
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the countries in the Great Lakes region decided to
lift the sanctions of food, medicine, agricultural and building
supplies. enditem

<HEADLINE> W. Africa States to Jointly Crack Down on Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- West African countries are
determined to evolve strategies aimed at stamping out the
increasing crime wave in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
As a first step forward, the Nigerian police has set out to
negotiate with neighboring Benin to control cross-border
crimes, according to the country's Police Inspector-General Alhaji
Ibrahim Coomassie.
</P>
<P>
Criminal activities, especially cross-border crimes, have been on
the rise since the signing of a protocal among West African countries
to facilitate free movement of goods and persons years ago.
</P>
<P>
Criminals take advantage of the protocol to traverse borders for
refuge while perpetrating such crimes as car theft, robbery and
illicit trafficking of drug, fire-arms and art works.
</P>
<P>
The situation has aroused concern among sub-regional leaders.
Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha has said that with such
crimes quickly gaining ground in the sub-region, no country is now
safe from the activities.
</P>
<P>
To jointly combat the crimes, two sub-regional committees have
been set up among member countries of the Economoic Community of
West African States, now chaired by General Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The committees are mandated to harmonize legal instruments of
coopertion and design modalities for training and operation.
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria, the government said it would continue to work
out ways and supply appropriate equipment to fight perpetrators of
violent crimes in the country despite the big cost of crime
prevention.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Cases Doubling Every 14 Months in India: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Cases of acquired immuno
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are doubling every 14 months in India
and infection with the AIDS virus has become widespread among
young men and women in the lower socio-economic class in the
country, the Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted a report as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
From 1987 to 1990, there were an average of 5.7 AIDS cases each
year at the National AIDS Reference Center at Christian medical
college hospital, Vellore in Tamil Nadu and these shot up to 28
per year from 1991 to 1993 and 104 in 1994, said the report of the
college researchers in the Indian journal of medical research.
</P>
<P>
When the data from only Vellore, the headquarters of Tamil
Nadu's North Arcot district with a population of 3 million, is
extrapolated to the entire population of the country, it indicates
that there would have been at least 25,361 AIDS cases in India by
the end of 1994. This figure tallies with the World Health
Organization's projections of 20,000 AIDS cases in India by the
end of 1993, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 211 patients diagnosed were young men and women
between 31 and 33 years, belonging to the lower socio-economic
class in the country, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Macao Establish Joint Logistic Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A local transportation company in
Macao today signed an agreement with a Japanese logistic company
to establish a joint logistic venture in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The I-JCM, Logistic (Macao) Ltd., will be jointly established
with Integrated Group, a Japanese-funded company based in
Malaysia, holding 60 percent shares, and a local cargo ship
company, JCM, holding 40 percent shares.
</P>
<P>
Based in Macao, the new company will try to explore the
potential of Macao as a free shipping entrepot in the Pearl River
Delta and the Southeast Asia region, said Eric Yeung, chairman of
the I-JCM.
</P>
<P>
Makoto Takahashi, managing director of Integrated Logistic (HK)
Ltd., said at the signing ceremony that he believes Macao will
enjoy growing business of logistic services.
</P>
<P>
"Macao can become a logistic hub of south China," he said. "It
is one of the important gateways to China's inland areas. A lot of
foreign manufacturers have established factories in Zhuhai and
other major cities in the southern China region, and the new
airport in Macao will become much important than before."
</P>
<P>
The new joint venture marks a milestone that Japanese
investment ever entered Macao in logistic business. It came into
being after 18 months of preparation.
</P>
<P>
The Integrated Group, established in 1973, now has branches in
Hong Kong and Shenzhen city. Its main customers include the
leading Japanese electric appliances producers like National,
Sharp, Hitachi and Sony.
</P>
<P>
The company's business scope ranges from transportation,
shipping, consultation and warehousing.
</P>
<P>
The local partner of the business, JCM, was established in
early 1996 by 17 Macao ventures, most engaged in foreign
trade. Shareholders of JCM holds about half of the export volume
in Macao.

<HEADLINE> HK Police Force Remains Part of Interpol: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Police Force will
remain a part of the Interpol after Hong Kong's handover but will
operate as a sub-bureau of China instead of being a sub-bureau of
Britain, according to Hong Kong's Commissioner of Police Eddie Hui
Ki-on.
</P>
<P>
Hui made the comment when addressing delegates at a recent
Interpol meeting of Asian contact officers here.
</P>
<P>
Hui said that apart from a few superficial and cosmetic
changes, there would be no disruption to the force's work and no
change to the way in which the Hong Kong Police Force carries it
out.
</P>
<P>
"The rank and organizational structure will remain as it is
today and the force will retain the sole responsibility for
internal security and the policing of Hong Kong - including its
waters and border with the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to myself as Commissioner of police, I shall be
responsible to the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's future is guaranteed by the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, which is an internationally accepted agreement. I am
confident that Hong Kong will continue to prosper, that law and
order will be steadfastly maintained and that the relationships
with overseas law enforcement agencies which the Hong Kong Police
have developed in the past will be maintained," said ACP Crime
Wong.
</P>
<P>
Hu Xin, Interpol delegate from China, said that "As with the
rest of the officers from various Asian Interpol bureaus, we look
forward to working with Interpol Hong Kong in the future as we
have done in the past. Our communication in terms of the exchange
of information on criminals and crime will only get better."
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Zahid Mahmood, chairman of the conference, said, "If
any of the 29 Interpol delegates from the 17 Asian countries
(regions) represented during the meeting had any doubts as to what
the post handover Interpol Hong Kong would be like, we go away
with confidence that in the future for the Hong Kong Police and
its Interpol Bureau, it's basically business as usual. And in
terms of fighting international crime, that's a very good news."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong joined the Interpol in 1960 and Hong Kong Police
officers regularly attended conferences organized by Interpol.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Contact Officer Network was set up in 1995 to provide
the structure for urgent and effective personal contact between
Asian National Central Bureaus (each member state in Interpol is
represented by a National Central Bureau) and a sub-bureau.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Agriculture Growth Rate Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of the Philippines'
agriculture sector reached 4.22 percent during the first quarter
of this year, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
At current prices, this growth rate is translated into a gross
value of 5.44 billion US dollars, indicating an increase of 5.48
percent from last year's level, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero as
saying the growth rate is a good indicator of being able to attain
a very bullish growth rate of 4.7 percent for 1997 against last
year's growth rate of only 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poultry subsector has the highest growth rate of 11.15
percent among the main subsectors, followed by the livestock
subsector with a growth rate of 6.07 percent from January to
March.
</P>
<P>
Next to the livestock is the crops subsector which attained a
3.3 percent growth. Dairy production, however, was down by 10.08
percent.
</P>
<P>
The fisheries subsector made a dramatic comeback during the
first quarter of this year with a growth rate of 0.79 percent or
8.38 percent more than last year's record, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the fishery subsector was a major loser together with
the coconut industry in terms of production performance due to the
unfavorable weather conditions and the prevalence of red tide.

<HEADLINE> Britain Recruit Spies Through Public Advertisement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The British security service MI5 has
decided for the first time in its history to recruit spies through
open advertisement.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement, published in today's Guardian newspaper,
said this was a "career with a very special part of Her Majesty's
government -- the Security Service."
</P>
<P>
MI5, Britain's counter-espionage service, has taken a leading
role in the fight against the Irish Republican Army which seeks
end of British rule on Northern Ireland through military
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Britain's secret intelligence service MI6 handles agents
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The two agencies are each estimated to have an annual
budget of 125 million pounds (200 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new way of soliciting intelligence agents marks a radical
change for Britain's spy services, which in the past preferred
less direct approach to recruitment.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement said, "Your involvement would be more in
managing the information gathering process and responding to the
other operational needs of the Service."
</P>
<P>
"Exceptional powers of communication and persuasion will make
you adept at talking your way into situations with the opportunity
for gathering useful information, as well as the resourcefulness
to extract yourself from less promising circumstances," it added.
</P>
<P>
MI5 identified marketing executives, teachers, fund raisers,
overseas aid workers, academics and journalists as suitable sorts
of candidates.
</P>
<P>
"The ability to deal with ambiguity and make decisions on
partial information is essential. Security threats never conform
to a neat routine and neither will your work -- so flexibility
is also essential," it added.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Cut 1997-98 Immigrant Intake by 6,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia would cut immigrant
intake by 6,000 next year to 68,000, Immigration Minister Philip
Ruddock said in Melbourne today.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said the federal government was forced to reduce the
migrant intake for 1997-98 to 68,000, down from the previous
year's 74,000, by continuing high unemployment and the number of
migrants who had featured in unemployment figures in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press said the figure represents a
drop of 20 percent over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian and refugee intake will remain at 12,000,
taking the total immigration intake to 80,000.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said surveys had shown that many unskilled migrants who
had entered under the former government's guidelines, largely in
family reunion categories, had been unable to find work.
</P>
<P>
It was not in the national interest to continue to allow large
numbers into the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The immigration minister insists the cut is not a response to
independent MP Pauline Hanson, who called for an end to immigrant
intake and said the nation risked being swamped by Asians in her
maiden speech to the parliament last September.
</P>
<P>
"If there were a response to Pauline Hanson there would
probably be no program at all," Ruddock said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government's refugee guidelines favored
people who had no place to go, and those applying from the former
Yugoslavia and the Middle East would receive top priority, while
those seeking admission in the same category next year from Asian
and African countries would be assigned a lesser priority.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Decides to Set up Demilitarized Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper said today that the government has decided to set
up a demilitarized zone in the southern province of Caqueta in
which the guerillas can free 70 government troops they captured
last year.
</P>
<P>
The 13,200-square-kilometer zone is located along the Caguan
river, Samper said at a ceremony held in the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
The government will cease all military actions and police
patrol in the zone during the 32 days as from May 23 so that the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) can release the 70
soldiers under the monitoring of the International Red Cross
Society, announced Samper.
</P>
<P>
The president hoped that the guerillas will take the
government's decision, made after Monday's meeting between the
president and a number of ministers and top military leaders, as a
gesture for peace and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The 70 soldiers were seized in an attack by FARC, the country's
largest guerrilla group, on a government military camp in the
southern province of Putumayo on August 30, 1996.

YANTAI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 million US dollars of
overseas investment have flowed into the Yantai Development Zone
in this east Chinese city in Shandong Province during the first
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The three-month period saw 730 million yuan in output value
from overseas-funded businesses in the zone, a 40 percent rise
from the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The zone has attracted overseas investment from 27 countries
and regions, including the US, Britain, France, Germany, Japan,
the ROK, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four overseas-financed enterprises are adding more than
200 million yuan worth of investment, and there are now 38
overseas-funded projects with an investment of more than 10
million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The zone will obtain an increasing amount of foreign funds from
multinational companies in east Asia, Europe, and America. But it
is not encouraging low-technology, high-consumption, or
environment-unfriendly foreign-funded projects, or those with an
investment of less than 100 US dollars.
</P>

Construction of a 7.9 billion-yuan automobile parts project

<HEADLINE> China's Major Bank to Extend More Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank, the
country's major bank for fixed-asset investment loans, will extend
more loans to potential home buyers, according to a senior bank
official.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money for home buyer loans this year will go up
by four billion yuan (about 480 million US dollars), the bank's
vice-governor, Shi Chungui, says.
</P>
<P>
Shi also said that in the future 50 percent of CCB's new loans
for fixed assets will be extended to home buyers.
</P>
<P>
CCB became the first Chinese bank to finance home buying in the
late 1980s, and by the end of last year, had extended a total of
20 billion yuan worth of such loans, 6.51 billion yuan of that
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's leading economic center, the amount of
outstanding home loans with the bank is 2.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
As China reforms its old housing system, where apartments are
allotted to workers for nominal amounts of rent, more individuals
are buying their own houses. One problem however, has been that a
bank loan is essential for most people because their income almost
always falls far short of that needed for the price of a new
house.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Prose of French Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The famous prose "Les Essais" by
French writer Montaigne (1533-1592) has been published by the
Yilin Translation Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
"Les Essais" is the collection of Montaigne's essays, which has
gained worldwide appreciation for 500 years.
</P>
<P>
"Although Montaigne is not known by many Chinese readers, but I
believe that his work will be warmly received and become popular,"
said Ji Xianlin, a leading translator.
</P>
<P>
It has taken four years to translate and compile the collection
into Chinese, said Ji, adding that it was difficult to translate
the ancient French and Latin phrases in the essays.
</P>
<P>
Montaigne's essays feature a combination of life, truth and
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
Before "Les Essais", the publishing house had translated two
masterpieces: "A La Recherche du Temps Perdu" by Marcel Proust,
and James Joyce's "Ulysses".

<P>
QINHUANGDAO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Qinhuangdao on China's northeast
coast has become known as a hygienic port after making efforts to
curb pollution in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Local environmental protection departments report that smog
and coal dust in the air at Qinhuangdao are strictly controlled,
even though it is considered the world's biggest handler of energy
production materials.
</P>

The offshore water at Qinhuangdao Port now also meets China's
national quality standards for the offshore water.
</P>
<P>
The port has 38 berths handling from 3,000 dead weight tonnage
(dwt) to 50,000 dwt, along 11.3 km of the northeastern coast, and
covering an area of 9.2 sq km.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Call for Equality in World Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Lecturers of the University
of Dar es Salaam have called on western countries to allow equal
partnership in the modern global trade, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
They made the call during a public lecture on "Globalization,
Africa and New Realities" by visiting Swedish Secretary of State
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mats Karlsson here at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Meena, an expert, said that it was time for Africa to
demand an equal play field on global trade and partnership if
such developments are for the mutual benefit of both sides.
</P>
<P>
She called on the developed countries to allow a revision of
the terms of trade and partnership with Africa because currently
it is the rich states that dictate and dominate the unfair
relations while the poor have been forced to liberalize their
economies.
</P>
<P>
Anna Tibajiuka, the head of the Tanzania Women's Council,
challenged the controversial World Trade Organization (WTO) to
enforce equality in the global trade and partnership rather than
pressing Africa to unfairly open up its economies.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Africa has virtually lost its confidence in
global trade and partnership due to the prevailing inequality.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Wangwe, the Economic and Social Research Foundation
(ESF) Director, said as Africa has no choice to play a role it
wants in modern globalization, both donors and recipients of
development aid are bad players.
</P>
<P>
In response, Karlsson said it was true that Africa has for a
long time been unfairly treated in the global trade, citing the
barbaric exploitation done by the west during the slavery, colonia
and modern era.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that the fate of Africa's demands for
equality in globalization depends first on Africans themselves.
</P>
<P>
The current cooperation between the South and the North has a
flawed base which demands renovation so as to get rid of
post-colonial structures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The lecture was part of a continental debate on Swedish
African policy's reshaping as Africa is due to enter into another
trade partnership agreement with Europe after the Lome Convention
expires in February 2000.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Colombian
president Virgilio Barco Vargas today died of stomach cancer and
Alzheimer's disease at the age of 75 in a Bogota clinic.
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Samper expressed his condolence over Barco's
death in a radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
"I share the sense of loss that all Colombians are
feeling. Barco was a man of few but firm convictions and very
dedicated to certain principles," said Samper.
</P>
<P>
The government of his home province of Norte de Santander
declared three days of mourning.
</P>
<P>
Barco, a Liberal Party member like Samper, started his
four-year presidency in May 1986 after a landslide victory in
elections.
</P>
<P>
Barco, who was born in 1921 in the northeast town of Cucuta on
the border with Venezuela, is widely remembered as one of the
capital's best-ever mayors for pushing forward a series of major
public works and urban renovation programs during his term between
1966 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
He served as Minister of Public Works and Minister of
Agriculture in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president partly succeeded in defusing Colombia's
long-running guerrilla war by striking a peace treaty with the
leftist M-19 guerrilla group and opening the way for former
guerrillas to return to civilian life.

<P>
SHENYANG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Electronics and information
technology is contributing an increasing amount to saving
traditional industries in northeast China's Liaoning Province,
where more than 300 million yuan has been spent on computerizing
industrial production in the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 kilns and furnaces have been improved and are
providing much better results. Digital-control and digital-display
technology has been used to transform machine tools and to
increase efficiency by around 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Quality and productivity have improved a great deal as
well. Renovation of a steel rolling mill of the Anshan Iron and
Steel Corporation has brought a million yuan in profits annually.
</P>
<P>
The province, which is China's major heavy industrial base, has
also increased effort to develop hi-tech products of its own,
and has succeeded in producing 200 items, including computerized
energy-saving meters, computerized cash registers, and computers
for navigation.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Air-blower Plant adopted computer-aided design and
manufacturing technology in the 1980s, and shortened the design
period for its DH and CL series of turbine compressors to four
months. This alone increased its output value by more than 16
million yuan annually.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Nyanza Province of Kenya has the
highest number of expectant mothers who have tested HIV positive
in the country, according to a senior medical officer.
</P>
<P>
Nyanza Provincial Medical Officer of Health Richard Muga told
a one-day seminar that 20-30 percent of expectant mothers in
Kisumu, the provincial capital, were carriers of HIV, which
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times newspaper today quoted Provincial Commissioner
Joseph Kaguthi as saying at the seminar that the province
recorded 16,000 cases of HIV/AIDS in 1996, accounting for 20
percent of the total in the country.
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said, 45 percent of hospital beds in the
province are occupied by HIV positive people or AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
Roselyne Onyuka, Provincial Director of Education, told the
participants of the seminar that more than 2,700 teachers died
every year of AIDS-related disease in the province.
</P>
<P>
Muhoroni Sugar Company Managing Director E.O. Wanga noted on
the same occasion that 90 percent of the company's staff deaths
were AIDS-related.
</P>
<P>
Muga pointed out that 75 percent of the victims got the
disease through sex,
</P>
<P>
The seminar was resolved that inter-sectoral HIV/AIDS
committees at district, divisional and locational levels be formed
to help create awareness among the local people at the
grassroots.
</P>
<P>
According to Onyuka, the Kenyan Ministry of Education is
intensifying awareness activities and counselling among the
people to help combat the spread of the disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong today formally signed
the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Government
Procurement, according to a Hong Kong government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The provisions of the agreement will enter into force in Hong
Kong after 30 days, i.e., June 19, 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) provides for a
set of rules that govern the procurement of goods and services by
government and other public entities of signatories.
</P>
<P>
It lays down very detailed rules on tendering procedures,

<P>
Hong Kong's application to join the agreement was unanimously
agreed by signatories to the agreement on December 5, 1996.

The spokesman said: "We were given a six-month period to align
our domestic procedures with the provisions of the agreement. We
have now completed the alignment process, and are ready to
participate in the agreement."

<P>
"Hong Kong maintain an open and fair procurement regime. Our
accession to the GPA, therefore, will not incur significant
additional obligations on current parties.
</P>

"Joining the GPA will enhance confidence in our procurement
regime and improve access of our goods and services to the
government procurement markets of other World Trade Organization
GPA signatories," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from government departments, statutory bodies, namely,
the Urban Council, Regional Council, Hospital Authority, Housing
Authority, Airport Authority, Mass Transit Railway Corporation,

BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will sign an economic
cooperation pact with Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka next month,
according to a senior Thai Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Kobsak Chutikul, director general of the Economic Affairs
Department was quoted today by the Thai News Agency as saying that
Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Pitak Intrawityanont will play host
to his counterparts from the three countries.

The dynamic potential of the three countries is enormous and
the economic cooperation between Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and
Thailand will benefit these four countries and the region as a
whole, Kobsak said.

and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to fund
feasibility studies of proposed projects instead of the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The ESCAP will be approached to fund studies in areas in which

<HEADLINE> First Cloned Sheep Sheared to Raise Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The first cloned animal from an
adult cell sheep, Dolly, was sheared for the first time Tuesday
and the wool will be sold to raise money for charity.
</P>
<P>
The 10-month-old Finn Dorset sheep produced enough wool for a
hat, jumper and pair of mittens, said a press release from the
Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, where Ian Wilmut and his colleagues
announced the success of Dolly in February.
</P>
<P>
"Dolly is quite a large sheep and there was quite a lot of
fleece," said Harry Griffin of the institute.
</P>
<P>
The fleece will be auctioned later this year by the Cystic
Fibrosis Trust to draw attention to the life-threatening inherited
disease.
</P>
<P>
Dolly can help cystic fibrosis (CF) sufferers in two ways, said
Martin Scott, medical director of the trust.
</P>
<P>
"There is the potential for increased availability of rare
life-saving drugs which reduce inflammation in the lungs of CF
patients. Secondly, we hope Dolly will teach us more about how
genes work and help us find an eventual cure for CF," Scott said.

<HEADLINE> Kabila in Kinshasa to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Head of State of the Democratic
Republic of Congo Laurent Kabila tonight arrived in the capital
Kinshasa from his military base in Lubumbasi with the mission to
form "a broad-based unity government".
</P>
<P>
Kabila did not make any formal statement at the airport and
drove directly to the city under the escort of his security men.
</P>
<P>
Local Kinshasa citizens and hundreds of foreign journalists
had been waiting for a whole day in the airport, along the main
road leading to city proper and at the entrance of the
intercontinental hotel where he is supposed to stay.
</P>
<P>
Later reports said he had postponed the mission for security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Declaring himself to be head of state and changing the country
name of Zaire to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kabila is
expected to announce a "broad-based" salvation government tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Although Kabila had declared earlier that the mobutists,
followers of toppled President Mobutu Sese Seko, would be excluded
from the new government, diplomats said a couple of "light-weight"
cabinet positions might be reserved for them only to show that the
government is really "broad-based" and democratic.
</P>
<P>
But one thing is sure that various opposition parties including
the Sacred Heart Alliance led by twice Former Prime Minister
Etienne Tshisekedi, would be given places in the government.
</P>
<P>
"The new government will take up the challenge left by Mobutu's
decaying regime to re-build this country which has been crushed to
pulp," said Grattas Bugera, General Secretary of the Alliance of
the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL)
chaired by Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Bugera, Kabila's second man, arrived in Kinshasa on Monday to
prepare for Kabila's entry.
</P>
<P>
So did Kabila's Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha, who arrived
here this afternoon and was mistaken for Kabila himself by some
foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has promised to hold the general elections in the
central Africa's largest nation within two years, arguing that the
Zairean people will have to be prepared for democracy first.
</P>
<P>
On May 17, the Congo People's Liberation Army, under the
leadership of Kabila's ADFL, captured Kinshasa, the last
"liberated" city in the mineral-rich African country.
</P>
<P>
The 2.345-million-square-kilometer territory of the country
fell to the hands of Kabila's revolting troops within only seven
months.
</P>
<P>
And Mobutu, who was in the Togolese capital of Lome on Sunday
and Monday, is believed to be flown to Morocco in exile.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Chinese City Doubles Quarterly Income Tax Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Personal income tax revenues of
this capital city of southwest China's Sichuan Province doubled in
the first quarter of this year, the city's local tax bureau
reports.
</P>
<P>
It says that the rapid growth follows a 67 percent increase in
individual income tax revenues last year. The bureau declines to
reveal the exact amount collected between January and March.
</P>
<P>
The fact that more employers are willing to deduct income taxes
from their employees' wages on behalf of the tax agencies is a
major reason for the rapid revenue increases.
</P>
<P>
Taxes collected this way now account for more than 90 percent
of total tax revenues, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
Increased efforts to curb tax evasion among high-income
earners, such as lawyers, taxi drivers, chefs, beauticians,
entertainers and advertisers have also helped the stable growth in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
A tax check done among these people netted more
than 20 million yuan (about 2.4 million US dollars) in individual
income taxes last year, the official says.

<HEADLINE> New Fertilizer Applying Technique Raises Timber Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in China recently
successfully developed a fertilizer applying technique that is
used to raise the timber output of low-productive species across
the country.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted in more than 300 experiment spots in 14
provinces or autonomous regions shows that this technique can
increase the output of timber by 15 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Shen Guofang, a member of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, who heads the research, this technique will
significantly reduce the time needed for young trees to grow into
useful timber.
</P>
<P>
The technique was jointly developed by nine institutes
including the Chinese Academy of Forestry Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer applying technique has reportedly been used in
the World Bank-funded National Afforestation Project, and has
yielded 350 million yuan (some 43 million US dollars) in economic
benefits.

<P>
FUZHOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- All rural households have installed
telephone in some 100 villages in Quanzhou, a city in east China's
Fujian Province, becoming China's first group of villages with 100
percent telephone ownership.
</P>

Local farmers use the telephone to get market information and
contact businesses. As one village head said. phone service is an
important part of the local investment environment: "No telephone
means bad image in the eyes of investors."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals to East Asia, Pacific Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- International tourist arrivals to
East Asia and the Pacific region climbed by a healthy 9.3 percent
in 1996 to top 87 million.
</P>
<P>
A report from the World Tourism Organization stated that
earnings from international tourism in the region kept pace with
the growth in arrivals, increasing by 9.8 percent to 81 billion US
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Council of the World Tourism Organization is now
holding its 55th session meeting here as a prelude to the World
Tourism Leaders' Meeting scheduled on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The overall buoyancy of the economies of East Asia and the
Pacific is reflected in the region's strong tourism growth last
year," the report quoted Francesco Frangialli, Secretary-General
of the organization as saying.
</P>
<P>
Among the region's fastest growing destinations last year were
Indonesia, Macao and Japan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of receipts from international tourism, the biggest
increases in East Asia and the Pacific last year were garnered by
Japan, Australia, Indonesia and China.
</P>
<P>
The WTO report predicts that tourism in East Asia and the
Pacific will grow by an average of 7.6 percent annually to the
year 2000, when the region is expected to attract 229 million
tourists a year or one out of every five tourists in the world.
</P>
<P>
Limits and constraints that could possibly hold back the
region's tourism boom include airport congestion and shortages of
investment capital to finance new infrastructure, as well as lack
of trained staff and price hikes.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen City Intensifies Combat against Narcotics-related Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Coastal Xiamen City in east China's
Fujian Province has taken severe measures to crack down upon
drug-trafficking over the past several years, local police sources
said.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1996, police cracked 401 drug trafficking cases
and destroyed one "ice" drug processing plant, seizing 44.69 kg of
heroin, 48.6 kg of "ice" drug, 27.46 kg of opium, and a large
amount of other narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 666 people were found involved in drug-trafficking,
and 502 were sentenced to prison terms.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen is a major port city leading to Hong Kong, Macao, and
Taiwan, so drug traffickers have used the city as a good transit
site since it was designated as a special economic zone a dozen
years ago, local police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Public security departments in the city also put emphasis on
raiding places where drugs are taken, especially small hotels,
rented houses, and dancing and singing halls. From 1993 to 1996,
police busted into 296 places and seized 937 narcotics takers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city established a rehabilitation center in
October 1993, which has since offered treatment for 593 drug
addicts.

South China's Guangdong province, reports a steady improvement in
industrial performance, with total output value in the first
four months of this year reaching 53.98 billion yuan (6.7 billion
US dollars), up 15.22 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The production and sales ratio increased to 96.13 prcent, up
by 0.68 percentage point compared with the first four months of
last year.
</P>

months of this year, the city exported 15.4 billion yuan (1.86
billion US dollars) worth of industrial products, up 28.3
percent over the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Export volume now takes up 21.48 percent of the total
industrial output, which, experts believe, shows that enterprises
and overseas businessmans have come to fit into the new situation
since the export tax rate was twice reduced by the State.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, overseas-funded enterprises are
performing relatively better than the state-owned and collective
ones in the city, and light industries are developing faster than
heavy industries.

NANNING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The southern Chinese autonomous
region of Guangxi is trying to put a halt to the flow of small
amount of goods that cross its borders by paying a certain
"tariff" that is charged at unauthorized check points where there
are no customs officers.
</P>
<P>
But now, border trade goods must go through normal customs
procedures or will be taken as smuggled goods, according to a
recent circular issued by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous regional
government.

smuggling," provincial authorities say.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Help Bring Agriculture To High Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- As increasing numbers of
Chinese enterprises develop markets in rural areas, more farmers
are becoming market-oriented as a result.
</P>
<P>
North China's Hebei Province is an example. More than 30
percent of its major farm produce and by-products are processed
and 62 percent are commercialized. And nearly four million of its
farmers compete in the market.
</P>
<P>
Shijiazhuang Sanlu Dairy Products Corporation produced more
than 470 million yuan in output value last year, relying on
abundant farm products. It has brought 63 dairy farms to
prosperity, involving 3,100 households of more than 5,000 farmers,
whose per-capita income rose to 2,600 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
More enterprises have followed suit. And 1,000 key
agriculture-related enterprises are doing well, with 24 of them
each yielding over 100 million yuan worth of annual sales.
</P>
<P>
The province will increase this number to 2,000 by the end of
the century, and 20 of them are expected to sell products worth of
500 million yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
Hebei has set up more than 100 production bases of about 1.33
million ha in 60-plus counties, in a bid to link small production
to the big market.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers are doing a better job thanks to guidance from
enterprises concerned, and earning more accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province Speeding Economic Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Landlocked Qinghai Province in
northwest China, on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has been able to
increase its economic strength by placing priority on developing
its rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The province has an abundance of petroleum, natural gas,
non-ferrous metals, and rare metals. It also has a potential of 21
million kilowatts of hydro-electric power, and 33.3 million
hectares of grassland and 666,000 hectares of wasteland that could
be cultivated.
</P>
<P>
So, the province has spent more than 40 billion yuan and had
8,000 projects for making use of these resources, since a local
"resource development strategy" was started in 1978, local
officials say.
</P>
<P>
The projects include the country's biggest potash fertilizer
plant, the largest asbestos production base, and the second
biggest lead and zinc mine, with a one-million-ton annual
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
An industrial system has been formed with the salt chemical and
petrochemical industries as pillars. Other industrial projects
include high-energy plants producing steel, aluminum, and
magnesium.
</P>
<P>
Because the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, the country's largest
and the second largest rivers, start in Qinghai, it has also made
an effort to tap its rich hydro-electric power resources. The
Longyangxia power station has an installed generating capacity of
1.28 million kilowatts, and a two-million-kw station, the
Lijiaxia, has just gone operational. Other smaller stations
generate a total of 6.114 billion kwh of electricity annually.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation projects in Qinghai have helped increase the amount
of irrigated farmland by 133,000 hectares and have improved
120,000 hectares of grassland, local sources say.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these efforts, the provincial GDP has gone from
1.55 billion yuan in 1978 to 18.32 in 1996, while its industrial
and agricultural output value increased from 1.96 billion yuan to
19.95 billion yuan during the same period.

FUZHOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian province is
preparing to build the country's biggest breeding base of large
yellow croakers - a kind of fish that makes popular seafood dish.
</P>
<P>
The province has listed aquatic products as one of its main
industry, and provincial fishery experts reported some
success in research on ways of breading yellow croaker
fingerlings through artificial insemination in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The base, covering 200 hectares, will be located in Ningde
prefecture, and consists of fish ponds and a feed production
factory.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that they plan to finish the construction within
the Ninth Five-Year-Plan (1996-2000). The first phase of the
project which started earlier this year requires an investment of

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Businessmen Urge India to Lift Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi business leaders urged
India to remove all barriers to narrow the growing trade gap
between the two neighboring countries, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi businessmen had not been able to fully explore and
exploit the Indian market in the past due to the presence of a
number of non-tariff barriers, hidden subsidies and other policy
variables in India, said Abdullah Harun, president of the
Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(FBCCI).
</P>
<P>
"To create a level-playing field, non-tariff barriers on all
commodities should be dismantled and all commodities should be
dismantled on an urgent basis," he told a meeting of the
India-Bangladesh Joint Business Council (JBC) held here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The one-day council meeting ended with an agreement, in which
both sides agreed on an action plan towards expanding bilateral
trade and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, both sides recommended further trade
liberalization while adopting fast track approach for tariff
concessions to rectify trade imbalance and curb unofficial trade.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement, issued by the two sides after the fourth
meeting of the council, also recommended encouraging and
legalizing border trade, making adequate administrative machinery
available at major points of the Bangladesh-India border.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side, led by Mumtaz Ahmed, who is also Chairman of
the JBC Council, said that Bangladesh should opt for selling its
services by allowing Indian traders to use its roads, waterway and
ports to fill up the gap in trade.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed a wide trade gap in the 1995-96
fiscal year with India's exports of 1.1 billion U.S. dollars to
Bangladesh and Bangladesh's exports of only 70 million dollars to
India.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition Submits Memorandum on Local Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition has
handed over a memorandum to the Election Commission here demanding
the invalidation of the local elections held last Saturday,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress (NC) party alleged in the memorandum that
the first phase of the local elections in West Nepal was plagued
by widespread violence, vandalism and abuse of administrative
power by the ruling side.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, signed by NC President Girija Prasad Koirala,
urged the commission to declare the Saturday polls null and void
and hold re-elections across West Nepal.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of senior NC leaders Tuesday presented the
memorandum to the commission under a decision by the party
leadership at an earlier meeting, party sources said.
</P>
<P>
The NC memorandum accused the government of failing to secure
law and order during the elections by tacitly encouraging workers
of a major ruling partner to carry out illegal activities against
NC candidates.
</P>
<P>
The workers of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) prevented NC candidates from filing
nominations, forced them to withdraw nominations and assaulted
ordinary voters, the memorandum claimed.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of the local polls indicated that the NC
party, which held the most of the country's local governments
before the elections, was losing its majority control of local
authorities to the CPN-UML, the biggest party in the three-party
ruling coalition under Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who
is from a small party.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission is unlikely to yield to the NC party's
demand as it has already arranged re-elections in some areas where
the earlier polls were disturbed by clashes between workers of
different political parties, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of local elections, to be held in Central and
East Nepal, is scheduled for May 26.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands has offered to
sell submarines to Malaysia, according to the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama today.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is offering a package that includes technology
transfer and training and also assistance to set up a submarine
branch for the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN), Bernama said, quoting
Dutch Deputy Defense Minister Jan Gmelich Meijling.
</P>
<P>
Meijling, who visited Malaysia recently to promote Dutch
defense-related equipment particularly submarines, said in an
interview with Bernama "talks have been going on for quite some
time."
</P>
<P>
RMN chief Ahmad Ramli Mohamed Noor also visited the Netherlands
to study the offer, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said earlier his
ministry was looking into the various types of submarines while
awaiting the government's approval to procure its first ever
submarine either new or second hand.
</P>
<P>
So far half a dozen countries such as Sweden, Britain, Germany
and France, have been eyeing to sell submarines to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is among the countries to which the RMN sent
its personnel for specialized training in submarine operations and
maintenance. The others are Germany, France, Italy, Britain,
Turkey and France.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch deputy minister said that on a broader perspective,
the Dutch defense industry was willing to work and set up joint
ventures to manufacture defense-related products with Malaysian
companies.
</P>
<P>
He described the existing defense ties between his country and
Malaysia as good and said that several Dutch defense companies are
expected to sign agreement with their Malaysian partners soon or
in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Urged to Grace More Time for Qomolangma Climbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has been
asked to allow a grace period for the spring climbing season to
some foreign expeditions, which are being stranded on the south
face of the 8,848-meter Mt. Qomolangma due to bad weather, reports
here said today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the foreign climbing teams have sent a fax message
to the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) here from the base
camp, asking the NMA to Plead with the government on their behalf
for few more days, according to the association sources.
</P>
<P>
Under Nepal's mountaineering regulations, all climbing teams
have to conclude their expeditions on Himalayan mountains by May
31 when the current spring season ends, otherwise they could be
subject to heavy fines.
</P>
<P>
Six foreign teams, including each from Malaysia, the United
States, Canada, and New Zealand and two from Britain, are
currently attempting to scale the world highest mountain after
paying a royalty of 10,000 U.S. dollars for each member to the
Tourism Ministry, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
An official of the ministry said these stranded climbing teams
could renew their permissions and extend them to the summer season
which subsequently begins on June 1, but ruled out the possibility
to allow spring teams to climb during the summer.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecast for the coming week still brought bad news for
the climbers waiting on high-altitude camps for last opportunities
to make their assaults to the summit.
</P>
<P>
This spring's unusual bad weather conditions including heavy
snow and strong wind in the Mt. Qomolangma area has so far claimed

<HEADLINE> Singapore Reports 33 New Cases of HIV Infection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore reported 33 new cases
of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in the first quarter of this
year and a baby is among the 33 infected Singaporeans, the Straits
Times said today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since 1991 that a baby has contracted
HIV through its mother, the newspaper report said, adding that a
baby can get infected while still in the womb, but most infections
occur during the birth process itself.
</P>
<P>
Quoting figures from the Ministry of Health, the report said
that all but two of the cases were infected through sexual
intercourse. Apart from the infant who was infected by its mother,
the other non-sexual case was an intravenous drug user.
</P>
<P>
The ministry reportedly noted that since the first HIV case was
detected in March 1985, the number of new cases reported has
increased each year, from two in 1985 to 139 in 1996, and 33 in
just the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Heterosexual contact is still the main mode of transmission,
affecting 82 percent of the cases. Two were homosexual, and a
further two were bisexual.
</P>
<P>
As of March 31 this year, a total of 591 Singaporeans have been
found to be HIV infected. More than half displayed no symptoms,
while 110 had full-blown AIDS, the Ministry's figures showed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police Arrest 20 People Following Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Twenty people were arrested Tuesday
for involvement in a riot in Buncit Raya, Mampang Prapatan, South
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, police said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Those arrested are individuals who committed destructive acts
to public facilities and threw stones," Jakarta police commander
Hamami Nata said.
</P>
<P>
As the 27-day election campaign period were scheduled to end on
Friday (May 23), thousands of supporters of the United Development
Party (PPP) took to the streets once again on Tuesday despite
party leaders' explicit orders that all rallying activities in the
capital were to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
During the rallies, they lit bonfires and clashed with backers
of the ruling party Golkar in several areas around Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
A mob set a police patrol car on fire in East Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Police, forced to break up the street battle, took action by
firing tear gas canisters and rubber bullets and by spraying water
from armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was killed during the rioting," Hamami said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior police officer Tuesday denied allegations
that the situation in Jakarta is not safe after a series of riots
erupted in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
"Rumors that the situation is not safe are not true. Security
officers have been making all-out efforts," chief of the
Indonesian police information service Nurfaizi said.
</P>
<P>
He said security officers would take action against supporters
of political parties who insisted on staging motorcades.
</P>
<P>
Nurfaizi said three security officers had been killed while
carrying out their task during the campaign period which began on
April 27.
</P>
<P>
Until Monday, he added, 80 people were killed, mostly in
campaign-related traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
In this year's campaign, the country is divided into three
groups of campaign areas where the three parties -- the PPP,
Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) -- could do their
campaign activities in turn.

</P>
<P>
The council, set up in 1994, has acted as a leading organ to

<HEADLINE> Australia Urged to Pay For 60 Years of "Genocide" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia is bound by
international law to pay compensation for the "genocidal" removal
of as many as 100,000 Aboriginal children from their parents
between 1910 and 1970, an official inquiry has found.
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) under
the federal government also recommends reparations be made to the
affected families and communities and calls for an apology by all
Australian parliaments and police force, the leading newspaper The
Australian reported today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard has ruled out financial compensation
and the government's attitude has been that there is no need to
dwell on the past, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The 689-page report, ordered by the former federal government,
concludes that the policies of forced removal constituted a "crime
against humanity" which amounted to genocide, the newspaper said
in a frontage report.
</P>
<P>
"Systematic racial discrimination and genocide must not be
trivialized and Australia's obligation under international law to
make reparations must not be ignored," said the official report
completed last month.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the newspaper said Lois O'Donoghue,
former head of a governmental organization in charge of Aboriginal
affairs, was taken from her mother at two.
</P>
<P>
She said "it's very disappointing because the situation that
happened to me and others at that time is not only that we were
removed from our family, but we were denied our culture, our land
and our language, and that's something we have great difficulty
getting back."
</P>
<P>
The report explodes the myth that Aboriginal children were
taken from their families for their welfare during 1910-1970 as
part of the infamous Aboriginal assimilation policies.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald said today that "in fact, the
children, especially young girls, were exploited as cheap labor,
with some as young as 12 being raped by their white foster
fathers, church leaders and the employees of public institution."
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey conducted in 1994 shows that most families
have been affected, in one or more generations, by the forced
removal of one or more children, and nationally between one in
three and one in 10 Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from
their families and communities during 1910-1970.
</P>
<P>
The report also recommends a national compensation fund and a
national "sorry day" each year to commemorate the history of
forcible removal of children and moves towards giving indigenous
people self-determination over issues such as welfare and justice.
</P>
<P>
The federal government promised yesterday to table the report
in parliament next week.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Attorney-General Daryl Williams confirmed the
government had received the report last month but denied that it
was delaying its public release.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous, church and human rights groups yesterday united to
urge the federal government to address the findings.

BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has lost four places in
its annual world competitiveness rankings, from 14th to 18th,
according to the Nation Daily today.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997 World Economic Forum (WEF) index, released in
Switzerland on Tuesday, Thailand places 10th in market growth
index and is one of the top recipients of foreign direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand is weak in terms of import barriers, tax
burden and evasion, government competence, technology, labor
productivity and quality of legal institutions.
</P>
<P>
The overall ranking of competitiveness, surveyed among 53
countries and regions in the world, is based on 155 criteria,
drawn from eight key factors, including openness to international
trade and finance; role of the government budget and regulation;
development of financial markets; quality of infrastructure,
technology and business management; labor market flexibility, and
quality of judicial and political institutions.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is among countries in which government policies
worsened in the past year, according to the WEF index.

WARSAW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Slovenian Foreign Minister Zoran

on NATO's expansion and the European security.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers said that the understanding reached

<HEADLINE> Russian Newspapers Flood Ukrainian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian newspapers and magazines are
nearly eight times more popular in Ukraine than Ukrainian
publications and the parliament is getting worried.
</P>
<P>
The number and circulation of Russian publications has soared
since the government scrapped a law which allowed only three
Moscow-based newspapers to be sold on Ukrainian news stands.
</P>
<P>
Now, 155 of the 267 newspapers on sale in Ukraine are either in
Russian or are bilingual and Ukrainian publications are getting
squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
The country's parliament is currently debating a bill to
regulate the languages used by the media. The move comes in the
wake of a decision by the government late last year to set up an
Information Ministry to help Ukrainian language publications.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that 54 Russian newspapers and magazines are
sold for every 100 Ukrainians, compared with just seven Ukrainian
publications.
</P>
<P>
Although Ukrainian was made the only official language in
Ukraine following independence from the former Soviet Union in
1991, one in five of the country's 51 million people is ethnic
Russian and many native Ukrainians prefer speaking Russian.
</P>
<P>
Even children born after independence are more fluent in
Russian than Ukrainian.

<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa will step down from his post next month to join the
ruling party Lakas-NUCD in preparation for his presidential bid,
local newspaper The Manila Chronicle reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted De Villa as saying that he is not
resigning because of pressures from some politicians who wanted
presidential candidates to quit their posts early enough to
prevent them from using funds of their offices in their political
campaign.
</P>
<P>
De Villa and other non-Lakas aspirants for President Fidel
Ramos' endorsement have up to June 30 to join the administration
party, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The defense chief also claimed that he enjoys the support and
confidence of President Ramos and that very soon the president
will endorse him as the ruling party's standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
He also said he is now prepared to join Lakas-NUCD, adding that
he will no longer keep his political ambition secret, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani, another potential
presidential candidate who is also an elder sister of President
Ramos, called on those who will run for the 1998 elections to
immediately step down so as not to use their positions for their
political ambitions.

<HEADLINE> Applications to Thai Investment Board Falls 22 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Net applications for direct
investment submitted by Thai and foreign investors to the Board of
Investment (BOI) of Thailand fell by 22.3 percent in the first
quarter of the year from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop came amid a decline in Thailand's macro-economic
stability, which is being threatened by problems in the finance
and property sectors.
</P>
<P>
Other factors included the lower yen, which made Japanese
products cheaper at home, according to BOI.
</P>
<P>
Net investment applications submitted to BOI during
January-March of 1997 totaled 153.9 billion baht (6.16 billion US
dollars), a decrease of over 22 percent compared to the same
period of 1996, which had 197.4 billion baht (7.9 billion dollar)
worth of investment, according to BOI.
</P>
<P>
Investment projects applied through BOI usually enjoy
promotional privileges, such as import duty reductions and tax
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Investments sought by Taiwanese businesses had the sharpest
drop, with only 20 projects worth 400 million baht (16 million
dollars) in equity investments applied for in the first three
months of 1997, compared to 8.7 billion baht (348 million dollars)
for 20 projects in the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Japanese and American projects also dropped to 4 billion baht
(160 million dollars) and 7.1 billion baht (284 million dollars)
from 6.3 billion baht (252 million dollars) and 10.9 billion baht
(436 million dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, European investors applied for more investments with 2
billion baht (80 million dollars) worth of equity investment
projects, compared to only 300 million baht (12 million dollars)
in the first quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, the fifth largest investor in the country, applied
for projects worth 100 million baht (4 million dollars) during the
first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Economy Expects Slight Increase This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia's economy is moving toward
stability as the gross domestic product is expected to grow 2
percent in 1997 or stay the same as last year, a senior official
at the Ministry of Economy said today.
</P>
<P>
Figures of the ministry showed that imports fell 4 percent and
exports rose 3 percent between January and April this year,
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The actual income of citizens increased 4 percent, and the
production of raw materials, chemistry and machinery remained
stable.
</P>
<P>
Residents whose average monthly income was lower than the
subsistence level of 400,000 rubble (about 70 U.S. dollars)
accounted for 21 percent of the total population in the first four
months this year, down 3 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the rich and poor is widening as the richest
people, making up for about 10 percent of the country's total
population, have aggregated 32.3 percent of Russia's wealth.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has outlined seven priority targets for
the near future, of which top consideration will be given to
helping the poor and revitalizing Russia's national industry.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Bronzes Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have recently
proved that people in Hubei Province in the central part of China
were able to produce high-quality bronze at least 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The evidence comes in the form of smelted ore that is 94
percent bronze and a residue that contained less than 0.7 percent
bronze, which was found at the Tonglushan Smelter Site in Hubei's
Daye city, which was discovered in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The smelter was built in the Western Zhou Dynasty (11th c.BC
- 771 BC). It operated for more than 1,000 years until the Western
Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD) when it witnessed the transition from
the Bronze to the Iron age. It is the largest and best preserved
ancient bronze smelter in the world.
</P>
<P>
The ancient Chinese smelted ore at some 1,200 degrees Celsius,
while their Egyptian counterparts could only smelt and cast metals
at lower temperatures at that time, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Also found at the two-sq-km site were hundreds of wells, some
30-60 m deep, more than 100 horizontal channels for pouring, three
smelting workshops with eight furnaces, and a great number of
tools made of bronze, iron, wood, bamboo, stone, and bone, as well
as pottery for daily use.

<TEXT>
<P>
Changchun, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Changbai Mountains in northeast
China's Jilin Province are expected to play a bigger role in
promoting local economic development, as they have been found rich
in wild plants.
</P>
<P>
A two-year scientific survey that ended recently showed that
there are in the mountains 2,077 varieties of wild plants,
including 1,600 of economic value.
</P>
<P>
And 875 kinds of them are medical plants, like ginseng,
dangshen (Codonopsis pilosula), tuber of elevated gastrodia
(Gastrodia elata). One of China's three medicinal material
production bases lies in these mountains.
</P>
<P>
The mountains rank fourth in forest resources and second in
annual wood production in China. There have been more than 280
species of nectariferous plants in the mountains, and the linden
honey products have won wide reputation.
</P>
<P>
The mountains also boast of edible wild vegetables, aromatic
plants, fiber plants, ornamental plants, and plants that contain
rich vitamins, sugars, amino acids, and minerals.
</P>
<P>
Local people have turned the mountains into one of China's
major forest zones and important bee-raising bases.
</P>
<P>
Some of the economic plant resources have been destroyed due to
random exploitation. Local governments are taking effective
measures to maintain ecologically sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council to Expand to 20-26 Member States: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said today he hoped the U.N. Security Council would be
expanded from the present 15 members to between 20 and 26 member
states.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after talks with Austrian President Thomas
Klestil, Chancellor Viktor Klima, Vice-Chancellor and Foreign
Minister Wolfgang Schussel and President of the National Council
Heinz Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Their talks mainly centered on U.N. reforms, Austria's role in
the United Nations and the situation in some of the world's hot
spots.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Security Council needed to be enlarged to
20 to 26 members to "go along with the present world political
reality."
</P>
<P>
The council now has 15 members with five permanent seats and
10 seats which rotate every two years among other U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. working group is currently discussing the enlargement
issue. Japan and Germany have both been lobbying for a permanent
seat on the council. But developing countries want more members
on the council because they fear they won't be fairly represented.
</P>
<P>
Industrial nations, Annan noted, wanted membership increased to 20
whereas developing countries wanted a much bigger Security
Council. The final decision will be made by all U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Annan thanked Austria for its active
participation in U.N. work and peace-keeping missions.
</P>
<P>
Annan also met with Franz Vranitzky, the commissioner for
Albania with the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), and discussed the situation in the country which is
preparing for elections after being shaken by unrest in February
and March.

<HEADLINE> China's Northeast Helping Unemployed Workers Get New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- About a million laid-off workers
in northeast China's province of Liaoning have found new jobs with
the help of local governments and grass-roots organizations,
according to official sources here.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is China's oldest heavy industry base and has one-tenth
of the country's state-owned enterprises, but many have long been
plagued by poor economic performance and overstaffing.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, state-owned enterprises laid
off more workers as the country moves ahead with its reforms and
improves efficiency. Liaoning is believed to have the most
unemployed workers in the country with 1.6 million, according to
local sources.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has placed equal emphasis on grain
production, a "vegetable basket" project, and re-employment, with
the hope of putting people back to work.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have also been helpful, developing 140
preferential policies to help people find jobs, while social
organizations have also done a lot of work in helping them find
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions helped establish 203 job markets and more than
3,000 agencies in 1996, where 16,000 people found new jobs, and
local industrial and commercial departments have helped 150,000
people employed over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up 1,400 job agencies, and financial
departments have started services to insure workers against
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Seven million workers at local state-owned enterprises,
collectively-owned businesses, and overseas-backed ventures have
taken out unemployment insurance. In the past three years, while
the province has been implementing the re-employment scheme,
financial organizations at various levels have given 340 million
yuan to help the unemployed get through their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The province will continue to build more job agencies and
expand labor exports to help people find work in other areas, said
Dai Mingshun, chief of the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of
Labor. They have set a goal of helping one million more find
employment by the year 2000.

<P>
HANGZHOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province has
been paying a great attention to environmental protection to
maintain an ecological balance, and its efforts have begun to pay
off.
</P>
<P>
Xialu Township in Shaoxing County was informed in early May
that it was given the title of "Global 500" for the year of 1996
for its outstanding achievements in ecological construction by the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has become famous for its successful development of
rural industry and is one of the areas in east China that has seen
the fastest growth since China decided on reform measures in the
late 1970s. This is especially true of the household
responsibility system in rural areas, and it has encouraged
surplus rural labor to work in nearby factories or find jobs in
cities.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, the province has made environmental
protection part of its plan for local economic and social
development and has selected some rural areas to experiment with
in constructing ecological villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
Xialu Township, which is in a mountainous area, has less water
and has been an easy victim of natural adversities, which caused
serious damages to vegetation. Township authorities have made an
effort to encourage residents to plant more trees to protect the
environment, and it now has a vegetation cover of 74.2 percent,
compared with 70.03 percent in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The township government has rules and regulations banning all
pollution-causing projects in developing the local economy. One
local conglomerate spent tens of millions of yuan on shifting its
flax dyeing and finishing mill from the township seat to a tidal
zone on the coast and on installing the necessary equipment to
treat industrial waste water.
</P>
<P>
The township authorities have also taken steps to improve the
environment. The local government has implemented management
measures for the township seat and for environment and hygiene.
</P>
<P>
Local residents have been told to put their waste in bags, and
industrial and other waste is buried in centralized places. The
local government has also encouraged a comprehensive recycling of
discarded materials.
</P>
<P>
Xialu Township survived UNEP's assessment, competing with
places and projects recommended for the title of "Global 500 " for
1996. For the competition, China recommended five units but Xialu
Township survived to claim the title.

<P>
This is a reward for the province's efforts to protect the
environment. Xialu is just one of the province's four places to
win the title of "Global 500".
</P>
<P>
The other three are Shanyi Village of Xiaoshan City, Lijia
Village of Yinxian County and Tengtou Village of Fenghua City.
</P>
<P>
The provincial environmental protection bureau says that the
province has assigned more than 100 villages or towns to
experiment with ecological construction and has successfully
established 70 ecological villages and towns, and has the largest
number of areas in China that have been given the title "Global
500" title.
</P>
<P>
Shanyi Village of Xiaoshan City has distinguished itself by
starting a number of ecological projects such as building timber
and cash forests and projects to prevent and cure plant diseases
and insect pests, and by the more rational use of resources.
</P>
<P>
The village has seen fast growth in agricultural and industrial
output value, and its per capita annual income surpasses Xiaoshan
City's.
</P>
<P>
Tengtou Village has been successful in building a
methane-generating pit with a volume of 500 cubic meters, which
has provided households with cooking gas and is offering farmers
help in cultivating aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Village-led industries have stopped business that may cause
serious pollution and been active in environmentally-friendly
projects. Their total output value has exceeded 200 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
With its increased funds, the village has made an overall plan
to rebuild previously-scattered rural bungalows into 32 low-rise
buildings with well-designed interiors.
</P>
<P>
Provincial authorities also plan to bring the number of
ecological villages and townships to 100 by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Environmental Protection Bureau say that
China has 19 projects, like the three-north afforestation belt,
and villages and townships that have won the title "Global 500"
title, which was developed by NEP to increase people's awareness
of the need for environmental protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning, northeast China's heavy
industrial base, finds the newly opened public informtion network
very helpful in promoting the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The net, which is China's first provincial public information
network, links up the province's 13 major cities apart from being
hooked up with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Named 'Beiguo' (meaning 'North China') Information Network, it
was designed and invested by the Dongda Software Center, one of
China's national software engineering research institutes.
</P>
<P>
It uses an optic cable for transmission and allows its users to
transmit text, graphic images, and sound simultaneously as well as
to surf the Internet or other local information nets.
</P>
<P>
The network is expected to become a major information channel
to promote the local economy, and in fact some enterprises have
already benefited from it. The Feilong Group reduced the cost of
production after learning the information on the net about where
to purchase cheaper raw materials, and the Yinzi Group concluded a
600,000-yuan steel deal through referring to the information on
the net.
</P>
<P>
Local government departments have also found the net useful in
helping them making sound judgement and decisions at work.

<HEADLINE> Panama to Develop Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Panama has the capacity to
develop a capital market as strong as its banking system, a
Panamanian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Arturo Tapia, member of the high-level commission for the
modernization of the capital markets, said that Panama can offer
Latin American and other countries a unique advantage, with its
dollarized services sector and an efficient banking system,
fundamental elements for taking the country to capital markets.
</P>
<P>
In both markets, the companies can offer their bonds directly
to the public in an effort to obtain funds, without going through
the banking system.
</P>
<P>
When a company needs financing or wants to expand its business,
it can request funds from a bank or issue bonds directly to the
public.
</P>
<P>
Tapia said that the banking systems in most developed countries
are complemented by capital markets. In the United States, the
capital market is larger than the banking system, but the banking
system in Panama is still predominant.
</P>
<P>
Since the Panamanian stock exchange initiated operations in
1990, it has had a sustained growth and registered more than 239
million dollars in trade between January and April of this year.

<HEADLINE> Czech Trade With Germany Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The trade between the Czech Republic
and Germany dropped by 1.3 percent in the first quarter to 106.6
billion Czech koruny (about 3.68 billion U.S. dollars) compared
with the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau said that Czech export to Germany
decreased by 0.2 percent to 53.9 billion koruny (about 1.86
billion dollars) and the import went down by 2.4 percent to 52.7
billion koruny (about 1.82 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Germany accounted for one third of the total import and export
of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Germany's less demand for imports from the Czech Republic and
the lack of competitiveness of Czech products are believed to be
the main reasons for the trade decline between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Increase Rice Production In 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Cuba will produce 200,000 tons of
rice this year, 55,000 tons over 1996, Cuban Agriculture Minister
Jordan Morales said in an interview published by the local press
today.
</P>
<P>
The rice harvested between March 1996 and March 1997 yielded
145,000 tons, 25,000 tons over the 1995-1996 season when
production levels of this cereal began to recover, Morales was
quoted as saying by the "Business in Cuba" weekly magazine.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are now made to increase efficiency, reduce production
costs and increase yields congruent with the financial resources
used for the production of rice, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that rice plantations have been
overhauled over the past year with financing from European and
Chinese banks to raise production from 3.5 tons/hectare to 5.0
tons/hectare.
</P>
<P>
Cubans consume about 500,000 tons of rice per year and the
government has to spend about 90 million U.S. dollars to make up
the shortfall of rice each year.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (95-96) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (95-96) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Under what circumstances may representatives of the
government of the Hong Kong SAR participate in diplomatic
negotiations?
</P>
<P>
Answer: After 1997, representatives of the government of the
Hong Kong SAR may, as members of delegations of the government of
China, participate in all negotiations at the diplomatic level if
such negotiations directly affect the region.
</P>
<P>
The three conditions for the participation in diplomatic
negotiations of representatives of the government of the Hong Kong
SAR are:
</P>
<P>
1) Such negotiations are conducted by the central government of
China;
</P>
<P>
2) Such negotiations directly affect the Hong Kong SAR;
</P>
<P>
3) Representatives of the Hong Kong SAR government do not
participate in such negotiations in an independent capacity but as
members of delegations of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Question: What about Taiwan institutions in Hong Kong after
China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Both Taiwan and Hong Kong are inalienable territory of
the People's Republic of China. Exchanges between the inland
areas, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the fields of economy, trade,
culture, science and technology have kept increasing, and their
relations are becoming ever closer.
</P>
<P>
In principle, when Hong Kong returns to the motherland in 1997,
Taiwan's institutions and personnel in Hong Kong will be permitted
to remain. Hong Kong and Taiwan will continue to maintain and
develop economic, cultural and transportation ties.
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan will not be allowed to have official organizations
in Hong Kong. Taiwan organizations in Hong Kong must abide by some
basic principles.
</P>
<P>
For example, they must not engage in activities that aim to
split China and sabotage the reunification of the motherland such
as advocating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan;" they must
not engage in any activities that impede the development of
cross-strait relations; they must abide by the Basic Law and
decrees and regulations of the Hong Kong SAR; and they must not
engage in activities that impair the stability and prosperity of
the Hong Kong SAR.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Starting Unified Paging Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 21 (Xinhua) --Tianjin Municipal Posts and
Telecommunications Administration in the north China's Tianjin
has started two new paging services in co-operation with
independent paging service centers.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin now has more than 70 separate paging services, with 1.2
million subscribers. A majority of the services are small in scale
except for the local posts and telecommunications departments,
which are financially and technically stronger.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of these have more than 10,000 subscribers each, but some
have only about 2,000 subscribers. To woo more subscribers, paging
service operators have been competing by cutting costs, a move
that has put some operators in a tough situation.
</P>
<P>
The two separate paging services brought 14,000 customers with
them when they joined more new paging services, which have been
built on the basis of the original paging network started by the
posts and telecommunications departments, and have a combined
handling capacity of 10 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 37 other separate paging services have also agreed
to join the unified new paging services and are now making
preparations, according to local sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China has moved from the 36th place
in 1996 to the 29th in the 1997 Global Competitiveness Ranking,
said the Global Competitiveness Report released today by the
Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
The rankings of a total of 53 countries and regions in the
world are based on 155 criteria with eight major factors
determining competitiveness: openness of an economy to
international trade and finance, role of the government budget and
regulation, development of financial markets, quality of
infrastructure, technology and business management, labor market
flexibility, and quality of judicial and political institutions.
</P>
<P>
The WEF says in its report that China's leap forward is mainly
due to the country's economic reforms in labor market and tax
policies.
</P>
<P>
In an opinion survey of some 3,000 business leaders worldwide
based mainly on their subjective judgements, China places ninth in
the competitiveness rankings.
</P>
<P>
In another ranking based on the market growth index, China, the
world's fastest growing economy, ranks second only behind the
United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based World Economic
Forum (WEF) today released its Global Competitiveness Report
covering a total of 53 countries and regions all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 economies of high competitiveness are Singapore,
Hong Kong, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the United Kingdom, Taiwan, Malaysia and Norway.
</P>
<P>
The rankings are based on 155 criteria with eight major factors
determining competitiveness: openness of an economy to
international trade and finance, role of the government budget and
regulation, development of financial markets, quality of
infrastructure, quality of technology, quality of business
management, labor market flexibility and quality of judicial and
political institution.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, with its ranking rising steeply from last year's
30th place to the 15th this year, has become the most competitive
country among the big emerging markets, the WEF report said.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's fastest growing economy, has moved from the
36th place in 1996 to the 29th due to the country's successful
reforms in labor market and tax policies and its absorption of
foreign direct investment of 42 billion U.S. dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Hong Kong have kept their leading places in the
competitiveness ranking.
</P>
<P>
Chile continues as Latin America's brightest star, rising from
the 18th place in 1996 to the 13th. Market-friendly economic
policies are believed to have dramatically improved its growth
performance of 6.9 percent, the highest in Latin America, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The United States emerges as the most competitive among the
large economies with populations of over 10 million. The two key
areas determining long-term productivity growth in advanced
nations - technology and management - have played a decisive role
in raising the country from last year's fourth place to the third.
</P>
<P>
Other factors include its labor market flexibility,
technological prowess and low fiscal deficit of 1.4 percent in
1996, which represented the industrial world's lowest.
</P>
<P>
Canada has moved from last year's eighth place to the fourth
thanks to its success in curbing fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
Among the European countries, the United Kingdom has jumped
from the 15th place in 1996 to this year's seventh, with the
Netherlands from the 17th to the 12th, Ireland from the 26th to
the 16th and Norway keeping a place in the top 10 from last
year's 7th.

ranking of the 53 countries and regions from last year's 49th.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A well-preserved irrigation network
dug in the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) has been found in northwest
China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 km of canals and ditches were found existing in Anxi
county. The ditches measured one meter wide and one meter deep.
</P>
<P>
For more than a thousand years, the network introduced water
from a river some 50 km away and irrigated an area of over 30,000
hectares in present-day wasteland.
</P>
<P>
Also found in the area were remains of a city and military
facilities from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), suggesting a
prosperous oasis at that time, Chinese archaeologists say.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the site became desertified during
the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) when the central government took the
place for military use and relocated all local residents.

<HEADLINE> Opposing Faction Denies Taliban's Gains in Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 21 (Xinhua) -- An opposing faction has denied
the Afghan Islamic militia Taliban's claim that it had captured
the strategic Shibar pass in central Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A Hezb-i-Wahdat official in northwestern Pakistan's Peshawar
city Tuesday rejected the Taliban claim as an "absolute lie",
stressing that the pass was still under the faction's control, the
Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Both sides were still locked in a stalemate at frontlines in
central Bamyan province, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Shibar pass is only five kilometers from Bamyan city, a
stronghold of the Hezb-i-Wahdat allied with northern warlord
Rashid Dostum.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban launched an offensive early this morning around
Sheikh Ali town, but the frontlines remain in the same position,"
the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ali is situated about 20 kilometers east of the pass and
the rival forces have been locked in a stalemate there since the
Taliban advanced up the valley in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is reported that the Taliban, who launched a
major offensive Tuesday, had made key gains in central and
northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern provinces of Badghis, Faryab and Sar-e-Pol
fell into Taliban hands after the defection of Dostum's right-hand
man, Abdul Malik, reports from Kabul said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said following Malik's revolt, most parts of the
northeastern province of Kunduz and Baghlan have also been
captured and heavy fighting was still going on around
Mazar-e-Sharif, Dostum's headquarters, about 300 kilometers from
Kabul.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Expand Crackdown on Medicare Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Success of a two-year crackdown
on Medicare fraud in five states prompted the U.S. Government to
expand it to a dozen more states Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a model that works. Now it's time to take what we've
learned and use it broadly and aggressively," said Donna Shalala,
the Health and Human Services secretary.
</P>
<P>
Medicare is the federal health insurance program covering more
than 37 million elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
The anti-fraud campaign, started in 1995 and known as
"Operation Restore Trust," will eventually cover all 50 states,
Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next two years, it will expand to a dozen more states.
</P>
<P>
During its initial phase, federal investigators targeted fraud
by home health agencies, nursing homes, medical equipment
suppliers and hospices, in California, Florida, New York, Texas,
and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
Shalala said, 74 criminal convictions have recovered 67.3
million dollars for Medicare, 58 civil cases have brought in
another 72.8 million dollars in fines and settlements, and
companies have returned 47.4 million dollars for services
inappropriately provided or billed.
</P>
<P>
Medicare has shut out 218 fraudulent health care providers, and
investigators still are working on 210 cases.
</P>
<P>
Medicare administrator Bruce Vladeck said cooperation between
Medicare and state Medicaid offices also helped identify cases in
which both the federal health program for the aging and state
programs for the poor and disabled were billed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Imposes Sanctions on Burma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton, citing
so-called human rights abuses, announced on Tuesday to impose
sanctions on Burma, which includes a ban on U.S. investment in its
oil and natural gas development.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who announced in April that he intended to impose the
sanctions, said in a letter to Congress that he was taking the
action because of "serious abuses" by the State Law and Order
Restoration Council in Burma against opponents.
</P>
<P>
The order prohibits U.S. citizens from entering into contracts
that involve the economic development of resources in Burma.
</P>
<P>
It also prohibits Americans from purchasing ownership shares in
developing resources in the country or helping non-U.S. citizens
who wish to perform activities forbidden under the ban.
</P>
<P>
Roger Beach, the chairman of the oil and gas company Unocal
Cop. -- the largest U.S. investor in Burma -- said he was
disappointed with the decision to impose sanctions because it
would hurt economic development.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the fourth largest investor in Burma,
after France, Singapore and Thailand.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street rallied
today, led by technology shares and financial services issues,
after Federal Reserve decided to leave interest rates intact.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 74.58 points, or about
1 percent, to 7,303.46, about 30 points shy of its all-time high
set last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gauge of 30 big companies had fallen by as much as 76
points before today's Fed policy meeting ended without any change
in the central bank's interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. Its volume increased to 447.17
million shares from the 345.14 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 8.39 to 841.66, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 3.06 to 437.20, leaving both
measures less than a point shy of record territory.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 22.34, or 1.7 percent, to
1,363.58, moving within 25 points of its all-time high, set back
in January.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.28 to
590.76.
</P>
<P>
Among leading Nasdaq technology issues, Intel, Dell Computer,
Cisco Systems and Microsoft posted big gains.
</P>
<P>
IBM, meanwhile, jumped the equivalent of 19 Dow points to lead
the blue-chip average.
</P>
<P>
Trading had been extremely hesitant in advance of today's Fed
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Kofi Annan Stresses Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Poverty is a challenge that
no country, developed or developing, can afford to ignore and is a
top priority goal of the United Nations agenda, UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the annual session of the special event on
poverty eradication held by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), he noted
that some 1.3 billion people in the world currently live in
absolute poverty, with incomes of less than a dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is growing as fast as populations. In Sub-Saharan
Africa, it is estimated that half of the people will be living in
absolute poverty by the year 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that UN can become a powerful force for development
-- for development targeted at poverty eradication, in the
following aspects: as a democratic voice of the weak; as a forum
of consensus-based action; through its advocacy and outreach role;
by forging new alliances and partnerships; through balancing
private interests and the public good; through the promotion of
share values; and through cost-effective and efficient development
activities.
</P>
<P>
The major themes of the programs of action of the United
Nations conferences in the 1990s together provide the basis for
comprehensive action against poverty and for the improvement of
the quality of life of the whole population, he said.

NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar sank against most

<HEADLINE> Canada to Send 15 RCMP Officers to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy announced here today that Canada is sending 15
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers to Bosnia to
participate in the United Nations International Police Task Force
(IPTF).
</P>
<P>
The officers are being deployed under the terms of recently
concluded Administrative Arrangement concerning funding for RCMP
participation in international peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is committed to participating actively in the efforts
of the international community to restore peace and order in
Bosnia," said Mr.Axworthy, "This decision further reflects
Canada's emphasis on the important role of civilians in
peace-building and in making the transition from conflict to
stability."
</P>
<P>
The IPTF was established by a UN Security Council Resolution in
December 1995, following the Bosnian Peace Agreement, which was
signed in November of that year. Its mandate is to monitor, advise
and otherwise assist the Bosnian police forces to ensure that they
operate in accordance with internationally recognized standards.
</P>
<P>
The IPTF has a current mandate of 18 months and consists of a
multinational force of approximately 1800 officers from 37
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will travel to Europe on Sunday, focusing on
Bosnia issues, the State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
Albright will deal with a "wide range of issues pertaining to
our relations with the European countries" during her week-long
trip, said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
The trip will bring her to France, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Bosnia and maybe other Balkan states later, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The focus of her trip will be Bosnia. Issues relating to the
implementation of the Dayton accords will be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary believes that it's important now to work with
the parties to the Dayton accord as to implementation," Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has scheduled to pull out its peacekeeping forces of
Bosnia in the middle of next year. But the Europeans believe
that a complete implementation of the Dayton peace agreement is
risky by that time.
</P>
<P>
Albright will arrive in Paris early Monday and joined President
Bill Clinton at the summit on May 27, when the U.S. and its
European allies will sign a document with Russia to fix future
relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- British new defense secretary
George Robertson on Tuesday urged Bosnia's former warring parties
to do more in consolidating peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Robertson told a press conference here at the end of his
two-day visit to Bosnia that he had made it clear to Bosnian
politicians that the continued presence of Nato troops in Bosnia
could not be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Bosnian parties should take advantage of Nato
troops presence to make more efforts in implementing the Dayton
accords. In particular, he called on the parties to pass the laws
necessary for holding the international donors' conference, to
hand in war crime suspects, clear mines and reduce arms
stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said that there is no difference between the Labor
and Conservative governments in their commitment to the Dayton
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the Dayton agreement was a compromise and
to implement it also requires compromise.
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary on Monday visited Banja Luka where
Nato-led British troops were headquaterred. During the two-day
visit, he met Bosnian leaders at both state and entity levels.

<HEADLINE> Study: Secondhand Smoke Doubles Risk of Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Secondhand smoke is more dangerous
than previously thought, doubling the risk of heart disease, the
New York Times reported today quoting a latest study.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, researchers at the Harvard School of
Public Health tracked more than 32,000 healthy women who never
smoked and found that regular exposure to other people's smoking
at home or work almost double the risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Many earlier studies have linked secondhand smoke to heart
disease, but the new findings show the biggest increase in risk
ever reported. And the researchers also say that it applies
equally to men and women.
</P>
<P>
The women in the study which was published today in the journal
Circulation ranged in age from 36 to 61 suffered 152 heart
attacks, 25 of them fatal. The results mean there may be up to
50,000 Americans dying of heart attacks from passive smoking each
year.
</P>
<P>
Before the study, it was known that passive smoking caused
increased risk for several ailments, including asthma and
bronchitis, as well as middle-ear infections in young children.
</P>
<P>
The study was considered very important for its careful
analysis of workplace exposure to smoke, which had rarely done
before.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Warns against Possible Cohabitation with Socialists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
warned this evening against a possible "cohabitation," or
sharing of government with the opposition socialists, saying that
France cannot defend its own interests unless it "speaks with one
voice."
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the statement five days before the holding of the
first round of the legislative elections, as public opinion polls
have predicted a shoulder-to-shoulder run between the ruling
majority and the opposition parties in this round of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Before holding a meeting with visiting German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl at the Elysee presidential palace, Chirac also reaffirmed
that France will hold its commitment to European integration
"with lucidity and pragmatism."
</P>
<P>
"How can you imagine that all that was built over the past 40
years would be undermined or shelved without resulting in
irreparable damages for our country?" said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse said that the message given by Chirac
also is aimed at showing his determination to engage France in the
process of European construction and the launching of the European
single currency, euro, by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In order to obtain a free hand to carry forward his efforts on
European construction, Chirac dissolved the French National
Assembly (lower house of parliament) on April 21 in a gamble to
secure another parliamentary majority by calling early legislative
elections one year before schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party has indicated that it will not accept the
European single currency if that would result in more economic and
social austerity plans that would hurt the French people.
</P>
<P>
France is struggling hard to achieve the criteria set by the
European Union to cut its public deficit to below three percent of
its gross domestic product this year, to qualify for the euro.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have resulted in many unpopular social and
economic policies over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said this evening that if the
oppositions win the election, a cohabitation will bring "a mess
in Europe."
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin immediately disputed
the statement by Chirac, saying that even in the case of
cohabitation, France would speak with one voice, as it did twice
under President Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand, a socialist president, had to share power from 1986
to 1988 and from 1993 to 1995 with the then opposition Rally for
the Republic party. Chirac and Edouard Balladur served as prime
ministers during that two periods of time respectively.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official: NATO Changes Pledge When Threats Occur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will change its promise to Russia if new
threats occur, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Talbott made the remarks in a speech at the Atlantic Council,
as part of a campaign of the Clinton administration to lobby for
the alliance's expansion.
</P>
<P>
NATO has promised Russia that it will not deploy nuclear forces
nor "substantial troops" on the territories of the new members in
the foreseeable future after it expands.
</P>
<P>
Talbott indicated that these pledges are "reassertions of
NATO's own policy" and not "negotiated limits on NATO's freedom of
action."
</P>
<P>
"The alliance reserves the unilateral right to reassess the
security environment at any time, and if it felt there was a new
challenge, to change deployments accordingly," he added.
</P>
<P>
Talbott also reiterated that the membership of the alliance
is open, even to Russia, after NATO decides on the first group
in July in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the criticism that any change in NATO, particularly
expansion, will dilute NATO's strength.
</P>
<P>
"Just the opposite is true," he said. "NATO was strong during
the Cold War because it was dynamic and faced the security
challenges as they existed at the time."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the costs of NATO expansion will be debated
much more than the expansion itself in the Senate. The U.S. will
have to pay 200 million U.S. dollars a year for ten years for the
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Any agreements on accepting new members into NATO will need the
ratification of a two-third majority in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chamber of Commerce Supports MFN Extension to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on
Tuesday welcomed President Bill Clinton's decision to extend the
Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status to China for the coming
year and pledged to exert its efforts for the approval in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Willard A. Workman, Chamber vice president, international, said
colleagues were "pleased" that the president did propose a
one-year extension. But he also expressed disappointment for not
asking Congress for a permanent and unconditional extension of
MFN.
</P>
<P>
Workman pointed out that U.S. companies export more than 14
billion US dollars a year in goods and services to China, which
supports more than 200,000 high-wage U.S. jobs in virtually every
state.
</P>
<P>
"Trade with China provides a solid basis for a U.S.-China
dialogue," he said. "All MFN means is the normal trade treatment
now granted all but a handful of countries."
</P>
<P>
Failure to grant China MFN status also would do immense harm
to Hong Kong, he added.

<HEADLINE> France to Sell Saudi Arabia a Third Frigate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- France announced today that it has
signed a contract with Saudi Arabia on the selling by France to
the kingdom of a third frigate since 1996.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe made the announcement this
evening on TF1 television channel, saying that the contract would
bring about orders worth billions of francs.
</P>
<P>
"Following the voyage that the president of the republic made
last year in Saudi Arabia, we just learned that that country
ordered with us a third `Lafayette' frigate," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
He said that the deal "would represent billions of (francs) in
orders and 2,600 consolidated jobs for five years."
</P>
<P>
The French presidential office hailed this evening the signing
of the new contract and said that President Jacques Chirac has
personally intervened for winning the contract.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry said that Saudi Arabia also ordered
three other medium-sized "ultra-modern" navy vessels with
France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac visited Saudi Arabia in July 1996 and signed with Saudi
Arabia the selling of two frigates under a contract named "Sawari
II."
</P>
<P>
According to the French presidential office, France signed a
total of from 95 to 100 billion francs (19-20 billion U.S.
dollars) of contracts with foreign countries, 10 percent of which
were won under "a strong political support" from the government.
</P>
<P>
The announcement on the deal was made five days before the
holding of the first round of France's legislative elections on
May 25.

<HEADLINE> Wage Rises in UK Make Savings Industry Prosperous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Rising wages are making the savings
industry in Britain prosperous, with personal saving up by 18
billion pounds (28.8 billion US dollars) in the first quarter of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of new personal saving was 26 percent higher than in
the first three months of 1996, and 80 percent up in the same
period in 1995, according to Abbey National, the bank.
</P>
<P>
The findings are contained in Abbey National's new savings
index. This combines figures from banks, building societies and
life and unit trust companies.
</P>
<P>
As being a consumer savings industry market for the first time,
it will be the scene of fierce competition this Summer, when
building societies convert to banks, expected financial experts
in the City.
</P>
<P>
Abbey's index shows banks and building societies have won back
a big share of new savings, from a low in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
At that time they received barely 30 percent of new savings.
That share is now back up to about 60 percent - largely at the
expense of National Savings.
</P>
<P>
National Savings rates look particularly competitive when base
rates are low or falling. But steady National Saving rates look
less attractive than variable bank accounts when base rates are
expected to rise, the City experts said.
</P>
<P>
Barry Naisbitt, chief economist at Abbey National, said that
the first quarter figures could have been distorted by the general
election. But savers were "responding to the political message"
that they would no longer be able to rely on the welfare state in
old age and adversity, he added.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Leaves Short-term Interest Rate Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
today left the short-term interest rate unchanged, holding the
federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks stable at 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. central banks apparently opted to wait and watch for
signs of inflationary pressures before its next policy-making
meeting on July 1-2.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed announced today that it had adjourned a meeting of
its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and had
nothing further to say.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy expanded at a rapid 5.6 percent annual rate in
the first quarter, the best in 10 years, and the unemployment rate
dropped to 4.9 percent in April, the lowest in nearly 24 years.
</P>
<P>
Fearful that strong economic demand would cause accelerating
inflation, the FOMC increased the rate by a quarter percentage
point on March 25, the first increase in two years.
</P>
<P>
But since then there have been signs that the U.S. economic
growth is moderating and the Fed has decided they could wait until
their next meeting to see if the slowdown is pronounced enough to
keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
The rate increase in March drew protests from groups ranging
from the AFL-CIO to the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and 64 other members of
Congress also criticized the increase in a letter to Fed Chairman
Greenspan. The letter said that "raising interest rate in a
pre-emptive strike against inflation risks damaging our economic
growth" and it was "unwarranted".

told today by his doctors that his knee injury has healed enough
for him to start "putting around," and Clinton planned to hit the
putting green immediately, White House spokesman Mike McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton planned to practice on the White House's south grounds
between his afternoon meetings, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The president injured his knee on March 14 when he fell at
golfer Greg Norman's home in Florida.
</P>
<P>
Clinton can't yet play full rounds of golf, McCurry said. "My
guess is it is still going to be late Summer before that is a
possibility," he said.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Exposes European Energy Subsidy Negative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Almost 15 billion U.S. dollars in
European taxpayers' money are being spent every year to subsidize
energy systems which damage the climate and increase the nuclear
risk, a Greenpeace report revealed today.
</P>
<P>
The report, Energy Subsidies in Europe, shows that more than 90
percent of direct subsidies from European governments to the
energy industry goes to fossil fuels and nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
This leaves just nine percent of total direct subsidies, or 1.5
billion dollars a year, to clean renewable energy sources, the
report says. In the EU alone, 12 percent goes to renewable energy
and 88 percent is spent on fossil fuels and nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
Launching the report, which was prepared by the Institute for
Environmental Studies of the Vrije University in Amsterdam,
Greenpeace International climate campaigner Kirsty Hamilton said
the results proved the lie of Europe's environmental rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
"Taxpayers' money is being used to fuel climate change," she
said. "The EU and its member states will not meet current
commitments to cut greenhouse gases by 15 percent by 2010 if they
continue these massive subsidies to the fossil fuel industries."
</P>
<P>
"Greenpeace is calling on Europe to switch subsidies from
fossil fuel and nuclear energy into solar technologies and energy
efficiency."
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said that with less than 650 million dollars the EU
and its member states could install the equivalent of one million
solar homes by 2010 which industry sources say would create 58,000
jobs and save two million tons of carbon dioxide emissions a
year.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Optimistic about Revising EU Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hague, May 20 (Xinhua) -- European Union foreign ministers
said on Tuesday that they were more optimistic of agreeing the
revision of the EU Treaty at the bloc's Amsterdam summit in
mid-June after narrowing their differences on several key issues.
</P>
<P>
"There are fewer problems and we have shed more light on
others, so they are more suitable for treatment," Dutch Foreign
Minister and current EU president Hans van Mierlo told a press
conference after the foreign ministers' informal meeting in The
Hague on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mr Van Mierlo said the meeting had made some progress in
establishing the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy(CFSP)
but acknowledged that difference remained on the issue of merging
the Western European Union(WEU) defense arm into the mainstream
EU.
</P>
<P>
EU heads of state and government are due to meet in the Dutch
seaside town of Noordwijk on Friday for an informal session to
give a final push for the Inter-Governmental Conference(IGC)
treaty review in order to have the IGC concluded successfully at
an Amsterdam summit on June 17-17.
</P>
<P>
Van Mierlo said that all member states had reacted positively
to an almost complete draft treaty prepared by The Netherlands,
but warned that a full draft would not be ready until early June.
</P>
<P>
"There is a degree of optimism that a positive result will be
achieved in Amsterdam," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But a great deal of work still needed to be done," he added,
referring particularly the strong opposition from Britain and the
four neutral state -- Ireland, Sweden, Austria and Finland, to the
EU-WEU merger.
</P>
<P>
The ministers have also discussed at the meeting how to
streamline the bloc's decision-making processes, diluting the
national veto with fewer areas requiring unanimity and
re-weighting the voting structure.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to strengthen the EU's procedure for agreeing
common foreign policies, with some member states suggesting that
the implementation of the Union's common foreign policies,
achieved by unanimity of the EU leaders, should be approved with
qualified-majority in the Council of Ministers.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Launch Major Review of Live Animal Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Labor government
announced here today that it would impose a major review of the
rules on exporting live animals to the other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture minister Elliot Morley was quoted as saying in a
statement issued early today that the latest move reflected public
concern about the welfare of the animals and criticism about the
current arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Morley stressed in the statement: "Where animals are exported
live, the public must have full confidence that the strictest
possible welfare rules are being applied to this trade."
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly we have ordered an urgent review of the
arrangements for ensuring that animals are rested, fed, watered
and cleared as fit prior to export in accordance with the law," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that the government was planning to
implement new European Union rules on animal transit, including
limits on journey time, that were agreed in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Professor Studies Impact of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A Case Western Reserve
University study shows children are being exposed to alarmingly
high levels of violence and, as a result, are suffering severe
psychological trauma.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by Mark Singer, a professor of social
work, and involved 2,244 third- through eighth-graders in
Cleveland public schools and a number of rural schools in Ohio.
The results were presented Tuesday during a symposium sponsored by
the Ohio Department of Mental Health, The United Press
International reported.
</P>
<P>
Singer said children who witness violence or who are victims of
it are up to 10 times more likely to suffer psychological
problems.
</P>
<P>
Singer said psychologists and social workers must intervene
early in young people's lives to help them deal with problems
arising from violence.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Since school is the gathering place for children, it
should be one of the first places where responsible adults talk
with them about (violence)."
</P>
<P>
Singer said he found both boys and girls with the highest
exposure to violence suffered seriously elevated levels of
psychological trauma compared with those exposed to the least
violence.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Kabila Fights for Idea of Congo for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Guo Ming)
</P>
<P>
KINSHASA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Kabila, who has changed
the name of the central African country of Zaire to the
Democratic Republic of Congo and declared himself head of state
of of the republic, has fought for the idea of a self-relied
Congo for decades.
</P>
<P>
His arrival at capital Kinshasa tonight marked a final victory
over his long-time rival of Mobutu Sese Seko, who was toppled by
the Alliance of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo-Zaire (LDFL) led by Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"My long years of struggle were like spreading fertilizer on a
field. But now it's time to harvest," said the strong, robust
rebel leader as he made a televised address to the nation on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, 56, heads the AFDL which was formed by four political
parties in the country. Its cutting edge is Banyamulenge ethnic
Tutsis who began the revolt in eastern Zaire in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
Known by followers as Mzee, the Swahili word for grand old
man, Kabila is the public point man for his alliance of four
political groups which was little known before formed on October
8, 1996 after they seized the first major eastern Zairean town of
Uvira.
</P>
<P>
They include the Popular Revolutionary Party (PRP) led by
Kabila himself, the National Council of Resistance for Democracy
(NCRD), the Revolutionary Movement for the Liberation of Zaire
(RMLZ), and the People's Democratic Alliance (PDA).
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea of our uprising is to form a new Congo which
has been devastated by the Mobutu regime," said Kabila's address
to the nation released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We should pursue self-reliance as our basic policy for
developing the Congo nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was Mobutu that gave the name of Zaire in 1965 when he came
to power following a military coup to topple the country's first
president Joseph Kasavubu.
</P>
<P>
A follower of Zaire's first Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba who
is passionate advocator of national unity regardless of ethnic
and regional differences, was murdered by secessionists under the
support of the United States.
</P>
<P>
It was also widely believed that Mobutu was behind Lumumba's
murder.
</P>
<P>
Although Kabila is from the mineral-rich Shaba Province in
southern Zaire, he has long been fighting against ethnicism and
regionalism in the country formed by over 250 ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"I call for national unity of Congo," this sentence could
repeatedly heard from him.
</P>
<P>
Although he lived for many years among the Banyamulenge Tutsis
in the Mulenge mountains south of Uvira, from where he planned
the uprising, Kabila also traveled a lot and made friends with
many leaders both in Africa and in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
He staged three armed revolts in eastern Zaire. All were
crushed by Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
And 36 years after the assassination of Lumumber, Kabila
started his fourth uprising in October 1996 when he led the
Banyamulenge, a Tutsi community of roughly 400,000 people,
resisted attempts of the Zairean government to expel them to
Rwanda, a land they left up to 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
This time, it took only seven months for Kabila, who had been
fighting Mobutu for three decades, to topple the Mobutu
government.
</P>
<P>
Well-educated, Kabila speaks perfect English despite coming
from Francophone Africa.
</P>
<P>
He is married with six children and one of them, Joseph, is
the alliance commander for the northern division which captured
the northeastern capital of Kisangani and southeast mineral
centre of Lubumbashi, Zaire's second largest city, and finally,
took over capital Kinshasa on May 17.

<HEADLINE> Albright Considers Trip to South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Tuesday that she was considering to visit South
Asia on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the independence
of India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Before her talks with Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub
Khan, Albright told reporters: "I am considering a trip to the
region. This is the 50th anniversary of independence and it seems
to be an appropriate time for a trip to be planned."
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state, however, did not give specific dates
for the possible trip.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India acquired independence in 1947 after Britain
ceded its colonial rule. But it created disputes over Kashmir,
leading to conflicts between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Indian and Pakistani leaders held talks in Maldives
on the disputes over Kashmir and the talks were said to have been
successful by all accounts.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the meeting between the Indian and Pakistani
leaders were "very important and useful" in improving the two
countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
"We would consider it very important that a dialogue between
India and Pakistan about the subject would be very useful and
terrific to resolve this. From what we've heard there seems to
be some potential progress," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said she would be seeking a briefing from Ayub Khan
on the outcome of the meeting during her talks with the
Pakistani foreign minister.
