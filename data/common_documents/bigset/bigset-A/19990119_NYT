   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SOMEBODY should tell the Rockets' center not to make the same
mistake all over again and start using his Visa card to pick up
meal tabs throughout the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Hakeem. Just like the last time at the 1996 Olympics,
Scottie Pippen says you're going to eat those guys for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Pippen hasn't said anything, since the legal wonks
from the NBA and the nitpickers of the players' union are still
mud-rasslin' over the language of the new collective-bargaining
agreement and the lockout remains officially in place.
</P>
<P>
   But when the padlock is finally sledgehammered off the door
later this week, Pippen will be leaving Chicago and landing in
Houston, once more giving the Rockets the tasty ingredient needed
to match their hungry championship appetite.
</P>
<P>
   History will note that Pippen, the No. 2 cog in the Bulls'
six-time NBA title-winning machine, will be obtained in a trade for
Roy Rogers and a second-round draft pick. Which likely means that
if anybody had ever had the notion of trying to swap with the Bulls
for Michael Jordan, it would likely have taken a package deal of
Gene Autry, Hopalong Cassidy, Wyatt Earp and The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance.
</P>
<P>
   This was precisely the right addition for the Rockets to make at
exactly this time because of the attributes Pippen brings. Not just
speed, size, smarts, a nose for tough defense and the additional
ability to run an offense from the forward position. He is also the
greatest complementary player in the history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen can both dominate and accommodate, characteristics that
are quite necessary if the Rockets are to pick themselves up out of
the pack of last year's first-round playoff losers and make a
championship run in this first, abbreviated season of the
post-Jordan era.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, he is nine years older than the top choice on the
Rockets' wish list, Antonio McDyess. But for just that reason, he
makes more sense for this team.
</P>
<P>
   For while there is no denying that the 24-year-old McDyess is an
abundant package of talent, he is learning his place in the game,
still trying to decide if he'll attempt to conquer the world on his
own or become the cornerstone of a great team.
</P>
<P>
   In McDyess, the Rockets were trying to have their proverbial
cake and eat it, too. They were seeking an impact player to vault
them back to the elite level right now and also start grooming
Olajuwon's eventual replacement as ``The Franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   But with this year's on-the-run training camp slated to be over
faster than a hiccup, there would be little time to assimilate a
young, raw core player into the Rockets' system.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while keeping in shape at Westside Tennis Club all through
the lockout, McDyess has expressed reservations about joining a
team with two veteran All-Stars in Olajuwon and Charles Barkley. A
low-post player himself, he was most concerned about minutes,
especially at crunch time, and fearful that when a game was on the
line, coach Rudy Tomjanovich would have him sitting on the bench in
deference to the graybeards.
</P>
<P>
   The danger was that the transition would not be so smooth
immediately, and with Olajuwon at 36 and Barkley to join him next
month, the Rockets can't afford to waste time. Their championship
window is closing. The time is now.
</P>
<P>
   On the fly, Pippen can fit as neatly as the right piece of a
jigsaw puzzle into a lineup with Olajuwon and the now-definitely
returning Barkley. In his two Dream Team stints in 1992 and 1996,
he played whatever role was needed and did anything that was asked.
In 11 seasons, Pippen did enough of everything with the Bulls to be
voted one of the NBA's 50 greatest players ever.
</P>
<P>
   In Pippen, the Rockets get another Hall of Famer to replace
Clyde Drexler, a slasher who will still take the ball to the hoop
and can stick the jumper. They team him with rookie Michael
Dickerson and get a transition game, two horses who can run and
finish a fast break. They get rebounds and much-needed help
starting the offense and making entry passes to Olajuwon and
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   With Pippen on hand, the Rockets' needs at point guard are not
so dire. Brent Price, Bryce Drew and Matt Maloney can spot up for
3-pointers like Steve Kerr and John Paxson in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A five-year, $67.2 million contract takes Pippen to the end of
Olajuwon's career, and then the Rockets can start over, maybe by
then with another championship flag to hang from a new arena. Make
no mistake: It puts the Rockets ahead of Utah and toe-to-toe with
the Lakers in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem and Scottie, together again, doing lunch. Somebody else
could pay.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MINNEAPOLIS _ The Minneapolis Star Tribune put out a special
playoff section Monday. In it were 15 advertisements by companies
selling Super Bowl packages.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a measly couple of thousand dollars, Vikings fans can get
round-trip air fare from Minneapolis to Miami, lodging and game
tickets. Of course, they'll be watching the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   What those advertisers never contemplated, especially the one
that advertised ``Vikings _ NFC Champions gear on sale after the
game,'' was that their team could lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to take some time for us to get credit,'' said
Atlanta linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who went to four Super Bowls
with the Buffalo Bills. ``People are going to say that we still
don't deserve to be in the Super Bowl. If we win the Super Bowl,
people are going to say we were lucky. But it all counts.''
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Vikings fans on the concourse were chanting,
``Super Bowl, Super Bowl.'' By the third quarter, most of the
stadium had joined in. And when Gary Anderson, the Vikings kicker
enjoying a perfect season, lined up late in the fourth quarter for
a routine 38-yard field goal that would likely clinch the game, the
stadium went nuts. But when that kick went wide left, jaws dropped
in astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   That quiet lasted until Morten Andersen lined up in overtime for
the same 38-yard kick to win the game for Atlanta 30-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I remember is the ball going through the uprights,''
Atlanta linebacker Jessie Tuggle said of Andersen's decisive field
goal. ``I can't remember one play I made, just one magic moment as
the ball went through the uprights. I knew when the crowd was
silent that it was good.''
</P>
<P>
   It will go down as one of the greatest of championship games,
considering not only the overtime but the fact the Falcons found
themselves trailing 20-7 late in the first half. It was a game that
included four turnovers, two by each team. Three of those figured
into the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that lent itself to armchair quarterbacking,
adding to the fun. Trailing 27-20 in the fourth quarter, the
Falcons passed up a field-goal try and failed to make a fourth-down
conversion. Those three points loomed large when they eventually
tied the game. And the Vikings, instead of trying to march to a
winning field goal while possessing two timeouts in the final
minute of regulation, were content to bend a knee and take their
chances in sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a game in which superstars were contained, forcing
others to step forward. Vikings Pro Bowl rookie Randy Moss was
limited to one touchdown and 75 yards receiving. Atlanta's Jamal
Anderson was held to 67 yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And if Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler hadn't convinced
skeptics with his steady play all season, he proved Sunday he can
win the big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good quarterback,'' tight end O.J. Santiago said. ``We
know that in Atlanta. If the rest of the country doesn't know it,
maybe they will after today.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-play, 71-yard drive to tie the score and the 10-play,
70-yard drive to set up Andersen's kick were proof Chandler belongs
in the Super Bowl. In all, he threw for 340 yards and three
touchdowns. He was never intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him after we went down there and tied the score, that
ranks right up there with any of the big-time quarterbacks,''
Falcons coach Dan Reeves said. ``He's done it with the pressure on
him, made some big-time throws, did it after being hurt from the
scramble (when Chandler came up limping after a nine-yard gain on
the game-tying drive), hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a performance worthy of John Elway, the master of the
comeback and the Falcons' opponent in the Super Bowl. Not
surprisingly, it was Elway who engineered the drive the last time a
championship game was sent into overtime. And coincidence or not,
it was Reeves who was coaching the Broncos at the time as Elway
engineered the 98-yard drive to tie Cleveland in the January 1987
AFC Championship Game, which the Broncos won in sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Chris that it was as good as Elway or any of them,''
Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The only question remaining is if Chandler and his team are as
good as Elway and his Broncos on Jan. 31.

DAY HAS ARRIVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three days after Cal State Northridge lost to
Idaho State, a devastating loss that cost the Matadors a football
playoff berth, cornerback Donnell Day was back at work.
</P>
<P>
   Back running. Back lifting.
</P>
<P>
   He did it not to get ready for next season but rather in hopes
he would get the type of message he received this weekend.
Organizers from the Hula Bowl called and invited Day to participate
in Saturday's senior all-star game in Kahului, Hawaii, at 1 p.m. on
ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a chance to play with a lot of guys you see
playing all the time,'' Day said Monday via telephone shortly after
arriving at his hotel. ``I want to show I can play with the big
dogs and this gives me an opportunity. Pretty much, I'm here to
show the scouts I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   In helping resurrect CSUN's football program, Day tied for the
team lead with three interceptions. He also had 32 tackles and was
second on the Matadors with six pass break-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Day, a 5-foot-10, 185-pounder from Morse High in San Diego, will
play for Michigan coach Lloyd Carr on the North squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get that,'' Day said. ``A friend of mine, Rashard Cook
from USC, is on the South team. We played together in high school
and he was looking for me, saying, `Hey, I thought we were going to
get to play together.' I guess not.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the game is Saturday, the most important aspect of Day's
weeklong Hawaii vacation begins today and runs through Friday.
That's when NFL scouts, stopwatches in hand, evaluate practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they come to watch the DBs and wide receivers go
one-on-one,'' said Day, who's been working out at Mesa Junior
College. ``I know I'm in good shape and I'm ready for this. I was
watching the Blue-Gray game and I said, `Hey, I can play with these
guys.' Now I get a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN coach Ron Ponciano spent the last two weeks speaking with
Hula Bowl representatives about getting Day into the game.
Originally, Day was an alternate, but after several players dropped
out, Day was placed on the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows where Northridge is starting to get to when you can
get a kid in an all-star game like that,'' CSUN offensive
coordinator Rob Phenicie said. ``It's great for exposure and it's
great for the kid. What's also nice is Donnell is a great student.
He's one of the higher GPAs on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Day, who played with the Matadors for three seasons, had a 3.8
GPA in the fall semester and has fulfilled his academic
requirements as a psychology major.

EAU BOY! 12-YEAR-OLD HOPES TO MAKE BIG SPLASH WITH COLOGNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will move in the ``n'' California news file.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tommy by Tommy Hilfiger?
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein's CK?
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren's Polo?
</P>
<P>
   Nope, it's Brendon, a scent created by 12-year-old entrepreneur
Brendon Clark of Reseda, an L.A.-area suburb.
</P>
<P>
   And Brendon's eau d'adolescence goes on sale today, with 10
percent of the proceeds to benefit Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.
A clean lemon-lime fragrance for boys that was inspired by some of
the trendiest men's scents on the market, Brendon is the end result
of a two-year project and the youngster's own savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started because my mom thought I wore too much
cologne,'' chuckles Brendon, a budding actor with several TV
commercial credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said you could always smell me coming, and finally
explained I wasn't supposed to douse myself with it. But I think
she also noticed it because I used to mix different brand names _ I
love Tommy Hilfiger and Polo _ and try to get my own special scent
so it would be different than the colognes the other boys were
wearing at school,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Since most preteen boys aren't known for wearing cologne or
starting their own business, Brendon's mother, Layne Clark, quickly
saw her son was, well, different.
</P>
<P>
   Once she realized her son was serious about making cologne on a
big-time scale, she seized the opportunity to have a son-mother
project. Said Clark, ``I've just helped by taking him to meet a
chemist and studying the art of fragrance making. But everything,
from the idea ... to the final formula ... to the frosted bottle it
comes in ... is all Brendon's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with the Los Angeles-based chemist was a thrill, but
also a frustrating experience for the youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chemist would keep mixing and experimenting and each time
I'd tell him what I liked or didn't like. We both got frustrated
and I think the chemist thought I was kinda picky,'' Brendon said.
``But I knew I'd know the scent when I smelled it. And finally,
about two months ago, I did. And I love it. And all my friends wear
it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides learning about perfume and chemistry, the seventh-grader
at Portola Middle School in Tarzana, an L.A.-area suburb, says he
also learned about business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were advising a friend who wanted to start his own
business, I'd tell him to ignore bad comments, keep focused and
don't give up your dreams even when your feelings are hurt,''
Brendon said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he hopes, Brendon will be in department stores sold right
next to the products of his role models Hilfiger and Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I designed it for myself, so it's meant for boys, but I think
men of all ages will like it. I already heard that a 50-year-old
guy liked it,'' said Brendon.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   Most people haven't gotten a whiff of Brendon yet, but
apparently it has a universal appeal, according to Terri Chapman,
special events coordinator for Childrens Hospital Foundation, the
fund-raising arm of the downtown medical institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very strong, masculine scent, like something my husband
would wear, but since it's being marketed by a boy for boys, I took
a bottle to one of the rehabilitation wards and I had about a dozen
children test it. They all liked it, and it was such a big hit that
we decided to endorse it,'' Chapman explained.
</P>
<P>
   Brendon chose the hospital as beneficiary of the cologne to
spread the health, so to speak: ``I thought I've had such good luck
in life that it would be nice to share it with some kids who needed
some.''
</P>
<P>
   That good fortune he's talking about includes his close-knit
family, and his burgeoning acting career. Currently you can see him
on TV in Kraft Parmesan Cheese, Nestle Crunch candy bars, and Hot
Wheels toy car commercials, but he'd like to get a spot on a weekly
show or a movie. ``Hopefully a comedy, since my heroes are Jim
Carrey and Adam Sandler,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's busy with school, soccer and sharing his talents
as a second-degree black belt in karate with his students at House
of Champions in Van Nuys, an L.A.-area suburb.
</P>
<P>
   When he's older, Brendon would like to attend the University of
California, Los Angeles, because it's got a great basketball team,
and then design fashions for boys and men. &QL;

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
DENVER _ When the Denver Broncos tangle with the Atlanta Falcons in
Super Bowl XXXIII, there will be enough soap-opera intrigue to
interest even the most casual fan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, the Broncos, making a sixth appearance, are trying to
become the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since the
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it probably will be the last game of quarterback John
Elway's career.
</P>
<P>
   And will Atlanta coach Dan Reeves avoid the dubious distinction
of joining Minnesota's Bud Grant and Buffalo's Marv Levy as the
only coaches to lose four Super Bowls?
</P>
<P>
   But enough about the football angles. Here's the real drama:
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves coached the Broncos, he gave Mike Shanahan his first
NFL job. When Oakland fired Shanahan early in his second season as
the Raiders' head coach, Reeves rehired him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the 1991 season, Reeves fired Shanahan for
``insubordination.'' Reeves thought Shanahan had become too close
to Elway and that they were stabbing him in the back and leaking
behind-the-scenes information to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were best friends,'' Shanahan said Sunday after Denver
defeated the New York Jets 23-10 in the AFC Championship Game.
``Dan's done a great job in Atlanta. What they've accomplished in
two seasons is a credit to Dan and his staff.''
</P>
<P>
   After Shanahan was fired, Elway said playing for Reeves was
``hell'' and considered retiring. Quarterback and coach didn't
speak unless it was absolutely necessary. After the 1992 season,
Broncos owner Pat Bowlen fired Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Elway was accused of giving Bowlen a him-or-me ultimatum,
something the owner never denied.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is Reeves _ the sentimental choice _ against
Shanahan/Elway/Bowlen. But don't expect anything but nice comments
when the Broncos and Falcons arrive in Miami on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's a great coach,'' Elway said. ``Atlanta did an
outstanding job against Minnesota, and we're going to have to play
a lot better if we hope to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we wanted this season was to get back to the Super Bowl
and have a chance to defend our (title).''
</P>
<P>
   While Denver returns to the Super Bowl, Atlanta makes its first
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the experience has to help us,'' said Elway, who has
started in four Super Bowls. ``Plus, I think we're a very confident
team. Part of that comes from winning the championship last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're also experienced enough to know what's in front of
us. Atlanta's a great team that's playing with a lot of confidence,
too. They've been very, very impressive. We know what they're
capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler has outplayed Elway in the
playoffs. Not only is Chandler playing in his first Super Bowl, but
this is the first time in his career that his team reached the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some of their game against the Vikings, and they were
great,'' Elway said, referring to Atlanta's 30-27 overtime win at
Minnesota in Sunday's NFC Championship Game. ``Their offense is
very explosive. Chris has been exceptional. I'm happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons are going to pull another upset as they did at
Minnesota, the first thing they have to do is to contain Broncos
running back Terrell Davis, who has been magnificent in the
playoffs after being named the NFL's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Davis rushed for 199 yards and two touchdowns in Denver's 38-3
victory over Miami in the divisional round. He followed that
performance with 167 yards and a touchdown against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrell's the best back in the league, one of the greatest
ever,'' Elway said. ``Knowing he's back there ready to take the
ball when he's called on makes me feel a lot more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The second thing the Falcons have to do is to run the ball
better than the Dolphins and Jets. In each game, Denver allowed
only 14 yards on 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was pretty maligned, especially near the end of
regular season,'' Elway said, ``but you can't say enough about how
great they've played in the playoffs. They've been awesome. They've
really only given up two field goals in two games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets scored their touchdown after a blocked punt gave them
the ball at the Denver one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense completely shut down the run in the last two games
and forced turnovers to shorten the field for us,'' Elway said.
``They're playing well at the right time, and we're going to need
them for one more game.''

KINGS LOSE OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed logical to assume that Kings general manager Dave
Taylor would feel a sense of relief at Sunday's news that the
Vancouver Canucks had traded Pavel Bure to the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the seven-player deal of which Bure was the
centerpiece meant the questions would stop and the rumors would
end. Bure would not be coming to the Kings and Taylor no longer
would need to keep issuing denials to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, as Taylor prepared to return to Los Angeles after
attending an American Hockey League game on the East Coast, he
admitted he felt no relief at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bure is a superstar, there's no denying that,'' Taylor said,
not needing to add that the Kings are looking for a superstar
forward of their own who would put pucks in the net, games in the
victory column and fans in the seats next season at the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Over recent months, as Bure held out in a dispute with Canucks
management, Taylor discussed a variety of trade possibilities with
his Vancouver counterpart, Brian Burke _ trades in which several
players from each team would exchange uniforms, and trades in which
the Kings would give up several players and only receive the
27-year-old right wing known as the ``Russian Rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got close to an exact fit,'' Taylor said, adding that
he spoke with Burke as recently as a few days ago in one last,
ultimately unsuccessful stab at working out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   So Bure is a Panther and Taylor has stayed the course on his
methodical rebuilding program, while acknowledging the need to add
one large piece to the puzzle (Calgary's Theo Fleury?).
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in seeing the Kings'
marquee-player-who-wasn't, Pavel Bure and the Panthers come to town
on March 20. For those interested in seeing a marquee player garbed
in a Kings uniform, you'll have to stay tuned at least a little
longer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Who won?: If you subscribe to the theory that the team
getting the best player in a deal always wins the trade, then the
Panthers fleeced the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Florida not only got Bure but a solid defenseman in Bret Hedican
and a 1997 10th overall draft choice in defenseman Brad Ference.
But Burke is hoping that in time, the Bure trade will be remembered
as the deal that brought the Canucks three important pieces for
their future.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver received 22-year-old defenseman Ed Jovanovski (who's
had an up-and-down career since being chosen first overall in
1994), tough left wing Mike Brown (the 20th player chosen in 1997)
and goaltending prospect Kevin Weekes, who is 23 and represents the
Canucks' goaltending future. The Canucks also got 34-year-old
center Dave Gagner in the trade.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready Freddie: One of the best and most overlooked free-agent
signings of last summer was the Mighty Ducks' addition, for $2
million over two years, of defenseman Fredrik Olausson, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Not including Monday night's game against Pittsburgh, Olausson
had scored nine goals _ identical to the combined output of the
nine defensemen who have played for the Kings this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a big difference when the defensemen jump into the
offense,'' the Ducks' Teemu Selanne said. ``It also gives us more
room if the other team has to worry about five players instead of
three.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Smart decision: The Kings announced that at the Staples
Center, unlike many other new arenas around the NHL, they will not
use seamless glass, which is dangerous for players.
</P>
<P>
   __ St. Louis slasher: The NHL's All-Star format _ North America
against the World _ has the unusual effect of pitting
regular-season teammates against each other. As an example, St.
Louis placed forward Pavol Demitra on the World team and defenseman
Chris Pronger will play for North America.
</P>
<P>
   Demitra was asked if he was concerned that Pronger might slash
him during the game and said, ``He does that in practice anyway. He
slashes me every time he's got the chance. You go by him, he
slashes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronger replied, ``He hasn't felt the game slash yet. The
practice slash and the game slash are two different slashes. The
practice slash is just a warning that I could possibility get you
if I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz will
decide on June 22 whether or not to lift his injunction against the
Pittsburgh Penguins shopping themselves to other cities. . . .
Dallas center Joe Nieuwendyk was sent home from the Stars' recent
six-game trip to have fluid drained from both his knees. &QL;

30 years all figured out. ``In my dreams,'' he said, ``I want to be
like (Red Wings coach) Scotty Bowman back there, coaching until I'm
65 or 70 years old. I wish I could be good enough at this to be
like Scotty and be able to do this my whole life. What a fulfilling
life that would be.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader, defied
NATO on Monday and threatened a fragile cease-fire when he ordered
the expulsion of a top American diplomat who had blamed the Serbs
for the mass killing of more than 40 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
province last week.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the order for the expulsion of William Walker,
Serbian forces refused entry to a United Nations war crimes
prosecutor who arrived at the border to investigate the killings.
</P>
<P>
   And despite warnings from NATO, Serbian forces on Monday once
again attacked the area surrounding Racak, the village where the
massacre took place last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's acts of defiance put the Clinton administration into a
difficult position of deciding whether the expulsion of Walker, who
heads a monitoring mission in Kosovo, would mean pulling out 700
unarmed monitors who have been trying to enforce a cease-fire in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the monitors, who are under the auspices of the
Organization for Co-operation and Security in Europe, would mean
the formal collapse of the cease-fire and the almost certain
outbreak of new hostilities between the ethnic Albanian majority
and Serbian forces in the province.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Walker, a former U.S. ambassador to El Salvador,
traveled to the massacre site and saw the dead and mutilated
victims. He called their deaths a ``crime against humanity.'' On
Monday, the Yugoslav authorities accused him of being an
``undesirable person'' and told him to leave Serbia within 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The killings also brought Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor of
the war crimes tribunal, to the region, but Serbian border guards
refused to let her cross into Serbia. Arbour, who has been denied
visas in the past, turned up at the border post between Macedonia
and Kosovo, seeking to collect evidence from the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Two top NATO military officials, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United
States and Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, were scheduled to meet on
Tuesday with Milosevic in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the two men would be telling Milosevic that
he had to take seriously the warnings made on Sunday by NATO that
he must restrain his forces and reduce their numbers to levels
agreed to last October. The two generals will also try to persuade
Milosevic to back down from his order to expel Walker, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's latest ultimatums were a reprise of past behavior.
During and after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, he
consistently broke promises and cease-fires, mounted assaults and
then backed off at the last moment under threat from the NATO
allies.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said Monday evening
that Milosevic had no right to choose who would head the monitoring
mission. ``It is unacceptable for the Serbs to try to vilify the
monitors and expel those who are simply telling the truth at what
they saw,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government reacted fast and furiously to what it saw
as the audacity of Walker to condemn the Serbs so openly. Walker's
criticisms carried extra force because he made them at the site of
the massacre in the village of Racak where mutilated bodies were
found with their eyes gouged out, faces slashed and, in one case,
decapitated.
</P>
<P>
   The official news agency of the Yugoslav government, Tanjug,
accused Walker of ``flagrantly'' violating his mandate. Other
government sponsored newspapers said that ethnic Albanians had
staged the massacre and accused Walker of being a stooge for them.
</P>
<P>
   To make clear how the United States felt about the strong
language the state-controlled Yugoslav media used to describe
Walker, the U.S. delegate at the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Vienna, David T. Johnston, replied in kind on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He told the organization that Milosevic ``aspires to take his
place beside this century's chief perpetrator of the big lie.'' He
added that the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, also ``yields
no ground to Goebbels as the big lie's propagandist.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they took some heart from the
announcement by Russia that urged Milosevic to reverse his decision
on Walker. Russia has been Serbia's strongest supporter but is also
a member of the OSCE, the 54-nation body that Walker represents in
Kosovo, and defended the organization's mandate.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States failed to win Russian support in the
United Nations Security Council Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The council, in an unscheduled session, strongly condemned the
massacre and demanded that the Serbian government rescind its
expulsion order, but members were not able to agree on an
unequivocal demand for an immediate investigation by the chief
prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia. Nor could council members, facing Russian opposition,
agree to pinpoint the Serbs for blame, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed crisis in Kosovo comes after several months of
inattention by the international community and after three weeks of
provocative military actions by the Serbs and the ethnic Albanian
guerrilla force, the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The recent developments in Kosovo have also been overshadowed by
the administration's preoccupation with the impeachment hearings
and, on the foreign front, with its concentration on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo was an autonomous region before Milosevic rescinded that
status a decade ago. Most ethnic Albanians, who make up more than
90 percent of Kosovo's population, want complete independence, and
many of them believe that the only way to achieve it is through
violent rebellion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a day before the massacre became public, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright warned that the fragile Kosovo agreement
brokered last fall by the envoy Richard Holbrooke, was about to
fall apart, according to an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told the White House, the Pentagon and other agencies
that the administration faced a `decision point' in Kosovo, the
official said. She described the mission headed by Walker as good
at ``crisis management'' _ such as winning the release of Serb
soldiers held as hostages by the guerrillas _ but insufficient for
addressing the long term. She acknowledged that negotiations on a
political settlement were not moving forward. She described the
Serbs as obstructionist and the Albanian politicians as fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had three choices Albright told her
colleagues, according to this account. She summarized them as:
stepping back, muddling through or taking decisive steps, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary did not advocate immediate reconsideration of air
strikes or the insertion of NATO troops to keep the two sides
apart, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   She told others in the administration that Milosevic needed to
realize that he faced a real potential for NATO action. If he did
not get that message, he would not make any concessions, she
argued.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels on Sunday stopped
short of reviving plans for NATO strikes against the Serbs in
Kosovo and Serbia itself. Air strikes were in their final stages of
activation last fall but were called off when Holbrooke completed
an agreement with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said there had been little talk in the
last few days of air strikes, but it was unclear what would happen
if Milosevic insisted on expelling Walker.
</P>
<P>
   If Walker leaves, it is likely that the administration will call
for the departure of the 700 unarmed monitors. ``A consensus is
emerging of one out, all out,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   There is likely to be another confrontation over Arbour, as
well, an administration official said. Arbour announced in Skopje,
the capital of Macedonia, that she would make another attempt to
get into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the likelihood of her finding useful evidence dropped
sharply Monday after the mutilated bodies were moved from the
village to the morgue in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration faced the problems over Walker and Ms.
Arbour, Milosevic's Serbian forces continued their attack on the
village of Racak. Artillery fire hit the village from Serbian
positions on the surrounding hills, diplomatic observers reported.

COURTNALL EXPECTED TO BE BACK TONIGHT

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When the Los Angeles Kings played the
Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday, they were without three of their
fastest skaters: wingers Glen Murray, Craig Johnson and Russ
Courtnall, all of them ailing. And with that trio absent, the lack
of team speed played a big role in a 5-1 setback.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight when the Kings play host to the Colorado Avalanche, some
of that speed is expected to be restored to the lineup with the
return of Courtnall, who has been sidelined for two months with a
broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team couldn't skate with that team,'' coach Larry Robinson
said, referring to the Penguins. ``You get frustrated chasing those
guys all over the ice, and then you get impatient. (The Penguins)
had speed on every line. Speed today is what this game is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtnall said he feels close to 100 percent, and that he has
been assured that any lingering pain in his ankle is from scar
tissue, not because his ankle hasn't fully healed.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Kings have swift players even with him, Murray and
Johnson out of the lineup. But Courtnall said speed is an element
of which a team can't have an overabundance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed makes the other team have less time and makes them move
the puck quicker, maybe to an area they don't want,'' said
Courtnall, expected to skate on a line with Olli Jokinen and Luc
Robitaille. ``And with at least one quick guy on each line, it
helps with forechecking and makes for a balanced attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Fiset is expected to start in goal tonight and
defenseman Steve Duchesne is expected to play after missing one
game with back spasms.

 Neuheisel brings Gilbertson back to Husky coaching staff  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Back slaps and belly laughs filled the Washington
athletic facilities Monday as popular Keith Gilbertson returned for
his third tour of duty with the Husky football program, hired as
assistant head coach and offensive line coach.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson, 50, agreed to join Rick Neuheisel's staff Sunday, a
few days after Neuheisel surprised him with a phone call and job
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has been special for me,'' said Gilbertson,
standing in a hallway leading to the coaches' offices. ``It worked
out. I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive architect of the UW's 1991 national title team,
Gilbertson long has been a fan favorite. Even before Jim Lambright
was fired on Dec. 30 and replaced by Neuheisel, internet users were
calling for Gilbertson's return to the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Snohomish native spent the last three seasons with the
Seahawks as tight ends coach. He started looking for work on Dec.
28, when Dennis Erickson was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, Gilbertson had no prospects. He said a return
to Washington was highly unlikely, as was following Erickson to
Oregon State. He was willing to relocate, figuring he would land
another NFL job.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel apparently is not one to pass up a feel-good
opportunity. First he announced the Huskies would return to their
traditional gold helmets. Next he hired Randy Hart and Wayne Moses,
holdovers from Lambright's coaching staff. Now he has Gilbertson, a
direct link to the Don James coaching regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that makes this place so special is the
tradition,'' Gilbertson said. ``I know I've been away from it for
awhile, but nobody knows more about it than me. I grew up here. I
think I bring some experience back here, good and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson was either UW offensive line coach or offensive
coordinator in 1989-91, leaving when California hired him as head
coach. He coached the Bears for four seasons, guiding his second
Cal team to a 9-4 season, which included a 37-3 Alamo Bowl victory
over Iowa. He was fired in 1995 when his next two teams went 4-7
and 3-8, giving him a 20-26 overall ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Erickson, Gilbertson was Idaho's head coach in
1986-88. He guided the Vandals to a 28-9 mark, earning Big Sky
coach of the year honors during his final season.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson's first coaching stint at Washington came in 1976,
when he was a graduate assistant for James' second Husky team. He
also was an assistant coach for Western Washington, Utah State,
Idaho and the now-defunct USFL's Los Angeles Express.
</P>
<P>
   He and Neuheisel became acquainted when both were in the Pac-10
together, Gilbertson at Cal and Neuheisel at UCLA, his alma mater,
as quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him a long time and always liked him,'' Gilbertson
said. ``I'm surprised and I'm flattered. I always felt good about
being here, and always wanted to be here. It's a real good deal for
Keith Gilbertson.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gilbertson was reclaiming an office on campus, his fellow
UW coaches were hosting a visit by prize running back recruit, Paul
Arnold, according to Arnold's high school coach, Kennedy's Bob
Bourgette.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold has narrowed his choices to Washington, Notre Dame,
Michigan, UCLA and Colorado. He is such a high recruiting priority,
Arnold will be visited at Kennedy this week alone by the following
head coaches: Notre Dame's Bob Davie, Michigan's Lloyd Carr and
UCLA's Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Though out of the running, Nebraska and Oregon also have
requested school visits this week with Arnold, who is considering
making his college choice known in a live television broadcast
shown by Fox Northwest cable.

WIND AND RAIN DISRUPT TRAVEL AND DAMAGE BUILDINGS
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS grafs 2,8,9,10,11 for updates on damage and airport
delays.)   (bl)  
By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fierce winds and lashing rains swept through New Jersey on the
leading edge of a cold front Monday, shearing roofs off buildings
and causing power failures that left more than 10,000 New Jersey
train commuters stalled in their tracks during the evening rush.
</P>
<P>
   The storms caused several-hour delays and brief shutdowns at all
three major airports, and cut off power to more than 10,000 New
Jersey homes, most of which had their lights back on by late
evening. The power failures also forced the shutdown of PATH train
service between Newark and Jersey City for 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Between 5:20 p.m. and 7 p.m., 15 Amtrak trains on the Northeast
Corridor line were stranded, as were at least 20 trains on New
Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast and Raritan Valley lines,
railroad officials said. Service was restored by 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At the Windsor Industrial Park in Washington Township in Mercer
County, 10 miles northeast of Trenton, a powerful wind peeled back
the sheet-metal roofs of several buildings and caused one
cinder-block building to crack, said Michael McCloskey, the park's
property manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very loud bang,'' McCloskey said, ``and then the
ceiling tiles were rattling. You could just feel the negative
pressure. That's when things started to fly around.''
</P>
<P>
   Car windows blew out from the pressure, McCloskey said, and
other cars were damaged by flying debris.
</P>
<P>
   In Cherry Hill, N.J., near Camden, a concrete wall was blown
down, part of the roof of the Children's Discovery Museum was torn
off, and several buildings in an industrial park sustained roof
damage, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in Cherry Hill and Washington Township described the
winds as tornadolike. Bob Wanton, a meteorologist with the National
Weather Service in Mount Holly, N.J., said that while no tornadoes
were confirmed, winds probably exceeded 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Rainfall from the storms was heavy, with parts of western New
Jersey receiving up to 1.5 inches of rain before the front passed
through about 6 p.m., but most of the region received less than an
inch, meteorologists said. Temperatures dropped 10 to 15 degrees
after the front passed through, and skies began to clear.
</P>
<P>
   At Newark, Kennedy and La Guardia Airports, arriving and
departing flights were frequently delayed between 11:30 a.m. and 9
p.m., some by more than two hours, Federal Aviation Administration
officials said. Airports along the East Coast from Boston to
Philadelphia also reported delays.
</P>
<P>
   Ground transportation was also disrupted. Emergency shuttle
buses were pressed into service at the Port Authority Bus Terminal
in Manhattan and in Newark and Hoboken, N.J., to move people whose
trains were stranded.

NEW JERSEY LOSES BET ON ITS JETS   
 LOOKING FOR LIBBY

   NEW JERSEY LOSES BET ON ITS JETS
</P>
<P>
   It was only a playoff game. But the Jets-Broncos game on Sunday
had some officials making the kinds of ``my state's team is better
than your state's team'' bets that they usually leave for the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe SEN. CHARLES E. SCHUMER of New York will pay up on the way
to the impeachment trial or the State of the Union Address. He bet
SEN. WAYNE ALLARD &UR;  &LR; of Colorado a cheesecake. (If the Jets had won,
Allard would have had to give Schumer a T-bone steak.)
</P>
<P>
   So much for the under $25 category.
</P>
<P>
   In the over $25 category, GOV. CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN of New
Jersey bet GOV. BILL OWENS of Colorado a weekend at the Jersey
Shore or a weekend at a Colorado ski resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``No plans to take her up on that in the foreseeable future,''
said DICK WADHAMS, a spokesman for Owens. ``Bill just got
inaugurated last week, and his hands are full establishing his new
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Whitman referred to the team as ``our Jets,'' noting that
their home field is at the New Jersey Meadowlands. But a spokesman
for GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI &UR;  &LR; said, ``They have `N.Y.' on their
uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and New York City MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI placed no
bets. ``The governor grew up watching the Jets train in his
hometown of Peekskill and was keenly interested in the game,'' said
his spokesman, PATRICK McCARTHY, ``but we weren't able to work out
a bet with Owens' office.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Jets did not get much of a boost from RICHARD
DEFEO'S water.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo sells ``superoxygenated spring water.'' His company,
Oxygen8, takes water from the Catskills and adds 8 to 10 times the
normal amount of oxygen, then distributes the water in coolers with
built-in compressors that keep the oxygen levels high. Drinking it,
he said, makes one feel energized, particularly if one has to spend
an afternoon running, passing, kicking and colliding with heavily
padded opponents in a high-altitude place like Mile High Stadium in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   His salesmen tried to get the Jets to buy some Oxygen8 early in
the season. The Jets said thanks but no thanks, or words to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Jets realized they were going to Denver. DAVID PRICE,
their head trainer, called the company and ordered 50 gallons. ``He
said: `Wouldn't it be a good idea to have your water for this
Denver game? It's at 5,500 feet,''' DeFeo said. ``Of course.
Denver, it's an oxygen-depleted environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The company sent along hand pumps (instead of water coolers that
could tip over). ``They obviously couldn't accommodate having a
water cooler on the sidelines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Could they have drunk all 50 gallons during the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have been enough left over to douse BILL
PARCELLS,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR LIBBY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ GOV. PATAKI seemed so alone when he walked into the
Winter Antiques Show, at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue
at 67th Street, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked if he was considering buying anything, he
said, ``I need a press person here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said, ``I'm looking for Libby.'' His wife, LIBBY PATAKI,
was the honorary patron of the show.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 2,000-year-old terra cotta horse.
</P>
<P>
   The important word here is ``was.'' The 41-inch-tall statue
tumbled off its table in the booth of HELEN C. FIORATTI, a dealer
at the antiques show, on Thursday and broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were only two or three in the world,'' Mrs. Fioratti
said. One of the others sold recently in England for (PS)135,000,
or $222,723. Mrs. Fioratti declined to discuss the value of the one
she had, except to say, ``We weren't asking that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is in the hands of a restorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was standing there nicely,'' she said. ``Then it started
listing. I didn't focus; I was talking to people. It was awful.''

PIPPEN HEADED TO ROCKETS, SOURCES SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
The dismantling of a dynasty continues as several NBA sources
confirmed last night the Chicago Bulls expect to trade seven-time
All-Star forward Scottie Pippen to the Houston Rockets once the
lockout is officially lifted later this week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pippen, Michael Jordan's running mate during the Bulls' six
championships this decade, will apparently sign a five-year
contract worth $67.2 million with Chicago, then be sent to Houston
for forward Roy Rogers and a second-round draft pick in 1999. The
deal, which will pay Pippen $10.6 million this season, is allowable
under the league's new collective bargaining agreement because
Houston has enough room to fit Pippen under its salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it's done, and it looks like Houston has
themselves a championship-caliber team,'' said one NBA team
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bulls general manager Jerry Krause managed to salvage
something for Pippen _ albeit not much _ the move is another sign
that the three-time defending champions will instead be fighting to
stay out of the lottery this season. Jordan announced his
retirement last week, starting center Luc Longley is expected to
sign a contract with the Phoenix Suns, backup guard Steve Kerr is
close to a deal with the San Antonio Spurs and free-agent forward
Dennis Rodman is also unlikely to return to the Bulls since they
won't be considered among the league's elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls could have offered Pippen a contract of $14 million
this season, and he hinted last week that he would stay in Chicago.
However, the combination of a soured relationship with Krause and a
new direction with coach Tim Floyd made the championship
cornerstone expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, 33, averaged 19 points and five rebounds per game last
season, but had off-season back surgery for an injury that limited
his productivity in June's NBA Finals. He is considered one of the
league's most versatile offensive players and among its top
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   His addition allows the Rockets to minimize the loss of Clyde
Drexler, who retired after last season to coach the University of
Houston. Since Pippen's acquisition is also likely to motivate
free-agent forward Charles Barkley to return, the Rockets could
become a contender in the lockout-shortened '99 season by sporting
a front line of Pippen at small forward, Barkley at power forward
and Hakeem Olajuwon at center. Pippen is expected to be in uniform
when the Rockets play the Spurs in an exhibition Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The league's other two most prominent free agents are also
effected by Pippen's move. Forward Antonio McDyess, who immediately
crossed the Rockets off his list, will now decide between the
Phoenix Suns and Denver Nuggets, and forward Tom Gugliotta has
narrowed his choices to the Nuggets or Minnesota Timberwolves.

WOMAN DENIED TENURE GETS $12.7 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A jury has awarded $12.7 million to a former assistant professor
of chemistry who was denied tenure at Trinity College, a verdict
that some educators call the biggest by far for a tenure case in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, made up of four women and two men, decided on Thursday
that the college was guilty of sexual discrimination in denying
tenure to Leslie E. Craine, 55, and awarded her $671,000 for wage
losses, $2 million in damages, $4 million for emotional distress
and $6 million for punitive damages. The two-month-long trial was
held in Superior Court in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Craine had been on a tenure track for a professorship in
organic chemistry at the private, liberal arts college in Hartford.
But after she was denied tenure in 1993, and lost her job the
following year, she filed the sexual discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy about the verdict and I was kind of astounded at
the award figure,'' Mrs. Craine said in a telephone interview
Monday from her home in Windsor, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   She now teaches general chemistry courses, part time, at Central
Connecticut State University.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain whether the jury's award will be reduced.
Trinity plans to appeal the verdict, said Felix J. Springer, a
lawyer with Day, Berry &AMP; Howard in Hartford, which represents the
college.
</P>
<P>
   And if previous cases are an indication, the ultimate award may
be whittled down to five or six figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of the ball park,'' said Jordan E. Kurland, associate
general secretary of the American Association of University
Professors, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can recall one or two cases where the jury award was in the
seven figures, but they didn't end that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Trinity's tenure system had been viewed by Kurland and many
other academicians as being among the fairest.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other institutions, which let assistant professors
toil for years without formal feedback, at Trinity tenure-track
professors are reviewed by tenured professors in their respective
departments and given report cards every two years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If a candidate is making good progress, the recommendations are
glowing; if not, suggestions are offered on what more needs to be
done. By the candidate's sixth, and, usually final, year under
scrutiny, the last evaluation should not be much of a shock.
</P>
<P>
   And those who earn the recommendation of their departments are
then subject to review by a university-wide panel that includes the
college president, the dean of faculty and three faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Craine, who was hired in 1987 into a department that had
five tenured male professors, received unanimous recommendations
during her three evaluations, according to Jacques J. Parenteau,
her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   She had received a teaching award. And she had earned praise
from her peers for her published work in developing a method to
determine more clearly the chemical properties of various alcohols.
</P>
<P>
   But the college's tenure review committee rejected her case, 4
to 1.
</P>
<P>
   According to Springer, Mrs. Craine, while a fine teacher, did
not do enough scholarly or original research to merit tenure.
</P>
<P>
   And while the department recommended her unanimously, it did so,
in the opinion of the committee, without the effusiveness typical
of most tenure-worthy candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read between the lines, there was a lot of lukewarm
stuff at best,'' Springer said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began in November and was at times testy. The jury
took two-and-a half days to reach its verdict.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, the college sought to have a mistrial
declared, saying, among other things, that the judge gave incorrect
instructions to the jury and issued problematic evidentiary
rulings.
</P>
<P>
   The college also vigorously defended its record of gender
equality. Currently, half of the faculty are women and one-third of
the tenured professors are women.
</P>
<P>
   During the eight-year period that Mrs. Craine taught at Trinity,
Springer said, every other female who was up for tenure received
it. Two people were denied: one male and Mrs. Craine.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Craine's lawyers, though, countered that two other
candidates who were granted tenure when she was not had inferior
academic records.
</P>
<P>
   And she received the unwavering support of the chemistry
department, which took the unusual step of saying that it had not
been effective enough in selling her strong points.

NEW RULES PROPOSED FOR MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS ON MENTALLY ILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state advisory panel has proposed new rules that would allow
medical experiments involving some risk to be performed on mentally
ill patients and others incapable of giving consent.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules have caused concern among some advocates for
the disabled, who said they did not go far enough in protecting the
rights of such patients, including those suffering from Alzheimer's
disease and schizophrenia in state-sponsored psychiatric
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, which were reported in The New York Post on
Sunday, are contained in a report compiled by an advisory panel on
human subject research that was convened by the State Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Lowenkron, a lawyer with the advocacy group Lawyers for the
Public Interest, said the plan had loopholes that could lead to
riskier experiments than should be allowed on patients incapable of
consenting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Ms. Lowenkron's group and other advocates won a lawsuit
on behalf of mentally ill patients over the existing state rules on
such experiments. In a decision that forced the cancellation of at
least 10 research projects, a New York state appeals court found
that the rules did not adequately protect people who, because of
age or illness, could not give informed consent to take part. The
decision focused particularly on experiments that might pose a
health risk without providing any direct benefit to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers defended those rules, saying that the only way to
test drugs intended for treatment of severe mental illness or
Alzheimer's disease was on patients with those disorders, many of
whom lack the capacity to consent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules that were struck down, researchers could use
mental patients in such experiments with the approval of
``surrogates'' like friends or family members.
</P>
<P>
   Under new rules proposed by the advisory group, the state Health
Department would establish three levels of risk for human
experiments: minimal risk, minor increase over minimal risk and
more than minor increase over minimal risk. The ethics board of
each institution would determine which category an experiment fell
into.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowenkron said she was not so much concerned about the
minimal risk category because the dangers to the patient were so
low. She said there were strong protections in the greatest risk
category because patients could only be enrolled if they had agreed
to take part in the experiment before falling ill or had designated
someone as their proxy.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lowenkron said the middle category could make it too
easy to experiment on mentally ill and disabled patients because
they could be placed in the experiment by a court, guardian, family
member or close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a loophole which they could drive a truck through,''
she said. ``I'm not imputing ill motive, but I'm concerned that
this is now going to be just a convenient way to relabel that which
was considered very risky to the middle category.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Herbert Pardes, the chairman of the advisory group and
the dean of the faculty of medicine at Columbia University's
College of Physicians and Surgeons, defended the report, saying the
13 advisory panel members strived hard for balance. ``We're
interested in safeguarding people's rights but also making sure
that good, important research was not blocked,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sherry Grenz, an advisory group member who is the Albany chapter
president of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill of New York
State, agreed. Ms. Grenz said that in the past, when there were
only two categories of risk, minimal and great, researchers were
often discouraged from doing research. ``I believe research is our
hope for the future and so do many advocates,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Department will receive public comments on the
task force report until March 1.
</P>
<P>
   John Cardinal O'Connor expressed concern about the draft in his
homily during his annual right-to-life Mass at St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in no way even remotely to impute bad faith or evil
intentions to any of these researchers in our state, to anyone in
the Department of Health in our state,'' he said. ``But every one
of us perhaps could profit by a periodic reminder that much of what
was done under the Nazi regime under Hitler began long before with
the experiments of psychiatrists and other medical persons on
people who are psychologically incapacitated or otherwise
vulnerable.''

Never underestimate the lure of a champion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets completed a deal Monday to acquire six-time NBA
champion Scottie Pippen when Pippen decided Houston, the only team
to interrupt the Chicago Bulls' run of titles, gave him the best
chance to win a crown beyond the shadow of Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets thrust themselves back into the championship race by
arranging a stunningly one-sided deal. Agent Jimmy Sexton told the
Bulls that Pippen would allow a sign-and-trade deal only to
Houston, according to several sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to thank the Chicago Bulls, the great people of
the city of Chicago, and all my teammates for 11 wonderful
seasons,'' Pippen said in a statement released by Sexton. ``I would
also like to personally thank the Bulls for helping me through this
period of free agency. I wish them the best, because that is what
Chicago deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   By arranging for the Bulls to sign Pippen, 33, and then trade
him here, the Rockets will acquire the seven-time All-Star at the
official end of the NBA lockout, now scheduled for Wednesday. Until
then, everything is on hold.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets will send third-year forward Roy Rogers, acquired
with two draft picks from Toronto for Kevin Willis, and Vancouver's
second-round pick after either this season or the 1999-2000
campaign (the Lakers have the first option on the Grizzlies' next
two second-round picks) to the Bulls in exchange for Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the Rockets a championship-caliber team,'' said
recent Rocket Eddie Johnson, presently a free agent. ``Obviously,
with the health of Dream (Hakeem Olajuwon) and the re-signing of
Charles (Barkley), this has elevated them back to a contender,
especially in a short season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is definitely the best all-around player in the league with
Michael Jordan retiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets officials are not permitted to comment on any
transactions or about free agents other than their own until the
collective-bargaining agreement is finalized.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, sources confirmed Monday, had been working on
sign-and-trade deals with the Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers
that would have brought them more players. But those deals were
scotched at Pippen's insistence that he would sign only if traded
to the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had also been pursuing free agent Antonio McDyess,
who scratched them from his list as they moved their concentration
to Pippen. As of Monday evening, McDyess still had not reached a
decision on where he wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen will sign a five-year, $67.2 million contract, with an
additional $15 million available through incentives. The trade of
Rogers, who will make $862,560 this season, allows the Rockets to
pay Pippen $10.6 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   Because he first re-signed with the Bulls, Pippen, under the new
NBA bargaining agreement, is eligible for annual raises of 12.5
percent. Had he signed as a free agent, the maximum raise each
season would have been 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls and Rockets are permitted to trade players whose
salaries do not match, because both teams are under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also puts the Rockets, with only three signed veterans
and an exhibition game to play Saturday, in a vastly improved
position to complete their roster and make them a more attractive
team to rejoin.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen would fill the Rockets' salary-cap space, meaning they
could sign their own free agents _ Barkley, Johnson, Matt Maloney,
Othella Harrington, Mario Elie and Matt Bullard _ as Bird
exceptions beyond the limits of the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley has said he would return to the Rockets if they brought
in either Pippen or McDyess. Johnson, Harrington, Maloney and
Bullard have said their preference is to return to the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Elie is seeking a two- or three-year contract with a contender,
a deal longer than the Rockets are likely to offer, and is expected
to sign with the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Rockets are below the salary cap, as needed to
acquire Pippen, they will this year lose the $1 million salary-cap
exception and the $1.75 million ``middle class'' exception that
could have been used for other teams' free agents. But once over
the cap with the signing of Pippen and their own free agents, they
will be permitted to sign outside free agents to the NBA minimum,
as much as $1 million this season for a 10-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle SuperSonics made the 6-7, 228-pound Pippen the fifth
player taken in the 1987 draft and immediately traded the Central
Arkansas product to the Bulls for Olden Polynice and a second-round
pick. A two-time Olympic gold medalist, Pippen has averaged 18
points, 6.8 rebounds and 5.3 assists over an 11-year career,
numbers he has virtually duplicated in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockets, Pippen's ability to run an offense and push a
fast break will likely help the team take advantage of the
athleticism of rookies Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley and
veterans Harrington and, when healthy, Rodrick Rhodes. Pippen's
ability to penetrate could help shooters Bullard, Maloney, Brent
Price and rookie Bryce Drew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopefully looking forward to playing with Scottie,''
Harrington said. ``If you look at it, it makes the team that much
more athletic. Scottie can do a lot of things _ push the ball up on
the break, handle running plays, give Matt and Brent the
opportunity to play to their strengths to spot up and shoot the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of Scottie is tremendous. He gives so many things
on the court _ his ability to defend, post up, score, pass. Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Many around the league are likely to share that sentiment.
Pippen has been long considered a favorite of teammates and
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of players look up to him,'' Johnson said. ``He hasn't
gotten his just due, playing in the shadow of Jordan. He's smart.
He knows to win a championship you have to have
championship-caliber players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew he had to find a team that caters to his strengths _
his ability to push the ball and find people. We've got people who
can finish inside with Charles and Hakeem and some people who can
knock it down outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, unavailable Monday, has not commented about specific
free agents pursued by the Rockets, saying it would be wrong for
him to try to exert any influence on the decisions. But he said the
chase itself reflected on the organization in a positive way that
ultimately would deliver Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big compliment to the Rockets organization, from Les
(Alexander, the Rockets' owner) and the coaching staff on down,''
Olajuwon said last week. ``They're doing their best to bring in an
impact player to make a run this year. It says a lot about the
organization that they're looking for a top-notch player to make a
big impact.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, they found him.

KOURNIKOVA HAS TROUBLE WITH HER SERVE BUT STILL WINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for complete writethru w new hed to update with Tuesday
games.)  (js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ The chair umpire, John Blom, leaned into
the microphone on Court 1 on Tuesday and announced the
understandable: ``Kournikova has won the toss and elected to
receive.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Kournikova, the 17-year-old phenom in a
hurry, would have grabbed the match by the horns and served
herself, but these are troubling times for the lithe young Russian
with the deep Florida tan.
</P>
<P>
   Since last October, she has had the tennis equivalent of the
yips. It began when she lost her rhythm and nerve on her serve in
the second set of a three-set loss to Martina Hingis in
Filderstadt, Germany. She would serve 14 double faults in the last
two sets in that match, and since then Kournikova has been
double-faulting at a startling clip.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the 12th-seeded Kournikova served 17 double faults
in the opening set alone and finished with 23. The most remarkable
thing was that she still managed to defeat the American Jill
Craybas, 7-6 (7-1), 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there is no broom-handled racquet to turn to, so
Kournikova must simply muddle through. When she trailed by 3-2
early in the second set, a fan shouted, ``Hey Anna. Serve us a
double fault.'' Other fans booed at the heckler and another one
shouted, ``Don't listen to him, Anna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is half mental, half technical,'' Kournikova said of her
service. ``But it's not like a huge problem. When you have a
mistake on the forehand, nobody notices, but when you make a double
fault or low percentage of serves, everybody talks about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what her coach, Pavel Slozil, had suggested to help her
solve the problem, she answered, ``Forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Kournikova walked off Court 1, Petr Korda walked
on to face Galo Blanco in his first match in defense of his title.
Despite the controversy surrounding Korda's positive test for the
steroid nadrolone, he was not greeted as a pariah. When his name
was announced, there were scattered cheers, not boos or whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Several players, including the American Jim Courier, have said
they believed that Korda should not be competing in Melbourne. But
the Czech certainly had to compete at a high level to defeat
Blanco, 6-3, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the third set, with Korda leading by 4-3 and Blanco serving
at deuce, Korda hit a forehand while moving forward near the
baseline and twisted his left ankle. He fell to the court and then
asked for an injury timeout and had his ankle wrapped by a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to the trainer, `I'm not going to give up; I'll be on
the court until the last ball,' '' Korda said.
</P>
<P>
   Korda would win the third set, but the last ball was still a
long way away.
</P>
<P>
   When he won the final point after 3 hours 45 minutes, Korda
walked toward the net to shake Blanco's hand, but Blanco had other
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The only hand Blanco was prepared to shake was the hand of the
chair umpire, Mohamed Lahyani. That done, he walked straight to his
chair, packed his belongings into his racquets bag and walked off
the court.
</P>
<P>
   As Blanco's gesture made clear, this was not business as usual.
Korda, who tested positive for nandrolone at Wimbledon last year,
is playing here because an appeals committee reduced the standard
one-year ban to the loss of his prize money and computer points
from Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That never happened to me before,'' Korda said of the
Spaniard's decision not to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco said that his snub had nothing to do with Korda's drug
case. He said he was simply dissatisfied with Korda's handling of
his injury timeout, accusing the Czech of stalling for time and
exaggerating the nature of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   Korda opened his news conference with an announcement that
because his case was still in litigation, he would not answer
questions about it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how difficult it was for him to play in light of the
circumstances, he answered, ``What can I say? I can only say that
I'm really match short right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, defending champions at Grand Slam events play
their opening matches on the primary show court, but Korda was put
on Court 1 instead. The decision was made, according to the
tournament director Paul McNamee, because Korda is unseeded, not
because of the positive drug test.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ask to play on the center court when your ranking is
21,'' Korda said.
</P>
<P>
   While Korda was struggling and succeeding in the first round,
the man he defeated in last year's final, Marcelo Rios, already had
left Melbourne without playing a match. Rios, seeded No. 1 in Pete
Sampras's absence, announced his withdrawal on Monday because of a
stress fracture in his second lumbar vertebra. The tournament
doctor, David Bolzonello, said the injury should keep Rios from
practicing for three to four weeks and from returning to the tour
for at least six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rios will drop from No. 2 to at least No. 5 in the ranking after
this tournament and will drop much lower if his lower back does not
allow him to defend his titles at Indian Wells, Calif., and Key
Biscayne, Fla., in March.
</P>
<P>
   He has been troubled by leg injuries and back soreness often in
the last three months, and Bolzonello indicated that the same
magnetic resonance imaging scan that revealed his stress fracture
on Monday also showed evidence of a previous stress injury on the
other side of the same vertebra.
</P>
<P>
   ``These injuries are potentially serious for all athletes,
particularly those involved in a sport that involves extension of
the back,'' Bolzonello said. ``Now, we that we know it's there he
can follow the appropriate treatment, which is essentially rest,
and there's a very good chance it will heal without any concerns in
the next few weeks.''

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Mighty Ducks have depended on
their special teams and goaltending all season, but Monday's 5-3
victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins before 15,016 at the Pond was
a little extra special.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' fourth-ranked power play scored two more goals. The
ninth-ranked penalty-killing unit frustrated Pittsburgh's
third-ranked power play by killing off six of seven penalties and
Guy Hebert turned aside 44 shots as Anaheim snapped a losing streak
at two games.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Ducks (17-18-8) one point ahead of St.
Louis and into a tie with Edmonton for fifth place in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks hadn't taken a lead into the second period of a game
since Jan. 1 in Buffalo and they were 2-5 in that span. But Anaheim
took a 1-0 lead after 20 minutes on Monday thanks to another
contribution from red-hot Fredrik Olausson.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran defenseman slipped down from the right point on the
power play and deflected Teemu Selanne's perfect goal-mouth pass
past Tom Barrasso at 12:44 for his 10th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Olausson's goal extended his career-high goal streak to five
games, the longest by a NHL defenseman since Sergei Zubov scored in
five straight for the New York Rangers in April of 1995. Olausson,
who assisted on Anaheim's second goal, has scored 20 points in the
last 16 games and is now tied for fourth among defensemen with 28
points and only St. Louis' Al MacInnis has more goals (11).
</P>
<P>
   While Olausson has been streaking, Marty McInnis has been
slumping. But the winger gave Anaheim a 2-0 at 2:46 of the second
period when the Ducks converted another two-man advantage after the
Penguins' Darius Kasparaitis cross-checked Travis Green into the
boards behind the Pittsburgh net.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis shanked his first chance from the side of the net, but
seconds later he converted another pass by Paul Kariya for his
first goal in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis' goal was the Ducks' 10th power play goal in their last
eight games _ a span in which they have scored only 10
even-strength goals.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Anaheim's fourth on the two-man advantage in the
last four games _ another was scored just two seconds after a
two-man advantage had expired.
</P>
<P>
   But referees Mick McGough and Paul Devorski certainly didn't
make easy on the Ducks. They called four consecutive penalties
against Anaheim in one stretch of the second period, forcing Hebert
and the penalty killers to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   And work they did. Thanks to several big saves by Hebert, the
Ducks held the Penguins scoreless, and if not for Barrasso stopping
Kariya's shorthanded breakaway with 7{ minutes left, Anaheim would
have taken a three-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the power play came up empty on a 51-second two-man
advantage early in the third period, the Ducks finally put the
Penguins away with two even-strength goals at 4:56 of the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Sandstrom took a pass from Selanne on a two-on-one, held
on just long enough and snapped a shot over the fallen Barrasso. It
was Sandstrom's sixth goal of the season and first point in seven
games since returning from a broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The Matt Cullen-Sandstrom-McInnis line just put together by
Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg struck again at 8:15 when McInnis
scored his 12th goal of the season.

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MICHAEL Jordan's second and presumed final leaving may have been a
nasty lick for the NBA in this, its hour of dire need. But Jordan,
it appears, has done the Rockets a favor of untold magnitude. He
gave Houston, albeit unintentionally, its shot at a second coming.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All right now, after me. One two three: Thank you, Michael!
Happy trails, friend.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should, as a civic gesture, send M.J. a gold watch or
something. We'd better at least mail a real pretty card to Phil
Jackson as well. If Phil had stayed with the Bulls instead of
riding off into the Montana sunset, so would have M.J. and, no
doubt, the rest of them.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen included.
</P>
<P>
   Then, gee whiz, guess who everyone would have picked to win yet
another NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson's retirement begat Jordan's, which begat the
inevitable breakup of the unbeata-Bulls as we have known them.
Pippen was the first still-active domino in the post-lockout chain
reaction to topple, and he has, praise be, tumbled squarely into
our delighted laps, having concluded the Rockets are the team with
which he can maximize his bid to pull off a personal four-peat.
</P>
<P>
   That would even one-up Jordan, whose coattails he has always
been accused of riding. Pippen understands the dynamics of winning,
to be sure. With the Rockets, he receives the chance to show he can
go to the mountaintop on his own if being a sidekick to Hakeem
Olajuwon and Charles Barkley really constitutes a statement of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK, Scottie. No man is an island.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Pippen is going to cost the Rockets only money _
$67.2 million over five years _ plus a second-round draft pick and
Roy Rogers. Shoot, the Bulls can have Trigger, too, if they want.
And Dale Evans.
</P>
<P>
   How big a coup is this? As big as coups come. Quite simply, it's
the difference between the Rockets competing, front and center, for
their third title of the '90s and free-falling into lottery-bound
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   It's the difference between a community's being bitter and/or
apathetic following the interminable six-month lockout and saying,
``Whoopee, let's go watch some ball.'' Suddenly, a pickup game
Saturday night against the Spurs doesn't have the look of a farce,
assuming these new-look Rockets can manage at least one practice
before tipoff and find five players to stuff into uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a freebie exhibition olive branch might actually be worth
the price of admission.
</P>
<P>
   With Antonio McDyess, the most highly coveted young stud on the
market, having slipped from Houston's grasp _ he'll either stay in
Phoenix or inexplicably return to Denver _ it pretty much came down
to Pippen or bust for Leslie Alexander and Rudy Tomjanovich, et al.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, sans both McDyess and Pippen, the Rockets might as
well have traded Hakeem, given Barkley a tearful farewell embrace
and started over.
</P>
<P>
   But with Scottie in the mix, the Rockets' roster should come
together quickly and neatly, fleshed out by those who recognize
what a glorious opportunity beckons. First in line to return will
be, by all accounts, Sir Charles, who fervently desires the kind of
diamond-studded ring that money can't buy _ and who, therefore, has
promised to accept considerably less of same to be allowed to stick
around.
</P>
<P>
   You Barkley-bashers are on notice. The Chuckster's heart has
always been in the right place, although his mouth on occasion has
obscured it.
</P>
<P>
   While Pippen transforms the Rockets into more of a fast-breaking
team than they have been, Barkley assures us he's back in shape to
do that, certainly for a paltry 50 games. Also, the shortened
season cuts Olajuwon's creaky knees some slack. Further, Pippen's
mere Hall of Fame-bound presence in the locker room figures to have
an uplifting, energizing effect on everyone, veterans and rookies
alike.
</P>
<P>
   Making the pieces fit on such ridiculously short notice will be
a different kind of challenge for Tomjanovich, but he definitely
won't have to waste a lot of time or energy selling himself to
Scottie. Rudy's reputation as a popular coach precedes itself. A
Jackson type minus the beard and new-age mantra, he was no doubt a
major part of the Rockets' lure.
</P>
<P>
   So as long as we're passing out thank-yous, Tomjanovich deserves
one, too. And, of course, Hakeem, who is surely the primary
attraction for Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   He has played all these years beside the most gifted backcourt
artist the game will ever see. Coming to Houston now affords him
the unique opportunity of comparing an unforgettable experience
with an incredible one: complementing the No. 1 big man of our age.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like there could be a song in all this.

<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S. (Washington) _ Scoffing at warnings by the Clinton
administration that he must comply with a ceasefire in Kosovo, the

out of Kosovo and refused entry to a U.N. war crimes prosecutor who
arrived at the province's border to investigate a massacre. By Jane
Perlez. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DISSENT (Beijing) _ As they very publicly send the most
outspoken democracy campaigners to prison, China's leaders have
also quietly tightened the screws on liberal intellectuals,
journalists and publications. In the last few weeks the Communist
Party's powerful Department of Propaganda has closed down an
influential book publisher in Beijing and an adventurous newspaper
in the southern city of Guangzhou. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-RUSSIA-NUCLEAR (Washington) _ In his State of the Union

United States substantially increase its financial assistance to
Russia to minimize the threat posed by the Russian nuclear arsenal,

</P>
<P>
   ANGOLA (Luanda, Angola) _ After 5 years of trying to make peace
in Angola, having spent at least $1.5 billion and having seen 60 of
its staff members lose their lives, the United Nations is now an
unwelcome guest here. Both the government and the rebels have
essentially indicated that they want the peacekeepers to leave so
that the two sides can fight to the finish without interference in
this country that is one of the most troubled, and potentially one
of the richest, in Africa. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET (London) _ A panel of Law Lords, Britain's highest
court, Monday opened a rehearing of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's plea to
be freed from house arrest and allowed to return home to Chile. By
Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   ISTANBUL-BAGELS (Istanbul, Turkey) _ Neither a bagel nor coffee
is the main attraction at Tribeca, a trendy new American-style
coffee house in Istanbul. The owners are selling something that
they believe is even more irresistible. They are selling America, a
product that is becoming ever more popular here. By Stephen Kinzer.

<P>
   FBN-ATLANTA (Atlanta) _ Fans used to winning, fans in cities
where teams routinely make a realistic run for the NFL
championship, might not understand Atlanta's quiet reaction to
winning, but many Falcons fans had to recover from the shock before
they could whoop and stomp. By Rick Bragg. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SKI (Georgetown, Colo.) _ Next weekend, skiers here are to
inaugurate the world's highest chair lift, but in a sign of
changing times in the nation's most popular skiing state, a
Colorado environmentalist is suing. After fighting logging, mining
and cattle grazing on National Forest lands, environmentalists
declared open season this winter on ski areas, once the
environmental good guys. By James Brooke. With graphic and photo.

   HAIR-WARS (Los Angeles) _ The City of Angels has seen its share
of war.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, there have been gang wars, water wars and, on
Oscar night, star wars. And as dusk fell Sunday, a hair war broke
out in a hotel near the airport, the site of numerous fare wars. By

<P>
   IMPEACH-SANTORUM (Philadelphia) _ Sen. Rick Santorum, the
conservative Republican from Pennsylvania, has been a strident
critic of President Clinton, once accusing him of telling
``bald-faced untruths.'' But these days, with Clinton's fate in the
hands of the Senate _ and with Democrats lining up to challenge
Santorum for his job in 2000 _ the junior senator's voice has
fallen silent. By Katharine Q. Seelye. With photos.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REPUBS (Washington) _ A telling sign of the troubles
confronting the Republican Party is that some Republicans are so
fearful of ceding Democrats a political advantage that they say
they would not dare boycott Tuesday's State of the Union address.
By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ The compressed calendar of presidential
primaries has set off a competitive frenzy among Republican and
Democratic contenders who believe that they must begin _ almost
immediately _ to raise money or they may find it impossible to
catch up. In many ways, this year is more crucial than 2000 in
determining whom the two parties will nominate. By Richard L.
Berke. With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CHILDCARE (Washington) _ President Clinton will embrace
an idea long favored by conservatives and propose a tax break for
parents who stay home to care for their children, White House
officials say. By Robert Pear.

Monday offered an apparently seamless blend of symbolism and
substance, just the right formula to commemorate Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s life. By James Bennet. With photos.

   A Different Look At World Danger Spots &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Air Security International, a 10-year-old Houston company that
provides security services for traveling executives _ keeping them
out of trouble if possible, and trying to get them out of it if not
_ has issued a list of what it considers the most dangerous
business-travel destinations in the world last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's listing of travel dangers is slightly different
from the State Department's, according to a company spokeswoman,
Kimberley Williams, though both attempt to evaluate the same kinds
of safety and crime issues. Air Security's list is largely based on
the detailed reports of paid agents _ including employees of
airports and international corporations, and owners of overseas
businesses _ working in the field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dangerous destinations are divided into four risk
categories: crime, kidnapping, political violence, and wars or
insurgencies. The only destination to appear in all four categories
is Colombia, cited as the country with the most kidnappings, as
home to ``the longest insurgency in the Western Hemisphere,'' and
for its high crime rate exacerbated by the cocaine trade, as well
as bombings, assassinations, guerrilla insurgencies and power
struggles among drug lords, politicians, judges and the military. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 10 places cited for their dangerously high crime rate are
Johannesburg (``carjackings, robberies and assaults continue
unabated''), Mexico City (corrupt police and ``taxi-related
crime''), Tijuana (``getting a reputation as the next Medellin''),
Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Papua New Guinea (gangs armed with
high-powered rifles, machetes, even grenade launchers), Kazakhstan
(``corrupt officials and police impostors continue to target
foreigners''), Lagos (pickpocketing to armed robbery and murder),
Moscow and Colombia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company found a heightened threat of kidnapping in five
places. Besides Colombia, they were the Caucasus region of Russia
(``extremely common''), Mexico (``rings operate throughout the
country''), the Philippines (where it's on the decline, but still
prevalent) and Yemen (tribesmen seeking government concessions use
foreigners as bargaining chips). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political-violence category cites Bangladesh, where labor
strife has been known to turn violent; Indonesia, where violence
between security forces and demonstrators still flares on occasion;
Pakistan, where ``more than 4,000 people have died in ethnic,
sectarian and political violence in Karachi since 1995'' and, yes,
Colombia. &QL;

   Remembering Woodrow Wilson &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Woodrow Wilson House in Washington is commemorating the 75th
anniversary of Wilson's death with the exhibition ``Woodrow Wilson:
An American Vision for the 20th Century,'' on display from
Wednesday through April 12. The Georgian Revival town house, now a
National Trust Historic Site and museum, was Wilson's last home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition showcases Wilson's accomplishments as an
educator, president (from 1913 to 1921) and statesman, stressing
his influence in university education, foreign policy and
international commerce. Photographs, newspaper articles, books by
and about Wilson, and World War I posters are among the items
included, along with the Nobel Peace Prize he won in 1919, the
first shell fired by American troops in World War I, and his
signature silk top hat and white kid gloves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An evensong service open to the public will be held at 4 p.m. at
the Washington National Cathedral on Feb. 3, the anniversary of his
death. On March 6, scholars will discuss Wilson's political legacy
in a seminar at the Smithsonian Institution co-sponsored by the
Smithsonian Associates and the Eisenhower Center for American
Studies. Tickets: (202) 387-4062, extension 18. &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The 45-minute programs will be devoted to 100 plays deemed the
century's most significant by a jury of more than 800 playwrights,
actors, journalists and other theater professionals, who were each
asked to nominate 10 English-language plays. Arthur Miller was the
most frequently nominated author, closely followed by Harold Pinter
and Samuel Beckett. The plays will be considered in chronological
order. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn

   Cleveland Plays Host To a Mexican Firebrand &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colorful, political, sophisticated and larger than life _ Diego
Rivera was all those things. So was his art, as ``Diego Rivera: Art
and Revolution'' makes clear. The exhibition of more than 120
paintings and drawings by Mexico's most celebrated artist begins a
four-city yearlong tour on Feb. 14 at the Cleveland Museum of Art. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rivera is renowned for fusing the innovations of European
modernism with the traditions of his country's pre-Columbian past
and its indigenous peoples. The show begins with a rarely seen
classical drawing done in 1899, when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   He began his prolific career along conventional lines. But by
the age of 20 he had left for Europe, where he met Picasso and
other important avant-gardists. His art was transformed, and he
produced such masterworks as ``Portrait of Adolfo Best Maugard''
and ``Majorca Landscape.'' ``Zapatista Landscape _ The Guerrilla''
reflects Rivera's political sympathies in the Mexican Revolution
and is considered to be his Cubist masterpiece. All can be seen in
the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to Mexico in 1921, Rivera set himself the task
of painting for the masses, making monumental murals, represented
in the exhibition by preliminary drawings and cartoons. His
paintings, both at home and in the United States during the 1930s,
became political, finally taking a turn toward humanism, with works
envisioning a utopian society. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Diego Rivera: Art and Revolution'' contains familiar images
like ``Flower Day'' and ``Tortilla Makers'' as well as works never
before shown in the United States, like a self-portrait from 1906. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Museum of Art, at 11150 East Boulevard, is open
Tuesday to Sunday. Admission to the Rivera exhibition, which lasts
through May 2, is by dated, timed tickets that cost $5 on weekdays
and $7 on Saturday and Sunday (with discounts for students and
groups). Admission is free on Tuesday from 3 to 5 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travel packages with breakfast and unrestricted admission
tickets are available at several Cleveland hotels: prices for
double rooms begin at $122 at the Glidden House, $164 at the Omni
International, $179 at the Renaissance Cleveland and $219 at the
Ritz-Carlton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information: (888) 262-0033 or www .clemusart.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will travel to the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art (May 30 through Aug. 16), the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston
(Sept. 19 through Nov. 28) and the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico
City (Dec. 17 through March 19, 2000). Judith H. Dobrzynski

 Neuheisel brings Gilbertson back to Husky coaching staff  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Back slaps and belly laughs filled the Washington
athletic facilities Monday as popular Keith Gilbertson returned for
his third tour of duty with the Husky football program, hired as
assistant head coach and offensive line coach.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson, 50, agreed to join Rick Neuheisel's staff Sunday, a
few days after Neuheisel surprised him with a phone call and job
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has been special for me,'' said Gilbertson,
standing in a hallway leading to the coaches' offices. ``It worked
out. I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive architect of the UW's 1991 national title team,
Gilbertson long has been a fan favorite. Even before Jim Lambright
was fired on Dec. 30 and replaced by Neuheisel, internet users were
calling for Gilbertson's return to the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Snohomish native spent the last three seasons with the
Seahawks as tight ends coach. He started looking for work on Dec.
28, when Dennis Erickson was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week ago, Gilbertson had no prospects. He said a return
to Washington was highly unlikely, as was following Erickson to
Oregon State. He was willing to relocate, figuring he would land
another NFL job.
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel apparently is not one to pass up a feel-good
opportunity. First he announced the Huskies would return to their
traditional gold helmets. Next he hired Randy Hart and Wayne Moses,
holdovers from Lambright's coaching staff. Now he has Gilbertson, a
direct link to the Don James coaching regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that makes this place so special is the
tradition,'' Gilbertson said. ``I know I've been away from it for
awhile, but nobody knows more about it than me. I grew up here. I
think I bring some experience back here, good and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson was either UW offensive line coach or offensive
coordinator in 1989-91, leaving when California hired him as head
coach. He coached the Bears for four seasons, guiding his second
Cal team to a 9-4 season, which included a 37-3 Alamo Bowl victory
over Iowa. He was fired in 1995 when his next two teams went 4-7
and 3-8, giving him a 20-26 overall ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Erickson, Gilbertson was Idaho's head coach in
1986-88. He guided the Vandals to a 28-9 mark, earning Big Sky
coach of the year honors during his final season.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson's first coaching stint at Washington came in 1976,
when he was a graduate assistant for James' second Husky team. He
also was an assistant coach for Western Washington, Utah State,
Idaho and the now-defunct USFL's Los Angeles Express.
</P>
<P>
   He and Neuheisel became acquainted when both were in the Pac-10
together, Gilbertson at Cal and Neuheisel at UCLA, his alma mater,
as quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him a long time and always liked him,'' Gilbertson
said. ``I'm surprised and I'm flattered. I always felt good about
being here, and always wanted to be here. It's a real good deal for
Keith Gilbertson.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gilbertson was reclaiming an office on campus, his fellow
UW coaches were hosting a visit by prize running back recruit, Paul
Arnold, according to Arnold's high school coach, Kennedy's Bob
Bourgette.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold has narrowed his choices to Washington, Notre Dame,
Michigan, UCLA and Colorado. He is such a high recruiting priority,
Arnold will be visited at Kennedy this week alone by the following
head coaches: Notre Dame's Bob Davie, Michigan's Lloyd Carr and
UCLA's Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Though out of the running, Nebraska and Oregon also have
requested school visits this week with Arnold, who is considering
making his college choice known in a live television broadcast
shown by Fox Northwest cable.

   MINNEAPOLIS _ Aside from the tight knot of Atlanta Falcons
celebrating disbelievingly at the bottom of the Metrodome, the only
sound in the moments after the NFC championship game Sunday was the
bonk of 64,000 strong Norwegian jaws dropping onto the concrete
floor in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   One jaw, however, was making a different noise.
</P>
<P>
   Bounding from the field up the stairwell toward the locker room,
three steps at a time, was Eugene Robinson, who really didn't need
steps.
</P>
<P>
   To no one and everyone, in the high-pitched staccato screech
that earned him the nickname ``Orca'' by his former Seahawk
teammates, the Falcons' safety shouted:
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't believe it!
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't believe it!
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't believe it!''
</P>
<P>
   Most assuredly, they didn't believe it. And remember, this is a
population that recently elected a pro rassler as governor, so its
capacity for active imagination is not to be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not in their darkest, lutefisk-induced nightmares did
Minnesotans envision Sunday: Their invincible, invulnerable
Vikings, a magnificent 16-1 this NFL season, losing a berth in the
Super Bowl 30-27 in overtime to an 11-point underdog team led by a
peripatetic grid hobo, Chris Chandler, whose nickname, ``Chrystal
Chandelier,'' is a testament to his physical fragility.
</P>
<P>
   By the Falcons' own admission, they are Dirty Birds, coached by
a guy who needs a zipper on his chest to deal more easily with his
heart problems. The relentless Vikings put 20 unanswered points on
that heart in less than 14 minutes of the first half, usually a
signal for even a healthy ticker to take the rest of the career
off.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Vikings lost, fergawdsakes, AT HOME, where rivals' ears
go to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come in here, with this crowd, and do what we did,'' said a
beaming Chandler, ``is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a description he might have reserved for himself, not only
for Sunday but for his advance from the back alleys of pro football
to the Boulevard of Pigskin Dreams, which this year is shaded by
the palms of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Everett native and former University of Washington
quarterback was good for a pick-free day of 340 yards and three
TDs, including a 16-yarder to Terance Mathis inside the final
minute of regulation. That touchdown not only concluded a marvelous
clutch drive that forced overtime, it drove home a point Chandler
was eager to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tired of looking at the papers and seeing (the Vikings
say) all they had to do was shut down our running game,'' he said.
``I took that personally.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have known Chandler through his often convulsive
career as a Husky and in the NFL, they know that when he takes
something personally, drama is imminent. Earlier in his career, the
drama was often self-destructive. But these days, a more serene
Chandler simply gets even. Or, as was the case Sunday, three points
better.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were 15-2 primarily upon the rushing feats of
running back Jamal Anderson, who had 1,800 yards during the season.
Held to a quiet 67 Sunday, the offense for the biggest game in the
Falcons' tepid NFL history reverted to Chandler, heretofore a
figure in NFL records only because he is the sole quarterback to
start for six different teams.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves, not long off a hospital gurney after bypass
surgery, armed Chandler with the key maneuver to survive the audio
riot _ a silent snap count, which eliminated the need for words
beyond the huddle. To carry out the lip-synch, Chandler even bobbed
his head as if he were calling signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked hard on the silent count all week,'' said Chandler's
partner in deceit, center Robbie Tobeck, who happens to be the QB's
natural-born enemy _ he's a Washington State Cougar (class of '93.)
``It really helped because it took the crowd's influence out of the
game. I don't think we had a single problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams often use silent counts for two or three series in a domed
stadium, and rarely have the cohesion to sustain it for a game. But
the Falcons used it throughout to accumulate 427 yards of offense,
including a touchdown and two field goals in the final 23 minutes
of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tip your hat to Atlanta,'' said Vikings cornerback
Jimmy Hitchcock. ``They were prepared for the noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Added offensive teammate Randy Moss: ``Atlanta came here and
played a perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chandler, a third-round pick in the 1988 draft, it was a
perfect, albeit tardy, breakthrough to the big time. Always
well-praised for his skills, he nevertheless had either bad timing
or bad luck _ and occasionally a bad temper _ that produced pink
slips from Indianapolis, Tampa, Arizona, the L.A. Rams and Houston.
But at 33 and with his sixth team, he has found health, quality
teammates and some security _ in September, he signed a four-year,
$25 million extension that included a $6 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to a lot of places in this league,'' he said. ``None
of them were good _ until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Because his previous teams never won, Chandler might be the most
obscure quality quarterback in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough guy, and very good,'' said Falcons tight end O.J.
Santiago. ``We know that in Atlanta. If the rest of the country
doesn't know it, maybe they will after today.''
</P>
<P>
   After outdueling the more celebrated Randall Cunningham, the
Vikings, suspected of being one of the great teams of the decade,
are no longer making that misjudgment.
</P>
<P>
   Too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``To overlook our passing game was a mistake that hurt them,''
said a defiant Chandler, still taking it personally long after the
Vikings and their noisy fans felt an insult far more deeply.

   AMMAN _ King Hussein comes back to Jordan today (Tuesday)
through the flag-bedecked streets of Amman after six months of
chemotherapy treatment for cancer in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   As Jordanians prepare publicly to celebrate his return with
military parades, air shows, fireworks, folk dancing and poetry
recitals, they speculate endlessly in private about who will
succeed to the throne he has held for 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that King Hussein, who is still only 63, is dying.
Despite the loss of his hair _ even his eyebrows _ the chemotherapy
appears to have cured the lymphoma from which he suffered.
</P>
<P>
   But his illness has focused the attention of Jordanians _ 90
percent of whom were born since he became king in 1953 _ on the
future of their country after his reign.
</P>
<P>
   In theory this was settled a long time ago. Crown Prince Hassan,
the king's younger brother, has been his designated successor since
1965. He ruled the country as regent while the king was being
treated in the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech on Jordanian television broadcast from London at
the weekend King Hussein made no reference to his future role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he has to say now that the crown prince is my successor
or not,'' said one Jordanian analyst Sunday, adding: ``I don't see
how he can let Hassan become king. He isn't popular with the people
or the army and whoever rules Jordan must have good relations with
army. His speeches are too intellectual. He speaks as if he was the
U.N. Secretary General.''
</P>
<P>
   This is harsh on Crown Prince Hassan. A burly, hard-working,
intelligent administrator of 51, he has inevitably stood in the
king's shadow throughout his life, but if often accused of lacking
the common touch.
</P>
<P>
   He is conscious of the difficulties of his own position.
``Prince Charles once told we should form an association of crown
princes,'' he said several years ago in an interview. ``Or perhaps
clown princes' association would be more appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during his six months as regent the crown prince's power
was far from absolute. The king never wholly relaxed his grip.
</P>
<P>
   He sent open letters from his hospital bed, one criticizing
Jordanian inefficiency as two jumbo jets almost crashed over Amman
airport when all the flight controllers went to pray at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   As he recovered he frequently saw President Clinton and helped
orchestrate the Wye agreement between Israel and the Palestinians
in October.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly the only question in dispute revolves around the
succession to the throne after Crown Prince Hassan. Should it be
his son Rashid or one of King Hussein's sons such as Hamza, 19, by
his present wife, Queen Noor?
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian constitution was altered in 1965 to allow Crown
Prince Hassan to become heir to the throne, because Abdullah, his
eldest son was only three and the king was in constant danger of
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice any decision on Crown Prince Hassan's successor
could be reversed by him once he became king. Therefore the present
dynastic dispute revolves directly around who will succeed King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   If Crown Prince Hassan is passed over then the most likely heir
to the throne is Hamza. His half-brother Abdullah, whose mother was
English, is commander of the royal guard, but primarily a military
commander with limited interest in politics. Though popular with
the army he speaks poor Arabic, while Hamza is fluent.
</P>
<P>
   The danger from King Hussein's point of view is that Jordan
cannot afford a weak ruler because it is less powerful than all its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It is squeezed between Israel to the west and Iraq to the east,
while its relations with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have been cool
since Jordan took a neutral stance in the Gulf war in 1991. It has
few natural resources and no oil, leaving it heavily dependent on
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein used his enforced stay in the U.S. to build close
personal relations with President Clinton. But neither his peace
treaty with Israel signed in 1994, nor his increasingly vocal
hostility to Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, are popular policies
at home. He knows his dynasty cannot afford to make too many
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The king has in mind major changes relating to the
succession,'' a palace official was quoted as saying Sunday but
would not elaborate. &QL;

PIPPEN HEADED TO ROCKETS, SOURCES SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
The dismantling of a dynasty continues as several NBA sources
confirmed last night the Chicago Bulls expect to trade seven-time
All-Star forward Scottie Pippen to the Houston Rockets once the
lockout is officially lifted later this week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pippen, Michael Jordan's running mate during the Bulls' six
championships this decade, will apparently sign a five-year
contract worth $67.2 million with Chicago, then be sent to Houston
for forward Roy Rogers and a second-round draft pick in 1999. The
deal, which will pay Pippen $10.6 million this season, is allowable
under the league's new collective bargaining agreement because
Houston has enough room to fit Pippen under its salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it's done, and it looks like Houston has
themselves a championship-caliber team,'' said one NBA team
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bulls general manager Jerry Krause managed to salvage
something for Pippen _ albeit not much _ the move is another sign
that the three-time defending champions will instead be fighting to
stay out of the lottery this season. Jordan announced his
retirement last week, starting center Luc Longley is expected to
sign a contract with the Phoenix Suns, backup guard Steve Kerr is
close to a deal with the San Antonio Spurs and free-agent forward
Dennis Rodman is also unlikely to return to the Bulls since they
won't be considered among the league's elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls could have offered Pippen a contract of $14 million
this season, and he hinted last week that he would stay in Chicago.
However, the combination of a soured relationship with Krause and a
new direction with coach Tim Floyd made the championship
cornerstone expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, 33, averaged 19 points and five rebounds per game last
season, but had off-season back surgery for an injury that limited
his productivity in June's NBA Finals. He is considered one of the
league's most versatile offensive players and among its top
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   His addition allows the Rockets to minimize the loss of Clyde
Drexler, who retired after last season to coach the University of
Houston. Since Pippen's acquisition is also likely to motivate
free-agent forward Charles Barkley to return, the Rockets could
become a contender in the lockout-shortened '99 season by sporting
a front line of Pippen at small forward, Barkley at power forward
and Hakeem Olajuwon at center. Pippen is expected to be in uniform
when the Rockets play the Spurs in an exhibition Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The league's other two most prominent free agents are also
effected by Pippen's move. Forward Antonio McDyess, who immediately
crossed the Rockets off his list, will now decide between the
Phoenix Suns and Denver Nuggets, and forward Tom Gugliotta has
narrowed his choices to the Nuggets or Minnesota Timberwolves.

VANCOUVER WINS, EMERGES AS DALLAS' NEW NEMESIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
DALLAS _ The Vancouver Canucks are taking on a sharky look about
them this season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Canucks, who last night bit the Stars for the third time _
this one a 5-3 Stars loss _ have officially taken the role of
mysterious nemesis away from the San Jose Sharks, who dominated the
Stars for two seasons before being solved in last season's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just like the Sharks used to be,'' winger Grant
Marshall said before the game. ``It's something we have to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Stars, there was no change from the
previous scenarios. The 15-23-6 Canucks again out-toughed the
27-8-7 Stars, but also outskilled them. The result was a domination
of the season series, three games to one, and a lasting reminder
for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   `We view that team as a playoff team. ... maybe against us,''
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``If we had to play them in the
playoffs, they would be a significant opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Canucks have defeated the Stars just about every
way possible. They did it Dec. 4 while missing offensive stars Todd
Bertuzzi and Alexander Mogilny. They did it Jan. 10 by holding the
Stars to 13 shots. Last night, they did it most convincingly by
making use of a healthy lineup and two new additions who were
making their debuts in Canucks uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Former Stars center Dave Gagner and hulking defenseman Ed
Jovanovski came to the Canucks on Sunday in a trade that sent
holdout winger Pavel Bure to the Florida Panthers. Gagner had two
assists and Jovanovski played almost 25 minutes and handed out
three hits.
</P>
<P>
   They were at the center of a team attack that swamped the Stars,
who scored 53 seconds into the game and received a late gift goal
from Craig Ludwig with 28 seconds remaining. In between, the
Canucks were dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play like men tonight and they did,'' Stars
defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``That's the way it's been all year
\Ragainst them\S; we didn't initiate anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Verbeek scored on the power play within the game's first
minute to give the Stars the first goal for the 24th time in 42
games. They are 18-2-4 when scoring first. However, it took the
Canucks only five minutes to tie it as Gagner fed Markus Naslund,
who scored his sixth goal of the season in four games against the
Stars and 23rd overall.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull tallied his 15th goal of the season at the 14:31 mark
of the first, but Gagner set up Bill Muckalt to tie the score once
again.
</P>
<P>
   Former Stars winger Trent Klatt then scored on the power play at
the 1:09 mark of the second period, and Mogilny and Mark Messier
added insurance goals to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Messier's goal was his 610th of his career, tying Bobby Hull for
seventh on the all-time NHL list. Bobby is the father of Stars
winger Brett. Messier also moved past Marcel Dionne into fifth on
the all-time assists list with 1,041.
</P>
<P>
   If those numbers aren't enough, consider these:
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks are 2-8-2 in their past 12 games _ both wins have
come over the Stars. The Stars are 14-3-4 over their past 21 games,
with two of the losses coming to the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   While the game was filled with all sorts of trivia, the results
were hardly trivial to Hitchcock, who chastised his team for not
showing up mentally or physically. The coach dismissed any talk of
excuses caused by the residual effects of a long road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had no effect at all,'' Sydor assured.
</P>
<P>
   Which meant the game would serve as a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The raw emotion I was talking about, this is a perfect example
of that,'' Hitchcock said. ``As a group, we've got to dig a lot
deeper.''

JAYHAWKS DEFEAT LONGHORNS INSIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Superiority in Big 12 Conference basketball still
calls Allen Fieldhouse home. It's just not in a very loud voice.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas won for the 35th time in 37 Big 12 games, claiming a
grind-it-out 76-67 victory over Texas last night. The Longhorns,
despite their worst-shooting half of the season, never let the
Jayhawks out of their sights and were within five points with less
than five minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   The victory puts No. 19 Kansas (13-4) atop the Big 12 standings
with a 5-0 record. Texas, its winning streak ended at six, is 9-9
overall and 5-1 in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas won this game with rebounding. The Jayhawks had 21
offensive rebounds that resulted in 27 points. In the second half,
they scored 20 of 25 points on second-chance opportunities and at
one point Kansas scored 16 consecutive points resulting from
rebounds. Kansas had a 51-35 rebounding edge, the first time in 10
games Texas has lost the board battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some letdowns on the offensive boards,'' said Texas
center Chris Mihm, who had 14 points and 11 rebounds. ``We had some
possessions where it really hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its rebounding and shooting woes, Texas kept in contact.
After Kansas opened a 54-41 lead with 11:14 remaining, the
Longhorns scrapped their way back. They trailed 60-55 with 4:44
left when Gabe Muoneke scored on a lane jumper. But that was as
close as Texas could make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played like we were happy just to get within five,'' said
Muoneke, Texas' leading scorer who finished with 12 points on nine
shots. ``We took a couple of 3-pointers that we should have made.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke missed the front end of a one-and-one with 4:07
remaining and Kris Clack (14 points) missed two free throws with
2:38 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas took control with its defense. Leading 7-6, the Jayhawks
extended their advantage with a 13-2 run; five different Kansas
players scored points during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   And Texas' offense, which was feeble during the team's 2-7 start
this season, returned to that frigid form. The Longhorns went
nearly seven minutes between field goals. Mihm scored at 16:12 and
again at 9:44.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Mihm and the Longhorns, that were his only
first-half baskets. The sophomore center reflected Texas' woes with
a 2-of-11 shooting effort in the first 20 minutes. The Longhorns
were 7-of-34 for 20.6 percent, their worst shooting half of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   After point guard Ivan Wagner made the team's only first-half
3-pointer in 12 attempts _ a misdirected lob pass that went in _
the Longhorns missed 17 of their next 18 shots. Despite that
rim-rattling exhibition, Texas' deficit at halftime was a
manageable 33-22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team before the game that Kansas won at Missouri
because of offensive rebounding,'' said Texas coach Rick Barnes,
whose team shot 35.4 percent and was 4-of-23 on 3-pointers. ``We
were fighting uphill all night.'' \Ntagtop:Wendell Barnhouse, (817)

</P>
<P>
   Doing it with D Texas' pressure defense helped the Longhorns get
off to a quick start in Big 12 Conference play; however, last night
Texas' defense was unable to force enough steals and turnovers in
the Longhorns' 76-67 loss to Kansas. A look at Texas' turnovers and
steals in its past five games. Texas Opp. Opponent Stls TOs Score

THREE KEY MAVERICKS HOPE TO SIGN SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
DALLAS _ Sixty percent of the Mavericks' projected starting lineup
and a key reserve will be trying to sign new contracts or contract
extensions when the frenzied free-agent signing period starts,
probably sometime this week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rookie forward Dirk Nowitzki, free-agent forward Kurt Thomas and
free-agent forward Cedric Ceballos hope to sign deals with the
Mavericks before the season starts Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson said he's willing to
offer Ceballos a three-year deal if the dollar figures are right.
Ceballos made $2.5 million last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early last summer, \RCeballos'\S eyes were this big, and he
\Rthought he\S was going to get his $100 million,'' Nelson said.
``So now, they're getting into an area where we can compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to have Ced on our team, and we're going to try and
sign him. I'm getting excited about having Ced on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Slaughter, the agent who represents Ceballos, didn't know
his client had reduced his demands of a five- to seven-year
contract to three years until a reporter told him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas' demands of a two-year $4 million contract
probably won't be realized in Dallas. The Mavs are offering a
one-year, $1.3 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Also, guard Steve Nash and forward Samaki Walker expect to
receive contract extensions, and forward Ace Custis hopes to sign a
one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki, penciled in as a starter at small forward, is all but
assured of signing a five-year contract worth about $10 million.
Yesterday, Nelson said he hopes to sign Nash to a six-year contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson and his peers don't know the rules of the NBA's new
collective bargaining agreement. Under the old rules, the Mavs
could sign players like Nash and Walker to contract extensions
before the beginning of their third season.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson isn't sure if the old rules apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're assuming that window \Rto sign Nash and Walker\S is
still going to be there like it was, and we'd like to do that if it
is,'' he said. ``But if it isn't, we'll have to wait'' until after
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same with Samaki. But I would think that window is
still going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash and Walker want long-term deals with the Mavs, and Nelson
can offer each player at least a six-year extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to sign an extension and have a new contract that
will keep me in Dallas for a long time,'' Nash said. ``The sooner
we can do that, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker geared up forhis negotiating sessions by changing agents.
Over the weekend, he fired Norm Nixonand hired Dallas-based lawyer
Randy Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have a guy in town so you can be able to
communicate with him on a regular basis instead of having to go
long distance,'' Walker said. ``He can stop in and check on things
and see how things are going. It's more for a security blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a career here in Dallas, and this is the place where
I finish my career, Randy and I will have a long relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he doesn't mind if he gets his new contract signed
before or after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way will be good,'' he said. ``I'm not going to rush it
and I'm not going to worry about it. I'm just going to play
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also said rookie forward Ansu Sesay may be looking to
play for another team because he wants a guaranteed contract.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson gave last year's second-round pick, guard Bubba Wells, a
one-year, guaranteed contract for $250,000. But Nelson said that
only happened because the Mavericks had a roster spot available.
They don't have one this season.  &LR; tagtop:Dwain Price, (817)

FRANCHIONE SIGNS RICH DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ In TCU chancellor Michael Ferrari's mind, he
had to get football coach Dennis Franchione signed to a long-term
deal and soon.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's a statement that we feel we not only had to make but
wanted to make,'' Ferrari said. ``For us to have a football program
where our commitment is just marginal, if you will, in this
particular period of time just won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU put its money where its mouth has been, announcing yesterday
a new seven-year contract for Franchione worth up to $900,000 a
season after incentives.
</P>
<P>
   His contract also provides for a $1 million bonus if TCU wins a
national championship, raises for all of his assistant coaches and
a clause that allows him to leave for four schools _ Notre Dame,
Texas, Texas A&AMP;M and Arizona State _ with a smaller penalty than if
he went elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   TCU negotiated a prohibitive buyout, in excess of $1 million
according to sources, if Franchione leaves for anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was never really about finances, at least from my
standpoint,'' Franchione said. ``Obviously, you can't overlook
\Rthe money\S, but it was more about they wanted me to be here and
we wanted to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione had five years remaining on his previous contract
that paid him approximately $450,000 a season.
</P>
<P>
   He has experienced a honeymoon since his arrival in Fort Worth
in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   TCU recently finished its first season under Franchione,
improving from 1-10 in 1997 to 7-5, including a 28-19 upset of
Southern California in the Sun Bowl on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, winning is great, and I was as excited about the Sun
Bowl as anybody. But it's beyond that,'' Ferrari said. ``We're
really trying to build here, and this is an important piece of it
and there are going to be other pieces of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs athletic director Eric Hyman said he hopes this
sends a signal to TCU coaches of the school's seriousness about
building a nationally prominent athletic program.
</P>
<P>
   So has men's basketball coach Billy Tubbs called yet, looking to
renegotiate his contract?
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is smart enough that I don't have to call him,'' Tubbs
quipped. ``Honestly, I think this sends a good message to everybody
on where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Louden, TCU trustee and intercollegiate athletics
chairman, said TCU wants to be in line with Division I athletic
programs such as Texas and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the price of doing business in that league,'' Louden
said, ``and we are in that league.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione's contract gets him in line with high-profile
football coaches such as Longhorns coach Mack Brown and Wildcats
coach Hal Mumme. Brown recently signed a 10-year deal increasing
his compensation package to $850,000 a year, and Mumme's salary
jumped from $450,000 to $800,000 this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Ferarri said numbers involved with keeping an in-demand coach
like Franchione immediately grabbed his attention, but he figured
it would be more costly to let Franchione get away.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione's name surfaced as a possible candidate for openings
at Iowa, Colorado and Oklahoma openings. Iowa contacted Franchione
about interviewing after Hayden Fry stepped down, and Franchione
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that they would've been delighted to somehow be able to
recruit Franchione to Iowa, and they're just one,'' Ferrari said.
``We have a coach who can move to those schools and he will be
wooed by those schools increasingly. He's in that category and
that's where his salary ought to be commiserate with. That's the
statement we're making.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione's statement sounded almost identical, as he talked of
his plan for TCU to emerge as a national contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great time to be here,'' Franchione said of TCU.
``I really feel like with the people that are in place here that
the sky is the limit in what we can accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione, like Hyman and Ferrari, said he realizes TCU has
reached a crucial time period, attempting to establish itself as a
big-time player in Division I athletics before an expected round of
conference realignment begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We earned our stripes with this,'' Hyman said. ``We have
gained credibility.''

NEW INTERNET CENSORSHIP LAW WILL FAIL, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress passed another unconstitutional piece of legislation
last year and attached it as a rider to the 40-pound, 4,000-page
Omnibus Appropriations Bill. When President Clinton signed the bill
into law in October, the Internet censorship act became law, too _
bad law.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, members of Congress ignored the First Amendment's
proscription: ``Congress shall make no law ... abridging the
freedom of speech,'' and passed the Child Online Protection Act
(COPA). The law contains the same constitutional problems that were
found in the Communications Decency Act, which was struck down by a
unanimous vote of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the guise of protecting children from online smut, Congress
created a new federal crime. Anyone who knowingly makes material
that is ``harmful to minors'' available on the World Wide Web for
commercial purposes can be fined $50,000 and spend up to six months
in jail _ for each violation. Worse, a person can be fined $50,000
for each day that such material was made available.
</P>
<P>
   According to COPA, ``The term `minor' means any person under 17
years of age.'' And the term ``commercial purposes'' is broad
enough to include anyone using the Internet to gather or post
information while conducting research that might lead to
publication.
</P>
<P>
   COPA defines ``harmful to minors'' as any material that is
obscene, which is already illegal. However, ``harmful to minors''
also includes 1) material that the average person would find
appeals to a minor's prurient interest; 2) depicts sex acts in a
manner that is patently offensive to minors; and 3) ``taken as a
whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value for minors.'' All three conditions must be met before
material can be considered ``harmful to minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with First Amendment case law will recognize this
three-prong test as a variation on the Miller test from the U.S.
Supreme Court's decision in Miller vs. California (1973). The
courts use the Miller test to determine whether a book, movie,
video or other material is obscene.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here, however, is that an adult must guess what is
patently offensive to a minor and what would appeal to a minor's
prurient interest and what would lack serious literary value for a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   For most 15-year-old boys, almost any material that hints at
sex, even bra ads in the Sears catalogue, would appeal to their
prurient interest. And one could argue that it would be nearly
impossible to find sexual material that would be patently offensive
to boys that age.
</P>
<P>
   Would special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report, which details
the sex acts that Clinton and Monica Lewinsky allegedly committed,
be harmful to minors? Would Starr's report have political value for
a 16-year-old? Probably. But what about an 8-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   Yet Congress considered the report important enough to post on
the World Wide Web _ and rightfully so. Whether or not the public
agrees with Starr's allegations or the manner in which they were
described, the report is politically and historically significant
as part of the Republican Party's attempt to remove a Democratic
president from office.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the problem, then _ should law-abiding citizens only
post material on the Internet that would not offend or ``harm'' an
8-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   And that is precisely where COPA falls short. Speech that is
appropriate for adults, like a discussion of rapes in prison or
genital mutilation, may not be appropriate for young children _
nevertheless, the Internet cannot be limited to what is only
appropriate for them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Supreme Court's 1997 decision concerning the
constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act, Justice John
Paul Stevens wrote: ``In order to deny minors access to potentially
harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large amount of
speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to
address to one another. That burden on adult speech is unacceptable
if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in
achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to
serve.'' The high court has made this exact point in numerous cases
before 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Assistant Attorney General L. Anthony Sutin of the U.S.
Department of Justice sent a letter to the House Committee on
Commerce to spell out the department's objections to COPA. Sutin
wrote that attempting to enforce the provisions of the act would
divert ``investigative and prosecutorial resources that the
Department currently invests in combating traffickers of hard-core
pornography, in thwarting child predators, and in prosecuting
large-scale and multi district commercial distributors of obscene
materials.'' Sutin also noted that COPA has serious constitutional
flaws.
</P>
<P>
   It's axiomatic that when a law attempts to restrict
constitutionally protected speech based upon its content, the law
violates the First Amendment. Somehow, members of Congress fail to
understand this nation's long and honorable freedom of speech
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   COPA sweeps too broadly and too vaguely to be constitutional.
And it does not take the least restrictive means to achieve its
worthy goal of protecting children from speech they might find
shocking or disturbing _ and that is reason enough to toss this act
into the junk-pile of history.
</P>
<P>
   The act requires anyone who has a Web site that contains sexual
material to verify the age of those who wants to view the site. Age
verification technologies are prohibitively expensive. The
requirement would shut down many, if not most, educational Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union and 16 other plaintiffs
challenged COPA the day after it was signed into law. Judge Lowell
A. Reed Jr. of the Federal District Court in Philadelphia granted a
temporary restraining order that prohibits enforcement of the act
until Feb. 1. The judge noted that it is likely the ACLU would
prevail on the merits of some of their claims.
</P>
<P>
   If this case reaches the Supreme Court, we can expect the law to
be overturned with a finality that will strengthen free speech law
as it applies to the Internet. And that result will be well worth
the time and resources spent defending our First Amendment rights.

   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ In the Panama Canal, ships are raised like
toys, step by step, through three sets of locks to a height of 85
feet above sea level, on their way from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Pacific and back again.
</P>
<P>
   The vessels are tugged through the locks by ``mules,'' or
electric locomotives on train tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Each passage requires 52 million gallons of fresh water to
equalize the water levels in these locks.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, no pumps are used, meaning that gravity is all
that pulls the swirling water from the surrounding watershed into
the locks' chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 85 years after its completion, these 50 miles of man-made
ditch are still an engineering wonder to behold, and the most
popular tourist attraction in this Ohio-sized country.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Canal is one of the greatest civil engineering
achievements of this century, which are often referred to as the
Seven Wonders of the Modern World.
</P>
<P>
   The others are the Suez Canal, the Dneproges Dam in Ukraine, the
Alaska-Canada Highway, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Empire State
Building, and the Eifel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, this S-shaped isthmus has its share of white beaches,
dense rainforests, and colonial architecture.
</P>
<P>
   But so does Panama's better-marketed neighbor to the north,
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   What Costa Rica doesn't have, of course, is the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Situated between Costa Rica and Colombia, Panama links North and
South America and the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
</P>
<P>
   The Panama Canal runs northwest to southeast, utilizing locks at
both ends, an existing river and a man-made lake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the Panamanian government prepares to take control of
the canal and surrounding properties, a massive push has been
launched to attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Panama's always been a comfortable place for Americans to visit:
English is widely spoken, tap water is safe for drinking, and the
U.S. dollar is the official currency.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Panama Canal treaties signed in 1977, Panama will take
sole possession not only of the canal on Dec. 31, 1999, but also of
some 250,000 acres of land, along with seven U.S. military bases,
golf courses, movie theaters, airports and other installations
bordering the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is a giant part of the Panamanian government's plans to
redevelop these properties.
</P>
<P>
   Already underway are projects to build new hotels in the
rainforests and to re-establish passenger service within two years
on the 143-year-old Panama Railway that runs alongside the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Ardito Barletta directs the Inter-Oceanic Regional
Authority, the agency charged with overseeing foreign investment in
the converted areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 300 cruise ships passing through the canal every year
but none of them stop because we don't have the facilities to serve
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Panama's biggest goal is to build facilities on both the
Pacific and the Atlantic within five years that can accommodate up
to 250 cruise ships a year.
</P>
<P>
   And, for sure, the passengers on those ships will want to see
the canal.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors can see the canal at Miraflores Locks, which
offers an air-conditioned visitors center and an observation deck
where ships can be viewed as they pass through the locks.
</P>
<P>
   By October 1999, construction of a new, three-story visitors
center is due to be finished, complete with a higher observation
deck, as well as a bar, restaurant and interactive game area.
</P>
<P>
   Here, ships look like corks trying to squeeze through the
opening of a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locks are only 110 feet wide and the biggest ships are 106
feet wide, so there's only two feet of clearance on either side,''
explained Jamie Robleto, a tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   In general, it's easy to see why a French company employing a
small army went bankrupt trying to excavate this huge path in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The project was launched in 1882 and ended in disaster seven
years later with over 22,000 people dying from malaria and other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The United States took over the project in 1903 and finished
construction in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   At Miraflores Locks, a short film in English and a team of
bilingual guides provide visitors with all sorts of canal-related
facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, more than 13,100 ships traverse the canal each
year, paying tolls based on tonnage and number of passengers
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The highest toll was $141,344, paid by the Crown Princess Cruise
Ship in 1993. The lowest toll was 36 cents, paid by Richard
Halliburton, who swam the canal in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Miraflores Locks is just minutes by car from Panama City, the
oldest Spanish settlement on the American mainland which is really
three cities rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   Stone ruins are all that's left of Panama Vieja, the original
settlement burned in 1671 by pirate Henry Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   In its place is the colonial Casco Viejo, a picturesque section
of the city where white houses with ornamental iron balconies line
winding, narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the flashy, modern part of the city, where gleaming
high-rise banks and hotels dot the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of Panama's 2.8 million people live in and around
Panama City, which sits on the Pacific side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the canal an easy visit from Panama City, but the
capital is also a good point from which to set off on day-trips to
see the wildlife in the Soberania National Park and in the
rainforest part of the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, which
consists of the 3,800-acre Barro Colorado Island and five adjacent
peninsulas in the man-made Gatun Lake.
</P>
<P>
   In Panama, which boasts large, unspoiled forests, a fourth of
the land has been established as national parks and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barletta, 357 varieties of birds have been spotted
in one day by the National Audubon Society in some parts of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama has more biodiversity than even Costa Rica, it's just
that few people know about this,'' he said. ``We want to let people
know that, while the canal is the main thing, there's lots to see
here.''

   RESIDENTS-WANTED (Dalhart, Texas) _ Civic leaders in this Texas
Panhandle farm town are so desperate for workers that they are
offering bonuses for anyone who will move here and stay. Although
town leaders have been flooded by inquiries about the incentive
plan, only six people have taken advantage of it. By ROY BRAGG.

<P>
   SUGAR-OVERDOSE (Albany, N.Y.) _ Dr. Thomas Yannios, a clinical
nutritionist, says we eat too much sugar. Besides obesity and
dental decay, too much sugar can set the stage for diabetes and
heart disease. And the sugar craze is getting even worse because of
the national obsession with low-fat foods, which often add sugar to
improve flavor. By SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>

topiary, from how to water it to how to fertilize it. A Q&AMP;A. By

   NAVY-CLEANUP (San Francisco) _ California environmental
officials say the cleanup of toxic waste at several former Navy
bases in the San Francisco Bay area could be delayed if the Navy
does not provide at least $2.6 million for the project. By JANE
KAY.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-SATELLITES (San Francisco) _ The old joke that
Californians are ``spaced out'' has a whole new meaning. Like
fruitflies orbiting a frost-felled orange, ``environmental''
satellites orbit hundreds or thousands of miles above Earth. State
agencies increasingly use satellites to monitor the 800-mile
ecological wonderland from the Oregon border to the U.S./Mexico
line. By KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   BAND-WARS (Nacogdoches, Texas) _ Like the independent bookstore
fighting the giant chain, Mark Stephens' fight with Alto Tatum Band
&AMP; Music Co., the choice of East Texas band directors, will not be
easily won. Stephens owns BandWagon Music Co., and his case has
touched a nerve in Texas communities where the owners of small
music businesses say they, too, are victims of collusion between
school districts and big companies. By THADDEUS HERRICK.

<P>
   BOOK-TAPES (Undated) _ Set in a fictitious rural town in
northern Michigan, ``What Looks Like Crazy'' is the story of Ava
Johnson finding her place in the world after learning she is

   VAN-GOGH (Los Angeles) _ As we approach the start of the third
Christian millennium, it is probably safe to say that Vincent van

comprise the central chapter in the modern myth of madness and
creativity, is the most popular artist of the second millennium by
current standards of taste. By DAVID BONETTI.

   TV-PBS (Pasadena, Calif.) _ It is a spectacle worthy of a

There's no question that PBS is one of the most misunderstood
networks. By TIM GOODMAN.

   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The essential road to equality,

influence, try some encouraging words. You might change a life. By

the national obsession with low-fat foods, which often add sugar to

 &HT;    Raptors giving Ohio's Baker a shot at dream
 &HT;    By Marc Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Over the last seven years, since he left Ohio
State, Mark Baker has never given up the dream of playing in the
National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Baker hasn't made a team yet, but he has made the money. This
week, the 6-foot-1, 29-year-old former Dunbar High School
All-Ohioan, began a tryout with the NBA Toronto Raptors, and he's
doing it with a two-year guaranteed contract ready to be finalized
when the NBA lockout officially ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're rolling the dice,'' Raptors coach, Middletown native and
ex-UD assistant Butch Carter said as the NBA began gearing up again
following a half-season long lockout. ``Other teams wanted him, so
we decided to sign him early. Everyone's been on him. The scouts
were out watching CBA games. He is leading the league in assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready. He's totally ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his three varsity OSU years _ the Buckeyes were 70-23
and went to three NCAA tournaments while Baker amassed 424 assists,
third-best in school history _ Baker thought he was going straight
to the NBA. Instead, Charlotte and Atlanta cut him after tryouts,
and Baker began an odyssey that led him to the Continental
Basketball Association, Athletes In Action, United States
Basketball League, Austria, Italy and back to the CBA, where he
played earlier this season with Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the NBA lockout, more coaches and scouts saw CBA
teams play, and Baker was leading the league in assists when
Toronto made its offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is so unreal,'' Baker said from Toronto, where he
participated in informal work outs Sunday and Monday. ``God works
in impossible situations. His timing is perfect. I thought my time
was straight out of college. But He had to wait on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker admits he was not ready on the court, or off, when his
college career closed with a double overtime loss to Michigan in
the 1992 Regional final at Lexington. Although he could play
basketball all day, he refused to work on specific skills he needed
to hone. Off the court, he found God, a wife and now has children
that have refocused what he does with his free time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, my life is balanced out now,'' Baker said. ``I have
a sense of being proud of myself. I've worked for this. I want to
take it up higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker would not say how much his contract pays, but at the
newly-structured NBA minimums, first-year players are guaranteed
$287,500 and second-year players $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more money than I make at all the other jobs I have
together,'' said Baker, who has worked in the Dayton Job Corps, for
the Dayton Public Schools and promises to continue his free summer
basketball camp.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he expected to have four point guards in his camp,
which will begin today or Wednesday. He will keep two of them for
the regular season, which will begin the first week of February. In
addition to Baker and former UD guard Negele Knight (who Carter
coached as a UD assistant in 1990), Carter said he expects to have
two younger point guards trying out. Baker said he and Knight were
the only two point guards in camp Monday.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Waist deep in the big desert?
 &HT;    For release Jan. 20, 1999. Moved in advance because of the MLK
holiday. Resending for those who need it.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why, whenever I read of a further escalation of our conflict
with Iraq, do I hear, subliminally, the strains of Pete Seeger
singing ``Waist Deep in the Big Muddy?''
</P>
<P>
   How deep are we going to descend into this sandy void,
physically disparate to Vietnam's ``Big Muddy'' but tactically just
as dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   During those somewhat glorious-sounding days of Desert Storm in
1991, it was golden the way we responded to our men and women
kicking Saddam Hussein's posterior. Overnight, heroes were born:
Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf and Dick Cheney at the top along
with thousands of others, trudging the sandy battlefield with gas
masks at their sides.
</P>
<P>
   We later found out, of course, that despite the efforts of our
troops, pilots and sailors, what we thought was the objective had
not been attained: Hussein still was there. We were told,
afterward, that Hussein never was the target, just his missiles and
germs.
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's posterior may have been kicked but he remains a pain
in ours.
</P>
<P>
   These years later _ support for continued enforcement of United
Nations sanctions eroding in the world community _ we are back at
it trying to keep our foot on the neck of Hussein; us and the
British, with vocal support from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Israel and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the Iraqis were somewhat right when they charged
that the U.N. inspection teams were spying for the U.S., something
we denied emphatically until faced with documentation. And then the
U.S. poured doublespeak into the media to muddle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   With each day new activity arises, much of it inspired by the
acrimonious Iraqi leadership, which is trying desperately to
position itself as the aggrieved victim of U.S. intransigence, a la
Fidel Castro. Sadly, it's working.
</P>
<P>
   As activity accelerates over no-fly zones and in saber-rattling
from Baghdad toward Kuwait, as missiles fly here and there, we are
going to reach a day when a U.S. or British plane will be shot
down. And with that comes the possibility of one or more of our
people, dead or alive, being dragged through the streets of
Baghdad, or hung from a lamppost, or forced to confess through
bruised lips that he intentionally bombed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in Somalia, and so disturbed were the
American people by the sight of American dead being dragged through
the streets that we had to get out and leave Somalia to its
warlords.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened to us in Vietnam. In the earliest days of
our involvement, the gullible among us _ including me _ rallied
around what we thought was the right cause. Others, early on, saw
through the deceits proferred not by the valiant young Americans in
combat, but by the likes of the Pentagon, Lyndon Johnson and Robert
McNamara.
</P>
<P>
   It took 50,000 dead, emphasized by the gruesome visuals sent
back to us through TV, magazines and newspapers, before we realized
the pit into which we had descended _ that Big Muddy _ and our
inability to achieve success.
</P>
<P>
   Our policy toward Iraq is in disarray, our former Allies queasy
about our itchy trigger fingers. How soon will it be before more
troops are called to the sands to defend Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, or
to contain Iraq _ whichever you believe the mission to be?
</P>
<P>
   And whatever happened to the U.N.; wasn't this their thing?
</P>
<P>
   The nation needs to pause and study what we're getting into. If
Saddam Hussein still isn't the target, if we're still only intent
in setting back his war machine a year at a time, then turn up the
volume on that old Seeger anti-war song.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Television needs another Flip Wilson
 &HT;    (Illustration available.)
 &HT;    By Todd C. Duncan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a situation in the media that pops up from time to time
when a prominent person's death goes relatively unnoticed because
they died during a busy news cycle or, worse, a major holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case in the death of Clerow ``Flip'' Wilson. The
versatile comic and 1970s television star died during the
Thanksgiving holiday at age 64.
</P>
<P>
   His obituary didn't make the front page of most newspapers and
was barely mentioned by the talking hairpieces who staff nightly
news and celebrity programs.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of our disposable culture to properly recognize Flip
Wilson and his legacy is unfortunate. He was much more than a man
who hosted a variety show.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970-75 span of ``The Flip Wilson Show,'' Wilson
created numerous offbeat and funny characters, none more so than
Geraldine, the sassy temptress who was able to seduce and outwit
the show's guest stars, including comedy and Hollywood legends Bob
Hope, Bing Crosby, Jack Benny and Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of the brief tributes and stories since the
comic's death have focused on the one character that found Wilson
in a dress. Geraldine was hilarious and unforgettable, but Wilson's
show was more than a showcase for a comic in drag.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's comic catch-phrases remain part of our culture. ``The
devil made me do it.'' ``What you see is what you get.'' ``When
you're hot, you're hot; when you're not, you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   And how many lovers have been eyed sitting in ``a booth in the
back, in the corner, in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   His humor had the ability to cut through the racial upheaval of
the time by filling a need that both blacks and whites have in
common _ the need to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making whites more comfortable with blacks'
growing presence in the nation's mainstream and giving blacks
something to laugh about without being the butt of the joke, Wilson
helped pave the way for today's black television stars. It's a
legacy many of them are staining.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of today's programs targeted to African-Americans,
Wilson's humor was never structured to embrace or exploit the worst
of black behavior. Wilson's jokes, usually unraveled in stories and
fables, were humorous tales where characters _ even those from the
streets _ had dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Even the episodes with slick-talking Rev. Leroy of the Church of
What's Happening Now managed to parody the black clergy and its
parishioners without beating viewers over the head with a
nauseating stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny is not a color,'' Wilson once said, responding to
critics who suggested that the show ignored America's racial gulf
and might not be ``black'' enough. ``Being black is only good from
the time you get from the microphone to the curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   Now shows and characters have to be ``black'' all the time. And
this hideous definition of ``black'' usually consists of stupidity,
slang, ignorance, questionable morality, physical exaggerations
and, of course, some form of dancing, singing or rapping. Watching
the buffoonish, buck-eyed antics of Martin Lawrence's character on
the hit show ``Martin'' is enough to make intelligent
African-Americans weep.
</P>
<P>
   During Wilson's reign, families, both black and white, could
gather around the television and watch his show without anyone
feeling offended or guilty. Modern shows are so laced with racial
barbs and crude sexual banter that it's virtually impossible not to
be offended
</P>
<P>
   Even Chris Rock, whose highly charged, intelligent humor is a
breath of fresh air compared with today's foul-smelling
entertainment, can't match the subtle clarity of Wilson's comedy.
</P>
<P>
   It seems we've taken a step backward from Wilson's vision. In
today's segregated television, blacks can't see themselves on
``Friends'' and whites don't watch much WB. Wilson let us take a
fun-filled peek at our common frailties and joys without race
obscuring the view.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, at least one cable show airs old ``Flip Wilson
Show'' episodes. It's a chance for viewers who were old enough to
catch the show when it originally aired to get a second look at
television history. And for viewers not old enough to remember
Wilson _ or who have never heard of any show older than ``The Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air'' _ it's a great opportunity see an
African-American comic just being funny.

 &HT;    What a mess on top of Hyde's desk
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ So far, I haven't been paying much attention
to the Senate
</P>
<P>
   goings-on in Washington. I've decided to save myself for the
Gilbert &AMP; Sullivan
</P>
<P>
   version which, unfortunately, probably won't hit the boards for
a while considering it took almost 200 years to set the Declaration
of Independence to
</P>
<P>
   music (``1776''). I just hope somebody has the foresight to
preserve Chief Justice Rehnquist's designer robe for the stage
version.
</P>
<P>
   But something I saw on the front page of last Wednesday's paper
set me to
</P>
<P>
   wondering about the whole procedure. It was a photo of House
Judiciary
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Henry Hyde at his desk working on an opening
statement for
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   What a mess! If the litter on the chairman's desktop is any
indication of the
</P>
<P>
   organization of the case against the president, our fearless
leader hasn't a
</P>
<P>
   thing to worry about. In that disaster, the Senate could very
well wind up impeaching Michael Jordan and offering Bill Clinton a
seven-figure contract
</P>
<P>
   with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Messy desks are the result of messy minds,'' my father used to
say whenever
</P>
<P>
   he'd see the utter chaos of my workspace and although he tried
to appear calm
</P>
<P>
   when lamenting my preference for working in the midst of what he
frequently
</P>
<P>
   referred to as ``Elizabeth's sty,'' his anguish would often show
as he pleaded with me to get organized.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I was a junior in high school, Daddy had taken
serious exception to my study habits (loose term for a taut
subject). He pictured me at his desk in the living room where the
light was proper and profound silence would encourage similar
thought. He even tried bribery. If I agreed to give his way a try
then he'd let me take the family car to the drive-in and show off
for my friends. That kind of worked, but it kind of didn't.
</P>
<P>
   For three nights, I studied my father's way. On the fourth, I
wheeled into the drive-in and broadsided Donny Baxter's '39
Mercury. Neither Donny nor the Merc was a pretty sight after our
Ford ``Woody'' wagon finished chewing on it. I was grounded until I
was 40 and lacking incentive, slid back into the old routine.
</P>
<P>
   My idea of homework heaven was books and papers scattered around
the bed and me plopped down in the middle of it all memorizing
``Out, out, damned spot
</P>
<P>
   ... !'' and listening to Frankie Laine wail ``Mule Train'' on my
bedside radio.
</P>
<P>
   One unfortunate night, in the midst of a paper on Lady Macbeth,
I lost control of my fountain pen and spewed ink on the chenille
bedspread. The next morning over oatmeal, I asked permission to buy
a new spread. Daddy rattled his Herald and cracked wise. ``Why
would you want a new spread? It's been years since anyone has seen
the top of your bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later I moved into my first apartment. Daddy came to visit
and taught
</P>
<P>
   me that refrigerators had to be defrosted and window sills
washed. He worried
</P>
<P>
   that my utilities would be cut off when he found bills in a
stack of mail that I'd shoved under one foot of the kitchen table
to keep it from wobbling. He was also concerned that a plague was
breeding in the hydrator drawer of my refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've gotten better at it. Now I have a four-drawer
file cabinet where I cram important stuff that I used to pile on
the attic steps, and I keep a desk calendar for reminders to pay
bills. In fact, I'm a little bit worried. This morning I caught
myself aligning the file baskets with the wood grain on my desk.
</P>
<P>
   So, out of patriotic concern, I've written to Rep. Hyde and
offered to help him clean up his act. He hasn't taken me up on it
yet and I'm thinking my letter may have been lost in the mess on
his desk which leads me to wonder: Are we ready for an NBA season
with Bill Clinton starting at forward for the Bulls?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Prosecuting the prosecutors
 &HT;    (EDS: This is the column that normally would move on Monday,
being resent today for those who need it.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps we have Ken Starr's obsessions and excesses to thank,
but for whatever reason there is a boomlet of attention these days
to over-the-top prosecutions _ welcome if it leads to reforms.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the process is still in its Holy Cow! discovery phase,
recently advanced by a chilling Chicago Tribune investigative
series.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are all the more spooky for the severe limits the
report set for itself. It looked only at homicide convictions
thrown out because prosecutors either suppressed evidence favorable
to defendants or knowingly used false evidence. It did not examine
similar missteps in prosecuting other serious crimes or other
prosecutorial misbehaviors.
</P>
<P>
   Even within those narrow straits, going back nationally 36 years
to the seminal Supreme Court ruling outlawing such abuses, the
reporters found 381 homicide convictions thrown out because
prosecutors cheated defendants out of fair trials. And it's a good
guess, approaching a dead cinch, many more railroadings went
unproved or undetected.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven defendants were sentenced to death and at least one
was executed before the prosecutorial misconduct was discovered.
The convicted have served as long as 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   In one case prosecutors depicted paint _ and in another, hog's
blood _ as human blood. Prosecutors have overcome self-defense
arguments by hiding weapons the slain were carrying. One convicted
a woman by hiding evidence her husband committed suicide. Another
prosecuted parents by hiding evidence wild dogs killed their
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   And the Tribune series is far from the whole story. PBS's
``Frontline'' did a rip recently on the increasing use of dubious
snitches, typically convicts angling for reduced sentences, to send
marginal drug offenders _ even innocent bystanders _ to prison for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   It was unease with such deals that led a three-judge federal
appellate panel in Denver last year to order a new trial for a
woman convicted of drug charges on the word of a man who has been
promised leniency for his testimony. The judges said the practice,
though common, violated bribery statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The full appellate court has reversed that ruling, but the
exercise will have been helpful if it draws more skeptical scrutiny
to the practice; defense attorneys may start forcing that.
</P>
<P>
   Overwrought prosecution would be cooled, too, if Congress and
the states scaled back the absurdly long sentences they enacted for
drug offenses in political hysteria years ago. The pointless
severity incites unjust bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, the courts must begin holding outlaw prosecutors to
serious account. Three in Illinois are on trial for framing a man
who served 10 years in prison _ potentially the first ever to face
felony sentences for such misconduct. Indeed, the Tribune found no
prosecutor has ever been publicly punished by professional
discipline agencies, much less convicted, for withholding evidence
or presenting false evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Overzealous prosecution is due a dose of properly zealous
prosecution.

 &HT;    DREAMSVILLE: Around the lake in one day
 &HT;    (''Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in which readers share
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   We knew something was up the second day Dad came home carrying
another 5-gallon can of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Each day he carefully poured the gas through a large
chamois-lined funnel into our open-top touring car.
</P>
<P>
   We had watched the many laborious steps necessary for readying
the car for summer driving.
</P>
<P>
   The car's motor was brought up from the basement and
re-installed. Water and oil then were added.
</P>
<P>
   Tires were put on the rim and inflated with a hand pump, after
which the complete wheel was attached to the axle.
</P>
<P>
   Now the car could be lowered from the blocks it sat upon all
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Spring was definitely here, and my older brother and sister and
I knew we would soon be able to go for our Sunday ride _ but we
suspected, too, that there were some plans we had not been told
about.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the news was broken. We were to drive around the lake
in one day, a distance of almost 100 miles!
</P>
<P>
   We were beside ourselves with anticipation when Sunday morning
finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 a.m. we were on the road, speeding along at 20 mph, making
the most of the good roads near towns while they lasted. Farther
along, on stretches between towns, the roads were little more than
wagon trails.
</P>
<P>
   We had traveled almost 20 miles before we had our first blowout.
</P>
<P>
   It was to be expected, and Dad got out the jack and raised the
wheel with the flat tire, pulled the tire from the rim and removed
the tube.
</P>
<P>
   He'd patch it if it was repairable or, if not, insert a new
tube, and then replace the wheel on the car and inflate the tire to
proper pressure using a one-cylinder hand pump.
</P>
<P>
   When a larger-than-usual hill appeared, we would get a running
start, but if the hill was too steep, we might stall halfway up.
</P>
<P>
   My brother, who was almost 14, had the job of getting out and
putting a rock behind the rear wheel to prevent the car from
rolling back. Sometimes all the passengers had to walk up.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of roaring starts, we'd finally reach the top
only to find that the radiator was boiling over. Then we would have
to wait until it cooled off.
</P>
<P>
   It was not long before we ran into our first blinding rainstorm.
The top had to be put up and side curtains fastened. By the time we
had everything snug, the rain stopped.
</P>
<P>
   After the rain we came upon a stretch of wet, red clay that was
slippery as butter, and we were soon in a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Dad walked to the nearest farm house for help. The farmer
hitched up his team and came to pull us out, at a nominal charge.
</P>
<P>
   We asked the farmer what he did for business when it didn't
rain. ``Water the road,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   By noon we were halfway around the lake and stopped at a
beautiful vista overlooking the water. Here we rested and enjoyed a
picnic lunch of sandwiches, potato salad and lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   From there we would be passing through cities, and the roads
improved. Paved roads were wide enough for only one car. When two
vehicles met, each had to drive halfway on the pavement and halfway
on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived home by 8:30 p.m. after a most exciting day, having
traveled some 100 miles with only four blowouts, two radiator
boil-overs and two misadventures into ditches.
</P>
<P>
   We went to bed tired and happy.

   COMMENTARY: There's something compelling about nice, round
numbers
</P>
<P>
   By Marilyn Geewax
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Deeply religious. Married with young children. Suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   International terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police say all of those descriptions fit the Concerned
Christians, a group of fanatics who left Denver to live in the
suburbs of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Israeli officials deported 14 of the Christians,
saying the cult's goal was to commit ``extreme acts of violence''
and spark a shootout with police this year to hasten the second
coming of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Shooting at police to bring back Jesus?
</P>
<P>
   As crazy as that sounds, cult experts say the Coloradans are not
alone in believing that wild events will surround the dawn of 2000.
As the millennium clock counts down, many more cuckoo birds are
expected to pop out.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are rampant in Jerusalem that soon ``the city will be
flooded with a lot of crazy Christians,'' David Parsons, director
of the International Christian Embassy in Jerusalem, told The
Denver Post recently.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just crazy people who are getting agitated about
the approach of 2000. Millions of ordinary Christians, with no
violent tendencies or cult ties, also believe that Jan. 1, 2000,
will bring about some type of apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of beliefs are not new. Historians say that as the
year 1000 approached, many medieval Christians became convinced
that the end was near. To prepare for the arrival of the Antichrist
and the Last Judgment, mass pilgrimages were made to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout France, large processions formed, with believers
clutching relics of the saints. As it happened, Jan. 1, 1000,
passed quietly.
</P>
<P>
   So what is it about triple-zero years that triggers this fear of
apocalypse? Is there really something special about millennium
years?
</P>
<P>
   Not if you think about it. The primary reason that an ``000''
date gets extra attention is because it supposedly marks another
period of 1,000 years since Christ's birth. And the figure 1,000
has significance for many Christians.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Testament's Book of Revelation, there is a prediction
of 1,000 years of peace before a final battle between Satan and the
forces of good. So some people attach religious meaning to
1,000-year chunks of time.
</P>
<P>
   However, most historians are certain that in the sixth century,
when Dionysius Exiguus created the template for our current
calendar (on orders of Pope John I), he miscalculated the year in
which Jesus was born. Most scholars say his birth occurred before 4
B.C. because two of the Gospels report that Herod the Great was
alive when Jesus was born. And Herod died in what would now be
calculated as 4 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the 2,000th anniversary of Jesus Christ's birth
passed placidly in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But knowing that the year 2000 does not literally mark the two
millennia since Christ's birth probably won't do much to discourage
intense interest in the date, at least in Western civilization.
That's because people steeped in our system of mathematics have a
fascination with round numbers. No one can explain exactly why we
love zeros, but we all instinctively know that a 10th wedding
anniversary calls for a bigger celebration than the ninth. And
that's why so many of us stare at our odometers when they hit
10,000 miles, or even better, 100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   So to make Dec. 31, 1999, a really special night, drive an old
car this year to get the odometer up to 99,999. Buy a 10-year-old
bottle of champagne. Then just before midnight, drive around the
block until you hit 100,000 miles. Park. Count down from 10. Pop
the cork and toast the ancient Arab mathematicians who invented the
zero.

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Group warns AIDS infection rate on rise
 &HT;    (EDS: This is a compilation of health stories which moved to the
wires this week.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After years of holding steady, HIV infection rates are
rising among young gay men in Atlanta, possibly because of
recreational drug abuse, an AIDS advocacy group is warning.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is unprotected sex that occurs when people are high
and their inhibitions are low, due to the influence of psychedelic
drugs like Ecstasy and crystal methamphetamine, say AID Atlanta
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a steady increase in the number of positive (HIV)
test results, particularly among young gay men,'' said Mark King,
director of education at the AIDS service organization.
``Anecdotally, what we're hearing is that very often substance
abuse has been a factor in their infection.''
</P>
<P>
   AID Atlanta reports that the number of positive test results in
1998 jumped by nearly 50 percent over 1997 figures _ even though
the agency performed fewer tests overall in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 2.7 percent of 4,144 people tested for HIV were
positive for the AIDS virus, compared to 1.8 percent of 4,290
tested in 1997. Before 1997, the percentage of positive HIV tests
had been flat for several years, so the spike in numbers raised
immediate concerns, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny tube can open arteries, stop pain
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At 76, Max Frenkel lost two of the joys
of his life _ ballroom dancing and table tennis _ to legs that were
crippled by clogged circulation. A decade ago, Frenkel's problem
would have been dismissed as an unfortunate function of aging that
medical science could do little to rectify.
</P>
<P>
   But today Frenkel is recovering, evidence of what physicians are
calling a quiet revolution in cardiovascular surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny metal tube, about a half-inch long, that could easily be
mistaken for the spring in a ballpoint pen is what put the bounce
back in Frenkel's feet.
</P>
<P>
   It is called a stent, and few inventions in the 1990s have made
such powerful impacts in so many different arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a dramatic increase in the use of stents
throughout the circulation (system),'' said Dr. Barry Katzen,
medical director of the Miami Cardiac and Vascular Institute. ``The
quiet revolution is that we have developed more applications to
address quality of life issues in ways we haven't been able to
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In stenting, a surgeon inserts the coil _ usually a cage of
surgical-grade stainless steel that resembles chicken wire _ by
running a catheter through a small incision made to the femoral
artery in the groin. A mild sedative to aid relaxation is used, but
not a general anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors ask patients to move or breathe deeply so that x-rays
can be taken to direct the catheter to the proper place where the
stent is deployed.
</P>
<P>
   A balloon containing the stent is threaded to the weak spot; the
balloon is deflated, and the stent spring-loads into place. A
typical procedure lasts 90 minutes and patients are released from
the hospital after about two days.
</P>
<P>
   The stent acts as latticed scaffolding, permanently implanting
itself into the wall of the vessel, holding it open and preventing
it from collapsing again, an occurrence called restenosis.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Frenkel had angioplasty without the stent and his
symptoms returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell the difference with the stents,'' he said. ``I
think it definitely feels better with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Women urged to get more folic acid
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some 4,000 pregnancies in the United States every year
are affected by neural tube defects, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 2,400 babies are born with major defects, such as spina
bifida, which can cause paralysis, mental retardation, and a fatal
condition called anencephaly (incomplete formation of the brain).
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 percent to 70 percent of these defects could be
prevented if women consumed adequate daily amounts of folic acid in
their diet or through vitamin supplements, the CDC estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Folate is a B vitamin naturally found in leafy green vegetables,
citrus fruits and other foods. It is also called folic acid when
synthetically added to vitamins and food. In an effort to reduce
birth defects, the Food and Drug Administration required folic acid
additives in a wide variety of food, beginning last January. Flour,
bread, rolls, pasta, rice and cereal are among the fortified foods
on grocery shelves. If the label says ``enriched flour,'' the
product contains folic acid.
</P>
<P>
   However, women of childbearing age still may not be getting
enough folate when they need it most _ during the first weeks of
pregnancy. Doctors recommend that all women capable of getting
pregnant be getting adequate folic acid all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really too late, the damage may have already been done,
by the time most women realize they are pregnant,''said Dr. Paul
Fernhoff, associate professor of pediatrics at Emory University's
division of medical genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Women should consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid
daily. But most women get only half of that amount, said Dr. Joe
Mulinare, acting chief of CDC's Prevention and Health
Communications Branch.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the March of Dimes Resource Center,
1-888-663-4637; Web site: http://www.modimes.org.; or the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention: 770-488-7190

 &HT;    College savings plans popular, but shop carefully
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   More and more people are jumping into college savings plans that
allow them to defer taxes on their investment income until the kids
are in college.
</P>
<P>
   When New York opened its 529 plan _ named after the section of
the law that set them up _ it took in $90 million in only four
months. That represents investments for 25,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, sign-ups are accelerating. More than 200,000
accounts were opened in 1998, according to the College Savings Plan
Network. That brings the total to about 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what the soccer moms want,'' said Marshall Bennett, the
Mississippian who chairs the CSPN. ``The middle-class has had to
depend on debt to pay for college. The rich could always pay for
it. But the middle-class needed some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the popularity: ``It's a way to save for
college and to earn tax breaks at the same time,'' said Mike
Fitzgerald, who oversees the Iowa program.
</P>
<P>
   The programs are sponsored and administered by state
governments. Thirty-four states have programs now. Georgia does not
have a college savings plan, but a number of other states accept
out-of-state accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rules vary from state to state, but the pattern is the same.
Anyone _ parent, grandparent, even a friend _ can set up a child's
account. Any number of people can contribute to it. Every plan has
a limit on maximum lifetime contributions, usually about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The money is invested for you in predetermined ways. In the New
Hampshire plan, for example, Fidelity splits your money among stock
and bond mutual funds and possibly a money market. The asset
allocations shift over the years, moving toward more stable
investments as the child nears college age.
</P>
<P>
   The donor has to pay current income taxes on his or her
contribution. But the earnings are sheltered. The income tax bill
is deferred until the money comes out. Then it is taxed at the
child's tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend the money for college expenses, including room and
board, at any accredited post-high school institution in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The option to spend it anywhere makes college savings plans a
lot more attractive than their predecessors, prepaid tuition plans.
Those were almost always limited to colleges in the state that
sponsored the program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those prepaid tuition plans are still being offered and
draw contributions from more conservative families. Shop carefully.
</P>
<P>
   The plans have numerous differences. The chart shows, for
example, some types of investments offered by several states'
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Expense levels can vary, too. Vanguard charges Iowans .31
percent a year for management expenses. It is among the cheapest
for college savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Iowa has by far the lowest ceiling on annual
donations. Any person can deposit no more than $2,000 a year in any
child's account. To beat that limit, each parent _ or anybody else
at all _ could contribute $2,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   You can make direct contact with state agencies through the
College Savings Plans Network. Go to http://www.collegesavings.com
or call 877-277-6496.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison of all the available state plans can be found at
http://Www.kiplinger.com.
</P>
<P>
   There are some drawbacks to the college savings plans, or at
least points to consider carefully. Chief among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ As noted, you have no control over how your money is invested.
</P>
<P>
   _ You can't move to a different investment if you don't like the
results your plan gets.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are cash penalties if you take money out of a plan for
anything except education. That could be exasperating if one or all
your kids decided not to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   _ The biggest advantage comes to those who can invest a lot
while their kids are young. That gives the investments plenty of
time to grow. One possible strategy: Encourage grandparents, when
they're in a giving mood, to consider a college savings plan.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Yankee hits paydirt with
'Stonewall's Gold'
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In J.D. Salinger's classic coming-of-age novel, ``The Catcher in
the Rye,'' Holden Caulfield reflects on how great it would be if
after you've read a book you really like, you could just call up
the author and talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the great things about being a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that I phoned Robert J. Mrazek (pronounced
``muh-RAZ-ik''), who you've probably never heard of but most likely
will. He's hit paydirt with his first novel, ``Stonewall's Gold''
($22.95, St. Martin's Press), new in bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the final winter of the Civil War, the story is told
through the voice of a 15-year-old Southerner, Jamie Lockhart, as
he makes his way across the wilds of Virginia in search of a secret
cache of Yankee bullion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treasure Island'' meets ``Cold Mountain,'' as it were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stonewall's Gold'' is an easy read, just over 200 pages. The
beauty of the book is that it can appeal to almost any audience,
from adolescents to senior adults, a novel of suspense and intrigue
woven into the fabric of Civil War history.
</P>
<P>
   But don't take my word for it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reader's Digest is including ``Stonewall's Gold'' in its May
edition of condensed books.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Literary Guild is offering ``Stonewall's Gold'' as its
alternate selection for February.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hollywood already has made no less than three offers for the
movie rights, all of which Mrazek turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Ask the author:
</P>
<P>
   ``I cherish this fantasy that if the book does halfway decently
I'd have some role in writing the screenplay,'' Mrazek said,
speaking from his home in Washington, D.C. ``That's why I've held
back selling it.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some horrible Hollywood treatments of otherwise
wonderful stories, Mrazek said, and ``I don't see Buffy the Vampire
Slayer playing Katharine.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Katharine Danridge, the beautiful young woman who joins
Jamie in her own quest, to seek revenge on the renegades who
murdered her father.
</P>
<P>
   But not to tell too much. Better that you read it for yourself.
Suffice that I tell you about Mrazek, whose own life makes
interesting reading.
</P>
<P>
   He's a Yankee, having grown up in Long Island, N.Y. If you hold
that against him, I probably shouldn't mention that he also served
as a cnongressman from New York, 1983 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he ventured South to our nation's capital with his
wife and children, and eventually came to love the backwoods folks
of Virginia, having acquired a cabin in the northwest Shenandoah
Valley where the family spent weekends and vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're rural and independent, and some of them still didn't
have electricity,'' Mrazek said. ``These were our neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent enough time with them that I really felt I had
acquired an insight into their spirit of independence.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how he developed the story line for ``Stonewall's Gold.''
Thanks to a ``lifetime of compulsive reading'' of Civil War books,
he came to task well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   This ``first novel'' is actually his third. Two others never
found a publisher. His overnight success has been a long night's
journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extraordinarily surprised,'' Mrazek said of the reception
``Stonewall's Gold'' is enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a time when glory is defined by how many television cameras
a celebrity can attract during 15 minutes of fame, it's rewarding
that a book embracing the values of heroism, sacrifice and honor
can find an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Those, of course, being Southern values, suh.

 &HT;    Blackfamilies.com: Resource-rich site targets underserved Web
audience
 &HT;    WITH ILLUSTRATION
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The African-American Web surfer belongs to one of the
fastest-growing user groups on the Web. By 2003, it's expected more
than 14 million African-Americans will be online.
</P>
<P>
   Blackfamilies.com, launching Monday, Martin Luther King Day, is
the newest Web site hoping to tap into this growing user group. The
site comes from Cox Interactive Media, part of Cox Enterprises,
which owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Based in Atlanta, the
site is part of a grass-roots electronic community springing up
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   A quick Yahoo! search shows 140 sites targeted at the
African-American community, but only two _ both based in Atlanta _
aim to provide a variety of resources.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Richard Kenyada was an electrical engineer in
Decatur who, along with a group of friends, ran an electronic
discussion area, Society of Voices, on a radio station's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Participants talked about problems facing Atlanta's black
community and possible solutions. ``We started to think we had so
many people with so many talents and since we're all local, maybe
we should do something,'' Kenyada says. ``So I started a column
called `Mr. Kenyada's Neighborhood' on the radio station's site.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort was short-lived. The radio station redesigned its Web
site, and Kenyada's message board was, as he puts it, ``lost in
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenyada decided to build his own Web site, one aimed at the
African-American community that would provide phone numbers, Web
links and other types of support. The site, dubbed Mr. Kenyada's
Neighborhood (http://www.kenyada.com) narrowed its focus to south
DeKalb County and two basic issues _ computer literacy and teen
pregnancy prevention. Kenyada says the focus has recently narrowed
to computer literacy. ``We felt computer literacy would help the
black family and in turn help stop teen pregnancy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There are many statistics demonstrating the black community lags
behind its white counterparts in computer ownership and Internet
use, but the number that captured Kenyada's attention was the fact
only 64 percent of African-Americans with household incomes of
$75,000 and above had computers in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of money,'' he says. ``It's a question of
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, Kenyada tells of a conversation he had
with a black salesperson who told him she's had a computer but that
it stayed in the box it came in for two years before she had a
friend hook it up. He says sites such as his that talk about
issues, history and culture relevant to African-Americans will
drive users of all backgrounds online. ``Now she can't wait to get
on the Internet,'' Kenyada says, ``because she knows there is
content there for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just think (the Web) is a lot of high-tech
geek talk. They don't see any connection to their lives, or their
history, music from the old days, or the jazz or the poetry,'' he
says. ``As we let people know what exists, more people will come
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Cox Interactive site (http://www.blackfamilies.com) is
beautifully designed and filled with information, entertainment,
and health and parenting tips, with a slew of high-profile sponsors
including Procter &AMP; Gamble and Barnes &AMP; Noble. Brand manager for
the site, John Pembroke, says it, like Mr. Kenyada's Neighborhood,
is designed to be a resource for African-American adults.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pembroke says Blackfamilies.com isn't a site just for
parents. ``Our site is an African-American family Web site, and
parenting is a major part of it,'' he says. ``But if you are a
single adult, you are still part of a family. We want to address a
variety of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is based in Cox Interactive's Atlanta studio and is
intended for a national audience. It will be updated throughout the
day with news and current events.
</P>
<P>
   The site also draws on the resources of Cox Interactive Media
and incorporates a search engine, LookSmart, that allows users to
search the site, the entire Web or just African-American-related
sites.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting aspects of Blackfamilies.com is its
shopping area, which will feature products and services of interest
to African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at product categories for African-American users,
it's very similar to general users, but the products are very
different. Amazon may have a book from John Grisham; we may have
Walter Mosely or Toni Morrison,'' says Pembroke. He calls it
targeted shopping, or offering products that serve a niche market.
Advertisers and commerce partners want to communicate their
messages to sell products to this audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are we trying to deliver useful content and
resources,'' Pembroke says, ``but we are looking to build a
community online. We want to be a resource to our audience with a
lot of content resources and reference links.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Cox and Kenyada believe resource sites for
African-Americans can go a long way toward bringing more users
online. ``There are lots of sites for African-Americans,'' Kenyada
says, ``but they are in a specific category or a list or sites. We
started out just trying to do a couple of specific things, but
people love it because it's positive information.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Oh, heavenly January; Central Texas deserved this
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The game-day image from Minnesota made one want to
put a blanket over one's feet: Bundled beings guarding fishing
holes drilled into feet-deep ice.
</P>
<P>
   I was marveling at how anyone would want to spend a leisure day
entrenched on a frozen lake, even if a 60-pound muskellunge were
eyeing one's hook.
</P>
<P>
   Then my oldest son helped remind me what I was forsaking by
camping in front of the TV, remote in hand, with the NFC
championship game as my hook.
</P>
<P>
   He needed a ride to the park to meet up with friends. Reluctant
to budge, I resolved to give him that ride and then hustle back to
the game. But after tasting what was outside, I hurried home,
pushed ``record'' on the VCR, and told our youngest son we were
running for daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, no one was hurt. Thousands of Central Texans, at
full gallop, were on that course.
</P>
<P>
   The azure above us was unbroken except for an occasional jet
trail. The sun, so unmerciful four months ago, was just mirthful
now in the mid-70s.
</P>
<P>
   The park was a scene of all seasons. At a backstop a father and
son took batting practice. On the asphalt path rollerbladers
whisked around and around.
</P>
<P>
   A yellow frisbee and a Day-Glo soccer ball darted back and
forth. My youngest and I were on the blacktop where he staked his
claim as heir to Air Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It was so nice as to be illegal, this January day.
</P>
<P>
   If we don't watch it, we Central Texans will miss another
winter, just like the last winter that never came. Yes, we've had
hard frosts and stiff winds that brought the dogs in. But the key
word much of the time has been mild, and that's certainly the word
in this third week in January.
</P>
<P>
   This is a surprise since some were forecasting that this winter
would be colder and wetter because of the toggle from El Nino, the
heat-and drought-producing phenomenon in the Pacific, to La Nina
when the Pacific cools and reverses things.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, right now La Nina looks like La Nada as far as
Central Texas is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   When in the midst of the El Nino drought, in which the
storm-producing jet stream was trapped in a rigid pose many miles
north of what we call Tornado Alley, the talk was of the worst of
all possible worlds in one calendar's sweep: extreme heat and
drought in the summer, extreme cold and precipitation this winter.
</P>
<P>
   But climatologists dispel the notion of symmetry when gauging
the El Nino-La Nina effect. The fact is, in most cases the
lessening of El Nino's grip on the jet stream only means a return
to the variety we all expect in weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not into French, but to these conditions I can only say,
``Vive la difference.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Central Texans invoke winter's name in all those
sweaty tribal dances each September, we don't really want it _ at
least not the kind of winter that glacierizes much of the Great
Plains each year.
</P>
<P>
   We don't want the whiteness that makes homicide seem justifiable
in Fargo, or the snowed-in insanity that causes one to root for the
man with the pick ax in The Shining.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we do need winter. The plants need dormancy. The bugs need
controlling. Generally Central Texans can expect two months of that
_ real frost and real cold. But that's all, thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   Mild winters are our reward for hellish Augusts and Septembers
that won't chill.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at the park my oldest son had his guitar out and was
strumming when a father came up carrying a little girl with a
droopy lower lip. The dad asked him to play her a song in hopes of
changing her complexion. He did. It worked. The father pulled out a
dollar bill, handed it to his daughter who handed it to the young
guitar picker _ a young man's first dollar on the music circuit, on
a warm January day.
</P>
<P>
   We've all earned this.

promising, politically controversial human stem cells. These cells
are extracted from aborted fetuses and human embryos, which were
created in in-vitro fertilization labs but never used for that
purpose. Some researchers raise the hope of using stem cells within
10 to 20 years to grow tissues for those who cannot obtain or use
transplanted tissue. One example is growing healthy neurons to
replace damaged brain cells in people with Parkinson's disease. But
opponents of abortion fear use of the techniques could convert

from certain activities during the offseason, including playing the
game.
</P>
<P>
   If you played without obtaining permission from the team and
were injured, the team could get out of their contract with you.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way I could live with that kind of restriction. I
needed to play. Not only had I always found comfort on the court,
but I used the summer to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls finally agreed to include what I called the ``Love of
the Game Clause.'' At the time, very few players, if any, had the
kind of freedom the Bulls gave me. I could do what I had always
done.
</P>
<P>
   I could play the game of basketball without consequence.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   It was 1982 and I was a freshman at North Carolina. We were
playing Georgetown and Patrick Ewing for the national Championship
in the Louisiana Superdome.
</P>
<P>
   I remember riding to the arena; I'm daydreaming about hitting
the winning shot. I remember feeling so calm, so relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   The dream wasn't game-specific so I didn't know whether it would
be against Georgetown in a few hours or against another team in
another year.
</P>
<P>
   But after we beat Georgetown for the championship, I told my
father about the dream. He paused for a moment and said, ``Your
life will never be the same after that shot. Your life is going to
change, son.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought, Well that's just my father talking. Of course he's
going to think that about his son. And besides no one really knows
one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   I never paid much attention to what my father said that day --
until now.
</P>
<P>
   When I think of my career, where I have come from, where it all
began and all that I have accomplished along the way, I realize
everything did change after that game.
</P>
<P>
   I think my father saw some things in me that I couldn't see in
myself.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he could tell one of his children had a special talent, a
special sense of himself. Maybe he knew one of his sons, for
whatever reason, was touched by some special spiritual inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, I guess I was the chosen one. No one from my
family is over 6 feet tall. Here I am, 6-foot-6. You could go back
two or three generations in my family and find one person maybe
6-foot-2.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not enough that I'm bigger than the norm for my family.
I have this special ability. I have an older brother, Larry, who
has the same heart, the same kind of ability, as I do, and yet he's
only 5-foot-8.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy who will still play me one-on-one in a heartbeat.
Despite all I've achieved in basketball, Larry believes he can win.
Yet he never got the same opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   So I think about that now. Why me?
</P>
<P>
   I do believe my father knew. I believe he saw things unfolding
in a way that no one, not me, not the Chicago Bulls, or anyone else
saw. I believe that's a father's gift. I only wish I could talk to
him now.
</P>
<P>
   I do believe there are things going on in the world that none of
us can see. I know it's true in my life. The only school I was
interested in out of high school was UCLA. All they had to do was
call and I would have been there.
</P>
<P>
   But they never recruited me, so I went to North Carolina. It
turned out to be the perfect decision because I was able to play
for Coach (Dean) Smith, who taught me the importance of
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when I decided to turn pro in 1984...I could have ended up
in Portland or Houston, but I landed in the middle of the country
in one of the three major markets. At the same time, Dr. J (Julius
Irving) was leaving and Larry Bird and Magic Johnson were there to
take the focus off me. It wasn't like I was Grant Hill or Shaquille
O'Neal coming into the NBA with expectation of carrying an entire
league.
</P>
<P>
   I will always believe that wherever I had gone my skills
eventually would have been acknowledged. But off the court, it
wouldn't have been the same.
</P>
<P>
   So when you look at all those twists and turns, all the little
things that happened and turned out to be major events, I have to
believe there was an original rhythm to my life, a spiritual road
that I was traveling without ever knowing where it would lead.
</P>
<P>
   How can you say there isn't a plan for all of us?
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Everything leading up to the shot against Utah in Game 6 of the
1998 Finals was vivid. It was like I was watching everything unfold
in slow motion on television.
</P>
<P>
   I stole the ball, looked up at the clock, and then down the
court. I could see every player and I remember exactly where they
were as I came up the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kerr was in the corner, John Stockton faked at me and was
going to come to me. I was up top. Dennis (Rodman) was curling
underneath the post on the left. Scottie (Pippen) was on the bottom
post on the right.
</P>
<P>
   I was going to the right because I knew I could get a shot off.
Any time I needed to make a shot I went to my right as long as the
defense didn't make a mistake and open a lane to my left. When you
go to your right the defensive player has to come across your body
to get to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   I was going toward Steve Kerr. John Stockton wasn't about to
leave Steve open as he had when Steve hit the winning shot in Game
6 of the 1997 Finals. So Stockton faked toward me and went back to
Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   I had no intention of passing the ball under any circumstances.
I figured I stole the ball and it was my opportunity to win or lose
the game.
</P>
<P>
   I would have taken that shot with five people on me. Ironically,
I have problems going to my right for a stop, pull-up jumper
because I have a tendency to come up short. I normally fade a
little. But on this shot I didn't want to fade because all my jump
shots had been short.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. I had enough time to think about those issues.
It's incredible, even to me. And yet, that's how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   I went straight up and I came straight down. I consciously
extended my hand up and out toward the target because I had been
coming up short. It looked like I was posing, but it was a
fundamentally sound shot.
</P>
<P>
   All that happened in about 11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   People don't believe I don't know what's going to happen after I
retire.
</P>
<P>
   But I truly live in the moment. Tomorrow I don't know what I'm
going to do. I think about today.
</P>
<P>
   That's what retirement means. You can design and choose your
moment. I can design shoes one day and ski the next.
</P>
<P>
   Once I retire, I will have created the opportunity to have a
choice. That is how I am going to live. I am not going to determine
what the moment is going to be a week from now. I've never done
that and I don't like living that way. I would feel too confined.
</P>
<P>
   To me, retirement means having no restraints. I won't be retired
fully until I don't have to do anything. One day I won't have to do
commercials, or talk to a board, or help in the design of shoes. I
will be able to wake up when I wake up.
</P>
<P>
   As long as I live in the moment I don't believe I will ever get
bored. I am not going to mind being out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   My problem is that everyone expects me to live in the future.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say there isn't an ego boost or a higher sense of
confidence in yourself when you've had as many lights shining on
you as I've had. But I never believed all the press clippings and I
never found comfort in the spotlight. I don't know how you can and
not lose your work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   I listened, I was aware of my success, but I never stopped
trying to get better.

   When I first signed with the Chicago Bulls in 1984, the NBA's
Uniform Player's Contract included a clause that prohibited players
from certain activities during the offseason, including playing the
game.

<P>
   If you played without obtaining permission from the team and
were injured, the team could get out of their contract with you.

FOUR CURES FOR CABIN FEVER
</HEADLINE>
  By LORI B. MURRAY 
 c.1999 Lori B. Murray 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time February arrives, the holidays are long gone, and
midwinter blues are center stage. It's time to get creative about
your leisure time with the kids -- before cabin fever gets the best
of everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few ideas:
</P>
<P>
   _ BUILD A BACKYARD ICE RINK
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're lucky enough to have a pond nearby, it may not be
safe for skating. Build your own fun with a backyard ice rink.
Invite the neighborhood kids and serve hot chocolate to warm little
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   1. Locate some level ground. Build a frame using lumber that is
1'' thick and 10'' high. Stake the frame on the outside so that
when the ice expands, your frame won't be knocked over.
</P>
<P>
   2. Build your frame on a warm day when the ground is still soft.
</P>
<P>
   3. Material for the inside of the rink should not be put in
place until it gets cold. It should be in one piece, without seams,
and it cannot be taped together. Either Visqueen (8 millimeter
thickness) or Permalon white plastic work well as a liner and can
be found at building supply stores. Don't use dark colors since
they absorb sunlight, making it harder to freeze.
</P>
<P>
   4. Carefully place the plastic sheeting inside your frame,
butted completely against the wall or frame. When you add water,
you will need to adjust the plastic so that it fits snugly but does
not pull.
</P>
<P>
   5. Use furring strips to hold the plastic in place over the top
of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   6. Keep leaves off the ice. Flood the ice nightly to smooth it
out after use and thawing.
</P>
<P>
   7. Add lighting for night skating if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   _ BAKE BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Whether you bake basic bread or quick, sweet bread, there's
nothing more satisfying than the smell of fresh bread baking in the
oven on a winter day. Don't be shy about making a loaf from
scratch; kids like to get their hands gooey and watch the dough
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Try the following kid-friendly books for bread recipes and tips:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bake Bread!'' (J.B. Lippincott Co., 1976); ``Knead It! Punch
It! Bake It! -- Make Your Own Bread'' (Thomas Y. Crowell, 1981);
``Let's Bake Bread!'' (Lerner Publications Co., 1973); ``Betty
Crocker's Breads'' (Western Publishing Co., 1974); ``The
Breadbasket Cookbook'' (Walker Books Limited, 1982).
</P>
<P>
   _ HAVE AN INDOOR PICNIC
</P>
<P>
   Get out the picnic basket, spread the tablecloth on the floor,
and build a fire in the fireplace. All you need now is some great
picnic food to complete the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a simple menu:
</P>
<P>
   Roasted Whole Chicken
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf Salad (easy and fun for kids to make)
</P>
<P>
   Banana Cupcakes
</P>
<P>
   _ CAMP IN
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's too cold to camp in the snow, but an indoor camp-out
in the family room by the fireplace sounds inviting. Pull out the
sleeping bags, hoist the tent, roast some marshmallows, and tell
campfire stories or sing songs. You won't have any stars to gaze
at, but the flames in the fire will do.

WHEN CHILDREN LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE
</HEADLINE>
  By LYNNE S. DUMAS 
 c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bonjour,'' sang out the 4- and 5-year-olds as they trooped
into the pre-kindergarten French class at New York City's Trevor
Day School. After greeting their teacher, Matt Dexter, the children
settled down and joined him in a game: They thumped their thighs,
clapped their hands, and as the teacher pointed to a body part,
called out its name in French: ``Le nez, la tete, les yeux.''
</P>
<P>
   ``C'est bon!'' praised Dexter. The kids beamed with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign language classes like this one not only help kids gain
language skills but also help them build self-esteem, thinking
skills, math ability and an appreciation of different cultures. And
children are best able to absorb a second language when they are
under 6 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Language comes easily to very young children,'' says Nancy
Rhodes, executive secretary of the National Network for Early
Language Learning in Washington, DC. ``At birth, they begin to
learn their parents' language because they hear it all the time.
Very young children can pick up a second language just as easily by
hearing it singing songs in it and using it in their play,'' Rhodes
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists' growing understanding of the brain helps explain why
young children can learn languages so effortlessly. ``From infancy
to age 6 or 7, there is a great deal of neurogenesis -- the
development of new connections -- going on in the brain,'' explains
Dr. George Bush, assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School, who specializes in brain mapping. ``A child's brain
is shaped by his experiences -- what he sees, hears and touches,''
says Bush. ``When it's exposed to the sounds of a second language,
the brain of a young child will actually grow connections that make
a new language easy to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Around age 12, the brain not only begins to slow in its ability
to develop those connections but starts to prune away any that
aren't being used, Bush explains. Thus children who don't start
learning a second language until later in life will often have a
more difficult time doing so because their brain may not have
developed the necessary connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids learn a second language early on, say as toddlers,
they tend to manage both their native and second language from the
same location in the brain,'' says Joy Hirsch, a professor of
neuroscience at Cornell University Medical College in New York
City. ``Kids who learn later -- as teenagers, for example -- seem
to manage their second language from a different and separate
location in the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch hypothesizes that ``older children may have a harder time
because their brain has to do extra work to create additional space
for the second language. And they must do this at a time when the
brain is becoming less facile at generating new connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely due to parents' clamoring, a fast-growing number of
elementary schools are offering second-language training to their
youngest learners. According to the Center for Applied linguistics
in Washington, DC, the number of elementary schools holding foreign
language classes climbed almost 10 percent between 1996 and 1997,
to 31 percent. That means more than 4 million elementary school
students are learning a foreign language in school before the age
of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Seven states -- Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, New
Jersey, North Carolina and Oklahoma -- have instituted a
second-language requirement for all children in elementary school.
And Delaware, Florida, and Hawaii are considering a variety of ways
to increase foreign language offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that learning a foreign language actually
enhances children's overall mental development. A study of 13,200
third- through fifth-graders at tending public schools in Louisiana
was revealing: It demonstrated that regard less of race, gender or
academic level, kids taking foreign language classes did better in
the English language arts section of the Louisiana Basic Skills
Tests than students who were not studying a foreign language.
</P>
<P>
   Math scores of children studying a second language improve, too.
Carol Saunders, a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta,
examined test scores of third-graders in 18 Georgia grade schools
and found that kids who had had foreign language instruction since
kindergarten did significantly better in the math section of the
Iowa Tests of Basic Skills than students with no foreign language
training.
</P>
<P>
   When given foreign language instruction by age 3 or 4, children
are able to speak like a native in their second language. As a
rule, says Donna Linton, director of the foreign language program
at Trevor Day School, ``the younger the children are, the better
their accent will be, especially if they've had some foreign
language training before learning to read English. That's because
the system of sounds they learn in English interferes with the one
they need for a foreign language. Once they've developed and
concretized formal reading and English language skills, their
accent in another language will never be quite as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring a native accent comes as a natural extension of
growing up in a bilingual family. But making sure your child is at
ease with more than one language takes a great deal of patience
even in a bilingual family, says Cristina Villalon-Kartheiser of
New York City, who has spoken only Spanish to her daughters, Katie,
6, and Annie, 4, from the moment they were born. The girls' father
speaks to them in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be very committed,'' says Villalon-Kartheiser.
``Whichever language one parent chooses to speak, he or she needs
to maintain it all the time so that the child doesn't feel that
either language spoken at home is less important in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   What if neither parent is bilingual? Try to make sure that your
child has continual exposure to a native speaker of a language
other than English, such as a grandparent or babysitter, suggests
Villalon- Kartheiser. You can also read stories to your child that
incorporate foreign words into English text, such as ``Rosita's
Calico Cat'' by Emily Thompson. Cassettes or CDs of Spanish songs,
such as De Colores by JoseLuis Orozco, as well as videotapes in
other languages, are especially helpful to parents who don't speak
a second language themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Or try creating a picture dictionary with your child in a second
language, using drawings or magazine cutouts to illustrate each
word. You can also take a family trip to another country; immersing
your child in another language is beneficial even for a short time.
</P>
<P>
   School-based immersion programs, in which children spend part or
all of the school day learning in a second language are another
option, albeit harder to find. The goal of immersion programs is to
enable a child to speak a second language fluently in a short
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   InterCultura is a foreign language immersion Montessori School
in Oak Park, Ill. Seven classes -- five with children ages 3 to 6
and two with ages 6 to 9 -- bathe students in the sounds of either
Japanese or Spanish. Classes, or ``communities'' as they are called
at the school, consist of about 20 students each. ``If you walked
into our Japanese community, you would see what you see in other
Montessori schools -- kids exploring puzzles and toys, working on
art projects, even learning practical tasks like using a broom or
setting a table,'' says Michael Rosanova, the school's director.
But what you'd hear is very different. For instance, the two
teachers of Japanese, who are native speakers, speak only in
Japanese to their young students. When they write, it is also in
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Children can respond in English if I they like, but as time goes
on, they, too, begin to speak only Japanese in the classroom. ``If
a child starts with us at age 3, it might take 8 to 10 months for
her to produce a second language spontaneously,'' says Dr.
Rosanova. ``But that's OK; the important thing is that she's
learning the language. At what point she becomes fluent varies
widely from child to child.''
</P>
<P>
   InterCultura children also teach each other. ``The other day,''
says Rosanova, ``a 5-year-old girl explained in Japanese to a newly
arrived 3-year-old Classmate: ``This water is pouring. It's pouring
from one pitcher to another. Would you like to try it?''' Such
interaction between children is at the heart of Montessori's
immersion programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Hieber's 4-year-old son, Liam, has gone to InterCultura
since he was almost 3. ``Why did I choose immersion? I felt it was
the most effective way for him to learn. He learns everything else
so rapidly, why not another language?'' she says. Hieber, who lives
in Chicago, was concerned that if Liam heard English spoken at home
and Japanese at school, he would get confused. But experience
allayed her fears. ``He moves easily from one language to the
other,'' she says. ``He speaks to me and his father in English
because he knows that's what we speak. In school, where everyone
speaks Japanese, he speaks Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-esteem is one more byproduct of early foreign language
instruction. ``Young children feel good about having this new
competency,'' says Linton. Lynn Fantom, mother of Luisa Sperry, 6,
of New York City, says that her daughter finds it particularly fun
to teach her mother Spanish words she doesn't know. ``She's as
proud as can be that she knows something I don't,'' says Fantom.
</P>
<P>
   Parents need to show lots of interest and enthusiasm about other
languages in order to encourage their child's learning. ``Attitude
has a lot to do with it,'' notes Marcia Rosenbusch, director of the
foreign language resource center at Iowa State University in Ames.
``If your child says a new word in a second language -- whether he
learned it at school, from you, or from a grandparent -- get
excited, make a fuss,'' Rosenbusch urges. ``It not only encourages
development of a second language but also helps children feel good
about themselves.''

FAT-BLASTERS FOR MIDDLE-AGED METABOLISMS
</HEADLINE>
  By JULIA CALIFANO 
 c.1998 McCall's 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unfortunate but true: Starting around age 25, a woman's
metabolism declines by about 5 percent every decade; by age 55
you're likely to have twice as much body fat as you had when you
were 20.
</P>
<P>
   But read on: ``We now know that getting older doesn't have to go
hand in hand with getting fatter,'' says Labros S. Sidossis, an
associate professor of nutrition and the director of the
obesity-research program at the University of Texas Medical Branch
at Galveston. ``With the right diet and exercise habits a woman can
avoid any significant gains in body fat as she ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the latest tips to keep off the pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn to graze.
</P>
<P>
   Grazing (that is, having smaller, more frequent meals) may help
you burn fat more effectively. A recent study of 16 women found
that those over age 60 burned 30 percent less fat after eating a
large meal of 1,000 calories than did women in their 20s; that
means the older diners stored more of the calories as body fat. But
both groups burned fat with equal efficiency after eating a smaller
meal (500 calories) and a 250-calorie snack.
</P>
<P>
   While more research is needed to know why older women store more
fat and at what age this begins, you may want to play it safe. Try
eating three or four lighter meals (around 400 to 500 calories
each) instead of consuming most of your calories in one or two
sittings, recommends study director Susan B. Roberts, an associate
professor of nutrition and psychiatry at the USDA Human Nutrition
Research Center on Aging at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walk at least four hours a week -- and no less.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the key to staying lean for life, according to a
recent study by the American Cancer Society. Researchers tracked
the eating and exercise habits of more than 44,000 middle-aged
women for 10 years; those who engaged in four or more hours of
walking every week were less likely to put on pounds than were
their sedentary peers, regardless of diet.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't cheat. The study found that walking less than four
hours weekly didn't help the women stay slim. To rack up that much
pavement or treadmill time, go for a 35-minute walk every single
day, or walk for 48 minutes five times a week. (Of course, check
with your doctor before starting any exercise plan.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Go for high intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The same study found that doing aerobics and/or calisthenics for
four or more hours per week reduced a woman's risk of putting on
pounds at the waistline by 72 percent; jogging or running for one
to three hours per week lowered a woman's odds for this by about 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, in an experiment at Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis, women and men in their 60s who went from
being couch potatoes to doing endurance exercises (like jogging or
cycling) for three hours a week lost up to 1 l/2 inches from their
tummies after nine to 12 months -- without dieting.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat lots of veggies.
</P>
<P>
   In the American Cancer Society study, women who consumed at
least 19 servings of vegetables a week were significantly less
likely to gain weight as they got older than those who ate
relatively few or no veggies -- regardless of total calorie intake.
To get 19 servings per week, aim for three a day.
</P>
<P>
   Easy produce boosts: At lunch have a salad, vegetable soup or a
sandwich stuffed with sprouts, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers. Sip
tomato or vegetable juice in the afternoon. At dinner add grated,
shredded or chopped vegetables (like zucchini, spinach and carrots)
to pasta sauce, meat loaf, rice or mashed potatoes. Keep a bowl of
baby carrots, celery and red-pepper slices in the fridge for a
handy snack.
</P>
<P>
   _ Muscle your way up to a faster metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   A pound of muscle burns about 35 calories a day, while fat uses
a measly two. But starting in their mid-20s, men and women lose
about a half pound of muscle every year, says Wayne Westcott,
fitness research director of the South Shore YMCA in Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, it's not hard to recoup your losses at any age with
strength training. For instance, when researchers at Tufts
University put 12 men and women in their 50s, 60s and 70s on a
three-times-weekly strength-building program, in just three months
the subjects gained enough muscle to burn an extra 109 calories a
day; over the course of a year, that adds up to 11 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   To get these benefits, do 25 minutes of toning exercises for the
upper and lower body (by using free weights, flexible bands or
resistance machines or by doing calisthenics) two to three times a
week. Again, check with your doctor first; then call your local
YMCA or pick up a good instruction book -- like ``Strong Women Stay
Slim, by Miriam E. Nelson (Bantam, 1998) -- to find out how to get
started.

</P>
<P>
   SNEAKY WAYS TO SLASH 100 CALORIES
</P>
<P>
   Losing weight really does get harder as you get older; after age
25 your metabolism burns up to 100 fewer calories a day with each
passing decade. Luckily, it's easy to make up the deficit, notes
Leslie Bonci, assistant director of nutrition at the Center for
Digestive Health at Pittsburgh's Allegheny General Hospital. These
small steps will help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat a half cup (or a half fist) less pasta.
</P>
<P>
   _ Order coleslaw made with vinaigrette instead of choosing
potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Substitute 4 ounces of juice combined with 6 ounces of seltzer
for a 10-ounce bottle of fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enjoy a slice of angel-food cake as an alternative to a glazed
doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have half a large bagel rather than a whole one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put only one slice of bacon on your BLT, not three.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat a half scoop of ice cream with a half scoop of sorbet,
cutting back from a full scoop of high calorie ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for a 3-ounce scoop of tuna salad on your sandwich in lieu
of the usual 4 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dip chips into salsa rather than guacamole.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go for a wine spritzer (half wine and half seltzer) in place
of wine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a small, not medium, order of french fries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Splurge on filet mignon as opposed to a T-bone steak.
</P>
<P>
   _ Munch a handful of pretzel nuggets instead of a handful of
peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Opt for hot-air-popped popcorn; steer clear of microwaved
buttered popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have one less tablespoon of butter or margarine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for mustard instead of mayo on your sandwich.

  Includes three color photos of dancers Suzie Hardt and Phil Jensen
at the Sapphire Ballroom in San Francisco. They are avaialble via
e-mail in JPEG format. Call Joe Applegate at 212-499-3342. 
 By MEG MCCONAHEY 
 c.1998 New York Times Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suzie Hardt rushes into San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel, all
adrenaline, anticipation and loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   She has slathered sunless tanning lotion on her legs, twisted
her black hair into a bun, swapped her glasses for contact lenses
and waged a 35-minute battle to glue false lashes over her brown
eyes. Any other day this no-fuss anthropology graduate wouldn't
even bother with mascara.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after maneuvering her Toyota through a rush-hour
bottleneck, she's left with only minutes to complete her Cinderella
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing on a sequined gown and making hurried fixes in the
mirror of the ladies' changing room, Hardt breathlessly shoots down
the hall, onto the ballroom floor and into the arms of partner Phil
Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   The neo-Baroque ballroom is decked out like a wedding reception.
Tiny cocktail tables dressed up with red and white centerpieces,
mixed drinks served up at a wet bar. Electric blue icicles shimmer
down a wall and couples, immaculately moussed, manicured, coiffed
and outfitted like Barbie and Ken at the prom, mill around in a
filmy swirl of rhinestones, tails and chiffon, nervously waiting
for their numbers to be called.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the glamor and sometimes garish glitz, the Sapphire
Ball, one of many ballroom dance championships held around the
country, is serious competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the room, vendors peddle the required gear:
$3,000 gowns, $100 pairs of shoes, hairpieces, falsies, even
on-the-spot massages.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as basketball with feathers, baseball with a
cummerbund, track in heels. When Jensen and Hardt take to the floor
it's with the focus and drive of athletes. They dance not for
romance, but to win.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is not a singular obsession. According to the
International Dancesport Federation, some 1.5 million couples
around the world, from Australia to Germany, from Canada to Japan,
are redefining social dancing into the new ``sport'' of competitive
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt is a 27-year-old office worker with a boyfriend; Jensen's
a single, 23-year-old engineer for Hewlett-Packard. Off the floor
they are almost social strangers, but Phil and Suzie need each
other. They both have it bad for ballroom. And in ballroom, you
can't do it alone. Finding the right partner, many dancers joke,
can be harder than finding a mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both over 6 feet tall, we're both under 40 years old and
we're both obsessive dancers,'' Hardt says of their strictly
ballroom alliance, forged, so to speak, across a crowded room at a
dance studio.
</P>
<P>
   Those caught up in the sequined magic maintain that it's a
high-aerobic activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do one round of a professional dance competition, five
dances of a minute and a half, is like running at full speed for 10
minutes. You have to be in really good shape to do this. If you're
good at it and putting effort into it, you're sweaty,'' says
Christine Rinne-Flores, who co-owns Stars Ballroom in Novato,
Calif., a place where competitive dancers converge for private and
group lessons, weekly parties and special events that are part of
the colorful ballroom community.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the International Olympic Committee
recognized the federation as the official governing body overseeing
the fledgling sport, a first milestone on the road to the Olympics.
Boosters have hired a high-powered agency to promote the image and
increase the profile of competitive dancing, a fusion of spectacle
and sport seen to outsiders mainly through the quirky, half-mocking
lens of movies like Australia's ``Strictly Ballroom,'' Japan's
``Shall We Dance'' and last summer's ``Dance With Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of lobbying, negotiating and politicking, both with
Olympic officials and within their own ranks, remain ahead. Key,
some observers say, is getting major TV exposure of ballroom.
That's already happening in countries like Germany, where
dancesport can be front page news.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the main TV exposure has been on PBS,
which airs the annual Ohio Star Ball the weekend before
Thanksgiving. But ballroom got a major network break recently when
NBC broadcast the International Dancesport Championships, with
Broadway diva Debbie Allen as hostess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dance sport now. It's totally international, all over
the world. It's in Taiwan, in Japan, Norway, Denmark, England,''
says Rhona Pick, whose Pick School in San Francisco has been
training dancers since 1963. She believes ballroom will easily
cross the Olympic hurdle because of its worldwide appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as exciting, definitely, as ice dancing, if not more,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest dancers could ever expect to go for the gold
however, is 2008, and to make even that deadline, the Federation
will have to convince Olympic officials by 2003 to accept ballroom
onto the program.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much locks even young, hungry dancers like Jensen
and Hardt out of an Olympic dream. But even without the big,
14-karat gold carrot to shoot for, the ballroom dance scene thrives
within its own intricate, arcane web of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm just happiest when I'm dancing. When I look back
in my life, all my happiest moments have been spent dancing,'' says
Hardt, struggling to explain the compulsion to dance six days a
week, sweating through some 12 hours of practice and lessons, both
group and private.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt pares her living costs down to the barest essentials,
sharing a house with five roommates. ``I basically don't spent
money on anything except for dancing,'' she admits. ``I don't have
any payments on my car and my rent is pretty cheap. I never buy new
clothes. I just go to yard sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many novices, her two ball gowns are hand-me-downs, one a
black-and-white formal that set its first owner back $1,700. She
similarly lucked into her dance shoes when a shoe store, going out
of business, donated its remaining stock to Rice University, where
Hardt competed on the ballroom team. The 2-1/2-inch-heeled slippers
are a little loose, and Hardt, hours before the Sapphire Ball,
found herself gluing on elastic straps. Having shoes fly off during
a fox trot is one of the hazards of competition, along with the
occasional collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not going to be too tacky,'' she giggled. ``But I
haven't got any other shoes for competition. They're really
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most sports, which can be measured by tangibles like
speed or distance, ballroom is highly subjective. Judges have only
a minute and a half to size up a floor full of couples, all in
motion, for form, technique and some inexplicable charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``A judge is paid to give their first impression. We're not here
to study them. Sometimes it's just the way they walk on the floor,
and make you look at them, or look at them longer,'' says Enrique
Ramon from Houston, Texas, one of the network of professional
judges who ride the circuit. Ramon says in the '60s, when he was
first competing, there were only three to four major competitions
in the United States. Now there are that many in any given weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The drive to get better, to best themselves, to out-dance
everyone on the floor can become consuming. Hardt vows to enter
every competition she can and someday take it all the way, which in
the world of ballroom is the ultimate championships in Blackpool,
England.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sapphire, she and Jensen make it to the finals in both
categories of competition they enter, and waltz away with a
second-place trophy in the pre-novice division, edging out seven
other couples, and place a respectable fourth in the higher novice
division. But they're more disappointed than elated about what
looks, to an observer, like a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't dance my best,'' Hardt says, looking stricken when
she comes off the floor, fighting tears behind the forest of
eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen, whose mother and brother and sister have come to watch,
is only a little less defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have danced better,'' he adds. ``I got off on my
timing but then we did fairly decent in the rest of it. But we
don't know that many dance steps and it was a little ahead of our
level. We do have a ways to go.''

dated during the early 1970s when he ``was interviewing some guy in
a garage as well as White House secretaries late at night.'' CBS
had given Stahl, its newest hire, the Watergate story, a measure of
how unimportant it seemed in its early stages. Woodward never
shared information with Stahl, but when she complained that the
story wasn't worth following, he made her stick with it. ``You must
hang onto this,'' he said. ``Trust me.'' And she did hang on,
developing a reputation for rambunctiousness and persistence (she
got on her hands and knees and interviewed John Dean through the
mail slot in his front door). There are lots of famous names,
famous stories, advice (about motherhood and about depression,
which plagued Stahl's husband) and good chat in this memoir, which
is written in exactly the voice you know from Stahl's reports on
``60 Minutes'' and other shows. She even uses the words ``good
grief'' more than once. It's an amiable book _ no one looks too
bad, with the exception of Stahl's domineering mother, Dolly _ and
fun to read. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE BIG BAD CITY &QL; 
 &UR; Ed McBain (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25)
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of stories in the big, bad city. One is that of
Cookie Boy, a burglar who leaves a box of chocolate-chip cookies
for his victims until one day he breaks into the home of a woman
whose own secret life makes his plans go terribly awry. Another is
that of the pretty girl, strangled and found sprawled by a park
bench. She remains anonymous until police discover, to their great
surprise, that she is Sister Mary Vincent, a nun who had breast
implants, money problems and a bottle of vodka in her refrigerator.
She had left the convent to become a singer but had returned to the
religious life just before she was murdered. Then there's the
continuing story of Steve Carella, the detective who is being
stalked by the man who killed his father. This is McBain's 49th
87th precinct novel, proof that practice makes you pretty good.
It's the longest-running series in contemporary crime fiction and
one of the best. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE MOTLEY FOOL'S RULE BREAKERS, RULE MAKERS &QL; 
 &UR; David and Tom Gardner (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Would you let these guys tell you where to put your money? You
betcha. So many of you have fallen in with them that they now have
their own foolish financial fiefdom, including a Web site, a
syndicated column, a radio show and three previous books on
investing. What else, you ask, could they possibly have to say?
Plenty, because there's more money to be made as long as you keep
buying their books, which brings us to a nagging question: Who are
the fools in this scenario? The Gardner brothers offer an in-depth
analysis of their stock-picking strategies, including an approach
that focuses on upstart companies that take their industries by
storm (America Online, for example, which we all wish we'd invested
in a long time ago). The Motley duo distracts us by bringing up
Shakespeare, Christopher Columbus, Tiger Woods and the Gap empire,
in which we did not invest but the Gardners did (and they
congratulate themselves loudly for it). However, there's also lots
of mumbo jumbo that made New &AMP; Notable squirm under the pressure to
be smart with our money. Read this, and you will either make money
or break out in hives. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MARCEL PROUST &QL; 
 &UR; Edmund White (Viking, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the first books in the new Penguin Lives series
of short biographies written by some of today's most respected
authors. Also available now is Larry McMurtry's ``Crazy Horse,'' a
profile of the Sioux warrior whose legend, McMurtry writes, ``grew
in the main from a broken people's need to remember and believe in
unbroken heroes, those who remained true to the precepts of their
fathers and to the ways of the culture and the traditions which
bred them.'' Two books will be released each season, six a year,
each about 150 pages. Future installments include ``Charles
Dickens,'' by Jane Smiley; ``Jane Austen,'' by Carol Shields;
``Robert E. Lee,'' by Roy Blount Jr.; ``Elvis Presley,'' by Bobbie
Ann Mason; ``James Joyce,'' by Edna O'Brien; ``Saint Augustine,''
by Garry Wills; ``Herman Melville,'' by Elizabeth Hardwick; and
``Charles Darwin,'' by David Quammen. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; DON'T SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF AT WORK &QL; 
 &UR; Richard Carlson (Hyperion, $11.95)
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, New &AMP; Notable scoffs at self-help books for obvious
reasons. Imagine our surprise when, after receiving a copy of
Carlson's previous book, ``Don't Sweat the Small Stuff With Your
Family,'' we found ourselves reading it with embarrassing zeal.
Carlson is less successful in that hotbed of misery and
interpersonal intrigue, the workplace. ``Make the best of those
boring meetings,'' he says. If that doesn't destroy his credibility
for you, try ``Be careful what you ask for.'' Or ``never ever
back-stab.'' Or ``let go of battles that cannot be won.'' Or
``don't let negative co-workers get you down.'' Or ``avoid comments
that are likely to lead to gossip or unwanted chatter.'' Or
``accept the fact that there's almost always going to be someone
mad at you.'' Your mother would say all of this more succinctly: Do
unto others what you would have them do unto you even when you're
at the water cooler. &QL;

WITNESSES REPRESENT CLINTON FOES' LAST STAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do you suppose that the Republican prosecutors in the
presidential impeachment trial are so desperate to call witnesses?
Do they actually believe that in-person testimony by Monica
Lewinsky and others will win them a conviction?
</P>
<P>
   Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'm guessing that the House ``managers'' who are
arguing the case for the removal of President Clinton from office
don't have the slightest expectation that he will be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The trial in the Senate on two articles of impeachment voted by
the House requires a two-thirds vote to convict the president and
thereby remove him from office. Assuming that all 100 senators
vote, it would take 67 votes to send Clinton packing _ which
(barring GOP defections) means that 12 of the Senate's 45 Democrats
would have to vote against their party's president.
</P>
<P>
   The smart money says: No chance.
</P>
<P>
   Once a trial gets going, of course, anything can happen. Just
ask those California prosecutors who figured that all they had to
do was stroll into the courthouse and collect a guilty verdict
against O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to say that 12 Democratic senators couldn't fall off their
horses on the way to the Capitol and miraculously join the ranks of
the anti-Clinton crusaders?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate is functioning as the jury in this trial, and as
noted, juries can be extremely unpredictable. I'd just as soon
wager on the pre-game coin toss at the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pundits and the politicians have been predicting
acquittal. Even one of Congress' most vocal anti-Clintonites, Texas
Rep. Dick Armey, said the other day that he expects the president
to beat the rap.
</P>
<P>
   So the question stands: Why are Republicans so insistent on
dragging out the impeachment trial by calling witnesses and opening
up the proceedings to every conceivable delaying tactic by the
Clinton legal team?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. The Republicans are determined to subject the populace
to one more excruciating, seemingly endless rehash of the
sex-and-lies scandal that brought us to this disheartening moment
in our nation's history. They just cannot accept the idea that the
vast majority of Americans want no part of this get-Clinton crusade
that seems to be boosting the president's job-approval rating even
as it decimates the Republican Party's stature as a serious bastion
of political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since news first broke about Clinton's affair with
Lewinsky, the anti-Clinton crowd has expected the American people
to demand the president's head on a platter. If they weren't upset
about the affair, Republicans assumed, the people would be outraged
about the lies that Clinton told to conceal the affair. If the lies
didn't light the fires of anti-Clinton activism, the president's
detractors knew, then surely allegations of witness tampering and
obstruction of justice would do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Every step of the way, the president's opponents have believed
that they were just one allegation away from gaining universal
acceptance of their view that Clinton had to go.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't happened. No matter how hard they try _ no matter
how noisily and messily they slosh around in the muck of scandal _
the Republicans can't get the country to see things their way.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes the Senate trial, and the president's enemies
figure they have one more chance to win the day. Even if they can't
drum up the votes to bounce Clinton out of the Oval Office, the
Republicans are sure that they can finally convince the American
people that the president is a lying, cheating worm who does not
deserve _ never has deserved _ the support he commands.
</P>
<P>
   If they can just do that _ if they can just make the electorate
see that it made an unforgivable mistake in choosing Bill Clinton
to be president _ well, if they can just do that, then they can
consider themselves victorious.
</P>
<P>
   If past performance is any predictor, though, the Senate trial
won't cause the public to turn against Clinton. It will cause his
approval ratings to go through the roof.

TAKING A SWING AT FREE SPEECH

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A little over a week ago, a kid in a local high school
got roughed up by another kid, which happens every day on some
campus in the city, and none of us the wiser.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators handle it. Students forget it. This
particular mugging made all the local papers and even the TV news,
however. Not because of the vehemence of the attack or the severity
of the injuries, but because the victim, a senior, worked for the
school newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   People in my business love that.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Claiborn, a student at Saguaro High School in Scottsdale,
wrote an unflattering commentary about football players for the
``Saguaro Sabercat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The heroes of today on the football field,'' it reads in part,
``might be the spouse abusers, drunks and hamburger flippers of
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few hours of publication, Claiborn was confronted by a
member of the football team and punched.
</P>
<P>
   The athlete, a sophomore, received an in-school suspension of 2{
days. The whirlwind from his uppercut continues to rip and swirl.
</P>
<P>
   We can't help ourselves. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Media martyrdom &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the American media loves more than a martyr, is a
martyr who happens to be in the media _ even if he's a student,
even if we disagree with what he said. We'll do everything possible
to canonize such a person.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the saint, the more of us who can squeeze under his
halo.
</P>
<P>
   In this particular case, the job was being handled competently
by others in town, so I stayed out of it. At least until I read a
story quoting the school's principal, Michael Carden.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Carden said, ``People have a right to a viewpoint that's
controversial, but they also have to put it out there in an
appropriate fashion. Sometimes the looseness people use with words
is what causes the problem, not necessarily what they say. There
were some inappropriate comments that were said that people took
objection to.''
</P>
<P>
   I contacted Carden, and asked if he was making excuses for the
athlete who took a poke at the writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was only a partial quote in that article,'' he told me.
``They left out the part where I told them that no matter what the
kid wrote, there was no excuse for physical confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what happened.
</P>
<P>
   An innocent omission.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Principal Carden had been a little more emphatic, if
he had said, ``Violence is never condoned. Period. End of story,''
there would have been no confusion.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't say that, not even to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that takes offense to an article needs to respond in
an appropriate fashion, and doing it physically isn't
appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``By the same token, when a person writes an
article they have the responsibility to do it in an appropriate
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've learned that what's ``appropriate'' for one
person can be insulting to someone else. &QL; 
Protection for all &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to predict who will take offense to what. Or
why. Or for how long.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Claiborn told me he's still being threatened by some kids at
the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony, of course, is that the person who hit me proved my
point,'' Claiborn said. ``I'm not against high school football. I'm
against bullies. I'm against violence.''
</P>
<P>
   He figures he should be able to say so, anyway he wants, without
getting cuffed. And he's right.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't some special treatment the government cooked up for
news people. It's for preachers, too. And for politicians. It's for
school principals and football players. It's for the guy with the
flag in his yard, the guy with the bumper sticker on his car, even
the guy with the swastika on his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week we celebrated a national holiday dedicated to the
memory of a man known for his strong convictions and his way with
words. A man who might still be around, if it weren't for someone
who didn't like what he said. &QL;

 &HT;    
 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    As a 10-year-old glued to the TV through the summer of
Watergate, I remember the air of gravity that hung over the
proceedings, the sense that it was a dreadful necessity to put a
president on trial.
 &HT;    I don't recall authority figures having to explain that it was a
national crisis _ even to a kid, that was pretty obvious.
 &HT;    And yet, one of the oddest things about the impeachment weekend
just before Christmas was the constant stream of reminders that
America again was experiencing such a crisis. Legislators and
commentators kept trying to find more dramatic ways to frame the
events taking place.
 &HT;    Bill Clinton, they intoned, was about to become only the SECOND
president ever impeached. And he would be our FIRST ELECTED
president ever impeached. On into January the tone remained the
same: We were having the first Senate trial of a president in 130
YEARS.
 &HT;    Watching TV was like having someone grab you by the lapels and
shout, ``Don't you understand this is supposed to be historic!''
 &HT;    Clinton's impeachment is historic in the sense of it being an
event historians will puzzle over in decades to come. But what
those historians will have to ponder is not how it shook the
country _ but why it didn't. They will have to explain how America
experienced the form of a constitutional crisis without the content
of one, how an impeachment could drive a president's approval
rating up instead of down.
 &HT;    They may be better disposed than contemporary observers of the
Clinton scandal to look beyond the Dow Jones industrial average for
an explanation. For Clinton's weathering of the Lewinsky scandal
represents something that is truly historic _ a break in the way
the American presidency functions.
 &HT;    For the 60 years or so that preceded Clinton's election in 1992,
the nation lived through what might be described as the heroic
phase of the American presidency. Not that all modern presidents
have been heroes, of course. But beginning in the late 1920s, the
country was enveloped in a succession of crises _ the Great
Depression, World War II and the Cold War. We measured our
presidents against their roles in these great events.
 &HT;    Thankfully, we're now living in different times. The nation is
at peace and growing more prosperous, not merely or even mostly as
a consequence of executive decision-making, but as a backdrop to
it.
 &HT;    This places a different and in some ways more difficult burden
on the leader of the free world. An American president now has a
more diffuse and bewildering job. He must focus on a series of
comparatively minor problems at home, make sense of international
confusion and compete for the public's attention with more
captivating forms of entertainment.
 &HT;    Clinton has not failed to keep his public entertained. To some
it has seemed like a tragedy, to others a sitcom. Following the
pattern of his career in Arkansas and of his accident-prone 1992
campaign, Clinton as president has repeatedly toyed with ruin,
practically digging his own grave, only to pop back up,
Houdini-like, after everyone thought he could no longer be
breathing.
 &HT;    With his impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice, his dialogue with disaster has reached what is likely to
be its final phase (though another eruption is always possible).
 &HT;    The debate is no longer over Clinton's continued viability as a
politician, because he faces no more elections. The stain of
impeachment cannot be washed away by what he does in his remaining
time in the White House, because part of what his impeachment means
is that the House of Representatives is no longer much interested
in doing business with him.
 &HT;    A conviction in a Senate trial would make Clinton history sooner
rather than later, but whether he is convicted, acquitted or
censured as a result of some Senate-White House deal, it does not
seem too soon to try to characterize his presidency. Clinton is the
president who, for better and worse, turned the White House into a
governor's mansion.
 &HT;    Clinton was worried about his legacy long before he learned, a
year ago, that the world was about to learn about Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    In the book ``Behind the Oval Office,'' Dick Morris described a
Sunday-morning phone conversation in August 1996 on the topic of
how Clinton would rate in the history books. Clinton agreed he
wasn't a top-tier president, but wondered what he could do to make
it into the ranks of Morris' second tier _ that is, with Harry
Truman, Theodore Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson and Ronald Reagan.
(Morris said he'd have to do three big things: Make welfare reform
work, balance the federal budget and smash international terrorism,
on top of some littler things.)
 &HT;    There is already a rough consensus among historians that Clinton
is indeed a significant president. He stands to be remembered, most
obviously, for causing a big scandal and getting impeached, but
also for getting re-elected, something no Democrat since FDR had
done.
 &HT;    But Clinton, I think, will also be remembered for reforming the
federal government and for reshaping the Democratic Party. Most
strikingly, Clinton, like Andrew Jackson and FDR, has changed the
very nature of the American presidency. Where those two presidents
expanded the role and importance of the presidency, Clinton has
downsized the office, both in the negative sense of stripping away
some of its dignity and in the positive one of making adjustments
demanded by the historical moment.
 &HT;    Coming to the White House from the governor's mansion in Little
Rock, Clinton has recast the presidency on the more modest model of
his previous job. Unlike presidents, governors have few
opportunities to be visionaries. Instead, they do what Clinton has
done _ a job of crisis management, political accommodation and
governmental reform.
 &HT;    Governors, of course, don't shape foreign policy. There's no
doubt Clinton will be remembered as primarily a domestic president
and perhaps the first in a line of domestic presidents who followed
the Cold War. Clinton ran on domestic and economic issues in 1992,
in answer to George Bush's international focus. His platform,
``Putting People First,'' the most detailed policy statement ever
issued by a candidate, elaborated a series of ideas about how to
make government more effective.
 &HT;    Clinton has improved a range of federal agencies and programs.
But what may stand as most significant is not just that he mended
broken policies, but that he restored the feeling that domestic
government could work.
 &HT;    Probably the most underappreciated thing Clinton did during his
first year was expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, a program by
which the federal government supplements the income of low-wage
workers.
 &HT;    Clinton's notion was that if you work full time, you shouldn't
have an income below the poverty line. A government commitment to
this principle exemplified his reform liberalism.
 &HT;    As a successor to the New Deal-Great Society archetype of
ever-expanding social benefits, Clinton proposed a more modest,
reciprocal model, one based on what he has described as an exchange
of opportunity for responsibility, and hence a model based on more
limited expectations of what the federal government can do.
 &HT;    During his 1992 campaign, Clinton characterized this notion, in
a phrase coined by Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy
Institute, as the ``New Covenant.'' Clinton's subsequent successes,
such as national service and welfare reform, have come from
applying this notion of a limited social contract.
 &HT;    His early failures occurred when he strayed from it, relapsing
into the older pattern of delivering new federal benefits from on
high. Most notable was his failure in health care.
 &HT;    Clinton botched the design and marketing of his plan, setting
himself at odds with moderates in both parties whose support he
needed. Considering himself a centrist reformer, Clinton didn't see
the potential for his ``managed competition'' scheme to be
portrayed as an oldfangled liberal spending program.
 &HT;    What Clinton didn't yet get was the depth of the discontent with
the way government was working. When he took office, trust in
government had been steadily eroding for a quarter century. In
1964, 76 percent of Americans told pollsters they thought they
could trust government to do the right thing all or most of the
time. In 1994, the year Clinton's plan for health-care reform
fizzled, the number who said they trusted government bottomed out
at 15 percent.
 &HT;    The nature of this disillusion is a debate of its own, but it
was based at least in part on the failures of government in welfare
and public housing, in worsening crime and deteriorating public
education.
 &HT;    This loss of confidence easily attached itself to Clinton's
attempt to award the federal government another vast
responsibility. Clinton was regarded as someone who had promised
change and failed to deliver. This frustration came to fruition in
1994.
 &HT;    Not until the ascendancy of the Gingrich Congress did Clinton
fully grasp the depth of disenchantment with Washington. But from
that point on, Clinton began to understand that he had to grapple
with this corrosive skepticism.
 &HT;    Following the 1994 election, Clinton faced tremendous criticism,
not just from Republicans but also from Democrats who felt he was
trying to jettison, in an effort at conciliation, the party's
bedrock beliefs.
 &HT;    The lightning rod for this anger became his nefarious political
consultant Morris, whom Democratic traditionalists saw as pulling
Clinton not in the direction of reform, but toward a dead centrism
derived from opinion polls. Clinton was much ridiculed for
proposing microinterventions such as free walkie-talkies for
neighborhood watch groups.
 &HT;    But what Clinton was beginning to understand was that
government's failures weren't arcane managerial issues; they were
questions of public trust. While devising gubernatorial-scale
programs that encapsulated his New Covenant approach, he proceeded
to address the two biggest causes of that mistrust.
 &HT;    First, Clinton agreed to the Republican goal of a balanced
budget. But where the GOP long supported a balanced budget as a
means of downsizing government, Clinton saw it as a way to
reinvigorate government. From his first economic plan in 1993,
Clinton regarded the deficit as a problem serious enough to warrant
putting many of his pet projects on hold.
 &HT;    What he subsequently discovered was that by operating within the
context of a balanced budget, he could argue for expanding spending
in certain areas, such as school construction or national service,
without being accused of fiscal irresponsibility.
 &HT;    The federal budget had become like a state budget. Only if
government was convincingly limited in size could it hope to get
away with activism.
 &HT;    His second and arguably more important decision was following
through on his campaign promise to end welfare ``as we know it.''
Many liberals mistook Clinton's interest in the subject as
political; they saw the subtext as race baiting.
 &HT;    In fact, Clinton saw welfare as disruptive of the proper
relationship between government and its citizens. The system's
unpopularity was not just because of its being counterproductive or
a waste of resources, but because it offered something for nothing.
 &HT;    Members of Clinton's cabinet objected strenuously to his
decision to accept a modified Republican bill based on the idea of
block grants, and a few of his own policy makers resigned in
protest over the issue.
 &HT;    But Clinton could see that the country's governors, already
embarked on a variety of welfare-reform experiments, were in the
best position to know how the system might be fixed. Only in the
last year has it become evident that Clinton did reform welfare
largely in the way he said he would with pretty much the results he
anticipated.
 &HT;    Welfare rolls have declined from 5 million families in 1995 to 3
million in June 1998. A downturn in the economy could curtail this
progress by making it harder to place people in jobs, but at the
moment the national picture is one of drastically declining levels
of dependency with scant evidence of increased misery.
 &HT;    These promising signs have been accompanied by progress in other
areas in which government has failed. Under Henry Cisneros, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development actually began breaking
up pockets of concentrated poverty by tearing down parts of the
worst urban housing projects and moving to voucher-based subsidies.
 &HT;    Cities have also benefited from two changes that may have been
largely incidental to Clinton's agenda _ a big drop in crime and
the end of a long-term increase in out-of-wedlock births. Together
these developments have begun to have a tipping-point effect for
America's urban centers.
 &HT;    It's too early to say that these improvements have restored the
30-year slide in faith in government. But from its low in 1994,
confidence in government had recovered more than 20 points by early
1998. Impeachment has driven it down a bit _ but to nowhere near
its lowest level. In fact, Clinton has made a legacy for himself
that could supercede the Lewinsky scandal.

 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Before Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, conventional wisdom
held that the Democrats faced a crisis. After 12 years of GOP White
House rule and defeat in five of the previous six presidential
elections, the party had seemingly ceased to become competitive at
the presidential level.
 &HT;    Peter Brown's 1991 book, ``Minority Party: Why Democrats Face
Defeat in 1992 and Beyond,'' was one of several arguing the thesis.
White working-class and suburban middle-class voters, according to
the conventional wisdom, were abandoning the party in droves
because of its excessively liberal positions on crime, welfare,
foreign policy and ``values'' issues.
 &HT;    How could the Democrats become politically competitive again in
an era when what the party once stood for _ an expanding federal
role _ was proving less and less popular? The party itself was
deeply divided over how and whether it should evolve.
 &HT;    On one side was a group of centrist reformers clustered around
the Democratic Leadership Council. On the other was a rump of
liberal traditionalists, including labor unions and minority groups
who viewed DLC positions as treasonable to their basic beliefs.
 &HT;    Clinton has faced the problems of his party _ at least at the
presidential level _ methodically, systematically and effectively.
To a remarkable degree, he has succeeded in making once seemingly
incurable ailments vanish, while giving back to the Democrats the
kind of well-oiled national political machine they had before 1968.
 &HT;    His first task was pulling thorns from the party paw. Asked
which party did a better job handling crime, voters chose the GOP
by a margin of 18 points in 1991.
 &HT;    Clinton reversed this pattern by jettisoning Dukakis-era
positions such as opposition to the death penalty while exploiting
the one aspect of the issue where public opinion diverges from the
dictates of GOP interest- group politics: gun control.
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't have much of a basis for claiming that it's his
policies that have reduced crime rates over the past several years,
but he has put away the charge that Democrats don't like punishing
criminals. Recent surveys show the parties polling essentially even
on the issue.
 &HT;    What's most remarkable is not that Clinton has taken crime and
other reliable wedge issues away from Republicans. It's that he has
done so while unifying a party that was itself divided over these
issues. In 1992, both the New Democrats and the traditionalists
supported Clinton in the belief that he was, at heart, one of them.
 &HT;    Perhaps inevitably, both sides were disappointed in the way he
governed. For much of his first term Clinton was out of favor with
the center or the left of his party, or both at the same time.
 &HT;    In his first two years, the DLC saw Clinton as swinging left
with his health-care plan and tax increase. In his second two
years, liberals griped over Clinton's accession to a balanced
budget and welfare reform. But by the time of the 1996 election,
Clinton had again forged an alliance.
 &HT;    Many people are puzzled about how Clinton has been able to
appease liberal constituencies while flouting their principles _
confronting unions with Nafta, poor blacks with welfare reform,
teachers with charter schools and feminists with Paula Jones.
 &HT;    The simplest explanation is that he has restored a model last
seen among Democrats during the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when
those joining his coalition got to experience victory and taste
power. Clinton has created a sense of partisan pride powerful
enough to quell the narcissism of small differences.
 &HT;    This thrill of putting up a good fight against a common enemy _
something presidents as different as Ronald Reagan and Franklin
Roosevelt once created and used _ has overcome ideological and
sometimes moral scruples. Democratic activists have taken the
advice Clinton gave a group of them in 1981: ``When someone is
beating you over the head with a hammer ... take out a meat cleaver
and cut off their hand.''
 &HT;    It hasn't always been pretty, or even, perhaps, ethical. Since
1992, Clinton's style has been to dispense with qualms and play
politics in as ruthless and relentless a way as the GOP. In the
1980s, Reagan and George Bush were charged with relying on polling
to an unprecedented degree. Clinton has gone them one better,
market-testing his rhetoric, then deploying it with a numbing
repetitive precision.
 &HT;    He answered the slick fabrications of Michael Deaver with the
more subtle and compelling mythography of Harry Thomason and Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason. He dug deeper for dirt on his opponents,
devised more effective 30-second attack ads and showed great
ingenuity in exploiting loopholes in the campaign finance law.
 &HT;    The biggest change is financial. In the 1980s, the GOP advantage
in fund-raising was as high as 5 to 1. In the 1992 election cycle,
Clinton and Ron Brown, then chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, whittled it down to 3 to 2. In 1996, Clinton and Harold
Ickes nearly caught up in the chief corporate category, so-called
soft money, bringing in $123 million to the GOP's $138 million.
 &HT;    They did this with willful blindness about the sources of these
funds. Clinton's attitude is that because the rules aren't enforced
and Republicans are preventing him from creating a level playing
field, he is free to fight as dirty as they do.
 &HT;    Since the Lewinsky scandal, various sectors of the ideologically
disgruntled Democratic ``base'' _ those who might be thought to be
less than keen about Clinton's small-bore, poll-driven,
corporate-friendly centrism _ have been the president's staunchest
supporters.
 &HT;    Black leaders disappointed with Clinton over matters ranging
from the balanced budget to welfare reform have flocked to his
defense. Among blacks, Clinton's approval rating remains as high as
Ronald Reagan's rating was among conservative Republicans.
 &HT;    This is a testament in part to the real feeling Clinton evinces
over racial issues, as well as to black sensitivity to
prosecutorial unfairness and sympathy for victims of persecution.
But it also speaks to a different kind of party, one in which
members are willing to settle for half a loaf.
 &HT;    Republicans, on the other hand, now face the problem of a
radical base that has lost its willingness to postpone
gratification. The adage that Democrats look for heretics while
Republicans seek converts has ceased to apply.
 &HT;    To a remarkable degree, the parties have switched places.
Clinton's political formula is now almost universally regarded as a
winning one for Democrats. All of the serious contenders for the
2000 Democratic nomination have indicated their desire to continue
in the same basic direction.
 &HT;    Al Gore, Bill Bradley and John Kerry have all positioned
themselves as Clinton Democrats. The potential contenders who do
not fit this profile _ Paul Wellstone and Jesse Jackson _ are
running as protest candidates. Clinton's ``Third Way'' formula has
an international following as well. From a historical viewpoint,
the question is whether a Democratic successor will be able to
carry off Clinton's balancing act within the party.
 &HT;    There is a worrisome analogy in the GOP, where Reagan became a
successful two-term president by appeasing the religious right
while reaching out to moderate voters. Bush's efforts to sustain
this equilibrium made the Republican right truculent to the point
of self-destructiveness. Today the GOP remains badly divided,
looking back to the Reagan years as an irretrievable golden age.
 &HT;    Clinton's successor, almost certain to lack his political gifts
and perhaps his ruthlessness, faces an enormous challenge in
maintaining the Clinton coalition.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Even if President Bill Clinton is not convicted by the U.S.
Senate and does finish his second term, impeachment will still be
in the first paragraph of his obituary.
 &HT;    At some level, Clinton can't escape becoming a historical joke.
 &HT;    He is now and forever our priapic president, who takes his place
alongside our drunken president, Ulysses S. Grant, our napping
president, Calvin Coolidge, and our treacherous president, Richard
Nixon.
 &HT;    Whatever else he does in office, Clinton will not be able to
keep this out of his capsule biography: He's the one who had oral
sex with a 21-year-old intern in the Oval Office, got caught, lied,
caused a national spectacle and saw it undermine his second term.
This story line may be tempered with sympathy.
 &HT;    In a longer view, Clinton's libido may not differentiate him
from Franklin Roosevelt (who died with his mistress, not his wife)
or John Kennedy (who arranged orgies in the White House swimming
pool). But it will be hard to avoid the view that there was
something more reckless about Clinton, because he had no basis for
thinking the press would protect him, as it did his predecessors.
 &HT;    Nor can Clinton escape his reputation for being slippery. He is
not the first president to lie, or lie under oath. But he will
surely be remembered as someone who habitually played games with
the truth.
 &HT;    Clinton is the president who said he never inhaled, who told a
national audience, ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman'' _ and considered it true because his definition of sexual
relations did not include receiving oral sex.
 &HT;    The most evasive of these lines, such as ``It depends on what
the meaning of the word 'is' is,'' are destined for inclusion in
Bartlett's. Clinton is to hairsplitting legalisms what Yogi Berra
is to tautological absurdities; he seems nearly to have invented
the form.
 &HT;    It will also be recalled that he was disloyal to friends and
took advantage of people who worked for him. In the Lewinsky
scandal, he led subordinates such as his former press secretary
Michael McCurry to damage their own professional reputations by
amplifying his lies. Clinton will be remembered as, among other
things, a cad.
 &HT;    When the scandal first broke a year ago, Washington reporters
were still dealing with the issue of whether to protect the public
from information they assumed it was too unsophisticated to handle.
Few suspected how much the rest of the country had changed in the
previous decade.
 &HT;    In fact, the impeachment episode has revealed the state of
national mores at century's end. America today is no longer the
America of 1987, the year that Gary Hart was driven from a
presidential race by the Donna Rice scandal and that Clinton
decided not to go for the nomination after his aide Betsey Wright
presented him with a list of ex-lovers capable of sabotaging his
candidacy.
 &HT;    Clinton is not simply the beneficiary of the arrival of a more
tolerant moral standard; he is personally responsible for its
application to politics. He was the first presidential candidate to
publicly acknowledge that he had committed adultery.
 &HT;    Some have argued that, based on the famous ``60 Minutes''
appearance, in which he acknowledged causing pain in his marriage,
there was an implicit bargain between Clinton and the voters. If we
elected him, he promised to sin no more.
 &HT;    But the real proposition was direct and explicit: Clinton stood
for office on the basis of what he could do rather than who he
would be. Unlike previous presidents, he proposed to be hired on
the basis of his abilities and his approach to government, not his
qualities as a moral exemplar. He was promising to be a good
governor.
 &HT;    Such a promise is built into Clinton's view of government _ a
``New Covenant'' in which Washington no longer delivers solutions
to our problems; it merely helps us to solve them. Not looking to
government as an all-purpose savior implies no longer putting
politicians on a pedestal.
 &HT;    To perform their new role, leaders don't have to be ideal human
beings, superior projections of ourselves. They merely need to
understand our problems and help us grapple with them. If they hold
up their end of the bargain, by governing well, we won't go beyond
ours by judging them harshly for inevitable human failings. While
he has surely tested our commitment to this pact, Clinton has held
up his end of it.
 &HT;    The compact that Clinton embodies has emerged as our country's
de facto standard of political morality. We now distinguish public
from private in the lives of our leaders, and forbear from
judgments about the latter.
 &HT;    The new rules have not taken hold everywhere yet. Much of the
press has yet to assimilate the concept that most of the public no
longer considers intrusive reporting about private lives relevant
to democratic decision-making. Nonetheless, a president with a rare
ability to compartmentalize his psyche has ratified a new attitude
toward the private lives of public figures.
 &HT;    You can go further than that and say that the Lewinsky scandal
says something not just about the development of American political
morality, but also about American morality in general. A quick
survey might leave one with the impression that the 1990s were the
decade that Puritanism died.
 &HT;    Since Clinton has been president, homosexuality has gained
public acceptance; legal gambling has swept the country;
pornography has become ubiquitous; and vice has been redefined as
disease. Meanwhile, the public has become unshockable about sex and
unconcerned about presidential adultery. These changes imply that
traditional morality has receded.
 &HT;    But something more complicated is going on. The same public that
has forgiven Clinton his trespasses holds to a strict personal
morality and has endorsed Clinton's emphasis on ``values'' in
government programs _ what Prof. Michael Sandel of Harvard calls
Clinton's repudiation of ``moral neutrality'' in public policy.
 &HT;    The harmonization of these seeming contradictions may be arising
from the increasingly subtle distinction Americans are making
between the public and private realms.
 &HT;    One striking thing the sociologist Alan Wolfe shows in his book
``One Nation, After All'' is that while American suburbanites are
far from relativistic in their own moral views, they shrink from
judging the private behavior of others, and dislike moralizing when
they see it practiced. At the same time, they want government
policy to support their values.
 &HT;    The Lewinsky scandal writes these distinctions large. Few
approve of Clinton's behavior. Yet the vast majority object even
more to casting stones at the president for mistakes in an area
where he is answerable to his family and his God, not to voters or
the media.
 &HT;    Though these mistakes may make it impossible for Clinton to talk
about values any longer, voters care more about how he applied his
views in public _ welfare reform, for example _ than how he
violated them in private.
 &HT;    Clinton didn't devise this ethic, but his election and survival
encapsulate it. He leaves behind an electorate that wants its
values embedded in public policy, but that no longer moralizes
about private behavior.
 &HT;    One historical issue about Clinton's impeachment may be a simple
extension of the current mystery: why a Republican Congress pursued
it. Scholars of the 21st century will recall that removing a
popular president from office was very unlikely, that it wasn't
dictated by the Constitution and that demanding it was obviously
harmful to the GOP's public standing.
 &HT;    Today we have an overheated political environment, yet it's hard
to see what the fuss is really about. It seems that the prime
motivating factor in impeachment is personal. There's a simmering
hatred of Clinton, which has boiled hotter and hotter through his
time in office and bears little relation to the passions people
ordinarily bring to politics.
 &HT;    The most common explanation is that hatred for Clinton is an
expression of ``a culture war.'' The idea here is that in their
strenuous dislike of the president, conservatives are fighting a
battle over the 1960s and its legacy. Clinton is the first
baby-boomer president, the first who dodged the Vietnam draft and
admitted to smoking marijuana.
 &HT;    His conservative opponents, including many members of the same
generation, see such a figure as a threat to the moral order. But
the culture-war argument doesn't do justice to an antipathy that
goes back to Clinton's candidacy. I think there are three separate
psychological profiles of Clinton-hating, which have blurred
together at times.
 &HT;    _ The first type of Clinton-hater is liberal, and he does derive
his hatred from the '60s. He views Clinton as a fundamentally
disingenuous and inauthentic person who uses public interest as a
cover for private ambition. This opinion, which is manifest in much
of Clinton's press coverage, does not draw a line between the
personal and the political. The problem isn't that Clinton
committed adultery or that he lied about adultery _ these lapses
have inclined liberal critics to support him.
 &HT;    What they object to is that Clinton cares about winning more
than he cares about principles; that he has thrown overboard such
worthy causes as civil liberties, intervention in Bosnia, human
rights in China and campaign finance reform.
 &HT;    _ A second kind of hostility to Clinton is neither liberal nor
conservative but comes from the Washington establishment. Sally
Quinn, the journalist and Washington hostess, has written that the
Clintons ''dissed'' Georgetown society by neglecting its advice and
avoiding its company.
 &HT;    This is true, but the falling out goes well beyond a mere social
snub. By downsizing the presidency and ushering in an era of a less
ambitious federal government, Clinton has made Washington and its
establishment less important. By turning away from both foreign
affairs and big-ticket domestic programs, Clinton has made
Washington less central to the concerns of the nation than it was
in the days of SALT treaties.
 &HT;    Turning the presidency into the country's biggest governor's job
is contrary to the political establishment's sense of the office
and their relation to it. By allowing the Lewinsky scandal to
happen, Clinton has turned the American presidency (and by
extension those who feed off it) into an international
laughingstock.
 &HT;    ``Clinton acted ... as if he does not recognize what it means to
be president of the United States,'' wrote David Broder, a
Washington Post columnist, after Clinton's first nationally
televised mea culpa.
 &HT;    _ The third and most potent kind of Clinton-hating is
conservative, but is related to the liberal kind in its aversion to
a Democrat who plays politics to win. Instead of being pleased that
Clinton has enacted parts of their agenda, Republicans are furious
at him for co-opting the best bits of it.
 &HT;    Yet in the end, the question of Clinton-hating transcends
conventional political analysis. It's personal and aggravated.
Detestation of the president is worsened by the phenomenon of
sustained public support for Clinton, which his opponents find
baffling. Why does this man's approval rating rise in the teeth of
humiliation?
 &HT;    At one level, Clinton's supporters have made a pragmatic
judgment that he governs in their interest. But at another level,
he draws on a reservoir not of love, not of respect even, but of
identification.
 &HT;    This identification works in two directions. It is partly the
public's identification with Clinton, the perpetual underdog who
refuses to ever quit fighting. To a public that consumes quantities
of confessional entertainmentand self-help advice, Clinton's
turmoil seems not bizarre, but familiar.
 &HT;    His cyclical progress through stages of sin, denial, contrition
and forgiveness has humanized him like no previous president. To a
public that had already accepted Clinton with his faults, the Starr
report arrived not as a shocking indictment, but as a juicy soap
opera with footnotes. As with other celebrities, Clinton's
screw-ups are a comforting reminder that he isn't any better than
the rest of us and doesn't think that he is.
 &HT;    But possibly more important is the way Clinton identifies with
regular people. No one who has ever seen him work a rope line or
entertain questions at a town meeting can fail to be impressed by
the way that he engages with ordinary people. Unlike any other
politician of this generation, he is in his element with a crowd _
black, white, religious, academic _ it almost doesn't matter.
 &HT;    The way Clinton draws sustenance by relating to strangers is
part and parcel of his political talent. Often Clinton-haters think
his ``I feel your pain'' act is a fraud, rather than an expression
of natural sympathy. There is in their anger at him something of
the mystification with which the liberal intelligentsia beheld
Ronald Reagan's popularity.
 &HT;    It's as if Clinton's bond with the public was based on some kind
of black art. In Reagan's case, this was chalked up to the mesmeric
power of his acting (a power never attributed to him during his
screen career). With no ready explanation of how Clinton does it,
conservatives such as William Bennett have often taken the route of
becoming infuriated with the public for falling for such a
charlatan.
 &HT;    In fact, Clinton has devised a brand of idiosyncratic populism,
based on the sense of him as a personally flawed but
public-spirited and highly intelligent leader ready to fight to his
last breath for the people who elected him. Knowing Clinton as it
has known no other incumbent president, the public has nonetheless
refrained from judging him _ or at least has been willing to judge
him in his complexity, separating his private behavior from his
record.
 &HT;    Clinton is likely to remain an equivocal figure, a man of
significant accomplishments and flawed character, who created
gratuitous troubles but defined a social transformation in
surviving them. He may come to be remembered as the most
paradoxical president: an undisciplined man who restored trust in
government, while inspiring almost none in himself.

 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Before Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, conventional wisdom
held that the Democrats faced a crisis. After 12 years of GOP White
House rule and defeat in five of the previous six presidential
elections, the party had seemingly ceased to become competitive at
the presidential level.
 &HT;    Peter Brown's 1991 book, ``Minority Party: Why Democrats Face
Defeat in 1992 and Beyond,'' was one of several arguing the thesis.
White working-class and suburban middle-class voters, according to
the conventional wisdom, were abandoning the party in droves
because of its excessively liberal positions on crime, welfare,
foreign policy and ``values'' issues.
 &HT;    How could the Democrats become politically competitive again in
an era when what the party once stood for _ an expanding federal
role _ was proving less and less popular? The party itself was
deeply divided over how and whether it should evolve.
 &HT;    On one side was a group of centrist reformers clustered around
the Democratic Leadership Council. On the other was a rump of
liberal traditionalists, including labor unions and minority groups
who viewed DLC positions as treasonable to their basic beliefs.
 &HT;    Clinton has faced the problems of his party _ at least at the
presidential level _ methodically, systematically and effectively.
To a remarkable degree, he has succeeded in making once seemingly
incurable ailments vanish, while giving back to the Democrats the
kind of well-oiled national political machine they had before 1968.
 &HT;    His first task was pulling thorns from the party paw. Asked
which party did a better job handling crime, voters chose the GOP
by a margin of 18 points in 1991.
 &HT;    Clinton reversed this pattern by jettisoning Dukakis-era
positions such as opposition to the death penalty while exploiting
the one aspect of the issue where public opinion diverges from the
dictates of GOP interest- group politics: gun control.
 &HT;    Clinton doesn't have much of a basis for claiming that it's his
policies that have reduced crime rates over the past several years,
but he has put away the charge that Democrats don't like punishing
criminals. Recent surveys show the parties polling essentially even
on the issue.
 &HT;    What's most remarkable is not that Clinton has taken crime and
other reliable wedge issues away from Republicans. It's that he has
done so while unifying a party that was itself divided over these
issues. In 1992, both the New Democrats and the traditionalists
supported Clinton in the belief that he was, at heart, one of them.
 &HT;    Perhaps inevitably, both sides were disappointed in the way he
governed. For much of his first term Clinton was out of favor with
the center or the left of his party, or both at the same time.
 &HT;    In his first two years, the DLC saw Clinton as swinging left
with his health-care plan and tax increase. In his second two
years, liberals griped over Clinton's accession to a balanced
budget and welfare reform. But by the time of the 1996 election,
Clinton had again forged an alliance.
 &HT;    Many people are puzzled about how Clinton has been able to
appease liberal constituencies while flouting their principles _
confronting unions with Nafta, poor blacks with welfare reform,
teachers with charter schools and feminists with Paula Jones.
 &HT;    The simplest explanation is that he has restored a model last
seen among Democrats during the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when
those joining his coalition got to experience victory and taste
power. Clinton has created a sense of partisan pride powerful
enough to quell the narcissism of small differences.
 &HT;    This thrill of putting up a good fight against a common enemy _
something presidents as different as Ronald Reagan and Franklin
Roosevelt once created and used _ has overcome ideological and
sometimes moral scruples. Democratic activists have taken the
advice Clinton gave a group of them in 1981: ``When someone is
beating you over the head with a hammer ... take out a meat cleaver
and cut off their hand.''
 &HT;    It hasn't always been pretty, or even, perhaps, ethical. Since
1992, Clinton's style has been to dispense with qualms and play
politics in as ruthless and relentless a way as the GOP. In the
1980s, Reagan and George Bush were charged with relying on polling
to an unprecedented degree. Clinton has gone them one better,
market-testing his rhetoric, then deploying it with a numbing
repetitive precision.
 &HT;    He answered the slick fabrications of Michael Deaver with the
more subtle and compelling mythography of Harry Thomason and Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason. He dug deeper for dirt on his opponents,
devised more effective 30-second attack ads and showed great
ingenuity in exploiting loopholes in the campaign finance law.
 &HT;    The biggest change is financial. In the 1980s, the GOP advantage
in fund-raising was as high as 5 to 1. In the 1992 election cycle,
Clinton and Ron Brown, then chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, whittled it down to 3 to 2. In 1996, Clinton and Harold
Ickes nearly caught up in the chief corporate category, so-called
soft money, bringing in $123 million to the GOP's $138 million.
 &HT;    They did this with willful blindness about the sources of these
funds. Clinton's attitude is that because the rules aren't enforced
and Republicans are preventing him from creating a level playing
field, he is free to fight as dirty as they do.
 &HT;    Since the Lewinsky scandal, various sectors of the ideologically
disgruntled Democratic ``base'' _ those who might be thought to be
less than keen about Clinton's small-bore, poll-driven,
corporate-friendly centrism _ have been the president's staunchest
supporters.
 &HT;    Black leaders disappointed with Clinton over matters ranging
from the balanced budget to welfare reform have flocked to his
defense. Among blacks, Clinton's approval rating remains as high as
Ronald Reagan's rating was among conservative Republicans.
 &HT;    This is a testament in part to the real feeling Clinton evinces
over racial issues, as well as to black sensitivity to
prosecutorial unfairness and sympathy for victims of persecution.
But it also speaks to a different kind of party, one in which
members are willing to settle for half a loaf.
 &HT;    Republicans, on the other hand, now face the problem of a
radical base that has lost its willingness to postpone
gratification. The adage that Democrats look for heretics while
Republicans seek converts has ceased to apply.
 &HT;    To a remarkable degree, the parties have switched places.
Clinton's political formula is now almost universally regarded as a
winning one for Democrats. All of the serious contenders for the
2000 Democratic nomination have indicated their desire to continue
in the same basic direction.
 &HT;    Al Gore, Bill Bradley and John Kerry have all positioned
themselves as Clinton Democrats. The potential contenders who do
not fit this profile _ Paul Wellstone and Jesse Jackson _ are
running as protest candidates. Clinton's ``Third Way'' formula has
an international following as well. From a historical viewpoint,
the question is whether a Democratic successor will be able to
carry off Clinton's balancing act within the party.
 &HT;    There is a worrisome analogy in the GOP, where Reagan became a
successful two-term president by appeasing the religious right
while reaching out to moderate voters. Bush's efforts to sustain
this equilibrium made the Republican right truculent to the point
of self-destructiveness. Today the GOP remains badly divided,
looking back to the Reagan years as an irretrievable golden age.
 &HT;    Clinton's successor, almost certain to lack his political gifts
and perhaps his ruthlessness, faces an enormous challenge in
maintaining the Clinton coalition.

 By JACOB WEISBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Even if President Bill Clinton is not convicted by the U.S.
Senate and does finish his second term, impeachment will still be
in the first paragraph of his obituary.
 &HT;    At some level, Clinton can't escape becoming a historical joke.
 &HT;    He is now and forever our priapic president, who takes his place
alongside our drunken president, Ulysses S. Grant, our napping
president, Calvin Coolidge, and our treacherous president, Richard
Nixon.
 &HT;    Whatever else he does in office, Clinton will not be able to
keep this out of his capsule biography: He's the one who had oral
sex with a 21-year-old intern in the Oval Office, got caught, lied,
caused a national spectacle and saw it undermine his second term.
This story line may be tempered with sympathy.
 &HT;    In a longer view, Clinton's libido may not differentiate him
from Franklin Roosevelt (who died with his mistress, not his wife)
or John Kennedy (who arranged orgies in the White House swimming
pool). But it will be hard to avoid the view that there was
something more reckless about Clinton, because he had no basis for
thinking the press would protect him, as it did his predecessors.
 &HT;    Nor can Clinton escape his reputation for being slippery. He is
not the first president to lie, or lie under oath. But he will
surely be remembered as someone who habitually played games with
the truth.
 &HT;    Clinton is the president who said he never inhaled, who told a
national audience, ``I did not have sexual relations with that
woman'' _ and considered it true because his definition of sexual
relations did not include receiving oral sex.
 &HT;    The most evasive of these lines, such as ``It depends on what
the meaning of the word 'is' is,'' are destined for inclusion in
Bartlett's. Clinton is to hairsplitting legalisms what Yogi Berra
is to tautological absurdities; he seems nearly to have invented
the form.
 &HT;    It will also be recalled that he was disloyal to friends and
took advantage of people who worked for him. In the Lewinsky
scandal, he led subordinates such as his former press secretary
Michael McCurry to damage their own professional reputations by
amplifying his lies. Clinton will be remembered as, among other
things, a cad.
 &HT;    When the scandal first broke a year ago, Washington reporters
were still dealing with the issue of whether to protect the public
from information they assumed it was too unsophisticated to handle.
Few suspected how much the rest of the country had changed in the
previous decade.
 &HT;    In fact, the impeachment episode has revealed the state of
national mores at century's end. America today is no longer the
America of 1987, the year that Gary Hart was driven from a
presidential race by the Donna Rice scandal and that Clinton
decided not to go for the nomination after his aide Betsey Wright
presented him with a list of ex-lovers capable of sabotaging his
candidacy.
 &HT;    Clinton is not simply the beneficiary of the arrival of a more
tolerant moral standard; he is personally responsible for its
application to politics. He was the first presidential candidate to
publicly acknowledge that he had committed adultery.
 &HT;    Some have argued that, based on the famous ``60 Minutes''
appearance, in which he acknowledged causing pain in his marriage,
there was an implicit bargain between Clinton and the voters. If we
elected him, he promised to sin no more.
 &HT;    But the real proposition was direct and explicit: Clinton stood
for office on the basis of what he could do rather than who he
would be. Unlike previous presidents, he proposed to be hired on
the basis of his abilities and his approach to government, not his
qualities as a moral exemplar. He was promising to be a good
governor.
 &HT;    Such a promise is built into Clinton's view of government _ a
``New Covenant'' in which Washington no longer delivers solutions
to our problems; it merely helps us to solve them. Not looking to
government as an all-purpose savior implies no longer putting
politicians on a pedestal.
 &HT;    To perform their new role, leaders don't have to be ideal human
beings, superior projections of ourselves. They merely need to
understand our problems and help us grapple with them. If they hold
up their end of the bargain, by governing well, we won't go beyond
ours by judging them harshly for inevitable human failings. While
he has surely tested our commitment to this pact, Clinton has held
up his end of it.
 &HT;    The compact that Clinton embodies has emerged as our country's
de facto standard of political morality. We now distinguish public
from private in the lives of our leaders, and forbear from
judgments about the latter.
 &HT;    The new rules have not taken hold everywhere yet. Much of the
press has yet to assimilate the concept that most of the public no
longer considers intrusive reporting about private lives relevant
to democratic decision-making. Nonetheless, a president with a rare
ability to compartmentalize his psyche has ratified a new attitude
toward the private lives of public figures.
 &HT;    You can go further than that and say that the Lewinsky scandal
says something not just about the development of American political
morality, but also about American morality in general. A quick
survey might leave one with the impression that the 1990s were the
decade that Puritanism died.
 &HT;    Since Clinton has been president, homosexuality has gained
public acceptance; legal gambling has swept the country;
pornography has become ubiquitous; and vice has been redefined as
disease. Meanwhile, the public has become unshockable about sex and
unconcerned about presidential adultery. These changes imply that
traditional morality has receded.
 &HT;    But something more complicated is going on. The same public that
has forgiven Clinton his trespasses holds to a strict personal
morality and has endorsed Clinton's emphasis on ``values'' in
government programs _ what Prof. Michael Sandel of Harvard calls
Clinton's repudiation of ``moral neutrality'' in public policy.
 &HT;    The harmonization of these seeming contradictions may be arising
from the increasingly subtle distinction Americans are making
between the public and private realms.
 &HT;    One striking thing the sociologist Alan Wolfe shows in his book
``One Nation, After All'' is that while American suburbanites are
far from relativistic in their own moral views, they shrink from
judging the private behavior of others, and dislike moralizing when
they see it practiced. At the same time, they want government
policy to support their values.
 &HT;    The Lewinsky scandal writes these distinctions large. Few
approve of Clinton's behavior. Yet the vast majority object even
more to casting stones at the president for mistakes in an area
where he is answerable to his family and his God, not to voters or
the media.
 &HT;    Though these mistakes may make it impossible for Clinton to talk
about values any longer, voters care more about how he applied his
views in public _ welfare reform, for example _ than how he
violated them in private.
 &HT;    Clinton didn't devise this ethic, but his election and survival
encapsulate it. He leaves behind an electorate that wants its
values embedded in public policy, but that no longer moralizes
about private behavior.
 &HT;    One historical issue about Clinton's impeachment may be a simple
extension of the current mystery: why a Republican Congress pursued
it. Scholars of the 21st century will recall that removing a
popular president from office was very unlikely, that it wasn't
dictated by the Constitution and that demanding it was obviously
harmful to the GOP's public standing.
 &HT;    Today we have an overheated political environment, yet it's hard
to see what the fuss is really about. It seems that the prime
motivating factor in impeachment is personal. There's a simmering
hatred of Clinton, which has boiled hotter and hotter through his
time in office and bears little relation to the passions people
ordinarily bring to politics.
 &HT;    The most common explanation is that hatred for Clinton is an
expression of ``a culture war.'' The idea here is that in their
strenuous dislike of the president, conservatives are fighting a
battle over the 1960s and its legacy. Clinton is the first
baby-boomer president, the first who dodged the Vietnam draft and
admitted to smoking marijuana.
 &HT;    His conservative opponents, including many members of the same
generation, see such a figure as a threat to the moral order. But
the culture-war argument doesn't do justice to an antipathy that
goes back to Clinton's candidacy. I think there are three separate
psychological profiles of Clinton-hating, which have blurred
together at times.
 &HT;    _ The first type of Clinton-hater is liberal, and he does derive
his hatred from the '60s. He views Clinton as a fundamentally
disingenuous and inauthentic person who uses public interest as a
cover for private ambition. This opinion, which is manifest in much
of Clinton's press coverage, does not draw a line between the
personal and the political. The problem isn't that Clinton
committed adultery or that he lied about adultery _ these lapses
have inclined liberal critics to support him.
 &HT;    What they object to is that Clinton cares about winning more
than he cares about principles; that he has thrown overboard such
worthy causes as civil liberties, intervention in Bosnia, human
rights in China and campaign finance reform.
 &HT;    _ A second kind of hostility to Clinton is neither liberal nor
conservative but comes from the Washington establishment. Sally
Quinn, the journalist and Washington hostess, has written that the
Clintons ''dissed'' Georgetown society by neglecting its advice and
avoiding its company.
 &HT;    This is true, but the falling out goes well beyond a mere social
snub. By downsizing the presidency and ushering in an era of a less
ambitious federal government, Clinton has made Washington and its
establishment less important. By turning away from both foreign
affairs and big-ticket domestic programs, Clinton has made
Washington less central to the concerns of the nation than it was
in the days of SALT treaties.
 &HT;    Turning the presidency into the country's biggest governor's job
is contrary to the political establishment's sense of the office
and their relation to it. By allowing the Lewinsky scandal to
happen, Clinton has turned the American presidency (and by
extension those who feed off it) into an international
laughingstock.
 &HT;    ``Clinton acted ... as if he does not recognize what it means to
be president of the United States,'' wrote David Broder, a
Washington Post columnist, after Clinton's first nationally
televised mea culpa.
 &HT;    _ The third and most potent kind of Clinton-hating is
conservative, but is related to the liberal kind in its aversion to
a Democrat who plays politics to win. Instead of being pleased that
Clinton has enacted parts of their agenda, Republicans are furious
at him for co-opting the best bits of it.
 &HT;    Yet in the end, the question of Clinton-hating transcends
conventional political analysis. It's personal and aggravated.
Detestation of the president is worsened by the phenomenon of
sustained public support for Clinton, which his opponents find
baffling. Why does this man's approval rating rise in the teeth of
humiliation?
 &HT;    At one level, Clinton's supporters have made a pragmatic
judgment that he governs in their interest. But at another level,
he draws on a reservoir not of love, not of respect even, but of
identification.
 &HT;    This identification works in two directions. It is partly the
public's identification with Clinton, the perpetual underdog who
refuses to ever quit fighting. To a public that consumes quantities
of confessional entertainment and self-help advice, Clinton's
turmoil seems not bizarre, but familiar.
 &HT;    His cyclical progress through stages of sin, denial, contrition
and forgiveness has humanized him like no previous president. To a
public that had already accepted Clinton with his faults, the Starr
report arrived not as a shocking indictment, but as a juicy soap
opera with footnotes. As with other celebrities, Clinton's
screw-ups are a comforting reminder that he isn't any better than
the rest of us and doesn't think that he is.
 &HT;    But possibly more important is the way Clinton identifies with
regular people. No one who has ever seen him work a rope line or
entertain questions at a town meeting can fail to be impressed by
the way that he engages with ordinary people. Unlike any other
politician of this generation, he is in his element with a crowd _
black, white, religious, academic _ it almost doesn't matter.
 &HT;    The way Clinton draws sustenance by relating to strangers is
part and parcel of his political talent. Often Clinton-haters think
his ``I feel your pain'' act is a fraud, rather than an expression
of natural sympathy. There is in their anger at him something of
the mystification with which the liberal intelligentsia beheld
Ronald Reagan's popularity.
 &HT;    It's as if Clinton's bond with the public was based on some kind
of black art. In Reagan's case, this was chalked up to the mesmeric
power of his acting (a power never attributed to him during his
screen career). With no ready explanation of how Clinton does it,
conservatives such as William Bennett have often taken the route of

 &HT;    In fact, Clinton has devised a brand of idiosyncratic populism,

public-spirited and highly intelligent leader ready to fight to his
last breath for the people who elected him. Knowing Clinton as it
has known no other incumbent president, the public has nonetheless
refrained from judging him _ or at least has been willing to judge
him in his complexity, separating his private behavior from his

 &HT;    Clinton is likely to remain an equivocal figure, a man of
significant accomplishments and flawed character, who created
gratuitous troubles but defined a social transformation in
surviving them. He may come to be remembered as the most
paradoxical president: an undisciplined man who restored trust in

<P>
   After 17 years of warfare, people in the rolling hills and olive
orchards in south Lebanon wonder if they might finally again have
peace _ a time when Israeli troops might not occupy their land or
trade artillery with Lebanese Hezbollah guerillas. For them, the
war represents episodes like this month's, when several civilians
were killed by Israeli bombing runs. Since Israel's invasion in
1982, aimed at squelching Palestinian terrorists, tens of thousands
of Lebanese civilians and more than 1,000 Israeli soldiers have
died. But, 1999 may be the year this grizzly machinery comes to a
conclusion.

</P>
<P>
   After 17 years of warfare, people in the rolling hills and olive
orchards in south Lebanon wonder if they might finally again have
peace _ a time when Israeli troops might not occupy their land or
trade artillery with Lebanese Hezbollah guerillas. For them, the
war represents episodes like this month's, when several civilians
were killed by Israeli bombing runs. Since Israel's invasion in
1982, aimed at squelching Palestinian terrorists, tens of thousands
of Lebanese civilians and more than 1,000 Israeli soldiers have
died. But, 1999 may be the year this grizzly machinery comes to a
conclusion.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Television needs another Flip Wilson
 &HT;    (Illustration available.)
 &HT;    By Todd C. Duncan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a situation in the media that pops up from time to time
when a prominent person's death goes relatively unnoticed because
they died during a busy news cycle or, worse, a major holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case in the death of Clerow ``Flip'' Wilson. The
versatile comic and 1970s television star died during the
Thanksgiving holiday at age 64.
</P>
<P>
   His obituary didn't make the front page of most newspapers and
was barely mentioned by the talking hairpieces who staff nightly
news and celebrity programs.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of our disposable culture to properly recognize Flip
Wilson and his legacy is unfortunate. He was much more than a man
who hosted a variety show.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970-75 span of ``The Flip Wilson Show,'' Wilson
created numerous offbeat and funny characters, none more so than
Geraldine, the sassy temptress who was able to seduce and outwit
the show's guest stars, including comedy and Hollywood legends Bob
Hope, Bing Crosby, Jack Benny and Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of the brief tributes and stories since the
comic's death have focused on the one character that found Wilson
in a dress. Geraldine was hilarious and unforgettable, but Wilson's
show was more than a showcase for a comic in drag.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's comic catch-phrases remain part of our culture. ``The
devil made me do it.'' ``What you see is what you get.'' ``When
you're hot, you're hot; when you're not, you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   And how many lovers have been eyed sitting in ``a booth in the
back, in the corner, in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   His humor had the ability to cut through the racial upheaval of
the time by filling a need that both blacks and whites have in
common _ the need to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making whites more comfortable with blacks'
growing presence in the nation's mainstream and giving blacks
something to laugh about without being the butt of the joke, Wilson
helped pave the way for today's black television stars. It's a
legacy many of them are staining.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of today's programs targeted to African-Americans,
Wilson's humor was never structured to embrace or exploit the worst
of black behavior. Wilson's jokes, usually unraveled in stories and
fables, were humorous tales where characters _ even those from the
streets _ had dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Even the episodes with slick-talking Rev. Leroy of the Church of
What's Happening Now managed to parody the black clergy and its
parishioners without beating viewers over the head with a
nauseating stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny is not a color,'' Wilson once said, responding to
critics who suggested that the show ignored America's racial gulf
and might not be ``black'' enough. ``Being black is only good from
the time you get from the microphone to the curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   Now shows and characters have to be ``black'' all the time. And
this hideous definition of ``black'' usually consists of stupidity,
slang, ignorance, questionable morality, physical exaggerations
and, of course, some form of dancing, singing or rapping. Watching
the buffoonish, buck-eyed antics of Martin Lawrence's character on
the hit show ``Martin'' is enough to make intelligent
African-Americans weep.
</P>
<P>
   During Wilson's reign, families, both black and white, could
gather around the television and watch his show without anyone
feeling offended or guilty. Modern shows are so laced with racial
barbs and crude sexual banter that it's virtually impossible not to
be offended
</P>
<P>
   Even Chris Rock, whose highly charged, intelligent humor is a
breath of fresh air compared with today's foul-smelling
entertainment, can't match the subtle clarity of Wilson's comedy.
</P>
<P>
   It seems we've taken a step backward from Wilson's vision. In
today's segregated television, blacks can't see themselves on
``Friends'' and whites don't watch much WB. Wilson let us take a
fun-filled peek at our common frailties and joys without race
obscuring the view.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, at least one cable show airs old ``Flip Wilson
Show'' episodes. It's a chance for viewers who were old enough to
catch the show when it originally aired to get a second look at
television history. And for viewers not old enough to remember
Wilson _ or who have never heard of any show older than ``The Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air'' _ it's a great opportunity see an
African-American comic just being funny.

IN THE WINGS, GORE'S 2000 MOMENTUM BUILDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As many Democrats ponder the &UR;  &LR; President's
impeachment trial and his State of the Union message, many are also
focusing on a major subplot: the growing power of Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's image as a wooden figure in the Clinton administration is
never more on display than at such events, when protocol requires
that he sit silently or clap politely. But this year, with Clinton
burdened by impeachment and the first primary of Campaign 2000 to
be held in 13 months, Gore's grasp on the Democratic presidential
nomination seems as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   But is Gore's nomination really certain?
</P>
<P>
   The theory of Gore's inevitability is touted by an array of
aides and supporters. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, for example,
has decided not to run partly because Gore controls so many key
assets, from major contributors to major backers to the unlimited
resources of vice presidential travel and prestige. But before
Kerrey dropped out, his aides compiled a 300-page blueprint for
beating the vice president that other candidates might try to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   The blueprint goes like this: Gore is likely to be a cautious
front-runner, offering Clinton continuity rather than boldness,
providing an opening for the sort of ``new ideas'' candidate who
tends to do well among Democratic activists who vote in caucuses
and primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sitting vice president without question is very difficult to
beat,'' said Steve Jarding, Kerrey's top political adviser. ``But
no one is absolutely safe in American politics.'' Gore, who has
filed papers for his candidacy, has only one formally announced
opponent, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. Senator John
F. Kerry of Massachusetts still is studying a race. In addition to
Kerrey, Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota dropped from contention
in recent weeks. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt is expected
to announce as early as this week that he will stay out of the
race, Democratic sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the question is whether Bradley, Kerry or another prospect
such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson will catch the public imagination
and create a two-man race that would be Gore's to lose. A New
Hampshire poll released last week found that Gore was leading
Bradley by 34 percent to 14 percent, not an overwhelming margin at
this stage of the campaign. The WMUR-TV poll gave Gephardt 12
percent and Kerry 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore strategy has been on full display in the last two
weeks, even as the Senate began Clinton's impeachment trial. On
Jan. 8, for example, Gore delivered the pork, so to speak, to a
very important constituency in Campaign 2000: hog farmers in the
first-caucus state of Iowa. He announced $50 million to help
farmers ``cope with disastrously low hog prices'' and threw in
another $80 million to help Iowa farmers who have 479,000 hogs
affected with a type of rabies.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, Gore oversaw an event dubbed ``The Vice
President's summit on 21st Century Skills for 21st Century Jobs,''
which served as a metaphor for Gore's campaign. The underlying
message was Gore himself has trained for the last six years under
Clinton and is ready to campaign and govern like his mentor at the
dawn of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a page from the Clinton campaign playbook, Gore
conducted a town hall meeting on the future, appearing before a
George Washington University audience here with satellite hookups
to 1,000 locations. Sitting on a stool, Gore conducted a series of
carefully scripted questions and answers with members of the
audience who have gotten good jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore presented a theme that could be summed up as ``I am the
future.'' He gave a glittering account of the economy during the
Clinton-Gore administration and then portrayed himself as the
politician who would guide workers from one well-paying job to the
next.
</P>
<P>
   Like a salesman at a computer trade show, the techno-savvy Gore,
who popularized the phrase ``information superhighway,'' marveled
about microprocessors and said a bright future was a mouse click
away for anyone with an education. When one member of the audience
said he had gotten a good job through a community education program
backed by Gore, the vice president, responded, ``You sound pretty
excited about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Such events underscore the power the vice president brings to
the campaign. Without spending a penny of campaign funds, Gore
connected with leaders from labor, industry and government,
assuring all three sectors that he will help them through the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Less publicly, Gore is raising campaign money at a furious pace,
hoping to bring in $35 million this year, a pace of $673,000 a
week. By contrast, Bradley, who hopes to raise $20 million this
year, is just beginning his fund-raising, and Kerry hasn't raised a
penny for a presidential bid because he hasn't decided whether to
run. While Gore aides said it is too early to announce who is
endorsing Gore, many party leaders are expected to do so.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes Gore campaign manager Craig Smith more than a
little optimistic. Asked if he could envision a way for Gore to
lose, Smith said: ``I'm sure you could come up with a scenario if
the stars and moon all align right, in this 12-minute window on
this one particular day, Thing X could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While Smith hastened to add that he is taking nothing for
granted, it is widely assumed that part of the Gore strategy is to
scare away possible opponents. The strategy worked in the case of
Kerrey.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska senator, who ran unsuccessfully for president in
1992, may have studied whether Gore can be beaten more closely than
anyone in America. His conclusion was that while there was a small
chance, the odds were too long. Kerrey, meanwhile, had promised not
to run for reelection to the Senate in 2000 if he ran for
president, meaning he faced a possible lose-lose situation.
</P>
<P>
   Jarding, who runs Kerrey's political action committee, known as
BackPAC, helped draw up a detailed strategy for beating Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The plan concluded that next year's truncated primary schedule,
widely perceived as a plus for the well-financed Gore, could help a
challenger more than is realized.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old, drawn-out primary schedule, someone like Gore
could afford to establish grass-roots organizations in many states.
But under the shorter schedule, in which New York, California and
other states hold primaries soon after New Hampshire, the
importance of grass roots would diminish, while the value of
momentum would increase. Thus, a challenger who does well in Iowa
and New Hampshire could trump Gore in New York and California even
without a major grass-roots effort in the latter states.
</P>
<P>
   The key to beating Gore, Jarding said, is to come up with a
maverick message that attracts attention in the early states and
then beat Gore at the expectations game. That is what then-Senator
Gary Hart of Colorado did in 1984, when he ran against former Vice
President Walter Mondale. Although Mondale won in Iowa against Hart
by 49 percent to 16 percent, Hart's performance was stronger than
expected and propelled him to a stunning victory in the New
Hampshire primary. Although Hart eventually lost the nomination to
Mondale, his effort is considered the model for beating Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey aides informed the senator that he would probably have to
spend four or five days a week raising money across the country,
and two or three days a week visiting Iowa, New Hampshire and other
early primary states. That didn't leave Kerrey much time to be a
senator _ a dilemma Kerry now is considering. Gore also was
strengthened by Attorney General Janet Reno's decision not to seek
an independent counsel to examine his campaign finance dealings,
and Gore does not appear to have been hurt by the Clinton
impeachment. To the contrary, many activists applaud Gore's loyalty
to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the most important factor in the race, the sizzling
economy, continues to work in Gore's favor, although a financial
meltdown in the midst of the campaign could change things
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   John Martilla, a longtime Kerry adviser, said Gore is beatable
by either Bradley or Kerry. Kerry declined to comment, partly
because he hasn't entered the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party will take a fresh look,'' Martilla said.
``The question is whether one of these candidates can light the
Democratic primary voters' fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is free of Senate responsibilities and insists he can
raise the money to compete. Asked how Bradley could win, spokesman
Eric Hauser said Bradley has ``the power of ideas and leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, Hauser added jokingly, the former New York
Knicks star could challenge the vice president to a playground
basketball game. ``It's a very simple strategy,'' Hauser said.
``Best two out of three games of Horse.''

TIME TO FACE THE HYPHEN QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The novel of the month, at least for readers who haven't sworn
off political fiction forever, is Erik Tarloff's ``Face-Time'' _
another Washington tale of an alpha male president and the fallout
from his sexual exploits.
</P>
<P>
   But as a professional nitpicker, I'm stalled on the title page.
Why the hyphen in ``Face-Time''? I haven't been so puzzled by a
hyphen since the debut of ``Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Face time, now slang for close-up exposure to an important
person, is older than you think. Lisa Birnbach, author of ``The
Preppy Handbook,'' found it on campus when she researched her 1984
guide to American colleges _ and when People magazine quoted her,
it was face time, two words. As it infiltrated the worlds of
business and politics, face time remained an ``open compound,'' and
the three current dictionary entries I've found all cite it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Though many two-word compounds change, over time, to hyphenated
forms and then to solid ones, face time seems to be resisting the
process. It is most often written like other open compounds
describing a kind of time _ down time, free time, sack time _
rather than the compounds referring to a time of day, like
lunchtime, dinnertime, bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   This is only a tendency, though, not yet a standard spelling.
Tarloff himself made the call for his book, and he likes the
hyphenated face-time. ``Making it one word _ facetime _ is
awkward,'' he reasons in an e-mail, ``and making it two separate
words _ face time _ undermines the notion of its being a single
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to make things more confusing, the cover of ``Face-Time''
doesn't use the hyphen. That's because the two words are stacked,
one atop the other, and graphic designers hate to see a hyphen
hanging out at the end of a line, especially when the type is two
inches high. Even the indisputably hyphenated Merriam-Webster Inc.
gives in on this point, allowing itself to be styled Merriam
Webster _ no hyphen _ on some jacket designs.
</P>
<P>
   Tarloff's hyphenated style may well become the standard someday.
But the variation from current newspaper style can make for an
eyeball-twisting reading experience _ as in last week's New York
Times review, where the hyphenated title ``Face-Time'' alternates
with the generic noun face time.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers may be noticing a bit of inconsistency here. I'm
lax about lighted vs. lit, tolerant of who for whom, and
practically libertine on so-called redundancies, yet this tiny
hyphen is affecting me like sand on a contact lens. Well, you know
the old saying about consistency . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quotes and comment
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A recent Globe story on the Montreal Metro's anti-loitering
strategy _ playing opera, loudly, to drive away young toughs and
panhandlers _ brought a phoned-in protest to the ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem with the article,'' said the caller. ``The
first sentence reads, `Music, it is said, has charms to soothe the
savage breast.' Breast?''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, it's breast, all right, though not in the Wonderbra sense.
The word's other, equally ancient meaning _ the front of the chest,
and hence the heart, the locus of emotion _ was what William
Congreve had in mind when he wrote, in 1697, ``Music has charms to
soothe a savage breast.''
</P>
<P>
   But Congreve didn't have to wait for 20th-century barbarians to
savage his line, Ask the Globe reported in a 1994 column. The beast
version of the line was recycled just a few decades after
Congreve's play, in James Bramston's ``The Man of Taste,'' and the
two versions have vied for supremacy ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Beast gets a boost from the relative rarity of breast, in
Congreve's sense; today it survives mainly in idioms like
breast-beating and make a clean breast of it. And beast is, after
all, equally plausible: It would have made as much sense to Mozart,
whose magic flute made the wild animals dance, as it no doubt does
to the managers of the Montreal Metro. If you like playing gotcha!
with your friends, though, breast is the version with the better
pedigree.

BOSTON SCHOOL BUSING FADING AS A KEY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The day after Mayor Thomas M. Menino announced a
neighborhood school plan that would effectively end student busing
in Boston, not one person came to a School Committee meeting to
object.
</P>
<P>
   A court case that could mean the dismantling of the entire
student assignment system, which uses race as one of the factors in
assigning students to city schools, was met with only tepid
protests by a handful of minority leaders last month.
</P>
<P>
   And when a series of public hearings was held last year on
possible changes in the student assignment policy, fewer than 10
parents attended each session.
</P>
<P>
   Busing is rapidly unraveling in Boston, but recent developments
have failed to spark any of the angry debates, the stormy protests
or unbridled passions that accompanied the historic 1974 court
ruling ordering Boston's schools to be integrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to people standing up and fighting for what they
believe in,'' said Hattie McKinnis, head of the Citywide Parents
Coalition, which was established to aid parents as part of the
desegregation court order. ``Now, people are mostly talking behind
closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of public outcry may have its roots in at least the
partial success of busing's original mission: Blacks have largely
been provided with the same access to educational resources as
whites, some parents and city leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they say, the injustices in the Boston public schools have
shifted from race to questions of quality: Today in Boston schools,
students of every ethnicity are provided a mediocre education.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of more teachers in schools, facilities, and bringing
people together in terms of diversity, busing did that,'' McKinnis
said. ``But in terms of academics, it didn't achieve much in that
direction, but that is for whites, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe (minority parents) feel their child is not getting what
they need academically, but they say, `So-and-so's (white) son
isn't either,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Alkins, head of the Boston chapter of the NAACP, said,
``The Boston educational system is worse now than it was 25 years
ago. . . . They are giving a bad education to all students.''
</P>
<P>
   Menino's plan to build five new neighborhood schools within the
next six years, along with a major reconfiguration of the use of
existing school buildings, will permit children to walk to schools
close to their homes, if they want to. He and schools
Superintendent Thomas W. Payzant have also pledged to give parents
a choice of schools to pick from. Still, that choice may be limited
to as few as seven or eight schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some minority parents, particularly those who attended Boston
public schools themselves, say they are mistrustful of any plan
that would give them a smaller choice of schools. They say their
concern is not about schools segregated by race but by economic
inequality, with schools in wealthier neighborhoods potentially
drawing in more educational resources and support.
</P>
<P>
   But many also said they are waiting until a definitive plan is
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last year I have heard about six different plans and
we don't know what to believe,'' said Jacqueline Avina of Jamaica
Plain, a black parent of a seventh-grader, who went to Boston
public schools. ``I think it is all politics. But I care. It can
get confusing though, you hear they are just trying out all these
different things.''
</P>
<P>
   School sources say the end of busing is imminent, perhaps even
before the implementation of Menino's six-year plan. The US Supreme
Court will decide this spring whether to rule on a Boston Latin
race-based admission case that could have nationwide significance
for school busing desegregation policies. The nation's highest
court has never ruled on admission policies at the public secondary
school level.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, school desegregation orders have been lifted in
cities such as Oklahoma City, Denver, and Cleveland. White parents
in Charlotte, N.C. _ using the same constitutional argument that
prompted the desegregation movement _ are suing for equal access to
schools they say their children are being denied entrance to
because they are white.
</P>
<P>
   Some minority _ and white _ parents say the silence surrounding
the proposed return to neighborhood schools is partially the result
of the phrase having a different connotation today than it did 25
years ago. Then, Boston's neighborhoods were segregated largely by
race, and white residents opposed the integration of their
neighborhoods as much as their schools.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many schools are as diverse as the neighborhoods that
surround them and if busing ended tomorrow, the classroom
demographics would change little. For example, when busing began,
East Boston was 1 percent minority. Now, it is more than 24
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, the city wasn't integrated, now it is,'' said
Maureen Joy, a white parent of an eighth-grader. Joy lives in South
Boston's Old Colony housing development where she says the majority
of her neighbors are minorities. ``So why can't my kid go to a
school down the street as much as across town?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many parents seem almost mystified by the fears that
neighborhood schools could mean less of an education for their
children. Many didn't grow up in the city or others were too young
to remember the ancient books that black pupils had to use in the
classrooms which were in overcrowded, decrepit buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``With neighborhood schools I could go either way,'' said
Dorchester resident Carla Webster, who is black and has 5- and
7-year-old children. She grew up in Ohio. ``A lot of parents in the
neighborhoods want local schools. I want choice, but because I want
to choose the best education for my children.''

`GMA' OFFERS FAMILY VALUES, PLUS SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GOOD MORNING AMERICA 
Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer 
ABC, 7-9 a.m., Mon.-Fri. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble with television these days is that the networks are
going ``back to the future,'' a phrase uttered Monday by Charles
Gibson, who returned to cohost ``Good Morning America'' with Diane
Sawyer. So much for the youth movement.
</P>
<P>
   Each month the major broadcast networks _ NBC, ABC, and CBS _
lose ground to cable, Fox, and WB. In an effort to restore its
competitiveness, it seems that ABC has decided to go with the
familiar and cozy. From the eternal flame glowing in the set's
fireplace to the American flag above the mantel, there's no
question that ``GMA'' is trying to recapture a core audience it
believes was eroded by ousted cohosts Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to return the show to its core values, which are
warmth with intelligence and a sense of family,'' ABC News
president David Westin said in a press conference last week. ``
`GMA' has been a wonderful and treasured franchise for ABC as a
network for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Gibson echoed Westin's sentiments, opening the show with
a pledge that the program would go ``back to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   It started on a newsworthy note with former presidential
candidate Bob Dole speaking on the slaughter of 45 Albanians in a
village in Kosovo over the weekend. Since Dole has been an
outspoken activist concerning the murder of civilians and ethnic
carnage in Eastern Europe, his appearance was timely and
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But then the trouble began. From syrupy ``welcome back''
drop-ins from Candice Bergen _ in her pajamas with her two dogs,
Lois and Louis (presumably named after publicist Lois Smith and
Bergen's late husband, director Louis Malle) _ wishing Sawyer and
Gibson luck, to the loss of the audio feed from Colonel Michael
Phillips in Kosovo, the first show never found its legs.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson is Gibson; viewers either find his naivete ingratiating
or unnerving. But Sawyer is a different story. Cohosting ``20/20''
with Sam Donaldson is a sprint compared to the early-morning,
two-hours-a-day, five-days-a-week grind. And if Sawyer is to
succeed, she needs to shed that schoolmarmish voice, which sounds
terribly patronizing.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in spite of the constant reminder that ``GMA'' is going to
be family-oriented, both Gibson and Sawyer issued warnings that a
story on what constitutes sex may be inappropriate for children.
</P>
<P>
   You might want ``children to do something else for the next half
hour,'' she said. . So what's the deal?
</P>
<P>
   Either you run a show that conforms to a particular definition
of family values or you open it up to a much wider vision. The one
thing parents don't want to do is stick their kids in another room
while they watch morning TV. You can't have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   While it's tough to judge a program designed for longer
distances on the basis of the opening episode, ``Good Morning
America'' has a long way to go if it wants to recapture the
audience firmly ensconced with Matt and Katie just across town.

BRAZIL'S FUTURE IN THE BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brazil's economic future _ and that of Latin America _ may hinge
on the ability of its political leaders to enact painful budget
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the finance minister, Pedro Malan, and the new
central bank chief, Francisco Lopes, met in Washington with the
International Monetary Fund seeking early access to the next
installment of a $41.5 billion aid package. The officials want to
bolster investor confidence following the decision Friday to allow
the real, Brazil's embattled currency, to float freely.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF refused to accelerate payment, scheduled for
February. That shifts the focus from Washington back to Brasilia,
the capital, where the Congress is expected as early as this week
to consider budget cuts and a new tax that would reduce a $64
billion deficit, currently about 8 percent of the gross domestic
product of Brazil, the world's eighth-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   The real has lost nearly one-third of its value since the
government first devalued and then released the currency from its
peg to the US dollar, a system in place since 1994 to check
inflation. Brazil affirmed Monday that it would continue to allow
the real to float, though it could intervene if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely agreed the real was overpriced. But the urgency of
fiscal reform increased as Brazil's situation deteriorated Monday.
The real lost nearly 10 percent of its value in a single day,
closing at 1.57 real to the US dollar, down from 1.43 real at the
beginning of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stock market in Sao Paulo rose 5.4 percent Monday,
it was little changed in dollar terms because of a dropping real.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people saying the IMF should've given them
money to support the new exchange-rate regime,'' said Catherine
Mann, a Latin America specialist at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Mann said that ``what is much more important than the
exchange rate regime are the fiscal issues.'' If the IMF had
granted Brazil's request for aid, it would ``take the onus off the
people internally to resolve these critical issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high not only for Brazil but also for its
neighbors _ and perhaps other emerging economies _ if Asia's
cascade of currency crises were repeated in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's economy minister, Roque Fernandez, said Monday that
his country's economy could shrink as much as 1 percent in the wake
of devaluation in Brazil, the destination of one-third of Argentine
exports. Latin Americans buy about one-fifth of all US exports.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials said they were forced to remove the real
from its dollar peg to release the pressure on interest rates and
give a kick to an economy expected to contract by 4 percent this
year. Despite a fear that devaluation might reignite inflation, the
government could no longer afford to continue to defend the
currency, which had depleted reserves to below half of year-ago
levels.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing, Finance Minister Malan said: ``We have a new
system in which we have consulted with (the IMF and the US
Treasury), and we agreed it was the proper system.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the government must restore stability by restoring the faith
of the international investment community. Deficit reduction is
key, analysts said, because it could help control the government's
costs at a time interest rates are running at 20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as a condition of the IMF-US aid granted to Brazil last
fall in the wake of Russia's financial collapse, deficit reduction
is a condition of future IMF funding.
</P>
<P>
   Congress late in 1998 had rejected the pension bill once, a move
that sent markets plummeting in December.
</P>
<P>
   But the government may now be listening to critics _ and
investors _ outside Brazil. The chief congressional lobbyist,
Communications Minister Pimenta da Veiga, said he expected
legislators to approve pension reform and a tax on financial
transactions to help slash the deficit this week.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mann said she believed the IMF's denial of early funding
put added pressure on Brazilian lawmakers to enact the reforms.
However, she said that it would be extremely difficult to cut
pensions for civil servants, a large and powerful constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the equivalent of cutting Social Security'' in the
United States, she said. ``To say we have to do this for the good
of the future of Brazil _ to get somebody to look beyond their next
electoral cycle _ is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegging the real to the dollar was intended to control
inflation. And it worked: The country had a deflation rate of 1.8
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   This gives Brazil more room to maneuver, said Santiago Millan,
an economist specializing in Brazil for the New York currency firm
Independent Economic Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury's still out on how much inflation this (devaluation)
is going to cause,'' Millan said. ``There are some reasons to
believe it might not be as inflationary as the Mexican devaluation
was. One of the main ones is that Brazil is a fairly closed
economy. They don't import as many goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, praised Brazil's
efforts after a weekend of emergency talks following last week's
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome in particular the confirmation that monetary policy
will be aimed at preserving low inflation,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON -- As the president's attorneys begin their
presentation to the Senate, they are in the odd position of being
able to write on a completely clean slate with regard to the key
element of the obstruction of justice charge lodged against him by
the House of Representatives last month.
</P>
<P>
   That element is the job Monica Lewinsky was offered at Revlon
just before she became a household name one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists fixate on one contact between a powerful
friend of President Clinton's, Vernon Jordan, and a bigshot New
York financier, Revlon's Ronald O. Perelman. This, Clinton's
accusers say, was an obstruction of justice because it was linked
with Lewinsky's efforts not to testify in the Paula Jones case _ a
kind of bribe to block her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Not once, however, in a chain of events commencing with
prosecutor Ken Starr's referral last summer, through all phases of
the House's handling of the mess, right through its managers'
presentation of their case last week, has a single morsel of direct
evidence or testimony even alleged a connection between the job and
the affidavit Lewinsky signed to avoid testifying in Paula Jones's
civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, from Starr in September straight through to Representative
Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas on the Senate floor last week, the key
to the charge has been inferences made from circumstances _ that
the job search was the quid pro quo for Lewinsky's silence in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the president's attorneys are talking evidence _ and
for conventional thinking about this case, the evidence is jarring
and fatal. In the light of this evidence, the famous job search is
shown to be only one of numerous examples of what happens when
prosecutorial obsession gets compounded by political zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the three elements of the accusation apart, the idea that
the actual evidence could help sustain the case for the president's
removal from office is ludicrous, especially when the only direct
evidence is exculpatory. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   1. Dec. 5, 1997, was said by Representative Hutchinson to be the
date the obstruction of justice began _ the day Lewinsky's name was
on a witness list for the Paula Jones case that was faxed to
Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, a job search described constantly as
desultory by the House managers, and even moribund during November,
supposedly turned frantic. The testimony from the participants is
to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky first brought her resume and a list of New York
companies she was interested in to Jordan on Nov. 5, 1997. That
contact had been arranged by Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, at
Lewinsky's request (this was an idea that originated with her loyal
friend, Linda Tripp). Currie arranged a phone call between the two
just before Thanksgiving, when Lewinsky was in Los Angeles. Both
testified they agreed she would get back in touch in Washington in
early December when Jordan was to return from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   2. That is exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The House case manufactures a further connection between the day
of their next meeting, Dec. 11, and the order that day by the judge
in the Jones case that her lawyers could take testimony from
alleged ``other women.''
</P>
<P>
   The first problem is that neither Starr nor the House cites a
single piece of evidence or testimony that Clinton or Jordan knew
about the judge's order on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   But get this: It is Vernon Jordan's grand jury testimony that at
this point he did not even know that the president and Lewinsky
knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more. According to grand jury testimony and FBI
interviews of the three principals (Lewinsky, Currie, and Jordan),
the president had nothing to do with the Jordan-Lewinsky job
meeting on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as arranged at Thanksgiving, Lewinsky called Currie in
early December, she called Jordan, and the Dec. 11 appointment was
made when Lewinsky called Jordan on Dec. 8 _ three days before the
judge's supposedly transformational ruling.
</P>
<P>
   3. It gets worse. The House case theorizes (because there is no
evidence) that an early January call from Jordan to Ronald Perelman
produced Lewinsky's Revlon job after she returned from what she
said was a disastrous job interview, and after she had signed the
Jones case affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   There are just two problems here. First, the Revlon person who
interviewed her told the grand jury she did just fine, and other
executives testifed that a second interview and the actual hiring
decision was made without knowledge of the Jordan-Perelman contact
and without knowledge even of Perelman's interest in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern of an inference-dominated case by the House that
literally ignores its own evidence, and also blithely assumes
actions and motives contradicted by that evidence, is shockingly
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this phase of the impeachment case, the political
melodrama may be about how long to keep the farce going with the
aid of how many witnesses who made multiple appearances before the
grand jury and Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue should be whether the House case should be
considered by the Senate as having been brought in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is that it wasn't.

COURTS CHIEF HAS A FOCUS ON DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Five years after a special commission concluded that
minority court employees faced discrimination in the workplace, a
top state judge believes the problem still exists.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Barbara Dortch-Okara is planning to use her new role as
the administrative chief for the state trial court system to
encourage increased diversity through the hiring and promotion
decisions of court managers.
</P>
<P>
   In her first extended interview since being named the chief
justice for administration and management last October,
Dortch-Okara said the discrimination may be the result of a
tendency by court managers to hire and promote ``people who look
like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dortch-Okara, 49, is the first woman, and the first
African-American, to hold daily management responsibility for the
court system with its 7,000 employees and $300 million annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination
found probable cause that four court employees were victims of
racial or gender discrimination; about 20 more complaints are
pending with MCAD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason may not be a deliberate desire to keep certain
people down,'' Dortch-Okara said of discriminatory hiring
practices. She was a member of the 1994 commission on racial and
ethnic bias in the court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think some decisions have been made (by managers) in the
past to hire people who they know look like them, or who they feel
an affinity with,'' she said. ``When you look at many courthouses
today, they are not particularly diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dortch-Okara, who when appointed in 1989 was also the first
African-American woman to serve on the Superior Court bench, said
she and the court's affirmative action officer will push managers
to search for diversity in hiring and promotion. The judge has also
created a ``work force diversity committee'' to help her improve
diversity training for court employees and ensure the search for
job candidates is as broad as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many managers, she said, ``don't realize that the demographics
have changed, and that the people coming into the courthouse today
are not the same people coming into the courthouse 15 or 20 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Dortch-Okara said she is searching for ways to
keep the opportunity for promotion alive for non-minority workers _
an opportunity that is already limited, given that few court
workers leave once they are hired. Since taking office last fall,
she has received letters from non-minority workers who feel they
have been wrongly passed over for better paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem that's not just a racial problem,'' she said.
``It's a problem for employees who are at the lower levels and want
to be promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dortch-Okara was selected as the chief justice for
administration by the Supreme Judicial Court, succeeding Judge John
J. Irwin Jr., who retired. Irwin, who held the job since 1994, used
a rigid, chain-of-command management approach that many court
workers said stifled them and allowed him to make the major
decisions as well as minor ones.
</P>
<P>
   Dortch-Okara, in the first months of her five-year term, has
adopted a more relaxed approach, according to court observers. ``I
have seen the difference,'' said Henry Cordero, vice president of
the Suffolk Superior Court officers union. ``We can solve things
more than we used to do in the past. Now, when we want, we can talk
to someone and actions are being taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Dortch-Okara, a Boston College Law School graduate, said she is
``not micromanaging. For me it would be impossible, there are so
many things going on here. I need time to think, I need time to set
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   While scoring points for stylistic changes, Dortch-Okara is also
benefitting from Irwin's tenure, during which a long-sought-after
$740 million bond bill for court construction was signed into law
and extensive planning was done on how to spend a $75 million bond
for the computerization of court records.
</P>
<P>
   How the courthouse bond money is spent is a major concern for
lawyers and court workers, who frequently work in unhealthy or
dangerous courthouses where maintenance has long been ignored.
``She's bound to make some enemies as they are selecting which
projects to go foward on,'' said one court watcher who requested
anonymity. ``She has to make some tough decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dortch-Okara said her list includes renovating the building
known as the Old Courthouse in Boston's Pemberton Square, make good
on a decade-old promises to build a new court complex in Worcester,
and to finish planning for a complex in Plymouth. But, she said,
she needs $1 billion more to upgrade or replace courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   Dortch-Okara said she misses presiding over trials, as she did
in 1996 when she drew national attention as the judge in the trial
of John C. Salvi III. He was convicted of first-degree murder in
the deaths of two women during shootings at two women's health
clinics in 1994, and later committed suicide in the state prison in
Walpole.
</P>
<P>
   But Dortch-Okara, the mother of a 5-year-old son and wife of
psychologist Ebi Okara, who works for the Department of Mental
Health, said the time was right for a career change. She plans to
return to the courtroom when her term expires in 2003, and expects
then to ``get a sense of whether I made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I want to be able to make a mark on the trial
court.''

presentation of their case last week, has a single morsel of direct
evidence or testimony even alleged a connection between the job and
the affidavit Lewinsky signed to avoid testifying in Paula Jones's
civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, from Starr in September straight through to Representative
Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas on the Senate floor last week, the key
to the charge has been inferences made from circumstances _ that
the job search was the quid pro quo for Lewinsky's silence in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the president's attorneys are talking evidence _ and
for conventional thinking about this case, the evidence is jarring
and fatal. In the light of this evidence, the famous job search is
shown to be only one of numerous examples of what happens when
prosecutorial obsession gets compounded by political zeal.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the three elements of the accusation apart, the idea that
the actual evidence could help sustain the case for the president's
removal from office is ludicrous, especially when the only direct
evidence is exculpatory. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   1. Dec. 5, 1997, was said by Representative Hutchinson to be the
date the obstruction of justice began _ the day Lewinsky's name was
on a witness list for the Paula Jones case that was faxed to
Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, a job search described constantly as
desultory by the House managers, and even moribund during November,
supposedly turned frantic. The testimony from the participants is
to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky first brought her resume and a list of New York
companies she was interested in to Jordan on Nov. 5, 1997. That
contact had been arranged by Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, at
Lewinsky's request (this was an idea that originated with her loyal
friend, Linda Tripp). Currie arranged a phone call between the two
just before Thanksgiving, when Lewinsky was in Los Angeles. Both
testified they agreed she would get back in touch in Washington in
early December when Jordan was to return from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   2. That is exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The House case manufactures a further connection between the day
of their next meeting, Dec. 11, and the order that day by the judge
in the Jones case that her lawyers could take testimony from
alleged ``other women.''
</P>
<P>
   The first problem is that neither Starr nor the House cites a
single piece of evidence or testimony that Clinton or Jordan knew
about the judge's order on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   But get this: It is Vernon Jordan's grand jury testimony that at
this point he did not even know that the president and Lewinsky
knew each other.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more. According to grand jury testimony and FBI
interviews of the three principals (Lewinsky, Currie, and Jordan),
the president had nothing to do with the Jordan-Lewinsky job
meeting on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as arranged at Thanksgiving, Lewinsky called Currie in
early December, she called Jordan, and the Dec. 11 appointment was
made when Lewinsky called Jordan on Dec. 8 _ three days before the
judge's supposedly transformational ruling.
</P>
<P>
   3. It gets worse. The House case theorizes (because there is no
evidence) that an early January call from Jordan to Ronald Perelman
produced Lewinsky's Revlon job after she returned from what she
said was a disastrous job interview, and after she had signed the
Jones case affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   There are just two problems here. First, the Revlon person who
interviewed her told the grand jury she did just fine, and other
executives testifed that a second interview and the actual hiring
decision was made without knowledge of the Jordan-Perelman contact
and without knowledge even of Perelman's interest in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern of an inference-dominated case by the House that
literally ignores its own evidence, and also blithely assumes
actions and motives contradicted by that evidence, is shockingly
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this phase of the impeachment case, the political
melodrama may be about how long to keep the farce going with the
aid of how many witnesses who made multiple appearances before the
grand jury and Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue should be whether the House case should be
considered by the Senate as having been brought in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is that it wasn't.

MUSIC STORE OWNER HITS SOUR NOTE IN EAST TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ When Mark Cory Stephens opened BandWagon
Music Co. on a quiet side street here in the town that bills itself
as the oldest in Texas, he figured market forces were on his side.
</P>
<P>
   The popular band programs at the Nacogdoches schools, as well as
the ones in nearby communities deep in the Piney Woods, meant a
steady demand for musical instruments. As for suppliers, the
closest competition was more than 60 miles north in Longview.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephens soon realized he had miscalculated. Most of his
prospective clients chose to do business with Longview's Alto Tatum
Band &AMP; Music Co., the choice of East Texas band directors. In fact,
area directors recommended that their students shop there, often
instructing them to buy certain brands only Alto Tatum is licensed
to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Now Stephens is suing Alto Tatum and 15 band directors from nine
East Texas school districts, arguing that they are conspiring to
squeeze him out of the music market. The lawsuit, filed in state
district court in Nacogdoches, contends that the Longview company
and the area band directors are violating school board policies and
state antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the day I went into business,'' said Stephens, ``they've
done everything they could to put me out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Stephens says, there are letters to parents from
band directors touting Alto Tatum and warning them to stay away
from ``fly-by-night'' establishments. He argues that for years
schools in East Texas invited only Alto Tatum on campus for ``band
drive,'' an annual event where kids sign up to play a musical
instrument. And Stephens says band directors continue to push
instruments sold exclusively by Alto Tatum.
</P>
<P>
   Though none of the nine school districts is named in the
lawsuit, they deny any wrongdoing on the part of their band
directors. The band directors themselves say they were acting in
the best interest of their students. Alto Tatum, too, pleads
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our client denies any conduct that is unlawful or wrongful,''
said Chad Everingham, an attorney and spokesman for Alto Tatum,
``and is resolved to vigorously defend itself against the
allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   The contentious case has touched a nerve, not only in East Texas
communities such as Nacogdoches and nearby Lufkin but also in
cities such as Houston, where the owners of small music businesses
say they, too, are victims of collusion between school districts
and big companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Walter Broughton of Broughton's Horn Shop argues
that Houston school district band directors have long steered
students to band-supply giant H&AMP;H Music Co.
</P>
<P>
   And Gene Hilliard of Music Music Co. lodges the same complaint
against the nearby Alief school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you're in or you're out,'' said Hilliard. ``And most
small music companies are out.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Alief and Houston districts reject the notion that they
conspire with H&AMP;H to determine winners and losers in the music
business. They say the sale of musical instruments is going much
the way of books, with the big retailers swallowing the smaller
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fight between music stores,'' said Paula Smith,
Alief performing arts coordinator. ``My band directors should be
left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Texas schools forbid officials from recommending or
requiring students to buy specific brands if there are others
equally suitable for teaching purposes. But schools routinely
suggest retailers where students might buy supplies or uniforms or
band instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Lufkin High School band director Paul Najera says he recommends
certain brands of instruments because some are better than others.
And who better to make that recommendation, he says, than a band
director?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trained in everything that's involved in band,'' said
Najera. ``That's what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether band directors who endorse certain
music stores or brands that are sold exclusively at those stores
receive anything in return, but no evidence suggests that is the
case. ``In no way do I think anyone involved was doing anything
wrong,'' said John Sharp, Lufkin superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Robinson, an Austin lawyer representing the band
directors, says she intends to argue that the band directors were
acting in good faith. Even so, Robinson says, state law holds
teachers immune from most litigation and she predicts that will be
true in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the relationship between Alto Tatum and East Texas band
directors is at least a cozy one. In 1997 the Lufkin schools
invited the company to its band halls to sell instruments to
prospective band members.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to parents, which has the unmistakable ring of an
advertisement, Najera said the company ``has been in business in
East Texas for 50 years now and has continued to serve many area
schools with quality, dependable instruments, accessories, timely
service and delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   After Stephens protested, Lufkin school officials prohibited
band directors from backing specific companies. But Stephens argues
that the staff did the same thing this year, promoting a band drive
featuring Alto Tatum at a church rather than on campus.
</P>
<P>
   A similar scenario was played out in Nacogdoches, where the band
drive was moved from campus to the downtown Fredonia Hotel, with
Alto Tatum setting up shop there. School officials acknowledged
BandWagon as a shopping alternative, but Stephens says only as an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a hint of monopoly, some parents are speaking out.
Tamara Horn says Nacogdoches school officials recommended an Alto
Tatum trombone for her son. When she chose not to buy it, instead
buying a similar model from Stephens, she says her son's band
director made disparaging remarks about his horn.
</P>
<P>
   Nacogdoches' Richard Fischer says school officials tried to get
his daughter to buy an expensive flute from Alto Tatum instead of
letting her use a borrowed brand that is the choice of the local
Stephen F. Austin University marching band.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of pressure on parents,'' Fischer
said, ``but it's applied through the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Alto Tatum almost certainly provides more choice in instruments,
and in some cases better-known brands. Agreements between the
company and certain manufacturers prohibit BandWagon from selling
some of the instruments that are considered the top choice in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stephens offers no interest on purchases, compared to a
rate of nearly 20 percent at Alto Tatum. For those kids who choose
a rent-to-own program, popular with those who may decide after a
year to quit band, he offers what he describes as a less
restrictive program than the competition. And Stephens promises
faster turnaround on repair.
</P>
<P>
   Like the independent bookstore fighting the giant chain,
Stephens' fight will not be easily won. But he contends that
Nacogdoches, a struggling East Texas town reliant on chicken
farming and timber and the local university, ought to rally around
its own businesses before those located 60 miles out of town.
</P>
<P>
   But his lawsuit is causing plenty of ill will, which may be
difficult to erase even if Stephens prevails. Said Sharp, the
Lufkin superintendent, ``Suing people you want to do business with
is no way to get that business.''

GUN FOUND IN LOCKER AMPLIFIES STUDENT'S `CRY FOR HELP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN AND RIC KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ He was sweet, but odd. The girls liked him for
his tender ways, but the boys teased him, mocking his strange
stories.
</P>
<P>
   As the only boy from the tiny town of Hill to attend Bishop
Brady High School, the shy 15-year-old sophomore created a fantasy
world, classmates said, and climbed deep inside. To puff up his
reputation at the private Catholic school, the former Boy Scout
reinvented himself as a bold mob soldier, a ruthless member of the
Russian underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, the boy allegedly told his fellow math students
that he was part of a group taking orders from a middle-aged man in
Portsmouth, and was involved in high-stakes crimes: ``We sell
drugs. We kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some classmates muttered that he was a Mafia loser, and rolled
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But while his classmates worked on math problems, the
15-year-old started scrawling inside his algebra book the names of
66 students and school officials _ enemies he felt had done him and
others wrong. On Friday, Jan. 8, the 15-year-old was talking big
again. He claimed to have a gun, a hit list, and a desire to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of his classmates scoffed, one took the threats to
heart and reported them to school officials. When police were
summoned, they found the target list, a compilation as confused as
the boy himself. In the boy's locker, they discovered a loaded
.22-caliber revolver and 400 rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 15-year-old is being held at a locked youth facility,
and authorities are probing his background and mental state to
determine whether to try him as an adult on felony charges of
attempted assault and reckless conduct. Regardless of whether he is
convicted, the boy could endure for a lifetime the kind of ridicule
he so desperately wanted to rub out.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is a juvenile, police and the Globe are withholding
the boy's name.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolmates recall him as a loner with a small circle of
friends, a boy who sat quietly in class and rarely raised his hand.
Then he'd blurt out that he was involved in a huge extortion case
with the Russian mob, prompting ugly taunts from kids he hoped to
impress.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, for one day, the boy became big man on campus. He
carried a gun to school, allegedly stolen from his father, and
vowed to settle unfathomable grudges.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond calculating a roster of his targets, students said, the
boy also solicited nominees for his hit list from classmates.
Moving from one group to another, he added names, scratched out
others, and reveled in his newfound popularity.
</P>
<P>
   To students, the boy seemed to magnify his perceived slights
into causes celebre.
</P>
<P>
   The student who stabbed him with a pen freshman year _ he was
put on the hit list. The kid who gave him a dirty look in the
hallway _ he was added. The upperclass track teammate who didn't
even know he existed made the hit list, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to tell why a list would be so large,'' said
Concord Police Lieutenant Paul Murphy. ``A lot of people had no
idea why they would be on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the chaotic days after his arrest, police and school
officials worked to decode this primitive hit list _ scrawled with
full names, partial ones, even initials _ and then track down the
would-be targets.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was one bullet missing from the cylinder and more
than 100 rounds gone from the ammunition box, police feared a
corpse would turn up somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That never happened. Even now, police say they have found no
thread connecting the people on the list _ girls and boys, students
and teachers, upper- and lowerclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cry for help and attention,'' said Brieana Speaker, a
15-year-old classmate. ``Maybe he thought the only way for people
to listen was to do something of this caliber.''
</P>
<P>
   When police arrested him, they said, he was dull, emotionless _
a flat-liner.
</P>
<P>
   Police say it's unclear whether the 15-year-old intended to
shoot someone. Still, if he is tried and convicted as an adult, the
boy could spend up to 22 years in prison. If convicted as a
juvenile, he could be kept in a locked youth facility, such as the
one he is being held in now, until he reaches 18.
</P>
<P>
   As authorities build their case, they indicate that the alleged
``hit list'' separates the defendant from other students who might
risk sneaking a gun into school.
</P>
<P>
   What connects him to boys who have actually carried out deadly
plans on schoolyards is fantasy, an imagined link to a glorified
criminal element such as the Russian mob.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, one of the two schoolboys who gunned down their
classmates with guns stolen from their homes told classmates he was
a member of the Bloods, a violent street gang begun in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Those two boys, like the Bishop Brady sophomore, bragged about
their plan to plenty of classmates.
</P>
<P>
   They felt shunned at school and wanted to show off, just like
the boy from Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In his hometown (population 850), it is hard to find anyone who
believes the local boy who blushed as he was congratulated at a
Bishop Brady track meet could have intended bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting back tears and still in shock, the boy's father
declined to comment at the advice of his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The family lives on what the locals call the Mountain, in a big
house with a back porch crammed with sleds and shovels.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Hill, who exchange their local news at the Village
Store, know the boy as a pleasant and polite classmate of their own
children, and his parents as hard-working neighbors devoted to
their three children.
</P>
<P>
   Still, neighbors recall that the boy had long been a step away
from the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he could be a strange kid once in a while,'' said
Barrett Batchelder, 16, rushing to wait on customers at the
village's red-white-and-blue gas station.
</P>
<P>
   As a grade schooler at Jennie D. Blake Elementary, the boy
struggled against an impulse to gnaw on things: his sleeve,
classroom crayons, even batteries. Soon, he was the only student
allowed to chew gum.
</P>
<P>
   As he grew older, the boy tried to overcome his awkwardness with
a macho attitude. He took karate lessons. He challenged other boys
to hit him in the stomach, and then laughed after the blows were
landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he was trying to show he was tough or what,''
said Mark Bogannon, 19, a Village Store cashier and Hill resident.
</P>
<P>
   At Bishop Brady, an hour's ride from Hill, the boy struggled to
find his place among shifting cliques, students said. His
adolescent angst increased this school year, after his close friend
from Hill moved out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Vashon, whose daughter car-pooled to Bishop Brady with
the boy, said she blamed a culture that glorifies violence, and the
media that sensationalize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to that family is devastating,'' Vashon said.
``Of course, they are in our thoughts, and our prayers.'' Like many
others, Vashon said she is pained by the image of the boy's parents
ending a visit with him, then traveling the long, rural road at
night that leads to their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully he will get help, and can lead a normal life,'' she
said of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   With a squadron of snowmobiles circling in the fresh snow by the
village gas station, Batchelder said he feels sorrow for a boy he
used to see happily playing tetherball and shopping with his
parents at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real sad,'' Batchelder said. ``I just don't know where he
would get these feelings inside, you know, to do what he did.''

CLASS DISTINCTIONS IN THE UMASS SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Massachusetts college administrator will always remember her
first encounter with Bill Weld. She spotted the then governor at a
summer jazz festival and told him she worked at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you stand it?'' Weld quipped. ``I think we ought to
bomb the place and start all over.''
</P>
<P>
   His flippancy came to mind recently when the administrator heard
about plans to build an elite college at UMass-Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Weld's successor, Paul Cellucci, now sits in the governor's
office. William M. Bulger, the former Senate president, is now
UMass president.
</P>
<P>
   And UMass-Boston is still worth bombing and rebuilding _ not
because of the education offered there, but because of the sad
state of the physical campus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when a special $15 million budgetary appropriation is sought
from the state, it is for a new complex to house an ``academically
exclusive'' Commonwealth College at UMass-Amherst. The goal, we are
told, is to encourage excellence in the state university system.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is stupid to argue against the pursuit of excellence.
But, according to Selma Botman, vice president for academic
affairs, the education offered at UMass is already excellent.
</P>
<P>
   If that is indeed true, who needs an exclusive enclave with a
fancy new name and a fancy new building?
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest. UMass needs it _ or thinks it does _ for one
reason: to convince excellent students and their proud parents that
it's OK to forget Harvard and attend our state university.
</P>
<P>
   This is about image.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with image enhancement _ just as there is
nothing wrong with reaching out to the state's top high school
students and trying to change any misperceptions they have about
the quality of education available at UMass.
</P>
<P>
   But quite frankly, an element of the elitism behind this
particular budgetary quest is a little bit scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to reward academically talented students and
bring them together in an environment with like-minded students,''
says Botman. ``Here we are saying, we want to give you an
opportunity where you live and work with people who are thinking
about the same things you are thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the college experience really supposed to ensure that people
with the same IQs and SAT scores get to live, work, and learn
together? It's certainly not what happens in the real world. So, is
it anything close to an appropriate goal for a public university?
</P>
<P>
   And how do you make a special budget request for a brand new
building for smart people without thinking about the message it
sends to everyone else?
</P>
<P>
   UMass spokesman Robert Connolly points out that the university
is in the second year of a major capital improvement program that
will expend nearly $700 million before it ends.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, half the money will be spent on new facilities
at the Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth, Lowell, and Worcester campuses
of the university. The remainder will be spent on maintenance,
repair, and renewal of existing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Boston campus continues to trail in money allocated
through this program. For example, when Dartmouth received $5.6
million, Lowell $4 million, and Amherst $1.5 million, Boston
received $839,000.
</P>
<P>
   That is probably why buckets are still strategically placed
across the UMass-Boston campus to catch rainwater during storms.
The garage is falling apart. And the library is dark, cold, and
technically antiquated.
</P>
<P>
   One UMass trustee, Peter J. Berlandi, says he supports the
Commonwealth College proposal as a way to attract the best
students. He nonetheless agrees that ``as an institution, we want
to make sure the balance is maintained so we can reward those
students who excel without jeopardizing the future for everyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   If the elite are taken care of first and best, what is the
message to everyone else?

<P>
   It's not subtle at all.
</P>
<P>
   It screams out to those who don't make the honors cut: You're
just not worth that much.

PATH TO HAPPINES, DALAI LAMA WRITES, IS AN INWARD JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The quest for happiness as been a basic human desire since
before the dawn of history. It continues today despite the
observation of Buddha and others through the ages that suffering is
our inescapable fate.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, as in other Western societies, we
frequently seem to equate happiness with the realization of our
desires: finding the perfect mate, landing the right job, or buying
the dream house in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just about everyone knows someone who has one or more
of the things they desire and yet are still unhappy. That seems to
strongly suggest, as the Dalai Lama asserts in a new book he has
coauthored, that happiness comes not from the external world, but
from within.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness,''
the Dalai Lama says in the opening sentence to ``The Art of
Happiness: A Handbook for Living'' (Riverhead, $22.95), written
with Dr. Howard C. Cutler, a Phoenix psychiatrist whom the Dalai
Lama met in 1982 when Cutler was in India studying Tibetan
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether one believes in religion or not, whether one believes
in this religion or that religion, we all are seeking something
better in life. So, I think, the very motion of our life is towards
happiness,'' the Dalai Lama writes.
</P>
<P>
   That begs the question of how do we attain happiness and, more
fundamentally, what exactly is happiness. For the Dalai Lama, it's
all in our minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Dalai Lama's perspective, there are many different
levels of happiness,'' Cutler said during an interview during a
recent visit to Boston. ``But based on our discussions, I'd say his
definition of happiness is a feeling of joy and a sense of
contentment that results from developing a calm, stable state of
mind rooted in affection and compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama makes a clear distinction between happiness and
pleasure. Pleasure is based mainly on ``physical, sensory
experiences'' that are subject to change and can be fleeting, he
contends.
</P>
<P>
   But happiness, as the Dalai Lama views it, is connected to one's
heart and mind and because of this is more reliable and resilient
to the vicissitudes of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dalai Lama isn't saying that we shouldn't provide for our
families or have a comfortable home,'' said Cutler, who was raised
as a Jew but has adapted Buddhist practices into his life. ``But if
suffering is a natural fact of human existence, then we need
strategies to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler was introduced to the Dalai Lama by the exiled Tibetan
leader's late older brother, Lobsang Samden, who was director of
the Tibetan Medical Institute in Dharamsala, India.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, who left his Himalayan homeland, has set up a
government-in-exile in Dharamsala.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Dalai Lama's lofty position and worldwide
reputation, Cutler had expected to encounter an ``aloof,
dignified'' religious leader. Instead, Cutler found the him to be
``one of the warmest, most genuine and sincere persons I had ever
met.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutler began working on the book soon after he helped organize
the Dalai Lama's visit to Arizona in 1993. Cutler said he did not
want to write another book on Buddhism, which is in vogue among
many Americans. The book market is full of titles on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to distill various elements of the Dalai Lama's
teaching into something practical that people could use in their
everyday lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to happiness and the Dalai Lama, one of the most
intriguing questions, and one that certainly interested Cutler, is
how the Tibetan spiritual leader is able to remain so upbeat given
the dismal plight of his people.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others who have been in the Dalai Lama's presence,
Cutler said the Buddhist leader's happiness is both palpable and
infectious, even when he is discussing Tibet-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it comes from developing the capacity to view any
given situation from a variety of perspectives,'' Cutler said. ``In
his own life, the fact that he was forced to leave his country and
live as a refugee could be seen as horrible. But from a differnt
angle, living like a refugee has been a good thing because he has
met many different people from different backgrounds whom he never
would have met if he stayed in Tibet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama's insights might seem obvious, but Cutler says it
is easy to lose sight of the obvious in our frenetic and
success-oriented society. ``Some of these ideas sound like cliches,
but the trick is to constantly remind yourself of that, and
gradually it does change the way you look at things,'' Cutler said.

FIG IVY TOPIARIES MAKE FEW DEMANDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have questions about a fig ivy topiary I received as a
gift. How is it watered? Do we fertilize it? Should it be set in
soil? Sun or shade? How much hot and cold weather will it tolerate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since your topiary has already fully grown in, all you need
to do is water when rain doesn't provide adequate moisture, and
apply a diluted liquid fertilizer every two to three weeks during
the growing season. You will find the topiary accepts sun to bright
shade. If you place it on soil and do not keep it clipped close to
the topiary form, the fig ivy will vigorously send out runners that
will root wherever they come in contact with soil. I have a bunny
topiary of fig ivy my son gave me years ago, and the runners
escaped and now provide shade on the west side of our screened
porch. I've named the little topiary ``The Runaway Bunny,'' as it
reminds me of the children's story by the same name.
</P>
<P>
   I've found the ivy is surprisingly tough. A freeze into the 20s
will burn the ends, but heat seems to be no problem. I really don't
even fertilize mine, but an occasional fertilization will boost
foliage health.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are aerating shoes worthwhile? How often should they be used?
How does one convert a weak lawn under a shade tree to ground cover
without disturbing the tree's roots? Is it backbreaking labor
requiring a lawn crew, or can I do it?
</P>
<P>
   My neighbor's lawn has a disease that is creeping outward in a
circular direction leaving nothing but bare soil behind. What can I
do to prevent this disease from affecting my grass?
</P>
<P>
   A: I definitely believe in the benefits of aerating the soil.
Many of us have heavy soils to begin with, and heavy rains and
heavy traffic compact the problem. Whether you purchase a pair of
aerating shoes and simply walk around your lawn or expend more
effort punching holes with a pitchfork or sharp stick, aerating
allows water and oxygen to penetrate to lower levels. I've noticed
a greener, healthier lawn in aerated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Aerate the soil before the lawn begins to put on top growth in
the spring. Occasional aeration throughout the rest of the year is
beneficial _ especially after heavy rains. I would let the lawn dry
some and not attempt to aerate a soggy situation.
</P>
<P>
   I think you could plant a ground cover beneath your tree. Ajuga,
ardisia, Asian jasmine, ferns, ivy, liriope, monkey grass, dwarf
mondo grass and vinca are shade candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The closer you set out transplants, of course, the quicker the
coverage. If the tree is deciduous, you might get a head start by
planting before the foliage fills in. Work the soil carefully
between major roots, and add organically enriched soil or compost.
Do not add more than 2 inches over the tree's root system.
</P>
<P>
   If the root system is particularly shallow and fibrous, I think
you'll find 2- to 4-inch transplants easier, as you can dig small
holes. I planted variegated vinca among the fibrous roots of our
large maple, damaging some of the intricate system, but no
long-range harm was done, as I did not chop into large roots.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the transplants watered, especially while they become
established.
</P>
<P>
   Maintain good culture _ proper watering, fertilization and
mowing _ to arm your lawn against disease. It's best to identify
the disease affecting your neighbor's lawn before treating your
lawn with a fungicide. If there is regrowth within a diseased area,
brown patch could be the problem. If there is little or no
regrowth, take-all patch could be the problem. We discussed that
situation in last week's column.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When amaryllis flowers have bloomed and leaves are turning
yellow, should we cut off the fading foliage or leave it attached?
</P>
<P>
   A: Remove the flower stalk 2 inches above the neck of the bulb
once the blooms have withered, but leave the straplike foliage to
grow. Water amaryllis regularly during spring and summer. Decrease
watering in the fall and stop when the foliage yellows. At that
time, cut the foliage off about 2 inches above the bulb. Let the
container remain dry and the bulb rest.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOWELL, Mass. _ David Cruz has the face of a boxer, with tiny
whisperlike scars etched in his satiny skin. He is 14 and boxes
daily, but his scars are from a different kind of combat.
</P>
<P>
   The deep one on his right cheek goes back to when he was a
toddler and pushed his mother's curling iron into his face when her
back was turned. The one on his forehead comes from a fall he took
off a table, tearing the stitches he already had from an earlier
fall. And that faint one on the left cheek? Well, no one quite
remembers. David was always moving so fast.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fight for survival, and not just on the street, that
propels Cruz up the tired wooden steps to Ramalho's West End Gym
every day after school. A battered two-ring gymnasium tucked on the
second floor of an abandoned textile mill at the edge of town, it
is the cliche of every poor neighborhood and bad-boy movie, its
drooping demeanor only slightly boosted by the triumphant ``Home of
Champions'' sign out front. But for the wiry young men who follow
their fathers' footsteps there, who in some cases pull their
fathers' worn silk boxing trunks over their hips, it the place
sings a solitary song of possibility. It is one of few things that
is always there.
</P>
<P>
   Not that many ever see it, for Ramalho's is a subterranean realm
that defies truisms as much as it does trendiness. At a time when
boxing is dismissed as damaging and destructive, many boxers come
to the gym specifically to avoid the dangers of the street. At a
time when youth sports are exploding and children are routinely
shuttled from one playing field to another, boxers at Ramalho's
train in isolation far from the public or parental eye. And at a
time when sports are often a vehicle to occupational heights, the
odds of Ramalho's boys making it on the pro circuit are about as
good as scoring a KO in the first round. Although there's always a
chance that someone, somewhere, just might see one of their names
in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love boxing,'' exclaimed Cruz, aiming a few rat-a-tat jabs
at the salt shaker on his mother's table. ``I love winning. Then
people start liking you. People you don't even know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramalho's gym is grimy at the seams and cold in the winter. In
the 29 years it has been in existence, 32 other boxing gyms in the
city have come and gone. The only Lowell boxing gym left, it is the
kind of place where women are tolerated _ sort of _ and the signs
on the wall say things like ``The More You Sweat, The Less You
Bleed'' and ``No pain, No gain.'' It is the kind of place that old
men remember and young men keep coming back to without entirely
knowing why. Only by looking at the lives of a few of them is it
possible to understand.
</P>
<P>
   David Cruz, for one, drops in at the gym after school six days a
week, his puckish smile as much a part of the place as the clanging
timer bell. If it were open on Sunday, he would go then too.
Usually he calls ahead, as much for the rare occasion of knowing
that someone is waiting for him as for the benefit of the sparring
scheduler. If he or any of the several dozen young men who train
there regularly don't show up for several days, someone from the
gym will call looking for him.
</P>
<P>
   A slender hundred-pounder, Cruz is bigger on enthusiasm than
discipline. Not only has he lost two public fights, he lost them to
a boy two years younger. The coaches at the gym mutter that Cruz is
a gym boxer, too nervous in public, that he doesn't listen. Maybe
it's his hyperactivity or the medication he's on. Maybe it's the
same thing that's kept him back two grades in school. But at
Ramalho's, winning, of course, isn't the main thing. It's showing
up. And in that department, Cruz has almost everyone beat.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz runs the mile and a half to the gym from his home in ``The
Acre,'' the city's oldest housing project, alternately jogging and
sprinting between telephone poles. To look at him loping through
traffic you would not know he is running because he doesn't have 70
cents bus fare, never mind seven dollars to go to the movies. You
wouldn't know that he is thinking how he is just like Mike Tyson,
who clawed through hopelessness in his early years, too. You
probably wouldn't look at him at all because in his baggy blue
pants he is one more city boy swallowed by the darkening night.
When he gets to the gym it is nearly empty, as usual on a Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way Mike Tyson's life was,'' Cruz says, solemn as
he pulls on his shorts. ``He didn't have no money to go to the
movies either.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is nearing 5 p.m. at Ramalho's, an hour and a half after the
doors opened, and the pace is picking up. Nearly two dozen young
men are going through their routine in front of the floor-length
mirrors or are poised across from one another, but the place is
oddly quiet except for the whish of soft leather boots and a
baseline hum of grunting. If concentration made a noise, the place
would be deafening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, hands up. Hands uuuuuuup,'' bellows Arthur Ramalho, the
gym's cofounder and patron saint.
</P>
<P>
   Director of The Lowell Council on Aging since the early '80s,
Ramalho is a man who would not do well in, say, Cambridge. He talks
fondly of the ``colored'' boxing coach he and Gardner Brooks, the
man with whom he started the gym in 1970, had as boys. Although a
few do, he does not like girls boxing in his gym, because, ``I
dunno. I don't like to see girls get banged around I guess.'' At
63, he knows the life stories of almost all his fighters and asks
about their schoolwork as he wraps red cotton strips around their
hands. He is widely suspected of funneling more than a few dollars
of his own money into the gym. The rest of the budget comes from
donations and renting the tired red-roped ring ($400 a night)
that's in the truck out back.
</P>
<P>
   That amateur boxing has faded from its glory days, that the YMCA
considers it too dangerous to offer, that the American Medical
Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have called for
the sport to be banned, is mere background static to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe building boys is better than mending men,'' he
declares and then grins. ``Hey, you like that?''
</P>
<P>
   David Cruz is one of those boys. A lanky youth who is not shy,
Cruz used to be taunted by other boys in the project where he
lives. Sometimes they would run after him, pointing fingers at his
skinny frame, and twice they beat him in the alley. Then there was
the man who lured him into his car with lottery tickets. Cruz
identified the man for police but became plagued alternately by
nightmares and fitful, sleepless nights. As his grades plummeted,
Cruz fought with his teachers and grew silent at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the teachers were against him,'' said his mother,
Carmen Cruz. ``He thought everyone was against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, but his sister's boyfriend, a boxer and a
lean, muscular young man whom others in the neighborhood looked up
to. Cruz begged the boyfriend to teach him to box and, finally, he
took Cruz to Ramalho's last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some boys drift in and right back out again. But when Cruz kept
showing up, Ramalho gave him a pair of old black gloves. The $10
monthly dues, well, never mind. His sister's boyfriend loaned him
trunks and a friend gave him some shoes. His coach, David Ortiz,
gave him headgear and painted his name on his locker in big black
letters. He also have him advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they put in, I'll put in,'' said Ortiz, a former
amateur lightweight and one of several volunteer coaches. ``But I
tell `em the minute they start fighting on the streets, don't come
back. I don't want nothing to do with them.''

<P>
   Cruz has been at it for over a year now. His schoolwork has
gotten a little better. The neighborhood boys have disappeared. It
is hard to say whether they're intimidated by Cruz's improved
self-confidence or by his fighting, or both, but either way the
result is the same. The boys don't know that Cruz lost to a younger
boy named Kermit last year. Or that he lost to him the year before
in the Silver Mittens tournament for juniors and keeps in the back
of his tiny closet the green silk jacket awarded to finalists, not
winners. He gave the trophy to his father, who lives somewhere
else. He says he will never wear the jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The third time he faces Kermit, and he is likely to in February,
Cruz is determined to win. Already this winter he has gained nearly
10 pounds, most of it in his upper body. He has added a mile to his
running regimen. He trains in front of the mirror to keep his head
straight. He sits at the kitchen table on a cold evening and flexes
his forearm into a hard knot of muscle as his mother lets out a
little ``Ooooohhh'' of pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I fight him again,'' Cruz said, heading out the door to
the gym. ``It'll be like a time bomb going off.''

</P>
<P>
   Matt Doyon lives only a few miles from Cruz's hardscrabble
neighborhood, but the two young men would probably never have met
if not for the gym. A Northeastern University junior, Doyon is
spending the semester marketing mutual funds at Putnam Investments
in Andover. A tightly packed 147 pounds, Doyon is part of a large
Sicilian family and makes a legendary pasta. At 21, he has no
girlfriend and lives with his mother in an apartment complex in
Chelmsford. What he has is boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Every day Doyon gets up at 5 a.m., runs 6 miles and goes to
work. He leaves at precisely 4:30 p.m. _ with the approval of his
boss, who allows him to leave early to accommodate his training _
and heads for the gym. He trains earnestly for two hours, hitting
the bags, jumping rope silently in front of the mirror, and then he
drives his blue Mustang convertible home and does some more. He
hangs upside down from an inversion rack _ a torturous-looking
device involving ankle boots attached to the closet door _ then
does situps for 25 minutes and lifts weights. He is in bed by 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to do this. I want to drink beer and chase girls
like other guys (do),'' says Doyon. ``But it's like there's a hole
in me that's only filled when I'm fighting in the gym.''
</P>
<P>
   And Doyon means fighting. ``This is the only sport where the
focus is to batter your opponent, and that is part of the
attraction for me. It sounds terrible sitting here talking, but
it's different in the ring. It's letting your id take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyon is a pretty good boxer given that he has been fighting for
only a year. He is aggressive and focused; his failing, perhaps, is
that he throws too many punches. But what has drawn him to this
combative arena, this ``poor man's sport,'' as he calls it, is not
easy for him to explain. It is true that he was close to his
grandfather, a carpenter from Sicily who fought as an amateur in
the 1930s. But his mother, Rose Sergi, does not mind telling you
that she does not like boxing, ``and I don't go to any of the
matches,'' she says. ``I couldn't bear to watch him get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyon talks about rage sometimes, a kind of untargeted force
within him. Already, he says, he feels he's been let down by people
in his life, like his father, who left home when he was a toddler
and whom he sees a couple of times a year. Friends, too. For Doyon,
who concedes that he is far more likely to wind up a businessman
than a boxer, it's all about self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to rely upon anyone when I'm in the ring,'' he
says. ``It's just me. What I've learned is that people really
underestimate what they can do. You can't be afraid of doing
anything.''

<P>
   Wilfredo ``Willie'' Vazquez knows all about confronting those
fears. At 19, he is a lean 125 pounds with a sparse black mustache
and the sweet smile of the young man who accompanies his mother to
church on Sundays. He does not look like a fighter, much less the
1994 Junior Golden Gloves Champion and one of the gym's best
lightweight fighters. And he almost wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez started fighting five years ago, but he was doing it on
the streets. Although not a member of the gangs who roamed the
project where he lived, he hovered at the fringe of their warring
and abuse. His schoolwork was poor, his attitude worse. But at the
urging of one of Ramalho's grandsons, Vazquez tried his hand at the
Lowell Housing Authority boxing team and 50 bouts later, nothing is
quite the same as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, `Wow! Boxing,' '' exclaimed Vazquez. ``Boxing was
different, something individual. It wasn't like a team where
everyone gets a trophy. It was me. I know that if I do something
out there, I accomplished it myself. Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, boxing has been the force that drives his life.
Mornings, he rose at 5 a.m. and ran 3 miles before going to work as
a cook in a cafeteria at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell.
Afternoons, he headed for the gym and pummeled the bag or an
opponent for several hours. Although his girlfriend, Jennifer
Tremblay, sometimes wishes the two of them could go out more, she
wants Vazquez to train hard because, as she points out, ``What's
the point of fighting if you're going to lose? I don't want to get
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, that very thing happened. Vazquez lost a match to an
opponent he had beaten at least once before, and his confidence
took as great a blow as his body did. He hasn't been back to the
gym since. Vazquez says he's been busy with a new night job at a
manufacturing plant and plans to join the Army reserves next month,
but insists he'll return to the ring by summer.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that fighters sometimes drift. And to hear the fervor
with which Vazquez still describes his strategy, it's a good bet
he'll be back. Because he is small, Vazquez aims less to knock his
opponent out than to tire him out, and he dances around the ring
fueled by a runner's wind. ``I just keep at `em, keep at `em. It
tires 'em out,'' explained Vazquez. ``I'm not into that power
thing. I mean, there's always someone bigger and stronger, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the small white house with the aqua trim that he shares
with his parents and two sisters, he does situps and pushups each
night and then collapses onto his narrow bunk bed flanked by 20
trophies. Tuesdays, he watches the fight on TV with his father, a
night-shift machine operator. Saturdays, he runs 6 miles. The rest
of the time he tends his three pit bulls. Vazquez loves his dogs
partly because they don't have much hair, but also because they are
fighters like himself, although he says he doesn't let them fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting dogs,'' he shrugs, watching his animals tear around
the hard-packed grassless backyard. ``It ain't right. I mean, I
like that they can do it. It ain't their fault they want to fight.
But I wouldn't take 'em out to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the young men at Ramalho's gym who have given up
more languorous lives, not to mention drinking and staying out
late, Vazquez sometimes wonders whether working so hard to stay in
shape is really worth it. Part of it is the flat-out joy of
winning. Part of it is seeing his name in the newspapers. And part
of it is that maybe one day he'll go professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I just want to prove that I can do it,'' says Vazquez.
``Maybe I just want to leave my mark.''

HIGGINS MAKES SPORT OF KILLING AN AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander Drouhin is not having a good day, but he doesn't know
yet how bad it's going to get. Boston's toughest sports agent _ his
vanity plate reads SPR AGT _ is in the skybox at the FleetCenter,
in the middle of a tricky negotiation with the general manager of
the Bruins when his cell phone rings. One of Drouhin's biggest
earners, a Patriots' player, has busted up a strip joint out beyond
Fitchburg and landed himself in jail. It's up to Drouhin to get him
out and keep the damage under control. And in the morning he has to
meet with an angry lesbian tennis player who is threatening to jump
to another agent.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, it turns out, is nothing. By the time the tennis
player calls to cancel her appointment, Drouhin has taken a couple
of bullets in the head at point-blank range, and it's up to state
police Lt. Francis Clay to find out who did it. George V. Higgins
has created a cunning puzzle in his latest novel because everybody
had reason to fear and hate Drouhin, and most of the people in his
life felt like killing him. Team officials hated him because he was
such a ruthless negotiator; his clients hated him because he could
never do enough for them and charged them too much for what he did
do. His housekeeping couple hated him because of his loose habits
and rowdy parties. His colleagues hated him because he worked them
so hard, and then took most of the money. Furthermore, Drouin's
not-quite-discreet relationship with an antique dealer named Ronnie
could send the whole agency down the tubes _ no macho athlete wants
to be represented by a gay agent. When a football player drunkenly
bursts into ``Bye, Bye Blackbird,'' he can't remember who sang it.
Drouhin knows: ``Blossom Dearie . . . Steve Lawrence and Eydie
Gorme.''
</P>
<P>
   Drouhin does have some friends besides Ronnie, however, and the
reader will stand among them; Drouhin is an amazing character that
only Higgins could have invented. Like most Higgins characters,
Drouhin is a motormouth, and you can't believe everything he says,
which is why it's so fascinating to listen to him. He's complicated
because he's an unprincipled man of principle. Readers of Higgins
have to learn to be like the good listeners in his books, who hear
what the motormouths are giving away without meaning to.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins knows the system, several systems, and how they work,
and he has a sense of humor about most of them. The barkeeper at
one of the strip joints that support a whole town testifies before
the selectmen that his patrons ``are a peacful bunch of happy
voyeurs and dance critics to whom violence is unknown.'' Higgins
tells you what things look like and where the furniture is. He
provides shading that other writers wouldn't bother with. Lt. Clay,
for example, is a recent widower; his wife has died of cancer. When
the medical team moves away from the corpse, Clay is reminded of
the synchronized waiters on a cruise he took with his wife that
they both knew would be their last holiday together. Higgins will
tell you a character's inseam, but the real measure of a man is how
he talks.
</P>
<P>
   Drouhin's saving grace is humor, a sense of irony, and what he
knows about the sports business; he's not Satan but has decided to
join Satan's party. An oil painting of baseball star Curt Flood,
who made prosperity possible for men like Drouhin by challenging
the system that tied ballplayers to their teams for life, hangs
prominently in his mansion _ although Drouhin's famous after-dinner
speech always gave the credit for his fortune to Peter Seitz, the
little-known attorney who won the 1975 Andy Messersmith arbitration
case that knocked out the reserve clause and changed the face of
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   The reader feels bereft when Drouhin is knocked off after what
is basically a 90-page monologue. It takes Higgins a little while
to work up another head of steam when Lt. Clay strides onto the
crime scene. No one writes better police procedurals than Higgins,
but how home security systems work in the better-equipped mansions
of the wealthy isn't as interesting a topic as wheeling and dealing
behind the scenes at the FleetCenter. Fortunately, however, it
doesn't take long before Clay is listening to another couple of
able monologuists, Drouhin's security man and one of his partners,
and they quote Drouhin at length. It's almost as good as having him
back.
</P>
<P>
   Formally speaking, ``The Agent'' may not rank with Higgins's
best work; the progress is too jerky, the plot too neat. What makes
the book enthralling is not the search for whodunit, although
Higgins does come up with a solution to the mystery audacious and
encompassing enough to satisfy everyone. What matters more is that
this time Higgins's matchless gift of gab is complemented by a
gimlet eye trained on a totally cynical business built on a
universal nostalgia for something pure and genuine. ``The Agent''
is full of sports history, sports gossip about real players, and
shrewd observations on the sports business, on how it has changed
and continues to change, and how its basis is not value, quality,
ability, or sportmanship. Drouhin observes, ``If sports is the
culture of this country _ and it sure is now _ then the way you
corner markets is not by representing big-name people who play
sports. It's by buying them. And then renting them out to the teams
and the pro tourneys and the soft drink companies and all the other
people selling stuff to people dumb enough to want to eat the same
burgers and cereal as their favorite star claims he eats.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins has written a powerful screed against greed; above all,
and always, he is a moralist. ``The Agent'' resonates because it's
an angry book, and the author's real subject is paradise lost.

SMOKE AND YOU'RE OFF THE PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you smoke, don't book a cruise on the Carnival Paradise.
Smoking is a no-no. The Paradise is the first entirely no-smoking
cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   So what if you do light up? Carnival says first you'll face a
$250 fine, and be put off at the next port of call. They're quite
serious about this. Even while the ship was under construction in
Finland, there was a strict no-smoking policy from the day the
first pieces of the hull were put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking is becoming an issue on many ships. Many lines are now
adopting a no-smoking policy in dining rooms and some staterooms,
but with the exception of Renaissance Cruises' newer ships and the
Paradise, none has a total no-smoking ban even on deck.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers may not like these policies, but the trend to smoke-free
lounges, staterooms, and dining rooms is growing. Royal Caribbean
International has banned smoking in all its dining rooms, and
Clipper Cruise Lines, Windjammer Barefoot Cruises now allow smoking
only on deck.
</P>
<P>
   As smoking bans grow, some lines have also latched onto the
popularity of cigar smoking. Celebrity Cruises has cigar clubs on
board. Its Michael's Clubs on the Mercury, Galaxy, and Century
offer cigar smoking, rolling and sales of fine cigars. The cigars
are limited to these cherry wood lounges, also equipped with smoke
eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Not being a smoker, I was impressed by the lack of cigar odor
during a brief visit. Other lines have also opened special lounges
where cigar lovers may even find banned-in-America Cuban cigars.
Norwegian Cruise Lines is planning a cigar parlor for its Norwegian
Sky, scheduled to enter service in August.
</P>
<P>
   Holland America and Windstar Cruises offer ``Cigars Under the
Stars'' programs on deck one or two evenings during a cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking has become not just a health issue, but also a safety
one. Fire is a major concern for cruise ships. During every
mandatory fire drill aboard ships, warnings are always given about
the disposal of cigarettes, particularly not to toss them
overboard, where they might land on a lower deck and cause a fire.
Warnings are also issued on smoking in bed, as this too could lead
to a fire if the smoker dozes off.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, fires at sea have been rare. The fire last year
aboard the Carnival Ecstasy has been confirmed as being caused by a
welder's torch.
</P>
<P>
   While some passengers may complain, overall it appears that
partial or full no-smoking bans are not only working but are
welcomed by cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Paradise's policy, Bob Dickinson, Carnival's president,
said, ``We've got a hit on our hands, and we're not the least bit
worried.'' He said the Paradise is already attracting more
first-time cruisers than any other Carnival ship did during its
introductory sailings.
</P>
<P>
   The Paradise does appear to be a hit. Its look is different than
other Carnival ships _ some say mellower and even more luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is the last of the Carnival Fantasy class ships, and
for this reason, designer Joe Farcus, who has become famous for his
flamboyant designs and has had the distinction of designing the
interiors of just about every Carnival ship, has come up with a
theme based on maritime history.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ship, tributes are paid to the classic liners of
the past. There are lounges named for such legendary vessels as the
Queen Mary, the Normandie, SS United States, and the Rex.
</P>
<P>
   The library aboard the Paradise, the Blue Riband, is named for
an international prize given for the fastest trans-Atlantic
crossing and features models of the ships that won the prize, and
even a signed photo of the duke and duchess of Windsor on the Queen
Elizabeth (Carnival now owns Cunard).
</P>
<P>
   Like its sister ship, the Elation, the Paradise also has a
larger children's area than is found on other Fantasy class ships.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting feature found throughout the ship are
foot-tall Faberge-inspired eggs. These blue-green eggs have tiny
lights in them, replacing the diamonds and rubies on Faberge
originals.
</P>
<P>
   The 70,000-ton, 2,040-passenger Paradise sails on weekly
alternating cruises from Miami to the Eastern and Western
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The Paradise not only appears to be, but is, a breath of fresh
air.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Paradise, Renaissance Cruises features a
non-smoking cruise on its new R-Series ships. The first of these,
the R1, a 684-passenger, 30,000-ton vessel, is now sailing in the
Mediterranean. Three sister ships are about to enter service.
</P>
<P>
   Other lines with near no-smoking policies are Clipper Cruise
Lines and Windjammer Cruises with no-smoking in cabins, dining
rooms, or show lounges.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Queen steamboats have no-smoking policies in dining rooms
and lounges. On the Delta Queen, the line's landmark steamboat, no
smoking is allowed in staterooms as well. The Delta Queen has an
all wood superstructure.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Lines has a no-smoking policy in portside
staterooms and in the dining rooms (starboard side rooms have a
smoking optional policy).
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you smoke, before booking a cruise, check with
the line as to its policy. You don't want to end up left on the
dock and have to find your own way home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sale of All Sails
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Lines is offering almost all of its 1999
sailings at a discount. The line's ``Sale of All Sails'' is
offering a minimum half-price companion fare and a two-category
upgrade for deposited reservations through Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Theater at Sea
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Theatre Guild has an all-star cast lined up for its annual
Theatre at Sea cruise. The cruise, beginning Feb. 15, features
stars such as Patricia Neal, Jane Alexander, Cliff Robertson,
Margaret Whiting, and Brian Bedford. Cruise options available
include leaving Feb. 15 for a 13-day Rio de Janeiro-to-Manaus
cruise; Feb. 28, Manaus to Fort Lauderdale or Galveston. Prices
begin at $1,747 with air fare extra. For information, call
800-752-9732.

   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Athens to Athens
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Star Clippers will be offering seven-day sailings this summer
with round-trip cruises from Athens. The Saturday departures May 8
through Oct. 2 will include a visit to Kusadasi, Turkey, the
gateway to the ancient city of Ephesus.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

Russia cruises

<P>
   ``There is no better time than now to visit Russia, and no
better way to get right into the heart of this beautiful country
than by riverboat,'' said Paul Duynhouwer, president of Intrav,
which just happens to offer riverboat cruises aboard the modern
250-passenger Kirov and Krasin.
</P>
<P>
   The line's Journey of the Czars two-week cruises leave from
either St. Petersburg or Moscow. Rates begin at $2,740, including
air fare from New York. For information, call 800-456-8100.

WHAT TO BRING: A CHARM OR TOILET PAPER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some like to dine. Some like to drink. And some prefer their own
toilet paper. The habits of business travelers from various
countries differ a good deal, according to a recent study. Here's
what the OAG Business Travel Lifestyle Survey found:
</P>
<P>
   --Americans play computer games on their laptops, tend to be
older than other travelers, like to spend time in airport
restaurants, are more likely than most to give their frequent-flier
miles to charity, and often bring along pictures of their pets.
</P>
<P>
   --Australians are likely to have a drink or two in the VIP
lounge, are often over 55, are safety conscious, want extra
legroom, and like a shower in the VIP lounge after they land.
</P>
<P>
   --The British love the BBC, take their own toilet paper with
them, are suspicious of laptops and the Web, and are most likely to
stray from their employers' travel policy but least likely to fly
first class.
</P>
<P>
   --The French are indifferent to inflight safety, don't worry
about late flights, adore their travel agents, are oddly
unconcerned about good food on a flight, and are least likely to
frequent health clubs.
</P>
<P>
   --The Japanese are most likely to bring a lucky charm, often
take public transportation to the airport, stay away from home the
least, often book hotels on line, and stick to their travel plans
once they are made. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: How many Massachusetts cities and towns can you name
that have a woman's name, such as Sharon? Answer at end of column. &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: People driving south to Foxwoods Resort Casino on Route
95 are usually cheered when a water tower comes into view because
that means they are about 30 minutes from Foxwoods. Thus, the
structure has been nicknamed the Half-an-Hour Tower. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``It is very difficult to say where a voyage begins.
First . . . there must be a dream, a longing for out-of-the-way
places.'' _ Peter Hamilton. &QL; 
 &QL; 
How's that again? Sign in a Meridian, Miss., jewelry store: ``Watch
Batteries While You Wait.'' (With thanks to AAA Going Places, via
William Buchanan of Lake Mary, Fla.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Museum of the month: The four-year-old Ramen Museum in Yokohama
attracts more visitors than the National Art Museum, according to
the JAL Newsletter. On display are many types of ramen _ a tasty
noodle _ from around the world, including an instant version with
Arnold Schwarzenegger on the cup. Three-hundred Japanese noodle
bowls are also displayed. The lower floor, meanwhile, reproduces a
Japanese street at dusk, with 88 miniature buildings. And there are
nine on-site ramen restaurants that draw so many diners that the
lines stretch for blocks. At the gift shop, you can even buy ramen
jewelry, key chains, and ``emergency ramen,'' lasting up to three
years. The man behind it all, Yoji Iwaoka, hopes to bring a similar
museum to Las Vegas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of ramen: The Japanese really do love the stuff. They
consume 5.3 billion servings a year, in about 600 varieties. &QL; 
 &QL; 
On the menu: Alain Raye, the new chef of Julien at Le Meridien
Boston, is the former chef-owner of three Michelin-starred
restaurants in France. And although his cuisine may have a
classical French accent, it is constantly evolving. Some samples
from his new menu: Atlantic salmon with spinach, roasted potatoes,
and Asian flavors; sauteed Maine lobster with green lentils,
candied lemon zest, and an old port sauce; and roasted rack of lamb
with nicoise olive crust and a compote of eggplant and vegetable au
gratin. If that has whetted your appetite, as it has ours, call
617-451-1900, ext. 7120, for more information or reservations. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Sharon, Beverly, Chelsea, Lynn, Florida, Lee,
Marion, Shirley, Ashby, and Hadley. There must be women named Ashby
and Hadley somewhere, and, likewise, there may be other communties
with rare names for women. (We thank frequent contributor Dave
Smith of El Al Airlines for the suggestion.) &QL;

ANOTHER Y2K PEST: LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Businesses are spending billions of dollars to fix
the so-called Y2K bug. Now comes another threat that might be
equally expensive: Y2K lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing trial lawyers of gearing up to sue over computer
failures next year, business lobbyists say one of their top
priorities this year is to persuade Congress to block some of those
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily hyped Y2K computer bug could cause deliveries to be
late, accounting systems to go awry, assembly lines to stall,
payments to be misdirected, and any number of other problems, which
in turn might lead to lawsuits between companies or by
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 cases have already been filed, including one in
Massachusetts, according to a tally by the Information Technology
Association of America, a trade group based in Arlington, Va. Trial
lawyers have already conducted seminars on how to file Y2K
lawsuits, said Thomas Donohue, president of the US Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the chamber and its allies are seeking legislation that
would limit punitive damages in Y2K cases and require Y2K-related
disputes to go to arbitration or to special courts.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Slade Gorton of
Washington last week said they intended to introduce legislation to
curb ``unnecessary litigation'' resulting from Y2K computer
glitches. The senators said they were still working on the details
of their proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug, also known as the year 2000 bug or the millennium
bug, arises from the longstanding practice by software writers of
referring to a year by only its last two digits. That has not been
a problem when software used ``87,'' for example, to refer to 1987.
But unless modified, much software now in use may interpret the
digits 00 to mean 1900 instead of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   American corporations have been spending heavily to make sure
their computers will keep operating come Jan. 1, 2000, and most
experts say widespread disruptions are unlikely. But sporadic
problems are inevitable, experts add, and that's where the
potential for litigation arises.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to head off Y2K lawsuits will likely set businesses
against trial lawyers. The two sides have often clashed as business
groups promote limits on ``frivolous'' shareholder lawsuits and
various versions of tort reform, such as limits on lawsuits over
defective products.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the trial lawyers' bar have called some Y2K bills a
form of tort reform that will unfairly deny plaintiffs their rights
to sue. Others have said the estimates of damages to be sought in
Y2K lawsuits are as overblown as the scenarios of massive computer
failure that will supposedly cripple the nation next year.
</P>
<P>
   Business lobbyists and their allies are promoting Y2K liability
limits by taking aim at the trial bar, saying that lawyers are
preparing frivolous lawsuits even against businesses that make
good-faith efforts to prepare for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without legislation, innocent people may be hurt by aggressive
trial lawyers who use the Y2K situation not to help the public, but
to enrich their own pockets,'' McCain said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The trial bar is preparing to file lawsuits seeking between $1
trillion and $3 trillion, said Donohue of the US Chamber of
Commerce. If his figures are right, lawyers will seek more money in
damages than businesses will likely spend on fixing Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts case, consulting giant Andersen Consulting
sued retailer J. Baker Inc. of Canton in state court in August. The
suit was an attempt by Andersen to show that it had met all of its
contractual obligations when it installed a computer system in the
early 1990s that might have been susceptible to Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Andersen said it took legal action after learning
J. Baker had hired a law firm to seek reimbursement for the cost of
the system. The case was settled in December following a nonbinding
review by a mediator, with Andersen making no payment to J. Baker.

UNION, EMPLOYERS JOIN TO FORM LIFELINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old saying: ``When the going gets tough, the tough get
going'' applies to the recent response by thousands of building and
trade union workers to a critically short blood supply in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   When a series of powerful storms across the country during the
recent holiday season virtually drained the nation's blood supply,
the Bay State's hospitals were forced to take steps, such as
delaying excluding elective surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But even with these moves, Children's Hospital in Boston was
feeling the most severe pinch. Since blood for young patients could
not be stored beyond seven days in some cases and no longer than 21
days in others _ while blood for adults could be kept up to 45 days
_ the hospital's blood supply was in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the urgent call for more blood donors, the
Massachusetts Building Trades Council recently formed a ``union''
with the Children's Hospital Blood Donor Center, and workers _ with
the support of both unions and employers _ lined up to give blood.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the 14 unions affiliated with the Building Trades
Council made of 2,000 blood and platelet donations by the end of
this year, making it the largest blood drive in the history of
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The blood drive, called ``Giving Pints for Half-Pints,'' already
began to have an impact on both union workers and cancer patients
at Children's.
</P>
<P>
   One union worker, Nick Marino, a member of Painters Local 402,
has donated a gallon of his blood over the past year to Children's
Hospital. His daughter, Amanda, had been diagnosed about two years
ago with Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare form of childhood cancer. After
nearly a year of intensive treatments at both Dana-Farber Cancer
Insitute and Children's Hospital, Amanda's tumor was gone.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Painters District Council, Nick and Andrea
Marino wrote: ``Our daughter received many transfusions from the
period between February 1997 and January 1998 and without the
support of kind people like you, the supply would not be there for
her.'' Such letters helped to convey to both contractors and union
workers the importance of their contribution to the Children's
Hospital Blood Donor Center.
</P>
<P>
   As a joint labor-management effort, the contractors and the
unions agreed to encourage workers to donate blood, with some
employers even giving them time to do so during working hours.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the drive thus far, which began last November,
has impressed the hospital's blood donor center.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this union support, we for the first time can supply all
the blood and platelet donations we need _ a goal which we have
been long striving for,'' said John McElroy, special collections
coodinator for the blood donor center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the unions projected number of 50 units donated each
week, we will be self-sufficient. We will not have to go outside of
our hospital for help,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The donations by members of the Building Trades Council are also
helping to keep costs down. The hospital does not have to rely on
outside sources to supply blood as long as the blood donations from
the union workers meet projected goals.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, more than 500 pints of blood have been donated to the
hospital by union construction workers and their employers.
</P>
<P>
   What helps to make this effort work so well, its supporters
point out, is the joint cooperation between management and labor in
the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of such joint efforts, there are likely to be many
more children such as Amanda Marino who will have a chance at a
healthier and happier life. And for this ``union'' of contractors,
union workers and the Children Hospital's Blood Donor Center _
nothing is more satisfying.

CARNIVALS TO TAKE THE CHILL OUT OF WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winter _ it doesn't have to be a chilling experience. There's a
lot of warmth out there, especially at the many festivals in Canada
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Two favorites across the border are the Quebec Winter Carnival
and Winterlude in Ottawa. Now in its 45th year, Carnival in Quebec
City is considered the world's largest winter festival, drawing
almost 1 million visitors to its festivities Jan. 29-Feb. 14. The
festival has everything to take the chill off, from boat racing on
the frozen St. Lawrence to a giant, fun-loving snowman, Bonhomme
Carnival. Call 800-363-7777 for details.
</P>
<P>
   Winterlude, weekends Feb. 5-21, boasts the world's largest
skating rink, the five-mile Rideau Canal, running straight through
the downtown area of Canada's capital city. Some even ice skate to
work using the canal, which was built in the early 1800s to help
protect Canadians from Americans. Now it is drawing Americans to
enjoy a warm Canadian welcome. For Winterlude information, call
613-239-5000.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is expanding its Winterfest (Feb. 12-14) to include
three festival sites and entertainment ranging from ice shows, a
fantasy snow playgound, music, midway rides, and more. For events,
call the event hot line at 416-338-0338.
</P>
<P>
   On this side of the border, Saint Paul, Minn., has been proving
for the last 113 years that winter can be fun. The Jan. 29-Feb. 7
festival, the nation's oldest and largest, owes its existence to a
New York Times reporter who called St. Paul ``the Siberia of
America.'' St. Paul put a ``spin'' on that, and has created a
festival that boasts more than 100 fun events, along with some
giant ice castles. If it does get too chilly for you, this is also
the home of the Mall of America, the nation's largest indoor
shopping mall, complete with play areas for the young in heart from
1 to 100. For Minnesota information, call 800-657-3700.
</P>
<P>
   While it doesn't have a major winter festival, New Brunswick,
Canada, offers a White Gold Rush Catalog filled with information on
activities ranging from soft snowmobiing adventures to
dog-sledding, from horseback riding to skijoring (cross-country
skiing behind a team of rugged Huskies) and Alpine skiing. The
province claims more than 150 inches of snow and 3,000 miles of
groomed and marked snowmobile trails. For a catalog, call
800-561-0123.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best lures to Canada is the extremely favorable
exchange rate that makes the American dollar worth up to $1.50
Canadian. The Canadians aren't hiding the value Americans can find
north of the border, either. In Quebec, the province is promoting
``Dollar Power.'' ``Winter has always been an excellent time to
enjoy Quebec, and now, with the favorable exchange rate, a good
thing just got better,'' said David Clich, minister for tourism
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada offers some great packages. For Winterlude, for
example, a package including air fare, two-nights' accommodations,
dinner, cross-country skiing, and more begins at $359 a person.
Call 800-774-8993.
</P>
<P>
   Should you head to Ottawa, do seek out a beavertail. This hot
treat, sold along the Rideau Canal and elsewhere, is a fried-dough
creation in the shape of a beaver tail, made of whole wheat, dusted
with cinnamon and sugar and sprinkled with lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   Camden, Maine, is famous as one of the country's most scenic
summer destinations, but in winter it's known for its toboggan
chute, one of the few left in the country. The ninth annual US
National Toboggan Championships will be held in Camden at the Snow
Bowl, Feb. 5-7. More than 200 teams _ some with wacky names like
Fat Bloated Idiots, Thrill Seekkin' Patriots, and the Throbbin'
Boggans _ will be participating on the 400-foot chute where riders
can experience speeds of up to 45 miles an hour. The island-dotted
view from the top of the Snow Bowl is worth the trip alone. For
information on the championships, call 207-236-3436, and for Camden
information, call 207-236-4404.

Eagle watch
</P>
<P>
   ``Once driven to the verge of extinction by pesticides, the
American Bald Eagle is now a regular visitor to the lower
Connecticut River each winter,'' said Jackie LaBella, executive
director of the Connecticut River Valley &AMP; Shoreline Visitors
Council. ``This year, people can either cruise the Connecticut
River or join in a tour along the river's banks to see the
eagles.'' More than 100 eagles are expected this winter. Through
March 13, eagle watch cruises depart the Connecticut River Museum
in Essex at 10 a.m., returning at 1 p.m. For information and
reservations, call the Deep River Navigation Co. at 203-526-4954 or
the Connecticut Audubon Society at 860-767-0660. Saturdays through
Feb. 20, the Audubon Shop Eagle Watch start at 7:50 a.m. at the
shop at 841 Boston Post Road in Madison. Call 860-245-9056.

ACTION IN THE LAND OF WAMPUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEDYARD, Conn. _ Even if you build it smack in the middle of a
place called Great Cedar Swamp, they will come. You can bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   Provide free parking and add more casinos and bingo halls and
hotels and restaurants, and the odds are that they'll keep on
coming in ever greater numbers just as long as the waters flow, the
grasses grow, and the slot machines continue to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   In only a few years, the separate gambling complexes operated on
their ancestral reservations by two small and once impoverished
Native American tribes have made this rural and formerly somnolent
corner of southeastern Connecticut one of the most-visited places
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the Mashantucket Pequot tribe's enormous Foxwoods
Resort Casino complex here and the Mohegan tribe's smaller but
still very large Mohegan Sun casino a few miles to the west in
Uncasville attract an estimated 17 million or more visitors a year.
The two reservations are just a few minutes from Interstate 95 and
only about a two-hour drive from both Boston and New York, an hour
or so from Providence and Hartford. The vast majority of visitors
are day trippers. Quite a number are almost daily trippers.
</P>
<P>
   However, as attractions and amenities multiply _ the sprawling
Foxwoods complex now includes three hotels, a deluxe health fitness
spa, and a superb museum of Native American life _ the area is
rapidly evolving into a major travel destination. Tribal officials
estimate that annually about 1.2 million casinogoers stay over at
least one night in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors come mainly to try their luck but also take time
from the gaming tables and slots to look around. Both nearby Mystic
Seaport and Mystic Marine Life Aquarium _ the area's chief tourist
attractions not so long ago _ report substantial increases in
visitorship since the casinos opened.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering gambling options galore, the Mashantucket
Pequot and Mohegan casinos are lavishly decorated, have a variety
of restaurants and lounges, offer upscale shopping, and regularly
feature name entertainers. Even if you're not much of a gambler
(and this writer isn't one at all), they're fun to check out. There
is nothing else in New England remotely like them.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no amount of publicity or advertising hype prepared me
for the reality of Foxwoods. To reach it from I-95, you take Route
2, a meandering two-lane country road. Suddenly, without warning,
the 18-story Grand Pequot Tower, glossy centerpiece of the complex,
looms like a mirage out of the scraggily forested and
lonesome-looking landscape of Great Cedar Swamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee, Toto,'' I muttered to myself when I first saw it, ``I
don't think we're in Connecticut any more!'' In fact, I had just
entered the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, which has its own
government, police and fire departments, customs, and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Established in the mid 17th century, the reservation was almost
abandoned in this one as the Pequots assimilated, intermarried, and
dispersed into mainstream America. Until a dozen or so years ago,
there wasn't much left to see here except a few battered house
trailers occupied by members of the then newly reorganized tribe.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to achieve economic self-sufficiency for the tribe,
gambling was introduced to the reservation in 1986 but confined to
a single high-stakes bingo hall. In 1992, after being turned down
by local banks, the 700-member tribe borrowed some $60 million from
a Malaysian casino company that appreciated the value of a good
location and built Foxwoods Casino.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the State of Connecticut authorized slot
machines in the casino in exchange for a quarter share of the
revenues. Ever since, Foxwoods has been on a roll and the tribe on
a building spree.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Foxwoods is the largest gambling casino in the world. And
the world includes Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and Monte Carlo. Hey,
the casino's parking lot is probably bigger than Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   There are five gaming halls (one nonsmoking) containing 370
table games and 5,750 slot machines. The cavernous multipurpose
room seats 3,700 people for bingo, and doubles as a performance
space that can hold up to 5,000. The performance that opened the
room was by a suitably outsized performer: heavyweight tenor
Luciano Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
   Open 24 hours a day, the Foxwoods gaming rooms pull in an
estimated $1 billion a year. Also profitable are the 23 retail
stores, one of which, Indian Nation, sells only upscale Native
American arts and crafts. Ditto the 30 food and beverage outlets.
The most popular restaurant _ perhaps because eating there takes
the least time away from gambling _ is the Festival Buffet, which
serves over a million meals a year.
</P>
<P>
   Money makers as well are Foxwoods' three hotels _ Two Trees Inn,
Great Cedar Hotel, and the new and splendiferous Grand Pequot Tower
_ which between them have more than 1,400 rooms. The posh Grand
Pequot literally towers over the countryside. (Amenities include a
luxurious and fully equipped health and fitness spa modeled after
the imperial baths of ancient Rome.)
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Pequot is Foxwoods' signature building and also a
highly visible symbol of the new prosperity and increasing
financial clout of the tribe. The tribe's last prosperous era was
more than three centuries ago when, as now , it had an unfailing
source of income: seashells from the Connecticut shore. Strung
together as beads and subtly colored by salt water, the shells
became ``wampum,'' the Native American trading currency.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe is now happily back in the modern equivalent of the
wampum business, and the Foxwoods color scheme uses the various
shades of mauve, beige, and blue found in the clam and quahog
shells commonly used as trading beads. Other decorative motifs draw
upon nature and are based on indigenous floral and leaf patterns.
But the most visible _ and audible _ Native American decorative
touch is the Rainmaker statue, which stands at the heart of the
gaming complex.
</P>
<P>
   The statue is a 12-foot-high clear plastic representation of an
Indian hunter who every hour on the hour fires a laser beam arrow
into the air as an appeal to the Great Spirit. In response, the
sound of thunder and the crackle of lightning roll through the
bingo halls and slot machine rooms, and artificial rain showers
rain down into the basin of a fountain.
</P>
<P>
   An also entertaining but far more serious expression of the
tribe's pride in its past is the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and
Research Center, about a quarter of a mile from the casino complex.
A $193 million project, the museum uses state-of-the art technology
_ including interactive computers and multisensory diormas _ to
tell the story of the Mashantucket Pequots and the other tribes of
the region.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit, you descend by escalator into a replicated
18,000-year-old glacial crevasse and wander through a remarkably
realistic re-creation of a mid-16th-century Pequot village.
Covering half an acre, the village consists of a dozen bark wigwams
and is filled with the sounds of birds and Indians at work and play
and populated by more than 50 life-sized and anthropologically
accurate figures. Artifacts displayed at the museum range from
ancient Native American tools, weapons, and handicrafts to the
beat-up typewriter that tribal chairman Richard ``Skip'' Hayward
used to successfully apply for federal recognition of the
Mashantucket Pequots, their first step toward economic revival.
</P>
<P>
   The museum theater shows a film about the nation's first Indian
war in 1637. This was between the Pequots and the English settlers
of Connecticut and Massachusetts and their Native American allies,
the Mohegans, who were led by a sachem, or chief, named Uncas. The
Pequots were almost wiped out, and the survivors eventually were
forced to move inland to a reservation on the east bank of the
Thames River, about 10 miles from that of the Mohegans _ now the
village of Uncasville.
</P>
<P>
   The once rival tribes have long since buried the hatchet and
together cut a deal with the state, giving them exclusive casino
rights in Connecticut. The well-marked and heavily traveled route
between the two casinos crosses the Thames over the Mohegan-Pequot
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Mohegan Sun (the name means ``Wolf Rock'') casino, which the
1,200-member tribe opened in fall 1996, is a low-rise concrete
structure much less dramatically sited than Foxwoods. There are 20
restaurants and lounges (one bar is called ``The Bow and Arrow'')
and a shopping concourse with shops selling Native American
handicrafts, among other things. But there are no connected hotels
or a tribal museum.
</P>
<P>
   The gaming casino has 3,000 slot machines, 180 gaming tables,
and a high-stakes bingo hall. This is about half the size of
Foxwoods but still makes Mohegan Sun the third-largest casino in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the decor of Foxwoods might be described as tasteful Las
Vegas, that of Mohegan Sun is aggressively aboriginal. The walls
and ceilings are covered with Indian signs and symbols, along with
blankets, basket, bows, snowshoes, and animal skins. The decor may
be low-tech early Native American, but the casino itself is a very
contemporary operation with computerized self-service betting and
giant projection screens for off-track betting.
</P>
<P>
   Although different from each other, both Mohegan Sun and
Foxwoods have one thing in common: As with all casinos, the odds
alway favor the house. Or, in their cases, the wigwam.

regards, urban sprawl has made winter a much more challenging foe
in many others. (Dempsey, Dayton Daily News). 15.

TAKING A MEASURED APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The terms ``laid-back'' and ``patience'' are not usually
associated with Bruce Arena. But those were key topics in Monday's
conference call with the US national team coach, who is preparing
for Sunday's game against Bolivia in Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time around, I am not concerned totally with results,''
Arena said. ``I am concerned with building a team that is prepared
to qualify for 2002, whether that means by winning games or by
developing a new team. It's about developing a new pool of players,
and with that there needs to be patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena was not patient for long at D.C. United. He revamped the
MLS team in the first month of the first season, creating a group
that set the standard for both attacking play and success. The
goals will be modest with the national team: Arena needs only to be
among the top three teams in the region during the World Cup
qualifying tournament, which will conclude in November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilding project has started with a training camp in
Orlando. Only four players remain from the starting team that faced
Bolivia June 12, 1996. Arena attended that game, a 2-0 US loss at
RFK Stadium, and discovered Jaime Moreno, who would become a key
player for D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, Arena did not seem to be in the US Soccer
Federation's plans because of his outspoken nature. After three
successful seasons with United, though, Arena could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as uncompromising as Arena can be, he apparently has a
sympathetic side. His players are loyal, he stands up for them, and
no major divisions appeared in the United team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is laid-back and he gets along with the players well, and
that's good for the team,'' said Cobi Jones, who was named USSF
player of the year. ``The training sessions aren't laid-back. They
are more like the European team's training sessions, about an hour
and a half, short and intense.''
</P>
<P>
   The first three opponents of the year, Bolivia, Germany (Feb. 6
in Jacksonville), and Chile (Feb. 21 in Fort Lauderdale), have a
10-1-4 record and a 40-16 goal advantage against the US. If such
lack of success continues, Arena will not be able to afford to be
so patient.

   Revolution hopeful
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were out of contention for the MLS playoffs in
record time last season. But they are setting their sights high
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reluctant to lower our ambitions,'' general manager
Brian O'Donovan said. ``That would be doing a disservice to our
fans, especially since we are hosting MLS Cup '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our last six games last year, we had four shutouts, and
that gives us hope. It's a game of chance and anything can happen.
We are not finished with trades and players changing, and this
could be a special year indeed with Walter Zenga.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were eliminated from the playoffs by Miami in
Zenga's first game as coach Aug. 30. They then won three of their
last five games and outscored opponents, 9-3.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has been in Italy preparing to return as player-coach. He
will arrive for the Revolution's first practice next Tuesday at
Foxborough, then bring the team to Italy for an extended training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Though Zenga had not coached before being hastily summoned to
replace Thomas Rongen last year, he quickly injected pragmatism
into the Revolution's approach. Before Zenga arrived, the team
displayed neither style nor substance.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no pretense at playing with flair this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe the fans of New England some results on the field,''
O'Donovan said. ``We need to achieve, and the way to achieve is by
winning, in this league or any league. The rhetoric has changed
from being an artist with a blank canvas to us having our feet
being collectively held to the fire to attain results.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is saying that the league is maturing to a level where
the criterion being applied is that you are only as good as your
results. Many coaches have lost their jobs, and that's been a harsh
dose of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches have lost jobs not because they lose games, but because
they lose control of the team, or of the situation. Defeats on the
field are the result of losing that control.
</P>
<P>
   MLS provides a huge safety net for coaches, with a forgiving
playoff system. Zenga appears to understand this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to be successful on the field, by hook or by
crook,'' O'Donovan said. ``The last coach we had was Coach of the
Year and had won the league, so that was the guaranteed way. But
the tried-and-true way doesn't always work. An unorthodox approach
to the game can be successful. And that's what captures the
imagination in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking a chance with Walter that could work out in our
favor. He is thinking and training for this season 24 hours a day.
And he's a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donovan said season-ticket sales are ahead of the 1996 and '97
paces and will likely exceed the 6,400 of '98 before the opener
March 28 at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They'll be back
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Burns and Ian Feuer are expected to be in Revolution camp
next week, and Joe-Max Moore will arrive after the Bolivia-US game.
Burns has not signed a contract, and was attempting to move to
Europe. Feuer's loan to Rushden and Diamonds expired after a 3-1
loss to Leeds United in the FA Cup. Burns missed the US's 0-0 tie
against Australia in San Jose in November and is not with the
national team. ``Mike had an opportunity to come to this camp but
chose to pursue an opportunity abroad,'' Arena said. ``He was
getting married in November, and that's a solid excuse for missing.
But if players miss these (camps) it hurts them. As I continue to
see players in the back and in Mike's position, there is a lot of
competition there at this point in time. I don't know when he will
have another opportunity with the national team.''

WALKER GETS DOWN TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Antoine Walker showed up at Brandeis Monday. He's added
five pounds and some more responsibility, and soon he will likely
become the richest player in the history of the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of the Celtics, who said he arrived in town
Saturday, joined his teammates for practice in Walthm for the first
time. He had his first session with the maniacal Shaun Brown, the
strength and conditioning coach, and realized right away that he
wasn't in Chicago anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different,'' said Walker, referring to his
routine at the health club the last six months. ``You have a coach
pushing you. But I know the program and I've stayed in shape. I
don't think anyone is in Coach P. shape, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the NBA opens for business, which now looks as if it might
be Wednesday, the Celtics will do all they can to quickly sign
Walker to a six-year extension. Rick Pitino made that clear Monday;
he is in no mood to wait until Walker hits the open market next
summer. That would make Walker available to anyone and wouldn't
help the Celtics in free agency because Walker would remain on
their cap at 300 percent of what he made this year, a cap figure of
more than $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Walker said, ``I know which way I'm leaning. I
want to take care of the situation right away. I'd like to get it
done immediately. I think everyone is on the same page on this.
I've talked to management.''
</P>
<P>
   The money, of course, is staggering. Assuming Walker starts at
the maximum $9 million per _ and we can't see pit bull agent David
Falk settling for anything less _ the six-year extension would be
worth a total of $70.875 million. It's not what he might have
fetched under the old rules, but, as Walker noted Monday, ``If you
don't like that much money, you're crazy. It's enough to take care
of me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino, who was at Brandeis watching his troops masquerade as
players, said, ``I think it will be done right away. Absolutely.
We're not going to wait. You don't want to open up the possibility
he could go to the other team. You can't take that chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sign him, it's good from a teaching standpoint, a
discipline standpoint, it's better psychologically because the
player isn't worried. (If you don't), your greatest asset is
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   So Walker apparently will be here a while. Where has he been the
last week, when most of his teammates were at Brandeis?
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago. I was trying to get here and I wanted to come. But
then I got snowed in and that threw off my plans,'' he said. ``I've
been playing every day in my health club.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino reiterated that he was not concerned about Walker's
absence, and teammate Ron Mercer added, ``You have to understand,
the weather was bad and he had things to do. It's OK for everyone
else. It's OK with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the extra five pounds was ``good weight'' in that he
wanted to get a little stronger. He's excited about the Celtics
``and that our team is basically still together.'' And he wants
everyone to know that he was misunderstood when he said last July
that ``veteran All-Stars'' like himself don't go to voluntary
summer workouts.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall that Pitino held a voluntary session at Brandeis
just before the lockout and also hired a shooting coach for the
occasion. Most Celtics showed. Walker did not, which miffed Pitino,
who thought the captain should have been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't mandatory,'' Walker said. (It couldn't have been;
there are no mandatory offseason sessions in the NBA.) ``I didn't
know it was that important. My thing was, I didn't feel like I had
to be there. Not in the summertime. I got a letter in the mail and
it said it was voluntary. I just didn't come.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker also said he probably should have been more assertive in
organizing workout sessions during the lockout. Mercer finally
tried to do it, but the first two scheduled sessions produced more
reporters (one) than players. Walker said by not coming East
sooner, he got to spend more time with his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   As for his oft-criticized on-court behavior, Walker said he
understands he needs to tone it down this year. He was among the
league leaders in technical fouls last season, and he and Pitino
have talked quite a bit about eliminating those.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an emotional player and it's an emotional game,'' he said.
``I'm going to have to lead by example. I'll have to be a leader on
and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good pressure. I enjoy it. It'll make me a better
person and a better player.''

FALCONS ABOUT TO GET THE ATTENTION THEY CRAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a phenomenon in sport known as the Dangerfield
Syndrome, and the newly crowned champions of the National Football
Conference are right now its official poster boys.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm not mistaken, veteran Atlanta safety Eugene Robinson is
still holding court in the visiting locker room at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gave us a chance!'' he was booming when I found it
necessary to exit the room Sunday afternoon. ``Nobody. It's been
the same way all year long. We've been the best-kept secret in the
NFL. I looked at ESPN. I looked at Fox. I looked at Fox Sports
East. I looked at Fox Sports West. I even looked at the Money
Report. And nobody thought we could win!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We faced that all year,'' echoed quarterback Chris Chandler.
``And now the entire NFC has to respect us. We beat the 49ers twice
and came in on the road and beat the Vikings. You're looking at as
good a football team as there is.''
</P>
<P>
   We might be, although the boys in Las Vegas still assume the
public doesn't think so. The early line on Super Bowl XXXIII was
Denver by 7. Get ready for two weeks of venting on the part of the
Atlanta Falcons. A team proclaiming to the world that is has been
subject to outrageous disrespect and lack of appreciation has been
pretty much business as usual for about two decades now, and most
of the time the accusations are bogus. This may be the one time the
team in question has a point.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for casual football fans to digest the idea of
the Falcons as legitimate title contenders. You might not go so far
as to label this franchise the LA Clippers of the NFL, but they
have been very forgettable. As a rule, they were seldom bad enough
to be pathetic. They were just blah.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, they were about as bad as they've
been. The 1996 Falcons were 3-13. The big move came when Dan Reeves
was hired as coach and general manager. By midseason last year, no
one was very excited. The team was 1-7. Talk about business as
usual. But they finished strongly, and since that point they have
had the best record in all of football.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's very nice. But who are these guys?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Whitfield? Ephraim Salaam? Brian Kozlowski? Lester
Archambeau? Henri Crockett?
</P>
<P>
   Any of these names ring a bell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of our 22 starters,'' points out Jamal Anderson (presumably,
you've heard of him), ``we have only two first-rounders, only one
of which we drafted. Everyone else was players no one else wanted,
fifth- or sixth-rounders or late-round people nobody thought could
play. We began to work and achieve a certain set of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the NFC title game, the average fan just didn't know
what to make of the Falcons. Their 14-2 regular-season record was
dismissed by many as being schedule-assisted. Even their 20-18
victory over the 49ers last week was underplayed because many felt
the Niners had been living on borrowed time for far too long.
Acting on this uncertainty, the oddsmakers had made mighty
Minnesota, the highest-scoring team in league history, an 11-point
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   It takes time and/or exposure for people to catch on to new
developments in this league. The Falcons have been this good for
only a very short while, and their national TV exposure was very
limited. It was quite possible for someone with a reasonable amount
of interest in the sport not to have seen the Falcons play this
season. They had begun the postseason as the mystery guest, and
they were still the mystery guest when they lined up against the
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The story line was enhanced when Reeves went in for bypass
surgery a short five weeks ago. Now there was another rallying cry
to accompany the no-respect theme. You may scoff, but artificial
stimulation happens to be very important in pro sports, especially
in one as emotional as pro football. We now have a Super Bowl
matchup featuring a supremely confident defending champ against a
rugged, inspired, nobody-loves-us-but-us team.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was understandably proud of his team's accomplishment on
Sunday. The Metrodome has become one of the great home-field
advantages in sport. The Arizona Cardinals had been spooked by the
noise level, attributing at least two fumbled snaps to the din. But
the Falcons played more than 70 minutes Sunday without one
procedure penalty, and no fumbled snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just proud of our football team, and the way they handled
the noise,'' beamed Reeves. ``I thought our offense did a really
good job of executing in a tough situation. We practiced hard all
week, and I don't think we had an illegal procedure all game, and
that's incredible when you look at their last three games here,
when I think every (opposing) team has had at least six or seven
illegal procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves now will be a huge story. He has been to the Super Bowl
as coach of the team he now opposes, and his problems with John
Elway will be aired in a national forum. He came to Atlanta after a
tough stint with the Giants in New York, where he battled with
general manager George Young over control. He got that control in
Atlanta, and in two years he has outdone that other noted grocery
shopper by taking his team to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He is not crowing, ``I told ya so,'' although he may be
entitled. What he's doing is taking the high road, framing the
success of his team in broader terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible, when you think about it, coming from a 1-7
halfway through the first year to be in the Super Bowl the second
year,'' he said. ``I can't say enough about our players. It's an
unbelievable group of guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great for the league, when a team like the Atlanta
Falcons can be in the Super Bowl. I just think it gives everybody
in this league hope that, regardless of what your situation is, you
can turn it around, and in a short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Falcon, it all makes sense, I'm sure. You win a
tough game here and a tough game there, and you start believing in
yourself. Next thing you know, you're 14-2. Then you're in the
Super Bowl. You can't understand why anyone ever doubted you, even
though if someone had presented you with the entire scenario two
years ago you'd have dismissed it as ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   So forget logic. The Falcons won't be charitable during the next
two weeks. They now want to make up for all the pub and all the ink
they never got.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure we can accommodate them.
</P>

THE MAVERICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's a three-time loser in Senate politics. The first time the
legendary Margaret Chase Smith handily defeated him in 1972 in a
race for the Maine seat she had long held. Then Edmund Muskie beat
him in 1976 by a 60-40 margin. And in 1996, he collected fewer than
13,000 votes to finish a distant third behind Susan Cooper in a
nightmare of a campaign, during which he was accused of setting a
detective upon one of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Monks is better known to business page readers for his
forays into corporate governance through a pair of organizations he
founded, Institutional Shareholder Services and the Lens Fund. As a
tireless campaigner for public betterment, he is the focal point of
two books designed to enhance his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is his own. ``The Emperor's Nightingale: Restoring
the Integrity of the Corporation in an Age of Shareholder
Activism'' was published last year _ an attempt to bring ``the new
science of complexity'' to bear on corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   The other, just published, is a very friendly biography, ``A
Traitor To His Class: Robert A.G. Monks and the Battle to Change
Corporate America,'' by Hilary Rosenberg. It employs a highfalutin
comparison to Franklin Delano Roosevelt to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   Together they show Monks, 65, to be a specimen of a vanishing
species: the Yankee Republican gadfly. Poor or rich, they are not
making Republicans in these parts the way they used to.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he arrived at Harvard College in 1951, Monks was
something of a personage: 6 feet 6 inches tall (he stroked the
crew), he was related to a substantial number of his college chums:
Among his ancestors were Gardners and Peabodys.
</P>
<P>
   Those in his class to whom he was not related included Minoru
``Ben'' Makihara, who married into Japan's Mitsubishi clan and who
heads the firm today (a high school friend); Dean LeBaron, the whiz
kid who built Boston's Batterymarch Financial Corp. into a cynosure
(a close friend); and Ned Johnson, the Fidelity Management and
Research scion whose great work lay ahead (roommate to Monk's
partner Arthur Dubow.)
</P>
<P>
   Law school came next, and in due course a partnership at
Goodwin, Proctor &AMP; Hoar (his father-in-law's fuel distribution
business was among his biggest clients). A few days after being
named, however, he quit. (``He saw that he had gotten all he wanted
out of the legal profession,'' writes Rosenberg.) He took up
venture capital and real estate development instead. One thing led
to another, and by the mid-1980s he was deeply involved in the
governance of that venerable Yankee institution called the Boston
Safe Deposit and Trust Co., through its corporate parent, The
Boston Co.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that the meatball hit him: In a seaside epiphany
Monks decided to use his knowledge of the mechanics of corporate
decision-making to show how to make corporations accountable for
their actions. He helped sell Boston Co. to Shearson American
Express for a tidy profit, took a turn as the Reagan
administration's scout on the Synfuels Corp. boondoggle, served for
a time as an overseer of pension plans in the Labor Department,
then swung full time into the corporate watch-dog business. The
rest is history, lovingly documented in ``Traitor To His Class.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once shareholder activism had been synonymous with the
Gilbert brothers and the clownish Evelyn Y. Davis, Monks took it to
a new level of behind-the-scenes respectability. Financial
deregulation had created new markets for corporate control; Monks
learned to exploit them by becoming a consultant on good-government
issues to the richest organizations. His Institutional Shareholder
Services slowly began advising blue-chip institutional investors:
the California Public Employees Retirement System, General Motors,
Fidelity, Wells Fargo, and TIAA-CREF, the university teachers'
retirement system. The activist style spread: There were imitators
and breakaways.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Monks kept one eye on political opportunities.
When Maine dismissed him for a third time in 1996, he responded
with ``The Emperor's Nightingale,'' employing everything from a
fairy tale of Hans Christian Andersen to the latest
``decoherant-histories approach to quantum mechanics'' to make the
point that corporations exist ``to bring order and chaos into a
special kind of balance.''
</P>
<P>
   He is probably right. But he is more likely to be remembered as
the man who supplanted Davis as the bane of complacent corporate
management _ and in doing so added a good deal of tone to the
gadfly game.
</P>

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, Jan. 20:
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-THREE-STARS (Paris) _ Starting up and running a
three-star restaurant is an astonishingly expensive proposition. A
typical three-star restaurant has two employees for every guest.
And with France's heavy taxes and formidable social charges, even
lunch and dinner bills of up to $500 per person fail to cover
costs. A debate is simmering in France over just how much trouble
the 21 three-star restaurants are in. How creative _ not just in
their cooking, but in their financing _ do chefs have to be, merely
to survive? Many now have backers; one is even going public. Will
the wildly escalating costs of running these establishments drive
the best and the brightest elsewhere? By Frank J. Prial.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN-STOCK (Undated) _ Let's face the truth once and for all.
Most people _ and that includes many chefs _ don't bother making
their own chicken stock, despite the constant urgings that it's the
only legitimate way to go. If you're among the abashed, buck up.
Confident cooks have known for years how to take a can of chicken
broth, a bouillon cube or even a cup of water and make the most of
it. And no apologies are necessary; it's still real cooking. Even
the best chefs will tell you so. By Mark Bittman.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   APERITIFS (Undated) _ On most fronts, American diners have
become more sophisticated and demanding, but when faced with the
aperitif moment, they flinch. ``Something to drink before the
meal?'' is a question brimming with promise. But the truth is, most
people are confused about what an aperitif is and what it is
supposed to do, and that includes professional bartenders. Is it
the same as a cocktail? If not, then where is the dividing line?
Questions like these have challenged the finest minds in drinkdom.
By Bill Grimes.

PUBLIC EDUCATION AND THE PATH TO OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A few years back, I was giving a talk one evening
in a lecture hall at Skidmore College, an exclusive school near
Albany. Like everybody else who was there, probably, I also forget
what I said.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't forget is the kid sitting in the back of that
lecture hall, up high in the seats. He was the only
African-American in that audience of perhaps 100 people. After I
babbled out whatever I had to say that night, he came down to say
hello.
</P>
<P>
   He told me, ``They said when you were introduced that you went
to college in Philadelphia and that you used to work there. I'm
from Philly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereabouts in Philly?'' I asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Philly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where in North Philly?''
</P>
<P>
   The kid looked at me strangely. ``Broad and Girard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to live there,'' I told him. ``I lived in a place
called North Tower Apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where my folks live,'' the kid said emphatically. ``And
you did not live there.''
</P>
<P>
   So, I asked him if a couple of brothers named Nick and Tom still
ran the restaurant on the ground floor. It was a place called ``The
Flamingo'' that served terrific cheese steaks. I asked him if a
slick, suave, grandfatherly guy named Jimmy still was writing
numbers out of a back booth. I asked him if Jimmy still had his
bodyguard, a mean-looking little thug named Rocky, who packed a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   The kid was astonished. Yeah, he said, Nick and Tom were still
there. Jimmy was still there, too. Rocky was in residence at some
state prison. Aside from that, though, the kid told me, nothing
much had changed.
</P>
<P>
   It had, though. What had changed was that a kid from that
incredibly rough, poverty-stricken black neighborhood had made it
to a ritzy school in a neighborhood just as foreign to him as North
Philadelphia had been to me when I'd attended Temple University
decades earlier. I was thinking about that kid Monday, on the
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. I wondered what he's doing now.
</P>
<P>
   My guess? He's doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   When I went to Temple, only three African-Americans in 100 had
college degrees. Today, it's closer to 15 out of 100. That's still
well below the 25 in 100 in the larger population who enjoy that
level of education. But it's both a sign of progress toward
equality in this society and a sign of how much more progress needs
to be made. That's why I bristle every time I hear somebody ranting
about dismantling public education.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure, money gets wasted. Money gets wasted in any large,
complicated enterprise, public or private. Ask anybody with
military or corporate experience. And, sure, the teachers unions
are joined at the hip with the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   It's true nonetheless that the essential road to equality in
this society, especially for minority kids in poor neighborhoods,
is education. Specifically, it's a public school system broadly
supported by all citizens as a crucial societal investment, whether
they have kids in it or not. That includes the public college
system, too, and it includes public support for poor kids who
choose private colleges.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that the public schools shouldn't be better.
And it doesn't mean that alternatives like charter schools should
be dismissed out of hand, especially where public schools just
can't seem to cut it.
</P>
<P>
   But I was living in that kid's slummy neighborhood on the day
King was murdered. I remember what the man died for.
</P>
<P>
   He died so everybody _ and I mean everybody _ could have a real
chance.
</P>
<P>
   That's what public schools are all about.
</P>

TEXAS TOWN OFFERS CASH TO LURE NEW RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROY BRAGG  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALHART, Texas _ Big tippers get the best tables, the closest
parking spots and the friendliest service.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to duplicate the success of habitual palm greasers, civic
boosters here are offering jobs, money and subsidized mortgages to
lure newcomers to this remote Texas Panhandle farm town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to find people who want to move here, buy houses,
raise their families here and live in a small Panhandle town,''
said Dyke Rogers, who runs a fuel distributorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a carrot at the end of a stick,'' said City
Councilman Danny Smallwood, the Coca-Cola distributor.
</P>
<P>
   The New Millennium Homestead Opportunity offers $1,000 bonuses
to the first 50 people who move to Dalhart, get a job, and keep it
for at least a year. Anyone who wants to stick around after getting
that job could qualify for an interest-free loan of up to $10,000,
which doesn't have to be repaid unless the house is sold,
refinanced, or paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Designed to fill jobs vacancies, the program also was intended
to draw attention to the out-of-the-way burg, 80 miles north of
Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Since the program was announced in August, more than 1,000 calls
have been logged at the Dalhart Chamber of Commerce, said P.J.
Pronger, the chamber executive director. Nearly a third of the
calls came after the ``CBS Evening News'' aired a Dec. 29 story on
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high level of interest, only six people have moved
here to take advantage of the incentives. Town leaders blame the
low figure on the lack of housing.
</P>
<P>
   Located 31 miles south of the Oklahoma border and 31 miles east
of the New Mexico border, this county seat of 7,500 is closer to
five other state capitals than to the Texas Capitol in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The promoters say Dalhart is a affordable and safe place _ it
has had 10 killings since it was incorporated in 1901. Rogers, who
owns a chain of convenience stores here, said the town's last armed
robbery was in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a ticket to the downtown Mission Twin Theater with a soft
drink and popcorn costs $4.85. The best steak dinner in town goes
for $9.50.
</P>
<P>
   The economy of Dallam County relies on cows, corn and amber
waves of grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in one of the best corn production areas of the
nation,'' Rogers said. ``And that's because we have cool nights,
sit at a high altitude and have good water.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that corn goes to feed the 500,000 head of cattle in
feedlots. Rogers said all of the lots are owned by large
agricultural corporations that are big enough to keep the lots full
despite fluctuating farm prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the country goes up and down, but it doesn't
affect us much,'' said Craig Fuller, a Dalhart accountant.
</P>

   Town leaders say Dalhart has become a victim of its own
prosperity, with unemployment levels under 3 percent. The openings
of a new state prison and a large commercial hog farm _ together
employing nearly 600 people _ depleted the area's job pool.

   ``All we've been doing is hiring people from each other,'' said
Fuller, describing the shell game employers have played in recent
months. ``If the dentist needs a receptionist, he hires someone
from the phone company. Then they hire someone from here to fill
that job. Then I need someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, Pronger and Rogers developed the bonus plan. The housing
money comes from an existing Texas Department of Housing and
Community Affairs program available statewide, Pronger said. A
local economic development group has provided the incentive money.

chain of convenience stores. He already was being courted for the

   ``I saw a town that held a lot of opportunity for me,'' he said.
The New Millennium Homestead Opportunity program ``tells me this is
a community that's striving for excellence. It's an indication of
what kind of community this is.''

<P>
   Leaders say they aren't disappointed with the results, although
the response to the program has highlighted the town's lack of
housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had any vacant housing, we'd have 100 people here
already. But no one has wanted to build because there wasn't a
market for it,'' Fuller said.

STATE ACCUSES NAVY OF SLOWING TOXIC WASTE CLEANUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ State environmental officials say the cleanup of
toxic waste at several former Navy bases in the San Francisco Bay
area could be delayed if the Navy does not provide more money for
the project.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Toxic Substances Control is threatening
to sue the Navy if it doesn't reimburse about $2.6 million that the
state says it needs to review the cleanup at Treasure Island, Mare
Island, Alameda and other former Navy installations.
</P>
<P>
   The department is responsible for overseeing the military's
removal of chemical and other debris before the property can be
turned over to cities.
</P>
<P>
   Delays in the state review would slow down the transfer of
valuable development land to San Francisco, Vallejo, Alameda and
other cities, former department director Jesse R. Huff wrote in the
last days of former Gov. Pete Wilson's administration.
</P>
<P>
   If the Navy doesn't agree to a reasonable settlement by Jan. 30,
the state will take steps to sue to recover the money, Huff wrote
on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The state estimates that delays could last years.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal and state law, the state has the authority to
oversee the quality of the job of cleaning up land, air and water.
The state also has the responsibility of determining how much that
oversight should cost in terms of hiring scientists and requiring
studies, according to Department of Toxic Substances Control
spokesman Ron Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we had an agreement, and there wouldn't be any
reduction. For us, as regulators, we never let the responsible
parties determine the need and level of oversight at a site,''
Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy spokesman, Jeff Young, said the Navy has a finite amount
of money. Acknowledging that the state has an oversight role under
the law, Young nonetheless insisted that California micromanages
and duplicates other activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to reduce the standards, or reduce the Navy's
responsibility in cleaning the sites. Our perception is that there
are not a shortage of people looking over our shoulder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for a state to request more money than the
federal government is willing to give, whether it's for schools,
highways or services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a system of appraising the amount of oversight
assistance needed to get the job done. The Navy may have a lower
estimate in the amount of oversight that is needed in a given year
for a given number of sites than the projection by the state,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal environmental law requires the Department of Defense to
clean up hazardous waste on the land once used as military bases or
other installations.
</P>
<P>
   California has 48 Navy sites. The San Francisco Bay area has the
largest cluster in the nation, with 13 Navy, Air Force and Army
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement with the Navy, California requests about $5
million to $6 million each year to review the cleanups. For 1998 to
1999, the state asked for $7.2 million. The Navy has agreed to
provide $5.9 million. For 1999 to 2000, the state asked for $6.4
million. The Navy pledges to give $5.1 million. For the 1998-2000
period, that leaves $2.6 million less than the state says it needs.

A KIND WORD IS WORTH A MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN TELFER  
 c.1999 Midland (Mich.) Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDLAND, Mich. _ A short program on a radio station here brought
back some memories about the dangers of placing labels on people.
</P>
<P>
   The program was talking about how some people had been
approached by an old man selling produce. The man had glazed-over
eyes and white stubble on his face. The people bought something
from him as quickly as they could so he would leave.
</P>
<P>
   They had labeled him a dirty wino because of his appearance and
the look in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The man kept coming around and in time they learned he was not a
drunk after all _ his eyes were glazed over by cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   The people had judged this man without knowledge, or very little
knowledge, of who he was. If we are honest, we all have done the
same thing. And some of us have been victims of such judgment.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, I had the opportunity to speak to some middle
school students. I gave them a small glimpse of the path I took to
becoming a newspaper editor. I'm not sure how teachers and
administrators reacted to the message, because success stories
don't always come about in ways people expect.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when I was the age of those students, my favorite
class was gym. I had a teacher who could not control his class,
suffered a nervous breakdown and left the profession.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, it was hard to enjoy going to school and I
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   High school was even more of a letdown. At one point, a
counselor told my mother I would never amount to anything. With
that label being reinforced daily, they were right. While at high
school, I did only what was necessary to pass classes. No homework.
No cramming for exams. I lived up to the expectations of that high
school counselor and my teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Graduation day provided a new opportunity, a clean slate. But I
had to go to a junior college because my high school grades were so
poor and I had no idea what I wanted to do anyway. One of the
classes I took in my first year was a writing class. I had always
enjoyed writing, but never pursued it. The instructor, a reporter
at the local newspaper, told me I had talent and should see if I
could do some reporting work at the college newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the first positive and supportive words spoken to me
by an instructor since the fifth grade, the last year school was
fun. The label had changed. The next thing you know, I was working
at the college newspaper. I was getting straight A's in my classes.
Teachers began communicating with me in a manner that showed
respect.
</P>
<P>
   I transferred to Central Michigan University, and the success
continued. I graduated with honors, having worked as a reporter and
an editor at the university newspaper. Two professional papers,
three jobs and 13 years later, I became a newspaper editor.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, I never stopped learning, and my love for
writing, for knowledge and for people never dimmed. Was it just
because of those positive words from that instructor 20-plus years
ago? At the time, I would not have believed it; but looking back
now, I can clearly see that that class and that instructor were
turning points in my life and career.
</P>
<P>
   I shudder to think what might have occurred had someone not
finally decided to judge me for the person I was, rather than the
person they thought I would be. That's what labels do. They block
your ability to see anything but preconceived notions, much like
the people who thought the old man was a wino.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with labels is they can stick for a
lifetime. Not everybody gets a second chance. And that's a shame, a
real shame.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it the next time you are tempted to place a label on
some child or an adult you know. Instead of calling them a
troublemaker or a disruptive influence, try some encouraging words.
You might change a life.

   AMMAN _ King Hussein comes back to Jordan today (Tuesday)
through the flag-bedecked streets of Amman after six months of
chemotherapy treatment for cancer in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   As Jordanians prepare publicly to celebrate his return with
military parades, air shows, fireworks, folk dancing and poetry
recitals, they speculate endlessly in private about who will
succeed to the throne he has held for 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that King Hussein, who is still only 63, is dying.
Despite the loss of his hair _ even his eyebrows _ the chemotherapy
appears to have cured the lymphoma from which he suffered.
</P>
<P>
   But his illness has focused the attention of Jordanians _ 90
percent of whom were born since he became king in 1953 _ on the
future of their country after his reign.
</P>
<P>
   In theory this was settled a long time ago. Crown Prince Hassan,
the king's younger brother, has been his designated successor since
1965. He ruled the country as regent while the king was being
treated in the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech on Jordanian television broadcast from London at
the weekend King Hussein made no reference to his future role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he has to say now that the crown prince is my successor
or not,'' said one Jordanian analyst Sunday, adding: ``I don't see
how he can let Hassan become king. He isn't popular with the people
or the army and whoever rules Jordan must have good relations with
army. His speeches are too intellectual. He speaks as if he was the
U.N. Secretary General.''
</P>
<P>
   This is harsh on Crown Prince Hassan. A burly, hard-working,
intelligent administrator of 51, he has inevitably stood in the
king's shadow throughout his life, but if often accused of lacking
the common touch.
</P>
<P>
   He is conscious of the difficulties of his own position.
``Prince Charles once told we should form an association of crown
princes,'' he said several years ago in an interview. ``Or perhaps
clown princes' association would be more appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during his six months as regent the crown prince's power
was far from absolute. The king never wholly relaxed his grip.
</P>
<P>
   He sent open letters from his hospital bed, one criticizing
Jordanian inefficiency as two jumbo jets almost crashed over Amman
airport when all the flight controllers went to pray at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   As he recovered he frequently saw President Clinton and helped
orchestrate the Wye agreement between Israel and the Palestinians
in October.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly the only question in dispute revolves around the
succession to the throne after Crown Prince Hassan. Should it be
his son Rashid or one of King Hussein's sons such as Hamza, 19, by
his present wife, Queen Noor?
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian constitution was altered in 1965 to allow Crown
Prince Hassan to become heir to the throne, because Abdullah, his
eldest son was only three and the king was in constant danger of
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice any decision on Crown Prince Hassan's successor
could be reversed by him once he became king. Therefore the present
dynastic dispute revolves directly around who will succeed King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   If Crown Prince Hassan is passed over then the most likely heir
to the throne is Hamza. His half-brother Abdullah, whose mother was
English, is commander of the royal guard, but primarily a military
commander with limited interest in politics. Though popular with
the army he speaks poor Arabic, while Hamza is fluent.
</P>
<P>
   The danger from King Hussein's point of view is that Jordan
cannot afford a weak ruler because it is less powerful than all its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It is squeezed between Israel to the west and Iraq to the east,
while its relations with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have been cool
since Jordan took a neutral stance in the Gulf war in 1991. It has
few natural resources and no oil, leaving it heavily dependent on
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein used his enforced stay in the U.S. to build close
personal relations with President Clinton. But neither his peace
treaty with Israel signed in 1994, nor his increasingly vocal
hostility to Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, are popular policies
at home. He knows his dynasty cannot afford to make too many
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The king has in mind major changes relating to the
succession,'' a palace official was quoted as saying Sunday but
would not elaborate. &QL;

<P>
   At least the suspense is over. On Jan. 13 Gustavo Franco,
Brazil's central-bank governor, resigned and his successor allowed
the country's currency, the real, to devalue by over 8 percent
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's giant, the eighth-biggest economy in the world,
which only two months ago won a $41.5 billion international support
package to defend the real, has admitted defeat.
</P>
<P>
   From Wall Street to Warsaw, financial markets shuddered, fearing
possible contagion from a Brazilian collapse.
</P>
<P>
   At this point a single question haunts investors and
policymakers alike. Will a Brazilian devaluation precipitate global
financial meltdown?
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely three months ago, when markets were at their most
jittery, that seemed a strong possibility. Whether it remains so
depends on two other questions.
</P>
<P>
   Will Brazil be able to control this devaluation, to regain
investor confidence and to continue with its economic reforms _ or
will it descend into Asian-style chaos? And will the rest of the
world react calmly or panic?
</P>
<P>
   In principle, Brazil should gain from a cheaper currency. The
real was widely thought to be overvalued and speculation about
devaluation was rife.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Brazil's interest rates remain so high (the
benchmark rate is 29 percent, despite falling prices) is that
investors were demanding compensation for the risk of devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, now that the devaluation has happened, Brazil's
exporters should become more competitive and interest rates should
come down.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of reigniting inflation, even in inflation-prone
Brazil, seems low in an economy that is now heading for a deep
recession. And since the Brazilians still have some $35 billion of
reserves left (even without the international package) there is
plenty of ammunition with which to defend the real.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, then, Brazil should be able to manage a
controlled devaluation, just as it did in 1995 after Mexico's
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is too sanguine. Brazil was forced to devalue this week
because investors had lost confidence in the government's ability
to tackle the country's main problem: fiscal profligacy,
particularly a public-sector deficit running last year at 8 percent
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Since the introduction of the real in 1994, Brazilian
politicians have bet that high interest rates and a stable exchange
rate would keep inflation at bay and attract enough foreign money
to allow budget reforms to work slowly through the country's
political labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   That bet has been lost, partly because sentiment about emerging
markets has soured so spectacularly and partly because the
Brazilians have so conspicuously failed to deliver on their fiscal
promises, even after they were hauled back from the brink by the
promised $41.5 billion of loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months the government has proved politically
weak (it failed to muster a simple parliamentary majority to raise
civil-service pension contributions), incompetent (it bungled the
renewal of a tax on financial transactions) and unable to restrain
free-booting state governments (witness last week's partial debt
moratorium by the state of Minas Gerais).
</P>
<P>
   These failings have not been solved by a devaluation that may
turn out to have been too modest. Instead, the government's
domestic credibility has taken a hammering.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is indelibly linked with a
strong real, a policy he himself invented. Only a year ago in an
interview with The Economist, Cardoso made clear that devaluation,
whenever it took place, would be a ``political disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed: it is hard to see a weakened Cardoso administration
credibly implementing the fiscal measures needed to restore
confidence. Much as a controlled devaluation and a return of
investor confidence would be welcome, the chances of either seem
pretty slim.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious is what international impact a Brazilian crisis
will have. Certainly markets are calmer than they were in October.
Wall Street has surged back (and beyond) its 1998 jitters.
Investors are no longer eschewing all risk in debt markets; even
emerging economies are gradually regaining access to world capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the stability is still fragile. America's economy is relying
ever more heavily on a stock market-fuelled consumption boom, and
the stock market itself has reached ever more surreal heights.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's travails are far from over; China looks increasingly
ropy. Within Latin America, the uncertainties that Brazil has this
week created could push several countries into recession, perhaps
into financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, the ingredients for global meltdown remain.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it can be avoided will depend primarily on whether
markets still believe in international policymakers, especially the
IMF and America's Treasury. Yet it is hard to see how investors can
have much faith in either. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 775. UNCUT VERSION IS 1,150 WORDS.) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Superficially, at least, Brazil seems to be just one more in a
string of IMF debacles. As in Russia, attempts to shore up an
exchange-rate peg with high interest rates and promises of
financial support have failed. In many eyes, the IMF will have lost
as much credibility as the Cardoso government.
</P>
<P>
   Regaining it will not be easy. The most important step must be
to revamp the details of Brazil's IMF agreement. Provided that
Brazil regains its nerve on fiscal policy and makes every effort to
pass the tough measures it promised, the loan package should stay
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Should Brazil fail to deliver on its promises, however, it would
clearly be wrong to throw good money after bad. But for now, the
presumption ought to be that the government will seek to salvage
things.
</P>
<P>
   The best course for the outside world is to go on supporting it
in those efforts _ so long as they seem sincere. Indeed outsiders
could go further, by putting pressure on international bankers not
to pull all Brazil's credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and other would-be architects of a new international
financial order also need to ponder broader lessons both from this
episode and from East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to defend pegged exchange rates with external financial
support seldom work. Either countries should float their currencies
(or adopt much wider bands) or they should adopt the rigid fixity
of a currency board or even currency union.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for international policymakers to be clearer about
this _ and for Brazil to accept the consequences for its own
currency regime.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil provides yet another example of the limited extent to
which outside credit can shore up investor confidence. That
realization should affect current discussion of the IMF's role.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil cracked largely thanks to its own failings, it
has been no showcase of the ability of outside credit to calm
investors. So last autumn's American proposal for ``contingent
credit lines'' may need to be rethought.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's markets calmed down in late 1998, all such
questions fell from the headlines. Even if Brazil does not lead to
new panic, it shows that they still need to be answered. &QL;

<P>
   That bet has been lost, partly because sentiment about emerging
markets has soured so spectacularly and partly because the
Brazilians have so conspicuously failed to deliver on their fiscal
promises, even after they were hauled back from the brink by the
promised $41.5 billion of loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months the government has proved politically
weak (it failed to muster a simple parliamentary majority to raise
civil-service pension contributions), incompetent (it bungled the
renewal of a tax on financial transactions) and unable to restrain
free-booting state governments (witness last week's partial debt
moratorium by the state of Minas Gerais).
</P>
<P>
   These failings have not been solved by a devaluation that may
turn out to have been too modest. Instead, the government's
domestic credibility has taken a hammering.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is indelibly linked with a
strong real, a policy he himself invented. Only a year ago in an
interview with The Economist, Cardoso made clear that devaluation,
whenever it took place, would be a ``political disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed: it is hard to see a weakened Cardoso administration
credibly implementing the fiscal measures needed to restore
confidence. Much as a controlled devaluation and a return of
investor confidence would be welcome, the chances of either seem
pretty slim.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious is what international impact a Brazilian crisis
will have. Certainly markets are calmer than they were in October.
Wall Street has surged back (and beyond) its 1998 jitters.
Investors are no longer eschewing all risk in debt markets; even
emerging economies are gradually regaining access to world capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the stability is still fragile. America's economy is relying
ever more heavily on a stock market-fuelled consumption boom, and
the stock market itself has reached ever more surreal heights.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's travails are far from over; China looks increasingly
ropy. Within Latin America, the uncertainties that Brazil has this
week created could push several countries into recession, perhaps
into financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, the ingredients for global meltdown remain.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it can be avoided will depend primarily on whether
markets still believe in international policymakers, especially the
IMF and America's Treasury. Yet it is hard to see how investors can
have much faith in either. &QL;

<P>
   Superficially, at least, Brazil seems to be just one more in a
string of IMF debacles. As in Russia, attempts to shore up an
exchange-rate peg with high interest rates and promises of
financial support have failed. In many eyes, the IMF will have lost
as much credibility as the Cardoso government.
</P>
<P>
   Regaining it will not be easy. The most important step must be
to revamp the details of Brazil's IMF agreement. Provided that
Brazil regains its nerve on fiscal policy and makes every effort to
pass the tough measures it promised, the loan package should stay
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Should Brazil fail to deliver on its promises, however, it would
clearly be wrong to throw good money after bad. But for now, the
presumption ought to be that the government will seek to salvage
things.
</P>
<P>
   The best course for the outside world is to go on supporting it
in those efforts _ so long as they seem sincere. Indeed outsiders
could go further, by putting pressure on international bankers not
to pull all Brazil's credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and other would-be architects of a new international
financial order also need to ponder broader lessons both from this
episode and from East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to defend pegged exchange rates with external financial
support seldom work. Either countries should float their currencies
(or adopt much wider bands) or they should adopt the rigid fixity
of a currency board or even currency union.
</P>
<P>
   It is time for international policymakers to be clearer about
this _ and for Brazil to accept the consequences for its own
currency regime.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil provides yet another example of the limited extent to
which outside credit can shore up investor confidence. That
realization should affect current discussion of the IMF's role.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil cracked largely thanks to its own failings, it
has been no showcase of the ability of outside credit to calm
investors. So last autumn's American proposal for ``contingent
credit lines'' may need to be rethought.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's markets calmed down in late 1998, all such
questions fell from the headlines. Even if Brazil does not lead to
new panic, it shows that they still need to be answered. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   At least the suspense is over. On Jan. 13 Gustavo Franco,
Brazil's central-bank governor, resigned and his successor allowed
the country's currency, the real, to devalue by over 8 percent
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America's giant, the eighth-biggest economy in the world,
which only two months ago won a $41.5 billion international support
package to defend the real, has admitted defeat.
</P>
<P>
   From Wall Street to Warsaw, financial markets shuddered, fearing
possible contagion from a Brazilian collapse.
</P>
<P>
   At this point a single question haunts investors and
policymakers alike. Will a Brazilian devaluation precipitate global
financial meltdown?
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely three months ago, when markets were at their most
jittery, that seemed a strong possibility. Whether it remains so
depends on two other questions.
</P>
<P>
   Will Brazil be able to control this devaluation, to regain
investor confidence and to continue with its economic reforms _ or
will it descend into Asian-style chaos? And will the rest of the
world react calmly or panic?
</P>
<P>
   In principle, Brazil should gain from a cheaper currency. The
real was widely thought to be overvalued and speculation about
devaluation was rife.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Brazil's interest rates remain so high (the
benchmark rate is 29 percent, despite falling prices) is that
investors were demanding compensation for the risk of devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, now that the devaluation has happened, Brazil's
exporters should become more competitive and interest rates should
come down.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of reigniting inflation, even in inflation-prone
Brazil, seems low in an economy that is now heading for a deep
recession. And since the Brazilians still have some $35 billion of
reserves left (even without the international package) there is
plenty of ammunition with which to defend the real.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, then, Brazil should be able to manage a
controlled devaluation, just as it did in 1995 after Mexico's
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is too sanguine. Brazil was forced to devalue this week
because investors had lost confidence in the government's ability
to tackle the country's main problem: fiscal profligacy,
particularly a public-sector deficit running last year at 8 percent
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Since the introduction of the real in 1994, Brazilian
politicians have bet that high interest rates and a stable exchange
rate would keep inflation at bay and attract enough foreign money
to allow budget reforms to work slowly through the country's
political labyrinth.
</P>
<P>
   That bet has been lost, partly because sentiment about emerging
markets has soured so spectacularly and partly because the
Brazilians have so conspicuously failed to deliver on their fiscal
promises, even after they were hauled back from the brink by the
promised $41.5 billion of loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months the government has proved politically

civil-service pension contributions), incompetent (it bungled the
renewal of a tax on financial transactions) and unable to restrain

<P>
   For a brief moment, harmony prevailed. On Jan. 8 the Senate
agreed unanimously on the rules that would govern Bill Clinton's
trial, and senators congratulated themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They would not be like their colleagues in the House, both
Republican and Democratic, who had turned the president's
impeachment into something resembling warfare. They would show that
the upper chamber was a civil and responsible place, and that the
trial of a president was a sober judicial proceeding. And all would
be well.
</P>
<P>
   Alas for good intentions. As Bill Clinton's trial opens in
earnest, the two sides are lining up again. The Democrats see no
need to call witnesses; the Republicans consider that this will not
be a proper trial without them.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are convinced that Clinton has done nothing to
deserve removal from office; many Republicans see this as their
last chance to get him out.
</P>
<P>
   The party's diehards detest this man not just for his ideology
(which, after all, has sometimes mimicked theirs), not just for the
misdeeds he is charged with, but as a person. And the president's
supporters, in turn, detest his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 trial managers, drawn from the House, are pictured as
sanctimonious hypocrites whose own misdeeds now stand exposed by
the publisher of Hustler magazine and whose impeachment charges, in
the words of a Democratic senator, Tom Harkin, amount to ``a pile
of dung.''
</P>
<P>
   An impeachment process against a president is inevitably
political; but it does not have to be like this.
</P>
<P>
   The articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon were voted
almost unanimously. The feeling was one of immense pride that the
Constitution worked, and could efficiently remove a bad apple from
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the impeachment procedures against Clinton have
been so partisan that they have had the opposite effect. They do
not prove that the system works; they seem merely to prove that it
can be abused by zealots on both the Republican and Democratic
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Partisanship already has a bad name in America. The public
associates it with gridlock, and is happiest when centrists in each
party make pacts with each other. Yet in recent years, for many
reasons, American politics has become more strident and divided,
and often along personal rather than ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for Congress must appeal for funds continually from
the most committed (and often more extreme) members of their
parties. At the same time, they must grab the attention of the
majority, who do not vote at all, with ten-second soundbites and
30-second negative commercials. In the past year, the president's
bad behavior has hardened attitudes still further.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sort of partisanship that is useful, indeed
essential, to the government of democracies: the friction of
different, but considered, points of view, as a result of which
problems are solved and excesses kept in check.
</P>
<P>
   It can be hard-hitting, but it keeps to the high ground; it has
nothing to do with personal vendettas. And it is in short supply
nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are no longer sure where either party, but especially
the Republican one, stands on the issues that concern them: reform
of entitlements, education, health care, the role of government.
</P>
<P>
   They have been treated to a brand of partisanship that is mostly
destructive. As they see it, the impeachment process is a nasty
game being played in Washington, which has nothing to do with them
and makes little difference to the smooth running of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, they are right. America's economy booms along
without hindrance; the states bask in budget surpluses; crime is
falling, jobs are growing. In most people's lives, most of the
time, Washington is indeed a sideshow, and even an economic
downturn or a foreign-policy crisis would give it only a temporary
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet democracy is hardly healthy when most Americans want no part
of politics, abandoning it instead to the destroyers and the
bigots. Perhaps this trial, founded fast in personal animosity as
well as presidential misdeeds, will finally wake them up. &QL;

   Who will bring peace to Africa? From north to south, east to
west, large swathes of the continent are at war, but almost all
efforts at pacification have come to naught.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, a ragged rebel movement has given the
Nigerian-led intervention force a fearful drubbing. In Angola,
faced by the determination of both sides to start fighting yet
again, the United Nations' secretary-general may soon recommend the
withdrawal of the U.N. force monitoring what is supposed to be a
peace.
</P>
<P>
   To send foreign soldiers, whether African or not, to intervene
in any of the continent's manifold disputes looks ever more
hopeless, ever more foolish.
</P>
<P>
   For America, Somalia was the turning point. When 18 crack
American soldiers died there in one disastrous night in October
1993, the intervention force of which they were a part was pulled
out and the Americans resolved never to intervene in Africa again.
Next year came genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   When the full enormity of the killing there became clear,
western governments had a rethink. They were still unwilling to
send their own troops to stop African wars, and had little faith in
the U.N., so they promoted regional peacekeeping: the neighbors
should police their own block.
</P>
<P>
   America, France and Britain started to train African armies in
peacekeeping techniques. Unfortunately, the programs were not
coordinated and American money soon ran out. Some of the countries
given peacekeeping training, such as Senegal and Zimbabwe, then
went off to fight wars of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Regional forces have now intervened in five African wars. In
none have they been neutral, always weighing in on one side or the
other _ and not always backing the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In Liberia, the West African peacekeeping force was itself
divided over whom to support. The Nigerians, who came to dominate
it, changed sides to back the man they had earlier tried to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia claimed a mandate
from the Southern African Development Community to intervene in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, another member, vigorously disagreed but then
claimed a similar mandate when it intervened in Lesotho last
September.
</P>
<P>
   These interventions have received no official blessing from the
U.N. The world has generally supported Nigeria's attempts to beat
the rebels in Sierra Leone but frowned on the intervention in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. itself, which at present has four missions in Africa,
is not fighting or even keeping the peace, merely observing. Its
attempt to bring peace to Sierra Leone has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In Western Sahara and the Central African Republic, U.N.
missions are stuck while one party exploits their presence to
strengthen its own position. The mission in Angola hangs in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique provides the only recent example of successful
peacekeeping in Africa. There a nasty civil war ended, the rebels
stood for election, lost and became a loyalish opposition. But the
success owed less to effective peacekeeping than to the commitment
of both sides to make the peace deal work.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is that, in a continent where guns are plentiful and
guerrillas can operate with relative ease, the only kind of force _
African or not _ that is likely to be successful is one which is
monitoring an existing peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it must be an agreement that all sides genuinely want
to last. Africa must get more of these if it is ever to have more
peace. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Praise be to Michael Jordan. At long last a grateful nation has
a good reason to turn its attention from the travails of Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball's transcendent star is at last retiring. This week,
even the expectation of such an announcement was enough to claim
front-page coverage, first spot on the television news and a sober
lead editorial in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Surely only insensitive curmudgeons, remote from the feelings of
ordinary folk, will argue that the priorities were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some non-sporting innocents will still need convincing. To
them basketball is just a game in which very tall men crowd on to a
rather small court to bounce a ball and then throw it through a
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Why these physical freaks should be paid so much (the average
salary in the National Basketball Association last year was $2.6
million, and Jordan's was an astounding $33 million, to which he
added more than $40 million in commercial endorsements) is a
mystery explicable only by the bizarre economics of television and
the willingness of young men to buy overpriced sneakers as though
clothes alone will help them emulate their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these innocents have a point. Even the sport's fans have
been bemused over the past few months by a self-destructive dispute
between owners and players which, it was accurately argued, boiled
down to a wrangle between short billionaires and tall millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two points they neglect. The first is the sheer
athleticism of the sport. No other American sport, certainly not
football, with its regimented moves, or baseball, with its tedious
longueurs, has the same combination of sustained physical grace,
effort, creativity and personality.
</P>
<P>
   To watch the slender Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers draw
away from his marker and score from the three-point line is to see
poetic elegance; to watch Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks play
on despite a recently fractured wrist is to see a courage money
does not buy.
</P>
<P>
   The second point is Jordan himself. ``His Airness'' (the title
is thanks to his gravity-defying slam-dunks and jump shots, and the
Air sports shoes that Nike named after him) is a star who deserves
his status.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the evidence is statistical: five times the league's
most valuable player; six times a championship winner with the
Chicago Bulls; twice an Olympic gold medallist.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement press conference, the Bulls' owner, Jerry
Reinsdorf, described him as ``simply the best player who ever put
on a basketball uniform.'' With due respect to Wilt Chamberlain and
Magic Johnson, Reinsdorf is right.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? It is true that America, in contrast to those
countries that meanly cut their stars down to size (Australians
call it ``the tall poppy syndrome''), is a country happy to be
star-struck.
</P>
<P>
   After all, to be a star is to outshine the competition, which
for America's values is an essential attribute; hence the ready
acceptance of salaries for corporate chieftains that elsewhere
would seem quite grossly excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even in America, Jordan seems an exceptional star. Would
the retirement of Bill Gates, richer even than Jordan, command
quite such rapt attention? Possibly not.
</P>
<P>
   But then Gates is simply an exceptional example of a common
phenomenon, the successful white businessman. Michael, as his fans
tend to call him, is also a successful businessman, but he is a
black one, and that combination is dispiritingly uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Black stars shine mostly in sports and show business, and even
there precious few appeal to the white majority.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali is one, but only since the baby-boomer generation
reached maturity and disregarded their elders' fears of Ali's Islam
and his opposition to the Vietnam war. O.J. Simpson was another,
but that lasted only until his trial for murder.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Jordan's reach beyond the boundaries of race is
unqualified: his shaven head is a poster icon for black and white
alike (one piece of market research found that the back of his head
is more recognized than the faces of Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich
and Jesus Christ).
</P>
<P>
   His presence on the basketball court has helped a sport that is
80 percent black win an audience that is 80 percent white; and the
products he endorses, from Gatorade soft drinks to MCI telephone
services, are aimed at the whole nation, not just its black
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Fortune magazine analyzed what it called ``the
Jordan effect,'' it calculated that, since joining the NBA in 1984,
he had brought the league some $10 billion in tickets, TV revenues
and merchandise sales _ only a small part of which can have come
from America's blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Jordan's multiracial appeal should be no mystery at
all. In a sport in which too many players are ill-educated or badly
behaved, the articulate Michael embodies virtues that pretty well
all Americans can identify with: an extraordinary discipline and
work ethic, enabling him to be the best in his field even at the
age of 35; an ability to inspire his colleagues; and a will to win
so strong that in one session of the 1997 finals against the Utah
Jazz he played a winning game despite a high fever.
</P>
<P>
   So what now? Unlike most sportsmen, Jordan has retired at the
top (his very last shot was the one that last year won the NBA
championship with just 6.6 seconds left to play).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown, the greatest running back in professional football,
is another black American who retired at the top; he then went on
to be a movie star and businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Brown this week had some cautionary words in the New York Times
for well-paid black athletes in white-controlled sports: ``They
keep saying the owners should hire more black coaches, but even if
you had all black coaches, that's not helping black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is that the owners and the agents control the
black athlete. The athletes should take the bull by the horns and
have more control over their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Will His Airness take up the challenge? It would be progress for
all Americans if the short white billionaires in the owners' box
were to be joined at last by a tall black one. &QL;

Air sports shoes that Nike named after him) is a star who deserves
his status.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the evidence is statistical: five times the league's
most valuable player; six times a championship winner with the
Chicago Bulls; twice an Olympic gold medallist.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement press conference, the Bulls' owner, Jerry
Reinsdorf, described him as ``simply the best player who ever put
on a basketball uniform.'' With due respect to Wilt Chamberlain and
Magic Johnson, Reinsdorf is right.
</P>
<P>
   But so what? It is true that America, in contrast to those
countries that meanly cut their stars down to size (Australians
call it ``the tall poppy syndrome''), is a country happy to be
star-struck.
</P>
<P>
   After all, to be a star is to outshine the competition, which
for America's values is an essential attribute; hence the ready
acceptance of salaries for corporate chieftains that elsewhere
would seem quite grossly excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even in America, Jordan seems an exceptional star. Would
the retirement of Bill Gates, richer even than Jordan, command
quite such rapt attention? Possibly not.
</P>
<P>
   But then Gates is simply an exceptional example of a common
phenomenon, the successful white businessman. Michael, as his fans
tend to call him, is also a successful businessman, but he is a
black one, and that combination is dispiritingly uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Black stars shine mostly in sports and show business, and even
there precious few appeal to the white majority.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali is one, but only since the baby-boomer generation
reached maturity and disregarded their elders' fears of Ali's Islam
and his opposition to the Vietnam war. O.J. Simpson was another,
but that lasted only until his trial for murder.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Jordan's reach beyond the boundaries of race is
unqualified: his shaven head is a poster icon for black and white
alike (one piece of market research found that the back of his head
is more recognized than the faces of Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich
and Jesus Christ).
</P>
<P>
   His presence on the basketball court has helped a sport that is
80 percent black win an audience that is 80 percent white; and the
products he endorses, from Gatorade soft drinks to MCI telephone
services, are aimed at the whole nation, not just its black
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Fortune magazine analyzed what it called ``the
Jordan effect,'' it calculated that, since joining the NBA in 1984,
he had brought the league some $10 billion in tickets, TV revenues
and merchandise sales _ only a small part of which can have come
from America's blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Jordan's multiracial appeal should be no mystery at
all. In a sport in which too many players are ill-educated or badly
behaved, the articulate Michael embodies virtues that pretty well
all Americans can identify with: an extraordinary discipline and
work ethic, enabling him to be the best in his field even at the
age of 35; an ability to inspire his colleagues; and a will to win
so strong that in one session of the 1997 finals against the Utah
Jazz he played a winning game despite a high fever.
</P>
<P>
   So what now? Unlike most sportsmen, Jordan has retired at the
top (his very last shot was the one that last year won the NBA
championship with just 6.6 seconds left to play).
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brown, the greatest running back in professional football,
is another black American who retired at the top; he then went on
to be a movie star and businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Brown this week had some cautionary words in the New York Times
for well-paid black athletes in white-controlled sports: ``They
keep saying the owners should hire more black coaches, but even if
you had all black coaches, that's not helping black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is that the owners and the agents control the
black athlete. The athletes should take the bull by the horns and
have more control over their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Will His Airness take up the challenge? It would be progress for
all Americans if the short white billionaires in the owners' box
were to be joined at last by a tall black one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Praise be to Michael Jordan. At long last a grateful nation has
a good reason to turn its attention from the travails of Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball's transcendent star is at last retiring. This week,
even the expectation of such an announcement was enough to claim
front-page coverage, first spot on the television news and a sober
lead editorial in the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Surely only insensitive curmudgeons, remote from the feelings of
ordinary folk, will argue that the priorities were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some non-sporting innocents will still need convincing. To
them basketball is just a game in which very tall men crowd on to a
rather small court to bounce a ball and then throw it through a
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   Why these physical freaks should be paid so much (the average
salary in the National Basketball Association last year was $2.6
million, and Jordan's was an astounding $33 million, to which he
added more than $40 million in commercial endorsements) is a
mystery explicable only by the bizarre economics of television and
the willingness of young men to buy overpriced sneakers as though
clothes alone will help them emulate their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these innocents have a point. Even the sport's fans have
been bemused over the past few months by a self-destructive dispute
between owners and players which, it was accurately argued, boiled
down to a wrangle between short billionaires and tall millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two points they neglect. The first is the sheer
athleticism of the sport. No other American sport, certainly not
football, with its regimented moves, or baseball, with its tedious
longueurs, has the same combination of sustained physical grace,
effort, creativity and personality.
</P>
<P>
   To watch the slender Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers draw
away from his marker and score from the three-point line is to see
poetic elegance; to watch Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks play
on despite a recently fractured wrist is to see a courage money
does not buy.
</P>
<P>
   The second point is Jordan himself. ``His Airness'' (the title
is thanks to his gravity-defying slam-dunks and jump shots, and the
Air sports shoes that Nike named after him) is a star who deserves
his status.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the evidence is statistical: five times the league's
most valuable player; six times a championship winner with the
Chicago Bulls; twice an Olympic gold medallist.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ William Kelley, chief executive of the University
of Pennsylvania Health System, strides over to his Penn Tower
window and, like a latter-day emperor, reviews his territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 1.3 million square feet of new research space in this
campus...We have the advantage here of a fully integrated health
system. We own four hospitals...We take care of 20 percent of the
people in the Greater Philadelphia market.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Schuylkill River, Jean-Pierre Garnier, the chief
operating officer of the SmithKline Beecham pharmaceutical company,
does a similar spot of high-rise window-gazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color of the Schuylkill is different every day. It's an
easy city to commit to,'' he says. ``There are now several hundred
biotech labs around here. There's a critical mass of people trying
to develop drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Can this really be Philadelphia, Penn., which W.C. Fields (a
humorously ungrateful son of the city) famously said was closed on
Sundays?
</P>
<P>
   True, the city has its Liberty Bell, and a quaint grid of
cobblestoned streets befitting America's first capital. But
Hollywood has engraved into the nation's consciousness a grimmer
image.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s a track-suited Sylvester Stallone sprinted up the
steps of the Museum of Art and became Rocky Balboa, a tough hero
from a tough neighborhood; in the early 1990s Tom Hanks played an
AIDS victim to the plaintive strains of Bruce Springsteen's
``Streets of Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Few outsiders connect Philadelphia with medical and scientific
excellence; they think, instead, of Boston or of sunny parts of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a pity, given that the reality of Philadelphia and its
suburbs is rather more encouraging than the reputation.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 80 colleges and universities, churning out
50,000 graduates a year; there are six schools of medicine and 24
teaching hospitals; budding scientific entrepreneurs can seek the
help of bright MBAs from the Wharton School of Business and can tap
the resources ($2.7 billion at the last count) of more than two
dozen venture-capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the birth of companies such as Centocor, which makes drugs
for heart disease and may soon have new ones for colon-rectal and
prostate cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Since like attracts like, it is easy to see how clusters of
excellence form in health care and pharmaceuticals, and in
associated financial and data services.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, for instance, talks of the ``synergies'' with chemical
and bio-engineering schools, notes the competitive success in
getting research money from the National Institutes of Health and
happily provides visitors with a photocopy of a patent for a
``viral-mediated gene transfer system,'' awarded two years ago to
him and two colleagues at Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Kelley could work anywhere _ but has chosen
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. Others, of course, have chosen to leave: not
necessarily the area, but certainly the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``hollowing-out'' process familiar to older cities across
the nation, much of the white middle class in the 1970s and 1980s
moved to the suburbs, leaving behind a ``core city'' of poor
schooling and inadequate housing and shrinking tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1950, when Philadelphia had around 2 million residents,
the city's population has slumped by a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Vietnam war, the industrialization of Southeast
Asia and then, in the early 1990s, the closing of the naval
shipyard all contributed to the demise of Philadelphia's
labor-intensive manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by 20 percent over
the past 30 years in the metropolitan region, and by 50 percent in
the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, barely five years ago, that the city was on the verge
of insolvency, rescued only by bonds issued by the Pennsylvania
Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority, a state agency set up to
supervise the city's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to America's economic boom, those days seem a distant
memory. But not everyone has forgotten them.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rendell, the city's Democratic mayor since 1992, wins
plaudits from the business community for his energy, his ideas and
his determination (early on he faced down union wage demands and
contracted out city services in 59 different areas).
</P>
<P>
   But he brushes aside the praise. After all, from April, when the
full impact of the 1996 welfare-to-work legislation is felt,
``We'll have to find jobs for 35,000-40,000 mothers. You add these
to the pool and you have a significant problem: 50,000, 60,000,
70,000 looking for jobs that basically don't exist.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quite so, because _ despite some intensive remedial work by
private-sector employers such as the Crown Cork &AMP; Seal packaging
company _ most of these job-seekers will have precious few
educational skills, and certainly not the ones that will attract
Kelley and Garnier.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor would love to have the powers to run the city's
schools that his counterpart, Richard Daley, has in Chicago,
insisting on benchmark standards and putting an end to the
automatic moving of students up a grade each year; but only if the
state legislature gives him money, too.
</P>
<P>
   That might add up to $300 million, and meanwhile each
schoolchild in the city will get $2,000 less spent on him than a
child in the suburbs. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OF 125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM; UNCUT VERSION IS 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could this change? The pessimists argue that for all its
construction boom (William Penn's statue, once setting a limit to
any building's height, became a relative dwarf more than a decade
ago), Philadelphia is still a laggard, slowed down by a history of
outdated habits and infrastructure that does not apply to sunbelt
cities such as Atlanta or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When a business-promotion association, Greater Philadelphia
First, recently drew up a nationwide ``income-opportunity index''
(relating average wages to living costs), Philadelphia came a
dispiriting 43rd out of 50.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rendell, who is full of bright ideas for channelling
federal tax incentives the city's way, can sound despondent: ``I
have a great frustration, because no matter how hard we work, we're
just staying even.''
</P>
<P>
   But staying even is surely better than going backwards. And if
getting more money is a matter of political persuasion, perhaps
Philadelphia will be better off than most.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in the summer of next year, as the presidential
election looms, Rendell's Philadelphia will play host to the
Republicans' national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to some millennium tourism and perhaps W.C. Fields's
epitaph for himself _ ``I'd rather be in Philadelphia'' _ will not
sound quite so mocking after all. &QL;

schooling and inadequate housing and shrinking tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1950, when Philadelphia had around 2 million residents,
the city's population has slumped by a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Vietnam war, the industrialization of Southeast
Asia and then, in the early 1990s, the closing of the naval
shipyard all contributed to the demise of Philadelphia's
labor-intensive manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by 20 percent over
the past 30 years in the metropolitan region, and by 50 percent in
the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, barely five years ago, that the city was on the verge
of insolvency, rescued only by bonds issued by the Pennsylvania
Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority, a state agency set up to
supervise the city's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to America's economic boom, those days seem a distant
memory. But not everyone has forgotten them.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rendell, the city's Democratic mayor since 1992, wins
plaudits from the business community for his energy, his ideas and
his determination (early on he faced down union wage demands and
contracted out city services in 59 different areas).
</P>
<P>
   But he brushes aside the praise. After all, from April, when the
full impact of the 1996 welfare-to-work legislation is felt,
``We'll have to find jobs for 35,000-40,000 mothers. You add these
to the pool and you have a significant problem: 50,000, 60,000,
70,000 looking for jobs that basically don't exist.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quite so, because _ despite some intensive remedial work by
private-sector employers such as the Crown Cork &AMP; Seal packaging
company _ most of these job-seekers will have precious few
educational skills, and certainly not the ones that will attract
Kelley and Garnier.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor would love to have the powers to run the city's
schools that his counterpart, Richard Daley, has in Chicago,
insisting on benchmark standards and putting an end to the
automatic moving of students up a grade each year; but only if the
state legislature gives him money, too.
</P>
<P>
   That might add up to $300 million, and meanwhile each
schoolchild in the city will get $2,000 less spent on him than a
child in the suburbs. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OF 125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM; UNCUT VERSION IS 1,100) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could this change? The pessimists argue that for all its
construction boom (William Penn's statue, once setting a limit to
any building's height, became a relative dwarf more than a decade
ago), Philadelphia is still a laggard, slowed down by a history of
outdated habits and infrastructure that does not apply to sunbelt
cities such as Atlanta or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When a business-promotion association, Greater Philadelphia
First, recently drew up a nationwide ``income-opportunity index''
(relating average wages to living costs), Philadelphia came a
dispiriting 43rd out of 50.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rendell, who is full of bright ideas for channelling
federal tax incentives the city's way, can sound despondent: ``I
have a great frustration, because no matter how hard we work, we're
just staying even.''
</P>
<P>
   But staying even is surely better than going backwards. And if
getting more money is a matter of political persuasion, perhaps
Philadelphia will be better off than most.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in the summer of next year, as the presidential
election looms, Rendell's Philadelphia will play host to the
Republicans' national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to some millennium tourism and perhaps W.C. Fields's
epitaph for himself _ ``I'd rather be in Philadelphia'' _ will not
sound quite so mocking after all. &QL;

   ALTUS, ARK. _ As every oenophile knows, Bill Clinton did not
serve Californian wine at his inauguration. He served Altus
Spumante, which comes from St. Mary's Mountain on the southern
slopes of the Ozarks.
</P>
<P>
   The winery there, in the northwest corner of Arkansas, is the
oldest and largest in the south-central United States.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas was the first Southern state to produce wine and grape
juice commercially, and it still ranks eighth in the country's
grape production.
</P>
<P>
   Four big wineries, with a total storage capacity of 1.2 million
gallons (4.5 million litres), are located there. The state's 12,800
acres (5,180 hectares) of vineyards are so precious that the
federal government in 1984 declared the land an American
Viticultural Area.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the help of new machines developed by researchers at
the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, Arkansas may start to
give better-known wine-producing regions such as California serious
competition.
</P>
<P>
   After three decades of experimenting, Justin Morris, a
researcher, and Tommy Oldridge, a farmer, have created a technology
that mechanizes all aspects of growing grapes from shoot- and
fruit-thinning to training up trellises, leaf removal, pruning and
harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Different grape species have distinctive growth patterns that
require particular sorts of trellis, and the Morris-Oldridge system
has been perfected for the 12 main combinations of grape species
and trellises.
</P>
<P>
   Italian inventors have come close to doing this, but their work
has involved wine grapes only. The Morris-Oldridge system can be
used for both wine and juice grapes, though not for table grapes,
which require more careful handling.
</P>
<P>
   Many vineyard tasks can be handled by machines, but this
invention is unique because it involves one machine with detachable
parts _ rather like a vacuum cleaner with attachments _ that can be
fitted on to a tractor frame. It is also unique in the number of
trellis types it can handle, including the ``lyre'' trellis, which
is U-shaped.
</P>
<P>
   At present, French-American hybrid vineyards are usually thinned
and pruned by hand to ensure a steady fruit load and a consistently
good grape. This takes 25 worker-hours for every acre. If the
Morris-Oldridge machine comes into commercial use, an acre could be
pruned in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, the inventors must get their American and
international patents; and the University of Arkansas, which is
recognized as having one of the best viticulture and oenology
programs east of the Rockies, must find manufacturers for the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   This may take three years. Once the technology is
commercialized, the university_ which employs Morris and is
responsible for the patent work _ will keep 50 percent of the first
$200,000 of royalties and 65 percent of any additional revenue. The
inventors will split the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The invention will no doubt help wineries around the world.
Whether it will help Arkansas's own wine industry depends a lot on
Arkansas itself.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislature had high hopes for its wine industry in
the 1980s. In 1983, Clinton _ then the state's fun-loving young
governor _ established the Arkansas Wine Producers Council to
promote wine-making and research.
</P>
<P>
   But, although the council was meant to get financing by law, no
money has ever gone in _ or out, for that matter. And Arkansans
wanting to pick up a bottle of wine at a grocery store need not
bother to look for one; the state banned wine sales in such stores
in 1981. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Milken, the junk-bond king who once earned
$500 million in a single year, is now building one of the world's
biggest education companies, Knowledge Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a buyout firm that strikes fear into
managers the world over, also owns an education company called
KinderCare.
</P>
<P>
   In Wall Street firms, analysts have taken to issuing breathless
reports making such assertions as ``the education industry is
undergoing a paradigm shift toward privatization and
rationalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is everybody suddenly so excited? Because of the parallels
they see between education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, health care was mostly stuck in the
public and voluntary sectors. Today it is a multibillion dollar,
largely private, industry.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of rich people _ not just Milken and Henry Kravis, but
also Warren Buffett, Paul Allen, John Doerr and Sam Zell _ are
betting that education is moving in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   Companies from a range of conventional industries are investing
in the business, including Sun, Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, Sony,
Harcourt General and the Washington Post group.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that the country spends a total of $635
billion a year on education _ more than it devotes to pensions or
defense _ and predicts that spending per pupil will rise by 40
percent over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies currently have only 13 percent of the market _
mostly in the area of training, and most of them mom-and-pop
companies, ripe for consolidation. But International Data
Corporation, a consultancy, reckons that this share will expand to
25 percent over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the new flood of private money is not going into
private schools, which educate just over 10 percent of America's
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s there was much enthusiasm for private
schools. In 1991 Christopher Whittle, a media entrepreneur, and
Benno Schmidt, a former president of Yale University, founded the
Edison Project, with plans to create a chain of 1,000 for-profit
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But private schools have proved unwelcoming territory. Most
existing ones are impossible to buy because they are run by
charitable boards or controlled by the Catholic Church; and their
endowments, which subsidize fees, make them hard to compete with.
</P>
<P>
   So the new education companies are concentrating instead on
lower-hanging fruit. Supplementary services _ mainly testing,
coaching, training and pre-school education _ are one boom area.
</P>
<P>
   As the income gap between high-school and university graduates
grows, so does parents' determination to get their children into
college. And new research on intellectual development, which
stresses the importance of a child's first three years, is also
leading to a craze for ``smart'' kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan Learning Systems, a Baltimore-based company founded by
two university dropouts, is the market leader. Testing is its most
profitable business, but it also sells tuition and training. It
thrives on synergies between different areas of education: when a
student flunks a test, its coaching arm can offer to help sort out
his problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Sylvan is also venturing into what could become its biggest
market by far: public education. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST 200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America's public schools are increasingly frustrating parents
and falling behind international standards. America spends more of
its GDP on education than most countries, yet it gets mediocre
results.
</P>
<P>
   Children in Asia and Europe often trounce their American
counterparts in standardized scholastic tests. More than 40 percent

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Milken, the junk-bond king who once earned
$500 million in a single year, is now building one of the world's
biggest education companies, Knowledge Universe.
</P>
<P>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a buyout firm that strikes fear into
managers the world over, also owns an education company called
KinderCare.
</P>
<P>
   In Wall Street firms, analysts have taken to issuing breathless
reports making such assertions as ``the education industry is
undergoing a paradigm shift toward privatization and
rationalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Why is everybody suddenly so excited? Because of the parallels
they see between education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, health care was mostly stuck in the
public and voluntary sectors. Today it is a multibillion dollar,
largely private, industry.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of rich people _ not just Milken and Henry Kravis, but
also Warren Buffett, Paul Allen, John Doerr and Sam Zell _ are
betting that education is moving in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   Companies from a range of conventional industries are investing
in the business, including Sun, Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, Sony,
Harcourt General and the Washington Post group.
</P>
<P>
   The government says that the country spends a total of $635
billion a year on education _ more than it devotes to pensions or
defense _ and predicts that spending per pupil will rise by 40
percent over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies currently have only 13 percent of the market _
mostly in the area of training, and most of them mom-and-pop
companies, ripe for consolidation. But International Data
Corporation, a consultancy, reckons that this share will expand to
25 percent over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the new flood of private money is not going into
private schools, which educate just over 10 percent of America's
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s there was much enthusiasm for private
schools. In 1991 Christopher Whittle, a media entrepreneur, and
Benno Schmidt, a former president of Yale University, founded the
Edison Project, with plans to create a chain of 1,000 for-profit
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But private schools have proved unwelcoming territory. Most
existing ones are impossible to buy because they are run by
charitable boards or controlled by the Catholic Church; and their
endowments, which subsidize fees, make them hard to compete with.
</P>
<P>
   So the new education companies are concentrating instead on
lower-hanging fruit. Supplementary services _ mainly testing,
coaching, training and pre-school education _ are one boom area.
</P>
<P>
   As the income gap between high-school and university graduates
grows, so does parents' determination to get their children into
college. And new research on intellectual development, which
stresses the importance of a child's first three years, is also
leading to a craze for ``smart'' kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan Learning Systems, a Baltimore-based company founded by
two university dropouts, is the market leader. Testing is its most
profitable business, but it also sells tuition and training. It
thrives on synergies between different areas of education: when a
student flunks a test, its coaching arm can offer to help sort out
his problems.
</P>
<P>
   But Sylvan is also venturing into what could become its biggest
market by far: public education. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST 200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America's public schools are increasingly frustrating parents
and falling behind international standards. America spends more of
its GDP on education than most countries, yet it gets mediocre
results.
</P>
<P>
   Children in Asia and Europe often trounce their American
counterparts in standardized scholastic tests. More than 40 percent
of American ten-year-olds cannot pass a basic reading test; as many
as 42 million adults are functionally illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for this dismal performance is that close to
half the $6,500 spent on each child is eaten up by
``non-instructional services'' _ mostly administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now the barriers between public and private sectors are eroding,
allowing entrepreneurs into the state system. The 1,128 (and
growing) ``charter schools'' are free to experiment with private
management without losing public money.
</P>
<P>
   Some school boards that have contracted out peripheral services
have been so impressed by the results that they are starting to
apply the principle to teaching itself.

to provide a cradle-to-grave service.
</P>
<P>
   In just 30 months he and his partners _ his brother Lowell and

<P>
   DELHI _ Stepping out of the smog and chaos of Gurgaon, a
commercial outpost of Delhi, and into GE Capital's ``international
services'' division is like crossing several time zones.
</P>
<P>
   The cubicles are techno-anonymous, not Indian drab. The faces
and dress are Indian, but the lingo is American: GE's bright
twentysomethings talk of mortgages as fluently as if they were
scouting for picket-fenced property themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The voices at the other end of the telephones are American, too,
explaining how credit-card accounts will be brought up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes India intrudes. The lights go out when the local
supply fails, but the computers keep glowing and within seconds
they flicker back on again. GE has three generators to ensure they
do.
</P>
<P>
   This is all part of what a local business magazine calls India's
``hottest business opportunity,'' a belated chance to match China's
splash on the world market.
</P>
<P>
   The product is not toys or trainers but information. It usually
originates in America and Europe, is beamed or shipped to India to
be chopped, reconciled, responded to or corrected, and is then
beamed back again.
</P>
<P>
   Remote services may be a market in which India can beat the
world. It has a vast population, rock-bottom wages and a good grasp
of English. At present, some 25,000 Indians are employed in remote
services, reckons the National Association of Software and Service
Companies (NASSCOM).
</P>
<P>
   McKinsey, a consultancy, thinks that number will rise to 1
million-3 million people within the next ten years. ``We're on the
cusp of something major,'' says McKinsey's remote-services guru,
Anil Kumar.
</P>
<P>
   Software showed the way. India has been writing and debugging
code for the world for over a decade, and it is now busy fighting
the millennium-bug menace.
</P>
<P>
   Software exports are worth $2.7 billion a year. Remote services
_ using software rather than writing it _ could some day make that
seem small change.
</P>
<P>
   The work ranges from typing in telephone-directory entries to
conducting basic research, and everything in between. It is mostly
stuff that is too routine for expensive western workers, who could
be serving customers directly; but not so repetitive that machines
can do it.
</P>
<P>
   Western companies with big back offices are setting up
operations in India, or hiring Indian-based firms to do the work
for them.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways's two-year-old World Network Services, based in
Mumbai, handles an array of back-office jobs for its parent and
other airlines, including dealing with errors that pop up in
automatic reservation systems and keeping track of frequent-flier
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Selectronic, a two-year-old firm in Delhi, plucks doctors'
dictation from a toll-free number, transcribes the recordings and
sends the results back as text to an American HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Although they serve so many different industries, such firms
have a lot in common. Their growth rates are startling: BA's
operation has grown to 750 in two years and it is hiring 800 more
workers for a new office in Pune. GE grew from 50 to 700 employees
during 1998 and is adding workers at a rate of 100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural fusion is another common feature. Since these companies
are outposts of American or British firms and adhere to their
standards, they must master not only unfamiliar terms but also the
mind-set behind them.
</P>
<P>
   At Selectronic, a six-month training course in American medical
terminology is supplemented with group viewings of the television
programs, ``Chicago Hope'' and ``ER,'' accompanied by take-out
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in some ways the atmosphere remains resolutely Indian. These
data-workers are not rootless part-timers, as their American
equivalents might be. Many expect their employers to treat them
like family members, providing transport to and from work, company
cricket games and jobs for life. Indian law makes it hard to do
anything less.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it all worthwhile is India's cheap, high-quality
labor. Although half the population is illiterate, India's
universities produce roughly 2 million degree-holders every year,
most of whom have some facility in English.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those employed in the remote-services business would be
deemed overqualified in the West. A certified public accountant
working on account reconciliation costs GE $15,000-20,000 a year.
In America, a less qualified worker doing the same job would cost
up to three times as much. Pramod Bhasin, head of GE Capital's
Indian operation, expects to save his employer some $10 million
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the software business, India's other world-class
industry, remote services do not employ only the highly educated.
Selectronic recruits from its lower-middle-class Delhi
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Its employees may speak English less fluently than GE's, but
Selectronic compensates with rigorous training and a checking
process that vets every one of the 1.3 million lines of
transcription the company produces monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Back-office work makes up the bulk of the business, but remote
services range beyond that. Bechtel, an American company, has a
team of engineers in Gurgaon working on construction projects
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Delhi is the home of McKinsey's ``knowledge center,'' which does
research for the rest of the far-flung company. Pfizer and
Quintiles, two American health-care firms, find India's crowded
hospitals ideal venues for conducting cheap trials of new drugs
(strictly to international ethical standards, they insist).
</P>
<P>
   Decision Support International distributes financial data,
telephone books and college catalogues to tiny, independent data
factories across Delhi and Madras, where they are fed into
computers and rearranged into new products for sale by its mostly
American customers.
</P>
<P>
   McKinsey reckons this business will be worth $50 billion by
2010. What could stop this happening? The price of telecoms,
several times American and European levels. Unless rates come down,
India will lose out on call centers, a business that is expected to
grow fast.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry is stifling bureaucracy and regulation, especially
laws that make it hard to sack workers. A number of firms have
failed because their work forces became bloated and inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   Automation also looks a threat, but may prove an opportunity.
The more information that is collected by machines, the more errors
creep in that need human intervention. BA found that customers were
offended by machine-generated letters. Now it customizes them in
India.
</P>
<P>
   The government knows it is on to a good thing. Last July it said
it would exempt remote services' export earnings from corporate
tax, putting the business on the same footing as software.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's best hope is a big effort by the government to
free it from the regulations that killed manufacturing exports at
birth. &QL;

DOCTORS FEAR AMERICANS' SWEET TOOTH ITS GETTING TOO BIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Donna Purnomo, a baker and restaurant owner, has
a serious sweet tooth. ``Your headline ought to read, `To some,
sugar is as addictive as heroin,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Purnomo, 45, can't resist the taste of sugar, especially when
combined with butter or other fats. ``Warm, chewy cookies, what
could be better?''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that once she starts eating, she finds it hard to
stop. ``Yesterday, I did pretty well. I made it through last night
and then there was a certain `cinnabun' calling me,'' she said.
``It's almost like some sort of demonic possession.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't realize how hooked they are. Some estimates
have placed the amount of sugar consumed by the average American at
134 pounds per year _ a pound of sugar every three days.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds impossible, consider that sugar often arrives
unnoticed in many processed foods. Besides the obvious culprits
like soda, candy, cakes and pies, sugar is found in breakfast
cereals, ketchup, fruit juices, salad dressing, yogurt, peanut
butter and bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sugar problem in this country is as bad as the fat
problem,'' said Dr. Thomas Yannios, a clinical nutritionist and
critical care specialist at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y.
Besides obesity and dental decay, too much sugar can set the stage
for other problems, including diabetes and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Yannios and other doctors argue that the sugar craze is getting
even worse because of the national obsession with low-fat foods.
All those so-called healthier snacks often add sugar to improve
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   But too much sugar gets stored as fat. The result is many people
aren't losing weight, lowering their cholesterol or reducing their
risk for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole low-fat craze is, in some ways, duping an
unsuspecting public,'' said Dr. Kenneth Bock, director of the
Center for Progressive Medicine in Albany. ``The public is not
being educated enough about the need to stay away from sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happens when you drink a soda or eat a low-fat
brownie: The sugar gets absorbed very rapidly into your system.
Your blood sugar soars. The body responds by releasing insulin _
the hormone responsible for regulating blood-sugar levels and for
transporting glucose molecules into the body's cells.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the body store excess sugar as fat, but as Dr.
Yannios explains: ``If insulin is circulating in the blood, it
inhibits you from releasing fat from your cells.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a very simple explanation for a complex metabolic
process.
</P>
<P>
   Purnomo has experienced some of the side-effects of the too much
sugar, such as weight gain and low energy. She also knows how she
feels when she cuts out sweets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm three times as productive when I'm not eating sugar,'' she
said. ``I always feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's not easy to kick the sugar habit, despite
the best medical advice: ``People should simply stay away from
simple sugars. They're not good for you,'' Bock said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also other sugars to worry about, like carbohydrates.
Besides getting rid of the sweets, people should also think about
what kinds of carbohydrates they're eating.
</P>
<P>
   Many commercially prepared breads and crackers are made of white
flour, a food that also causes insulin levels to rise.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done? Avoid the obvious soda, cookies, candy and
pastries. When shopping for breads, pastas or cereals, opt for
whole-grain varieties.
</P>
<P>
   With oatmeal, go for quick oats rather than instant varieties
with added sugar and flavors. That saves a lot of empty and
potentially harmful calories.
</P>
<P>
   As Purnomo knows, however, giving up sugar can be a challenge.
Bock describes it as a process similar to withdrawing from
caffeine, complete with headaches, fatigue and lightheadedness.
``But once you get through that, you'll feel better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Purnomo was up to the challenge, at least on a recent morning.
``Today is zero tolerance for sugar, fat,'' she said. But she's
also dreaming about a day when her sweet cravings might simply
vanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can put a man on the moon, why can't the medical
community come up with something to make that go away?''

   FRANCE-THREE-STARS (Paris) _ Starting up and running a
three-star restaurant is an astonishingly expensive proposition. A
typical three-star restaurant has two employees for every guest.
And with France's heavy taxes and formidable social charges, even
lunch and dinner bills of up to $500 per person fail to cover
costs. A debate is simmering in France over just how much trouble
the 21 three-star restaurants are in. How creative _ not just in
their cooking, but in their financing _ do chefs have to be, merely
to survive? Many now have backers; one is even going public. Will
the wildly escalating costs of running these establishments drive
the best and the brightest elsewhere? By Frank J. Prial.

Most people _ and that includes many chefs _ don't bother making

Confident cooks have known for years how to take a can of chicken
broth, a bouillon cube or even a cup of water and make the most of
it. And no apologies are necessary; it's still real cooking. Even
the best chefs will tell you so. By Mark Bittman.

people are confused about what an aperitif is and what it is

 &HT;    AS OF TODAY, GORE'S PRESIDENTIAL HORIZONS EXPAND
 &HT;    240&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stroke of noon Wednesday marks the point at
which Vice President Al Gore could, in theory, become the
longest-serving president of the United States since Franklin
Delano Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Noon on Jan. 20 marks the halfway point in President Clinton's
second term. Should Clinton resign or be removed from office by the
Senate any time thereafter, Gore would be allowed to seek two
presidential terms on his own after serving the remainder of
Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could end up serving nearly 10 years as president, second
only to Roosevelt, who was elected four times and served 12 years
and 39 days, dying in office in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically, it's a constitutional possibility,'' said
Thomas Neale, author of a recent Congressional Research Service
report on presidential succession.
</P>
<P>
   Had Clinton resigned or been convicted by the Senate on
impeachment charges prior to noon Jan. 20, Gore would have been
limited to election to only one full term after completing
Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
   The limitation is placed by the 22nd Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution. It states that ``no personal shall be elected to the
office of the president more than twice, and no person who has held
the office of president, or acted as president, for more than two
years of a term to which some other person was elected president
shall be elected to the office of the president more than once.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was proposed by a new Republican majority Congress
in 1947 specifically in response to Roosevelt's lengthy service in
the White House. Prior to Roosevelt, there was no prohibition on
the number of terms a person could serve as president, although the
practice was two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Since the amendment was ratified in 1951, only one vice
president who has had to complete a presidential term has fallen
under its prohibition: Gerald Ford, who succeeded Richard Nixon in
1974 with two years and five months remaining in Nixon's term. Only
15 months remained in John Kennedy's term when, upon his
assassination in 1963, Lyndon Johnson became president.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Truman, who succeeded Roosevelt, was specifically exempted
from the prohibition when the amendment was passed by Congress in
1947.

ANCHORMEN JENNINGS, BROKAW WEIGH IN WITH DIFFERENT TAKES ON 20TH
CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent whisper in publishing circles was that the bloom is off
the rose for celebrity-bylined books.
</P>
<P>
   Against this trend, here are Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings atop
the national sales chart for nonfiction. That Brokaw has a strong
grip on the lead position does not indicate a preference for NBC
over ABC. Nor are these superstar anchormen in direct competition,
because their books are quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation'' and Jennings' ``The
Century'' are big guns at Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble and in
lame-duck mom-and-pop bookstores nationwide. Surely this owes much
to their authors' household-name status.
</P>
<P>
   This is a certainty in Jennings' case, because the oversized
volume he has produced in collaboration with Todd Brewster is only
one of several current and soon forthcoming celebrations of the
entire 20th century; and although it is probably the best of the
lot, its $60 price tag would render bestsellerdom unlikely without
the impetus of a ``name'' author.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Century'' is by definition a gift book, a spectacular item
for the coffee table. Its festival of photographs makes it a visual
treat, but this aspect overpowers the substantial text. It's
likely, then, that although the work is purchased because of the
Jennings name, most consumers will flip through the pages, absorb
the pictures and captions, and pass over a text that is admirable
in any literary measure.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings in his 35 years of broadcast journalism has covered and
reported most or all of the more recent events in this visual
documentary whose co-written prose has a kind of valentine
resolution. Although social currents are noted along the way, ``The
Century'' makes no qualitative distinction between ``generations''
and does not register as a work of social criticism. In a subtle
way, Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation'' does.
</P>
<P>
   The Brokaw number retails at $24.95, and although it offers a
smattering of portrait photographs of his profile subjects (some of
the then-and-now kind), it is a book designed to be read, with text
running almost to 400 pages. Furthermore, its strong editorial
thesis is informed by solid and occasionally brilliant writing.
</P>
<P>
   Although longtime NBC anchor Brokaw customarily reports news in
sentences devised by others, he is rated by many colleagues as the
most literary broadcast journalist since the late Eric Sevareid.
Brokaw's creative flair has been evident both in written (his ``To
Be an American'' TV special) and oral presentations (his famous
``conversation'' with Mikhail Gorbachev).
</P>
<P>
   Surprise may be registered that ``The Greatest Generation'' is
Brokaw's first book. Other books may be the issue of his eventual
twilight years, when he may again be allured by a strong theme. The
bestseller of the moment definitely is a response to inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw was born in South Dakota on Feb. 6, 1940, so he'll
enter his 59th year three weeks hence. The generation earning his
designation as ``greatest'' is roughly that of his own parents.
</P>
<P>
   These are the people who, via Brokaw's eloquence, ``... came of
age during the Great Depression and the Second World War and went
on to build modern America _ men and women whose everyday lives of
duty, honor, achievement and courage gave us the world we have
today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the war was over, the men and women who had been involved
... were mature beyond their years, tempered by what they had been
through. They married in record numbers and gave birth to another
distinctive generation, the baby boomers. They became part of the
greatest investment in higher education that any society ever made.
They left campuses with degrees and a determination to make up for
lost time. They helped convert a wartime economy into the most
powerful peacetime economy in history. They made breakthroughs in
medicine and other sciences. They gave the world new art and
literature. They came to understand the need for federal civil
rights legislation. They gave America Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the postwar achievements of his subjects are dutifully
reported, the main focus of ``The Greatest Generation'' is the
experience of World War II. It is largely a work of oral history
and belongs on the shelf next to Studs Terkel's ``The Good War,''
an ironic title adorned by quotation marks that give the lie to
goodness in any war.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw would agree with Terkel on that point, but would more
easily subscribe to the necessity and the just cause of the war
against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brokaw's heroes and heroines are the people who met the test
of war _ the terror, the carnage, the specter of death _ without a
whine or a whimper, but with courage that underscored a national
code of honor. Like every valid book (or play, or movie) about war,
``The Greatest Generation'' is an antiwar book, but with a
substance of responsible patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people brought to life in Brokaw's text are
household names, like the author himself. One of the war heroes is
a future president of the United States _ George Bush. Another is a
longtime distinguished senator and failed candidate for the
presidency _ Bob Dole. Sens. Mark Hatfield and Daniel Inouye,
former Cabinet members Caspar Weinberger and George Shultz,
humorist Art Buchwald, Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee,
historian Arthur Schlesinger, journalist Andy Rooney: all are met
in their not-yet-famous youth, along with one Julia Child of the
Office of Strategic Services (forerunner of the CIA).
</P>
<P>
   However, a majority in Brokaw's roll call are ``ordinary
people'' (one of his chapter headings). Two of his subjects were
awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Heroes of the home front
are not ignored.
</P>
<P>
   One dictionary definition of generation is ``the time interval
between the birth of parents and the birth of their offspring.'' By
that reckoning, two generations have now followed the cycle
identified by Brokaw as the greatest. So is Brokaw's own generation
and the one succeeding it inferior simply because it has not been
challenged by major economic depression and all-out war?
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw doesn't ask the question, but the reader wonders. Have
today's younger Americans lost their patriotic resolve? Is the code
of honor that motivated a ``greatest'' generation now obsolete? And
if tested similarly, are we now too soft to contend?

CANNED STOCK: GETTING OVER THE GUILT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's finally face the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Most people _ and that includes many professional cooks _ don't
bother making their own chicken stock, despite the constant urgings
from too many culinary mandarins that it's the only legitimate way
to go.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just that making chicken stock is time consuming (it
is), or that it requires too much planning (it does), but that even
when you (italics)do(end italics) make stock, it always runs out in
a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   So what most of us really do is read that line in the recipe
that says ``2 cups of good chicken stock,'' reach for the can and
try to quell the shame, as if the dish will surely be a fraud.
(Maybe no one will notice _ quick, hide the empty can!)
</P>
<P>
   If you're among the abashed, buck up. There are worse sins.
Confident cooks have known for years how to take a can of chicken
broth, a bouillon cube, or even a cup of water, and make the most
of it. No apologies. It's still genuine cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best chefs will tell you so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 66 years old, and I've never made stock at home in my
life,'' said Andre Soltner, the former chef of Lutece and one of
the deans of French cooking in New York. ``The same is true of most
chefs, although they won't admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Rosenzweig, the chef of the Lobster Club in Manhattan,
makes a turkey meatball soup that begins with canned stock. ``I
treat it almost like water,'' she said, ``and add the kinds of
things that will transform it _ cilantro, garlic, ginger, cabbage.
All I want from the stock is a little bit of flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock is like any other ingredient,'' she continued. ``When
it's great, you let it shine. But when it isn't great, you enhance
it as much as you can. When I must, I start with canned stock that
has some fat in it _ a lot of the flavor is in the fat _ and use it
as a vehicle for other flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock _ the essence of meat and vegetables made liquid after a
couple of hours' simmering _ is the base of much classic cuisine.
In today's home cooking, not only soups but also reduction sauces,
risotto and many low-fat preparations rely on stock for much of
their flavor. (The words ``stock'' and ``broth'' tend to be used
interchangeably.)
</P>
<P>
   The stock used in most recipes is ``white'' stock, in which the
ingredients are simply simmered in water to cover; ``brown'' stock
is somewhat more complicated to make and begins with roasting meat
and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   To get a good white stock, the home cook has three choices: make
it yourself, spend $4 a pint for premium canned or frozen stock, or
figure out how to exploit the benefits of a halfway decent canned
stock sold in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem lies in defining ``halfway decent.'' When I
tasted 17 brands of store-bought stocks, I found only two that I
would consider using _ Arrowhead Mills All Natural Chicken Broth
and Perfect Addition All Natural Rich Chicken Stock. But many
accomplished cooks, including some of New York's top chefs, seem to
be more forgiving than I.
</P>
<P>
   The home cook in search of convenience as well as excellence
should look to the basics of chicken stock for the secrets to
enhancing a store-bought one. Real chicken stock is made from meat,
bones and aromatics, which can mean just about anything, but
usually includes carrot, onion and perhaps celery.
</P>
<P>
   Meat gives good flavor and, to some extent, so do bones. But
bones, which add body to stocks, cannot take the place of meat.
(``You make a stock of bones, it tastes like bones,'' Jean-Georges
Vongerichten, the chef at Jean Georges, once said to me. ``The best
stocks taste like meat.'')
</P>
<P>
   Whether the ingredients list of a store-bought stock begins with
salt, sugar and monosodium glutamate, or water and chicken, it can
be improved by the addition of wing tips, back, neck and other
chicken trimmings, along with some of those magical aromatics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All stock is a combination of flavors,'' said Monika Caha, the
chef at the Bistro in Manhattan. ``You can take anything, even a
bouillon cube, and turn it into something flavorful by adding some
fresh ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Aronson, who wrote ``The Bowl Food Cookbook'' (Workman,
1999) with Elizabeth Simon, said that there are even easier fixes
than simmering vegetables. ``We use a couple of different spice
bundles, sachets of common spices tied in cheesecloth,'' she said.
``In fact, you can put together many different combinations of
spices and herbs, and improve canned stock.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much effort or many ingredients to make a tasty
broth and it can be done in just a fraction of the time required by
starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   My preference is to begin with canned stock and simmer it for 10
or 20 minutes with an onion (you needn't bother to peel it), a
carrot and a clove of garlic. Some herbs, a bay leaf and a few
peppercorns will make it even better.
</P>
<P>
   After that, use your judgment, depending on the subsequent use
of the stock, how much personality you want to add and how
inventive you're feeling: parsley and celery are usually good
choices; ginger, scallions and a dash of soy are great in stocks
destined for Asian dishes; a bit of thyme or rosemary might be
useful, and a few dried mushrooms (or trimmings from fresh ones)
can add a huge flavor boost.
</P>
<P>
   Any chicken or meat trimmings or bones, or even a little fat,
will enrich the broth. Of course, some actual meat is a bonus. And
small amounts of seaweed, especially kelp (also called kombu) can
add good flavor, especially when there will be some seafood in the
final dish.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these ingredients can be scraps or leftovers _ parsley
stems, celery leaves, chicken trimmings or bones. ``I keep a bowl
in front of me while I'm preparing a meal,'' Jacques Pepin, the
chef, author and television cooking show host, said. ``And I put in
it the trimmings from onions, carrots, tomatoes and so on. When I'm
done, I freeze that, and use it to boost stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Soltner, who doesn't worry about boosting
canned stock at all. He just adds a cup of water to the browned
bits left after sauteeing meat and vegetables for a reduction
sauce, or a few cups to well-browned meat and vegetables to make a
quick soup. ``If I feel the taste needs a little nudge, I'll add a
piece of a bouillon cube,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One last note: Reducing store-bought stock, as you do
automatically when you make a risotto, is also a good technique for
intensifying flavor. But be careful of stocks that are salty to
begin with, because reducing them may leave you with a liquid that
tastes of nothing so much as salt.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Many chefs prefer salt-free stocks for that reason. But once
you've tasted salt-free stock, you may find, like Soltner, that you
too prefer water.

   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In tasting 17 commercial stocks, I found only two that could
substitute admirably for a quickly made chicken broth and two that
were nearly as good. The others, though far less costly, suffered
by comparison. Most of those in the ``acceptable'' category will
give good results if enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these stocks could be labeled ``all natural.'' In fact,
many are laden with either artificial ingredients or additives like
sugar and monosodium glutamate that have no place in homemade
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Within each category, stocks are listed in alphabetical order. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Very Good
</P>
<P>
   ARROWHEAD MILLS ALL NATURAL CHICKEN BROTH, 14.25-ounce can,
$5.61 a pint. Lacks intensity, but clean-tasting and clearly made
with chicken (the label boasts free range). Excellent for risotto,
very good for soups.
</P>
<P>
   PERFECT ADDITION ALL NATURAL RICH CHICKEN STOCK, 8-ounce
container, $4.25 a pint. Sold frozen. Can be diluted by a factor of
one or two. Good, clean flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Good
</P>
<P>
   MORE THAN GOURMET GLACE DE POULET GOLD, 1.5-ounce package, $2.50
a pint. Can be diluted by a factor of 20 to make about a quart of
pretty good stock, but at higher concentrations it is downright
powerful. Not as clean a flavor as the best store-bought stocks.
</P>
<P>
   PACIFIC FOODS OF OREGON ORGANIC VEGETABLE BROTH, 32-ounce
vacuum-packed cardboard container, $2 a pint. A
better-than-acceptable shortcut, like a mixed vegetable soup, with
no off flavors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Acceptable
</P>
<P>
   KNORR CONCENTRATED CHICKEN BROTH FLAVOR, 4.2-ounce bottle, 50
cents a pint. Not especially convenient _ the concentrate is too
thick to pour from the bottle, and the neck is too thin for a spoon
_ but it has decent flavor, especially at higher-than-recommended
concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   PROGRESSO CHICKEN BROTH, 16-ounce can, 67 cents a pint. Some
chicken flavor, but very weak.
</P>
<P>
   SWANSON 99 PERCENT FAT FREE CHICKEN BROTH, 32-ounce
vacuum-packed cardboard container, $1 a pint. Decent chicken
flavor, but some off flavors, too.
</P>
<P>
   SWANSON CHICKEN BROTH, 14.5-ounce can, 98 cents a pint. Vague
chicken flavor.
</P>
<P>
   SWANSON NATURAL GOODNESS FAT FREE CHICKEN BROTH, 14.5-ounce can,
98 cents a pint. The best of the fat-free varieties _ you can tell
a chicken was in the vicinity. Unlike the other products in this
category, it contains no monosodium glutamate.
</P>
<P>
   Unacceptable
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE INN CHICKEN BROTH, 14.5-ounce can, 74 cents a pint.
Super-salty, with no flavor of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE INN NO FAT CHICKEN BROTH, 14.5-ounce can, 74 cents a
pint. Some flavor, but again not chicken. Downright bad-tasting.
</P>
<P>
   ELI'S CHICKEN STOCK, 1 pint refrigerated container, $3 a pint.
When an ingredient list reads ``water, chicken bones, celery,
carrot, onion,'' and comes from an upscale retailer, you might
expect some flavor. You'd be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   HERB-OX CHICKEN FLAVOR GRANULATED BOUILLON, 4-ounce jar (makes
28 cups), 14 cents a pint. Absolutely classic bouillon flavor, not
bad for a drink made predominantly of salt and sugar, but little or
no relation to chicken.
</P>
<P>
   HERB-OX VERY LOW SODIUM CHICKEN BOUILLON, 1.2-ounce package of
eight packets, 30 cents a pint. Might pass for celery stock, but
certainly not chicken stock.
</P>
<P>
   KITCHEN BASICS REAL CHICKEN STOCK, 12-ounce vacuum-packed
cardboard container, $1.72 a pint. It may be ``cooked for over four
hours'' as ``in the spirit of the great French chef Escoffier,''
but you couldn't tell by the weird flavor and smell. All natural
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   KNORR CHICKEN BOUILLON, 2.5-ounce package of six cubes, 25 cents
a pint. Exactly what you would expect from a product whose first
ingredient is salt and econd is monosodium glutamate: It's tasty,
but just exactly what taste is that?
</P>
<P>
   PRITIKIN FAT FREE CHICKEN BROTH, 14.5-ounce can, $1.97 a pint.
Fat-free and flavor-free, just like water. But far more expensive. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   &UR; Muscovado Sugar &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have several recipes that call for muscovado sugar. What is
it, and where can I buy it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Muscovado is a minimally refined brown sugar similar to the
better-known Demerara and turbinado sugars. Unlike supermarket
brown sugar, which is refined white sugar darkened and flavored
with molasses, these sugars have not been stripped of their natural
molasses and therefore have distinctive, earthy flavors. They are
commonly known as raw sugars.
</P>
<P>
   The darkest and most intense of the three, muscovado has a
sticky, candylike texture and an intense, bittersweet taste
reminiscent of dark molasses and burnt-sugar caramel. In contrast,
Demerara and turbinado sugar both have a pale, sandy color, subtle
flavor, and free-flowing large sugar crystals. These two can be
used interchangeably, though Demerara has a bit more flavor.
Turbinado, the lighter of the two in color and flavor, is sold
under the brand name Sugar in the Raw, and is commonly offered as a
substitute for white sugar at coffee bars.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes that focus on natural ingredients often call for one
type of raw sugar or another, in order to use a less processed
sweetener. You can also substitute any of these sugars for
supermarket brown sugar in other recipes, although the flavor of
the finished dish will be more robust. Muscovado is especially nice
mixed into gingerbread, chutney and barbecue sauces, while
turbinado and Demerara are good to sprinkle over unbaked shortbread
cookies for an added crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Muscovado sugar, which will be labeled as such, is available in
many health-food stores and specialty shops; it is available by
mail from La Cuisine (800-521-1176; $5 for a one-pound bag).
Demerara and turbinado, often labeled simply ``raw sugar,'' are
available in health-food stores and large supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bugproofing &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Often, packages of flour-based products (flour and pasta in
particular) that I bring home from the store are infested with
little bugs. In the case of flour, I have been throwing the entire
package out. For pasta, I have been boiling the contents and
skimming the dead bugs from the surface. I'm interested in any
health implications. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Though some health professionals might argue that swallowing
a tiny bug or two won't harm you, it is best to get rid of
bug-infested products and try to make your kitchen as bugproof as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Insects usually invade food products in warehouses or stores,
not at the mill or manufacturing plant, especially if the product
is sold in bulk, and is not tightly packaged. If food you have just
bought contains bugs, throw it out or return it to the store. If
you discover bugs in your pantry, check all containers holding
flour, pasta, cereals, grains, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, and even
dry pet food for pests. Discard any infested products, and vacuum
well (throw out the vacuum bag). If the infestation was
particularly severe, you might also want to use a pantry-safe
insecticide spray or set out some natural insect pheromone traps.
You can buy both at Do-It-Yourself Pest Control (www.pantrypest.com
or 800-476-3368; $13.50 for the spray; $5.95 for two traps).
</P>
<P>
   To keep cabinets pest-free, check any newly purchased product
well for bugs (especially if it is natural, organic or purchased in
bulk). If the product seemed clean when you brought it home and
later developed bugs, it was probably housing nearly invisible pest
eggs and larvae.
</P>
<P>
   Store all foods in your cabinets in tightly sealed containers or
jars, to prevent any bugs from spreading. Although some people
swear that adding a bay leaf to the jar deters bugs, I have never
found this to be true.

   Restaurant ranges and refrigerators have already moved into home
kitchens. Now look for electric rotisseries, adapted from the ones
in restaurants, on more counters.
</P>
<P>
   The new appliances stood out at the 1999 International
Housewares Show in Chicago last week. These bulky machines, about
twice the size of a bread maker, cook whole poultry, large cuts of
meat and kabobs on vertical spits.
</P>
<P>
   If they look big on a counter, consider how much space they will
take up in the closet, where they may eventually gather dust. They
retail for $75 to $150.
</P>
<P>
   On the design front at the show, thick, black, easily gripped
rubberized handles seemed to be on every implement, a la Oxo's Good
Grip. What originated to help people with arthritis cope in the
kitchen has gone mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful innovation on display were stainless-steel mixing
bowls with rims that allow them to nest in a saucepan to form a
double boiler. Less valid is the trend toward metal cookware with
glass lids. ``You can see what's inside,'' one manufacturer's
representative explained. Yes, but not when the food is simmering
and steam rises. &QL;

   Le Bec Fin in Philadelphia, one of the country's top
restaurants, is introducing handmade chocolates by Robert Bennett,
the pastry chef, in time for Valentine's Day. Orders must be placed
by Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   These delicious bonbons, which are just sweet enough, include
intense raspberry truffles dusted with pink sugar, dark chocolate
squares with a mousse-like filling, chocolate hearts oozing mellow
caramel, nuggets of slightly crunchy chocolate-robed praline, and
chocolate fruit-and-nut-clusters that the French call mendiants.
</P>
<P>
   The basic assortment is $50 for a one-pound box, not including
shipping. Available by telephone: (215) 567-1000, or at the
restaurant, 1523 Walnut Street in Center City Philadelphia. &QL;

   Defying the weather, Custard Beach has opened a new shop just
off the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center. The original
store on East Eighth Street, where in 1994 Alan Silberman revived
the Coney Island tradition of super-rich, soft frozen custard,
closed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The new place also sells Belgian waffles and Italian ices.
Stores in Grand Central Terminal and in the Newport Mall in New
Jersey are planned.

   Don't blame a return to steak and butter for the demise of
Eating Well magazine after 10 years. Despite a circulation of
650,000, the publisher, Hachette Filipacchi, last week told
Marcelle Langan DiFalco, the editor in chief, and her staff in
Charlotte, Vt., to start cleaning out their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation of its competition, Cooking Light, reached 1.4
million this month, up 50,000 over last year. Eating Well will be
out of business with the March-April issue. It had been losing
money, and several editors said they thought the advertisers wanted
a younger, less middle-of-the-road audience.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's no wonder most people would rather order roast
duck in a restaurant than make it themselves. Even I find it
daunting to roast a duck at home, when there is so much fat, so
much spattering, so much tending and so much cleaning up afterward.
But there is a way to get the taste without the trouble _ by
cooking a magret de canard, a breast of moulard duck. It's as easy
as steak.
</P>
<P>
   Moulard is the breed of duck used for foie gras, and you may be
surprised at how unlike poultry it is: this is red-wine food.
</P>
<P>
   I started cooking it with traditional seasonings, saucing with
peppercorns or wine reductions, and then I started experimenting.
When my craving for Peking duck got serious, I tried five-spice
powder: not bad. Or I gave it a Thai taste with kaffir lime, lemon
grass and Thai basil: also not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Then one of the cooks in my restaurant brought me some terrific
Madras curry powder. It was great with the duck, and it inspired me
to create this dish, in which the breasts are left to season
overnight, with scallions, ginger, garlic and shallots, then rubbed
with the curry powder and quickly sauteed. The Indian flavors are
continued in the Basmati rice pilaf with its raisins and nuts,
cardamom, cinnamon and saffron.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its thick layer of fat and skin, magret de canard
should always be started in a cold pan. Place the breast skin side
down and bring up the heat slowly. The fat melts off while the skin
crisps without curling. Don't overcook: it is best served
medium-rare and always in bias-cut slices.
</P>
<P>
   You should have a game plan for this dish. I start the rice and
then, when it's almost ready, I saute the duck. I've also tried
shortcuts with excellent results: For a quick party dinner, skip
the marinade and just rub the breasts with the curry powder. Serve
with the rice and maybe a spicy chutney.
</P>
<P>
   CURRIED DUCK BREASTS WITH BASMATI PILAF
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes, plus 24 hours for marinating
</P>
<P>
   2 whole moulard duck breasts, with skin
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   6 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   4 large shallots, peeled, trimmed and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce fresh ginger (a piece about } inch long), peeled and
thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon imported Madras curry powder
</P>
<P>
   2 cups imported Basmati rice
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons blanched almond slices
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons skinned pistachios (unsalted, if possible)
</P>
<P>
   { cup finely chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   \ cup seedless golden raisins
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon saffron threads
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground cardamom
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Trim any loose pieces of fat or skin from duck breasts, but
leave the layer of fat and skin attached to the meat. With the
point of a knife, lightly score a crosshatch pattern in the skin of
each breast, taking care not to cut into the meat. In a mixing
bowl, combine scallions, garlic, shallots and ginger. Sprinkle half
this mixture in the bottom of a dish large enough to hold the
breasts in a single layer. Season both sides of the duck breasts
with curry powder, and lay them in the dish. Sprinkle with the
remaining scallion mixture. Cover with plastic wrap, and
refrigerate 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove breasts from refrigerator, and set aside at room
temperature. Rinse rice several times until the water runs clear,
then soak in 3 cups water for 30 minutes. Strain, reserving the
water.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, warm the oil and
add nuts. Stir until nuts are lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. Add
onions to pan, and saute until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add
cinnamon, and saute for 2 minutes. Add rice, and saute until it
begins to brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Add raisins, saffron, cardamom,
milk and the reserved water. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Stir well, then bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover and
simmer for 10 minutes. (Begin to cook the duck while the rice is
simmering.) Reduce heat to its lowest setting, and steam the rice
10 minutes more. Remove pan from heat, and let rice rest, covered,
5 minutes. Remove cinnamon stick. Add nuts, mix lightly and keep
covered until serving.
</P>
<P>
   4. To cook duck: Wipe off marinade and place breasts skin side
down in a cold saute pan. Turn on the heat to medium, and cook
until well-browned, about 10 minutes. Turn, and cook until breasts
are medium-rare in the center, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a
plate, cover loosely with foil and let rest in a warm place for 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   5. To serve, halve the breasts and slice each half diagonally
into slices \ inch thick. Place a sliced half breast on each of
four plates, accompanied by Basmati rice. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

ART-STAGE (LoS Angeles) _ Discussing art is a slippery slope.

sophisticated, educated or erudite you may be. That is what is at
the heart of ``Art'' at the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood. And
Yasmina Reza's Tony-award winning play is every bit as good as the
hype _ witty and wonderfully acted and staged. By Rob Lowman.

MAMET GETS PERSONAL IN TWO ONE-ACT PLAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David Mamet's plays have been called many things.
Macho. Minimalist. Angry. Funny. Brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   One rarely heard epithet, however, is ``autobiographical.''
Although Mamet renders the smarmy con artists, embattled salesmen
and desperate lowlifes who populate his plays with knowing
precision, we rarely sense that these characters are
self-portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's because they seldom utter the kind of soul-rending
confessions we associate with the first-person psychodramas of
Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill. Mamet's characters don't
tell us much about their families or their childhoods. They tend to
be self-contained, focused on the present, their motives frequently
cryptic, their desire for self-knowledge miniscule.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why director Michael Bloom is looking forward
to seeing what happens when ``The Cryptogram'' and ``The Old
Neighborhood,'' two one-act plays regarded as Mamet's most personal
to date, are paired together this month at the Geffen Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   First performed in the mid-1990s, the two short plays can be
seen as a set of thematic book ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cryptogram'' traces a 75-minute journey into a boy's
childhood at a time when his illusion of peace and security is
about to be permanently shattered. Its very literal title derives
from the code language spoken by the combative adults surrounding
the boy, a language whose ominous meanings seem to lie beyond his
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Neighborhood'' _ which itself is a 90-minute triptych
of one-act plays _ also centers on a journey into the past. In it,
the middle-aged Bobby Gould returns to his Chicago hometown to
excavate old friendships and old loves while attempting to chart a
new future. Like the characters in ``The Cryptogram,'' those in
``The Old Neighborhood'' also speak in a highly personalized
language, one often marked by disillusionment and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom thinks the double bill will allow audiences to spot
connections between the boy in ``The Cryptogram'' and the man who
has grown up to be Bobby Gould.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the continuity is really a kind of autobiographical
thread that one can read from `The Cryptogram' through `The Old
Neighborhood,' '' says Bloom, who teaches directing at the
University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was (Carl) Jung who said that men around the age of
40 or more start to go back to their past, look into their past a
little more closely, and examine what connection there might be to
their roots. I think it's a real archetypal journey, and that's
what really intrigued me about `The Old Neighborhood.' Wed
together, these plays give a pretty revealing portrait of a writer
who has not been terribly personally revealing before these
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   To help underscore that continuity, two actors will appear in
both plays. Ed Begley, Jr., will reprise the role of Del, which he
created in the American premiere of ``The Cryptogram'' at the
American Repertory Theatre in Boston, and also play Carl in ``The
Old Neighborhood.'' Christine Dunford, who was Peter Fonda's
drug-addicted sister in ``Ulee's Gold,'' plays Donny in ``The
Cryptogram'' and Deeny in ``The Old Neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Never exactly famous for taking benign views of his subjects,
Mamet startled the theater world with ``The Cryptogram's''
sensitive and sympathetic portrait of the young boy John. In recent
interviews, Mamet has acknowledged (if vaguely) the play's roots in
his own childhood, as the son of brilliant but emotionally abusive
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's tough on the boy, but I think it's basically
compassionate,'' says Bloom, ``and he's tough in the way that the
boy is quite assertive and, one might say, aggressive, because
that's the only way he can really discover the world. And that's
very much the world of the writer, often.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also noticed a greater degree of emotional directness in
``The Old Neighborhood'' than they'd come to expect from the author
of ``American Buffalo'' and ``Glengarry Glen Ross.'' A New York
Times reviewer described the play as Mamet's `most emotionally
accessible drama to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Warmth and fuzziness, of course, aren't the qualities that have
established Mamet as one of the century's most respected and
influential playwrights. It's the deadpan chill of his
profanity-laden humor, the rich spareness of his staccato dialogue
and the cool, cinematic objectivity of his scene construction that
make his voice probably the most recognizable in the American
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet's ability to pare dialogue to the bone and leap directly
into the action of the play allows him to virtually eliminate
exposition, knowing that contemporary audiences catch on quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That talent has helped earn Mamet an enviable dual career in the
theater and Hollywood. With screenplay credits including ``Wag the
Dog,'' ``The Untouchables'' and ``The Verdict,'' plus such films of
his own as ``Homicide,'' ``House of Games'' and ``The Spanish
Prisoner,'' Mamet is the only major American playwright ever to
have enjoyed a successful Hollywood screenwriting career, Bloom
says.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom says he used to think Sam Shepard was the most influential
American playwright of the last 20 years. Now he believes that
Mamet's plays, with their brusque syntax and violent atmospherics,
and the dark, lyrical satires of John Guare (``Six Degrees of
Separation'') have had the most influence on the subsequent
generation of American playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, although Bloom has directed many works by
contemporary playwrights such as Donald Margulies, Anthony Clarvoe
and Jon Robin Baitz, this will be his first Mamet play. Bloom says
he got a feel for the author when they met for the to talk over
lunch last fall in Cambridge, Mass., where Mamet lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves to tell funny stories, he's a real joker. I haven't
been the butt of any practical jokes, but I understand he's one of
the great practical jokers. He's a very funny guy. Very serious and
extremely funny.'' &QL;

ACTORS RELISH CHALLENGE OF MAMET DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every playwright represents a particular challenge
for an actor. David Mamet with his complex cadences, minimum stage
direction and oblique characterization perhaps more so than others.
</P>
<P>
   We recently stopped by the Geffen Playhouse to talk with two of
the actors _ Ed Begley Jr. and Christine Dunford _ currently
puzzling out Mamet's code for their performances in ``The
``Cryptogram'' and the ``The Old Neighbor.'' The pair had just
finished a rehearsal before a preview performance that night when
they graciously took time out to discuss the challenges they face
in performing a Mamet play. Having just worked together on stage,
Begley and Dunford seemed to be on the same wavelength with their
thoughts about the playwright, chiming in with quips right on cue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What attracts you to Mamet's work?
</P>
<P>
   Dunford: I think there is a great muscularity and vigor to the
language that is quite challenging ... and you really have to rise
to the occasion of meeting the vitality in the language. There's a
kind of intellectual rigor you have to have in approaching it
that's really refreshing. I think it uses more of the actor than
most pieces use because your intellect is involved.
</P>
<P>
   ... It's very difficult material. I think if you are true to the
inherent rhythm that the playwright has put down on the page for
you, you wind up finding a performance that surprises you. I think
that a lot of performers try to bend Mamet to their will, and it's
a big mistake. They wind up presenting it in an overly naturalistic
way or heightened way. There's a very delicate balance between
those two poles, and (Mamet) exists in a place that is very
fragile. It's exhausting but challenging to always be trying to
find the place between those two things. I really, really like it.
</P>
<P>
   Begley: I found when I first did a play of David's ... that the
lines are very hard to learn. But once I learned it, it's a song
that is easy to sing. ... You know there's a rhythm to the
language. I find myself in encounters constantly thinking (about
it), say when I deal with clerks (here Begley goes into a cadence)
... ``could ya, could ya, put the, put the money on the counter.''
... The kind of rhythms he puts on the page, I find them constantly
in life ... I find it very real. And also what he does so well we
have in this play.
</P>
<P>
   Dunford: It's almost as if (Mamet's lines) are musically
phrased. When somebody asks us to go back and do a section, we're
always ``No, we can't do it there.'' We know that exact place.
</P>
<P>
   Begley: Return to the coda.
</P>
<P>
   Dunford: It's got to be that exact section because that starts
the beat. And you can't go into the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   Begley: I forgot the syndrome of dealing with life while doing a
Mamet play. I'm constantly snickering in stores and in
conversations with people because it's Mamet-esque.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mamet is known for being enigmatic; as an actor, is it
difficult to understand your character?
</P>
<P>
   Dunford: It's very of funny that the name of this play is ``The
Cryptogram,'' because you could name any Mamet play ``The
Cryptogram,'' because I think investigating as an actor you sit
down and ask, ``What are the clues? Where are they?''
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons to (playwright Harold) Pinter, I think, are
appropriate in that because the language does not rely on
exposition and giving the audience _ in an obvious way _ all the
information. You do get the feeling that it's kind of a voyeuristic
experience watching it, I think, because it is as though the people
seem to be speaking in ordinary terms, even vague terms, but there
is a specificity and it is to be revealed in the process of the
play.
</P>
<P>
   Begley: (In doing the characters), I get all my clues _ there is
plenty of information _ from the dialogue because he does not have
stage directions. ``Enters. Exits. Hand knife.'' That's it. That's
the second act.
</P>
<P>
   Dunford: ``Starts to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Begely: That's as much as my character has, or her character has
in an entire act of the play ... all the clues come from the
dialogue. ... When he needs to be direct, Mamet certainly is. When
he needs to be clear, he is crystal clear. &QL;

COURT REFUSES TO HEAR CHALLENGE TO CALIFORNIA `THREE-STRIKE' LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court rejected a challenge Tuesday to
California's ``three-strikes'' law, which mandates stiffer prison
sentences for repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The law had been attacked by a homeless man named Michael Riggs,
who was sentenced to 25 years to life for stealing a bottle of
vitamins. Riggs said the law violated his Eighth Amendment
protection against cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Only Justice Stephen G. Breyer voted to hear Riggs' appeal,
saying it ``raises a serious question concerning the application of
a `three-strikes' law to what is in essence a petty offense.''
</P>
<P>
   But three other justices said they were reluctant to take the
case because lower courts have not yet ruled on whether the
California statute violates the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is therefore prudent for the court to await review by
others before addressing the issue,'' Justice John Paul Stevens
wrote for himself and Justices David H. Souter and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg. The other five justices did not comment. For the court to
consider an appeal, a yes vote of four justices is required.
</P>
<P>
   Under the California law, people convicted of a third felony
receive the mandatory 25-years-to-life sentence if their first two
felonies were violent crimes such as homicide or assault. But the
third felony may be either violent or nonviolent to trigger the
law, which went into effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Riggs was convicted of petty theft, which because of a
prior conviction became a felony, after shoplifting a bottle of
vitamins from an Albertson's Supermarket in Banning, Calif., a
suburb of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs had been previously convicted of vehicle theft, passing a
check with intent to defraud, attempted burglary, two counts each
of possessing drugs, forgery and receiving stolen property and four
counts of robbery. Of those crimes, two of the robbery counts had
been considered two strikes against Riggs.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal of his third-strike sentence, which he wrote from
prison, Riggs contended that it violated his Fifth Amendment right
to due process of law as well as the Constitution's ban on cruel
and unusual punishment because it was disproportionate to his
crime.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a state appeals court rejected Riggs' argument, and a
year later, the California Supreme Court refused to hear his
challenge to that decision.
</P>
<P>
   In his plea to the Supreme Court, Riggs noted that ``someone who
commits a cold-blooded, premeditated murder with a deadly weapon
receives a maximum sentence of 26 years to life'' and is eligible
for parole after serving 17 years and four months, while he will
not be eligible for parole until he has served 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments to the high court, state prosecutors told the
justices that the California law complies with past high court
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   They cited a 1980 decision in which the court upheld the life
sentence of a Texas man whose three convictions were for credit
card fraud totaling $80, forgery of a $28 check and falsely
obtaining $120.
</P>
<P>
   They also pointed to a 1991 decision in which the court upheld a
life sentence without the possibility of parole for a Michigan man
convicted of possessing a small amount of cocaine. The court said
then that the Constitution bars only those sentences that are
``grossly disproportionate'' to the crime.

PURE PLEASURE IN PINOT NOIR

<P>
   Buena Vista Pinot Noir 1996, Carneros, Calif. About $16.
</P>
<P>
   Some California pinot noirs are selling for $60 and more; a few
are worth it. For the rest, it would be tough to defend their costs
on the basis of quality when compared with this modestly priced
offering from Buena Vista.
</P>
<P>
   The Carneros region, which stretches across the south end of
both Napa and Sonoma, is incontestably one of the best places in
California to grow pinot noir. Buena Vista, with more than 900
acres, is the largest estate winery there, and has more than 160
acres planted in pinot noir.
</P>
<P>
   Spring rains reduced the size of the 1996 crop, but what
survived was mostly high-quality fruit. Two weeks of
lower-than-normal temperatures in August made it possible to keep
the grapes on the vines longer than usual, adding to both flavor
and color.
</P>
<P>
   The wine has good color and a delectable bouquet, although I
didn't get the touch of menthol found by Judy Matulich-Weitz, the
wine maker.
</P>
<P>
   With or without menthol, it is a most attractive pinot noir,
ready to drink now.

THE ESSENCE OF TANGERINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tangerine is a flavor that appeals to all tastes, but it is not
easy to show off in a sauce. While a tablespoon of lemon or lime
juice added at the end of cooking makes its presence felt, a
similar amount of tangerine juice is lost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Just using tangerine juice in quantity is not the answer; it's
simply too thin, too delicate, too ethereal. My goal in making a
sauce that smacked of tangerine, then, was not only to preserve the
fresh and distinctive flavor of the fruit, but also to create
something of substance, something with body, something that would
contribute to the final dish in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   My first idea was to reduce good chicken stock and stir in the
juice. As I suspected, since this is how the sauce for a classic
duck a l'orange is made, the stock provided much-needed body. But
the flavor of the stock became too strong in the reducing; the
sauce tasted of stock more than tangerine.
</P>
<P>
   So I eliminated the stock and simply reduced the juice. Now, the
flavor was terrific, but though the resulting liquid had some body,
it was still not enough. A little butter took care of that, and I
was pleased to discover on tasting that olive oil worked nearly as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem remained: cooking tangerine juice flattens out
the flavor, removing all the high notes. When I stirred in the
fresh, uncooked zest of the fruit, however, the brightness was
restored.
</P>
<P>
   The last hurdle was creating complexity in the sauce. Sweetness,
however appealing, is not enough on its own. There is some acidity
in tangerine juice, of course, but the sauce tasted
one-dimensional. Adding lemon or lime juice only confused matters,
but I found that a few pinches of cayenne _ along with salt, of
course _ did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Coriander seeds add a mysterious if mild flavor and a tiny bit
of crunch, but they are optional.
</P>
<P>
   A herbal garnish is another option, but there are differences
among parsley, cilantro and dill. The addition of any one is a
plus: dill accentuates the sweetness of the tangerine, parsley
offsets it with bitterness and cilantro (especially if there are
coriander seeds in the sauce) makes the entire preparation seem
exotic.
</P>
<P>
   I had originally considered pairing the sauce with pork, since
something about pork and citrus always appeals to me. But the
delicate nature of this sauce makes it best suited to fish, _ and a
mild-flavored one at that.
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly as good with boneless, skinless chicken, and it is
not bad with duck or that pork, although it doesn't stand out as
much. With any of these, serve white rice; its own mildness makes
it the perfect foil, as the juices of the fish or meat mingle with
the tangerine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ROASTED COD WITH TANGERINE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups tangerine juice (from at least 1{ pounds tangerines)
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds cod or other mild white fish
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon coriander seeds, optional
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter (preferred) or olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley, cilantro or dill for garnish, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees; if you have a baking stone,
use it. Finely grate the zest of the tangerines, without grating
any of the bitter white part. (On a good grater, you should be able
to get away with one swipe per section of skin, rather than rubbing
over and over.) Set aside. Juice the tangerines, and measure 1\
cups of the juice. Set the juice in a small saucepan over
medium-high heat, bring to a boil and reduce, stirring
occasionally, to about { cup; this will take at least 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place a large ovenproof skillet, preferably nonstick, over
high heat, and add the tablespoon of olive oil. If necessary, cut
the cod into serving pieces so it will fit into the skillet. When
the oil smokes, pour out any excess. (You need only a film.) Add
the fish and put the skillet in the oven; set a timer for 6
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. The fish is done when it offers little or no resistance when
a thin-bladed knife passes through it and when the flesh is opaque,
or nearly so, throughout. Unless unusually thick, it will be done
in about 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. While the fish is cooking, season the tangerine sauce with
salt and cayenne; it should have something of a bite. Add the
coriander, if you choose. Whisk in the butter or oil a little at a
time, until the sauce is smooth and thick. Taste, adjust seasoning
and add the grated zest; cook 15 seconds longer. Serve the fish
with the sauce spooned over it, and garnish with the herb.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   Indeed, it's rare parents who haven't shaken their heads in
dismay upon hearing the lyrics of some of today's popular tunes.
That's if you can even understand what the singers are saying. I
hate to admit it, but I have listened to entire selections of rap
and hard rock without being able to decipher one entire phrase. My
instincts tell me that I might be better off not knowing, in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
   I really am not sure that these artists are singing faster or
less coherently; it's possible that age has slowed my hearing down.
Anyway, I miss my good old days. I don't say THE good old days,
because your good old days may be totally different from mine. I
miss those sweet, simple, innocent lyrics sung solo or in
three-part harmony.
</P>
<P>
   For example, do you remember that sweet love song that said,
``Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near? Just like
me, they long to be, close to you. That is why all the guys in
town, follow you all around. Just like me, they long to be close to
you. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh close to you,'' and so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   What a nice song. It was romantic and easy to understand. There
was nothing abnormal or immoral about a song like that.
</P>
<P>
   Except, well, why would birds just appear like that every time
someone came outside?
</P>
<P>
   That is sort of weird, you know. I've seen what birds do to a
car. I hate to even think about a flock of them following me around
everywhere, but I'm sure it was strictly metaphorical. I hope so
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you gotta wonder about a woman who has every guy in
town following her around.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of woman is she? Where is this town? Doesn't anyone
work? They should be trying to do something about those pesky
birds. Maybe it was a town in the wild, wild west and there weren't
many women around.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmmm. I may have to rethink this music issue. Let me get back
to you.
</P>
<P>
   I've gotta go feed my birds.

IF OPRAH PICKS YOUR BOOK ...

<TEXT>
<P>
   What's it like to be touched by an Oprah?
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you're Oklahoma author Billie Letts. Here's how it
happened to you.
</P>
<P>
   You wrote this book in 1995 and it did OK, but it was no New
York Times bestseller, and then one day, on the Friday after
Thanksgiving in 1998, you're home alone and it's late afternoon and
the telephone rings.
</P>
<P>
   The caller says her boss wants to talk to you, so you hold the
line to see if it's true, and when they patch you through and you
hear the voice, you know it's her.
</P>
<P>
   She calls you by name. She says, ``Hi, Billie. This is Oprah
Winfrey. Congratulations.'' She has selected your book for her
club.
</P>
<P>
   You blather about your dogs and you apologize for blathering and
before you know it, your five minutes with Oprah are over. You call
your husband, you tell your sons and you vow to Oprah's people not
to tell another soul until Dec. 7, when you sit in front of the TV
and there she is, holding up your book, ``Where the Heart Is.''
</P>
<P>
   You cheer. You cry. You eat out for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy people call you the next day. They are old friends and
former students and reporters. One of them asks if you have a photo
from your days as a roller-skating carhop. You are 60 years old.
You say no.
</P>
<P>
   You get another telephone call a few days later. It's author
Alice Hoffman. She's calling to say relax, enjoy the ride; she's
calling you because author Wally Lamb called after Oprah selected
her book.
</P>
<P>
   Then Oprah comes to Durant, Okla. Well, not Oprah herself, but a
producer, a sound man, a cameraman and more equipment than you have
ever seen here in your town on the Texas border. They film the
peanut monument at the courthouse. They film the Old Faces, Upper
Crust Cafe. They film your house, so you have a friend bring over
some plants to brighten things up.
</P>
<P>
   Then Oprah calls you to Chicago. You know this means your month
in the sun is ending. You know the time is nearing for another
author and another announcement. You don't mind.
</P>
<P>
   Your book is on the bestseller lists in the Los Angeles Times,
USA Today, and the one place you never expected to see it: The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``So yes,'' you say. ``Oprah still has the touch. And I'm glad
she touched me.''

A SURE CURE FOR BORDEAUX STICKER SHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best 1996 Bordeaux wines are being bottled right now, the
1997s are still maturing in barrels and the 1998s are almost ready
for blending. In a few months, the most famous first-growth
chateaus will announce their prices for the 1998 vintage, to be
delivered in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   No one is expecting any surprises: even if prices stay at
current levels, they will be exceptionally high. And annual price
increases have become the norm in Bordeaux in recent years,
regardless of the quality of the vintage.
</P>
<P>
   For investors and collectors, these increases are no more than a
minor annoyance, since their wines will probably be worth even more
10 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   But for the average wine drinker, it would seem that these high
prices would put good Bordeaux totally out of reach. Actually, they
merely pose a challenge _ to find good Bordeaux for a reasonable
cost. Happily, that is not so difficult to do.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the staggering prices of the most famous
Bordeaux do reflect production costs and the intrinsic quality of
the wines. But mostly they reflect the laws of supply and demand.
Most of the top-name chateaus make fewer than 30,000 cases a year _
a huge amount compared with production at Burgundy estates and the
cult California wineries, but still hardly enough to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are hundreds of chateaus in Bordeaux not part of this
special market. Their prices are far more reasonable and more
closely reflect their costs.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many of these non-first-growth wines are from the
fine 1995 vintage _ the one that Chateau Margaux sells for more
than $300 a bottle and that Latour, Lafite-Rothschild,
Mouton-Rothschild and Haut-Brion sell for $200 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   I would be much more tempted by the exceptional 1995 Lynch-Bages
for about $55. Jean-Michel Cazes, the owner, regularly produces
wines of first-growth quality at prices that people who actually
drink wine can afford; a 1995 bottle of Haut-Bages-Averous, his
second label at Lynch-Bages, can be found for less than $25.
Lynch-Bages is in prestigious Pauillac. The Cazes family also owns
Les Ormes de Pez, in St.-Estephe, and its 1995 is also under $25.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been so-called second wines from the top
Bordeaux chateaus, usually from younger vines or from lots that
just don't qualify for the principal wine. And a few of these
second wines are considered about on par with the principal wines
from lesser properties. Among these second labels are Les Forts de
Latour and Les Fiefs de Lagrange.
</P>
<P>
   Les Forts de Latour is the second wine of Chateau Latour.
Tradition has it that in less memorable vintages Les Forts can be
more appealing than Latour itself. That has not been my experience,
although I remember when a bottle of the 1973 was opened for lunch
at the chateau in the early 1980s and the magnificent bouquet
filled the house.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Forts de Latour is going to set you back $50, but if
you happened to have an urge to spend $50 on a bottle of Bordeaux,
you needn't look any further.
</P>
<P>
   Almost in the same class and much less expensive, at about $20,
is Les Fiefs de Lagrange, the second wine of Chateau Lagrange, in
St.-Julien. This is an underrated chateau that has been making
superb wines since it was purchased by Suntory, the Japanese wine
and spirits conglomerate, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   St.-Julien wines are usually softer and more approachable than
those of adjoining Pauillac, and that is true of the 1995 vintage.
The first wine probably needs several more years to reach maturity,
but Les Fiefs is ready now.
</P>
<P>
   One of St.-Julien's best-known properties, at least in this
country, is Chateau Gloria, which was made famous by its owner, the
late Henri Martin, a legendary figure in the Bordeaux wine trade.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria was not included in the 1855 classification, so it cannot
command the prices of the chateaus around it. But most of its
vineyards were bought by Martin from those classified properties.
Over the years, Gloria's wines have matched or bettered those of
many of its neighbors in quality and beaten them in price. The 1995
is about $30.
</P>
<P>
   I have always wondered why, even with the unconscionable
inflation of Bordeaux prices in recent years, some chateaus that
could have raised prices did not. One of them is Chateau Meyney,
another property in St.-Estephe, in the northern Medoc.
</P>
<P>
   The wines are big and rich and, like most St.-Estephes, a bit
hard when they are young. In the 1995 Meyney, that hardness has
dissipated, leaving a full, rounded wine, ready to drink now, for
about $22 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   I've concentrated on the Medoc here, but there are well-priced
1995s to be found all over the Bordeaux region. In St.-Emilion,
there is Clos des Jacobins at about $27, and La Commanderie, a
light, easy-drinking wine at about $15. In adjoining Pomerol, there
is an elegant Clos l'Eglise at about $30.
</P>
<P>
   Clos de Jacobins is owned by Domaines Cordier, a well-known
Bordeaux negociant that also owns Meyney. Offering good
chateau-bottled wine at reasonable prices would seem to be a
Cordier principle. Clos l'Eglise is an austere wine for a Pomerol,
whose wines are often compared to Burgundies. This 1995 has a
beautiful bouquet, plenty of ripe fruit in the taste and a most
appealing silky finish.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can buy superexpensive Bordeaux wines and show that they
have lots of money. A shrewd few can buy Bordeaux like these and
show that they have lots of smarts.

to every year in finals.''

their new shoe. The new `taking the kids to school then doing some
work around the house' Jordans.''
</P>
<P>

   ``Elizabeth Dole says she's going to be doing a lot of praying

the boy was not upset that they moved, but that they drove across
the country at four miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been reported that Monica Lewinsky has been doing some
volunteer work. Apparently, she's been helping the underprivileged
achieve orgasm.''

last month. The reporter claims that he was taken to a secret
location for the interview and could not find it again --although
he does remember there was a butler named Alfred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, Michael Jordan announced his retirement, saying he
wants to spend more time for himself, to be a better parent, do
some traveling. You couldn't do anymore traveling than you did when
you played the Knicks. Perhaps you can bring along a ref to
overlook it, just so you'll feel more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Executives from the Chicago Bulls insist that even without
Michael Jordan, Phil Jackson and Dennis Rodman, the team can still
repeat as NBA champions with a little hard work, luck and 90 points
per game from Steve Kerr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard was arrested last night. How many
times have I said that? Maybe we should keep the cue card on that
one. I'm getting Deja Wu. ODB was arrested last night after opening
fire on two undercover cops. But fans, don't worry about his
career. To a rapper, shooting at cops is a cure for writer's
block.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week Paula Jones received $850 thousand in a settlement
from President Clinton. She said it will help her live her dream to
beat up the guy who was mean to her on New Year's Eve at the
go-cart tracks. That money came out of Bill and Hillary's joint
checking account. You know Hillary is in charge of the checkbook in
that family. `Bill, what did you do with check 820?' `Remember, I
didn't tell you the Paula thing, I didn't put it in the book.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura has chosen the Navigator as
his official car rather than the traditional Lincoln or Cadillac.
People all over Minnesota will well up with pride when they cry
out, `Here comes the governor's truck.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A customer filed a $4 million lawsuit against Starbucks this
week after he was badly cut drinking an iced cappuccino laced with
broken glass. When asked how he came up with the $4 million figure,
the customer responded, `I just want my money back.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has re-nominated James Hormel to be
ambassador to Luxembourg after conservatives last year prevented a
vote on his nomination. How important is Luxembourg? We've been
over eight months without an ambassador and we haven't missed out
on anything. Why are we friends with them? I'm not saying we need
to be mean to them, but do we need an ambassador? Like if we see
them at the U.N., we'll give them a head nod, but that's about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The anonymous fan who spend $2.7 million for Mark McGwire's
70th homerun ball also bought five other homerun balls from the
Sammy Sosa-McGwire homerun race. He is expected to merge all the
balls together to form `the ultimate homerun ball.' I mean `he'
will then trade the ball for a trip on the space shuttle with a
naked Jewel. Sounds like a good plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amtrak is unveiling a European-style rail line that links
Eugene, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. Within a month after
opening the high-speed line, the population of Eugene is expected
to be zero.''
</P>
<P>
   ``David Kaczynski, the Unabomber's brother, says that he'll use
the reward money he got from turning in his brother to establish a
fund for the victims. They're not going to cash the check. They're
not even going to open the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting this week, the fee for filing a citizenship
application is more than doubling from $95 to $225. But as always,
it is still free to crawl under a fence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Colonial Williamsburg announced plans for a fake TV show with
guests from two hundred years ago. We already have a real show like
that. It's called `The Late, Late Show with Tom Snyder.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLIND DATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After being with his blind date all evening, the man couldn't
take another minute with her. Earlier, he had secretly arranged to
have a friend call him to the phone so he would have an excuse to
leave if something like this happened.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the table, he lowered his eyes, put on a
grim expression and said, `I have some bad news. My grandfather
just died.`
</P>
<P>
   `Thank heavens,` his date replied. `If yours hadn't, mine would
have had to!`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAWYER JOKE NUMBER 333 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Defendant: Judge, I want you to appoint me another lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Judge: And why is that?
</P>
<P>
   Defendant: Because the Public Defender isn't interested in my
case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge (to Public Defender): Do you have any comments on the
defendant's motion?
</P>
<P>
   Public Defender: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I wasn't listening.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DIRTY OLD PEOPLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An elderly couple was sitting together watching television.
</P>
<P>
   During a commercial, the husband asked his wife, `Whatever
happened to our sexual relations?`
</P>
<P>
   After a long thoughtful silence and during the next commercial,
the wife replied, `You know, I don't know. I don't even think we
got a Christmas card from them this year.`

THURBER BRICKS ARE PIECES OF HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have noticed some ``Thurber Bricks'' in the north side area
of Fort Worth. How long ago were these bricks made in Thurber,
Texas, and are they still for sale?
</P>
<P>
   _ F.W., Waco, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Bricks began to be manufactured at a Thurber plant in 1897,
shortly after high-grade clay was discovered there, according to
the New Handbook of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Thurber, 75 miles west of Fort Worth in the northwest corner of
Erath County, quickly grew to a population of 10,000 because of the
brick plant and the Texas &AMP; Pacific Coal Co., which shared the same
mines.
</P>
<P>
   The coal mining operation closed in 1926 and the brick plant
closed four years later. Most residents had left the company town
by 1933; it has fewer than 20 residents today.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Two questions about basketball commentator Dick Vitale: What
was his coaching record, and where can I write to him?
</P>
<P>
   _ N.A., Lynchburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A: From 1973-77, Vitale had a 78-30 record coaching the
University of Detroit basketball team. Highlights were a 21-game
winning streak and an NCAA tournament appearance in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Vitale coached the Detroit Pistons in 1978-79, compiling a 34-60
record. While he led the Pistons, Vitale acquired Bob McAdoo from
Boston for M.L. Carr and first-round draft picks that became Kevin
McHale and Robert Parish.
</P>
<P>
   Write to Vitale or any ESPN broadcaster in care of ESPN, ESPN
Plaza, Bristol, CT 06010. He also has an online store at
www.dickvitale.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the holiday Boxing Day get its name?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.T.T., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Boxing Day is celebrated the day after Christmas in the
United Kingdom and most former British territories other than the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   It's a day to give gifts to people who deliver mail, milk and
other products to your home. Also, some celebrate by donating food
and other goods to less-fortunate people.
</P>
<P>
   The name comes from the boxes used to package these gifts.
Boxing Day, which is a legal holiday in the United Kingdom and
Canada, has been a tradition since the Middle Ages.

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday declined to hear a
case filed by SBC Communications Inc., challenging aspects of the
1996 Telecommunications Act that have barred Bell companies from
entering long-distance markets.
</P>
<P>
   The decision upholds a July ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeal in New Orleans, which had overturned a Texas court.
</P>
<P>
   SBC was joined in its unsuccessful case by other regional Bell
companies, including Bell Atlantic Corp. and U.S. West Inc.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp., MCIWorldCom and other long-distance companies
supported the lower court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is the first by the Supreme Court to decline to
hear Bell companies' arguments that the '96 Telecom Act is
unconstitutional because it selectively targets them for
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the '96 Telecom Act, regional Bell companies are barred
from entering the lucrative, $90-billion-a-year long-distance
business until they have sufficiently opened their local markets to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated requests since 1996, not a single Bell company
has been granted permission to move into long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, naturally, disappointed that the Supreme Court will
not hear our case,'' said SBC spokesman Selim Bingol in a prepared
statement. ``However, we are more determined than ever to win the
right to provide the full range of services our customers demand.''
</P>
<P>
   A second case, filed by BellSouth, makes the same argument. But
the Supreme Court has not decided whether to hear it. And BellSouth
is considering appealing a third case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that this constitutional issue is of
such importance that the Supreme Court should resolve it on its
merits,'' said William Barfield, BellSouth's associate general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, SBC argued that the Constitution bars Congress
from passing a law that singles out and punishes an individual or
company. Since the Telecom Act named Bell companies specifically,
SBC contended, the provision amounted to an unconstitutional ``Bill
of Attainder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, on behalf of the Federal Communications
Commission, however, argued that the '96 act established economic
regulations. It did not attempt to punish any particular company,
according to FCC officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're disappointed,'' said Robert McKenna, U.S.
West's associate general counsel. ``And it's not a good sign for
BellSouth's cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was heralded by FCC chairman William F. Kennard,
however. ``This decision confirms the logic of the Telecom Act:
that competition breeds competition. These companies should stop
litigating and give Americans what they want, choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. isn't waiting for the courts. The company
says it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to open its local
markets.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to ask New York for approval to offer
long-distance in the coming months. If successful, Bell Atlantic
Corp. is expected to file for FCC permission to offer long-distance
services. Kennard has signaled that he would look favorably on that
petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been two-tracking this,'' said Shannon Fioravanti, a
Bell Atlantic spokeswoman. ``We can't wait for the courts to work
their will.''

is up. We are moving forward.''
</P>
<P>

stepped down. Man, what did Larry Flynt have on this guy?''

<P>
   ``Are you upset that Michael's stepping down? You know what this
means, don't you? Now the Utah Jazz have to find a new team to lose
to every year in finals.''

their new shoe. The new `taking the kids to school then doing some
work around the house' Jordans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In business news, there's talk that the Swedish automaker
Volvo wants to merge with the Italian automaker Fiat. They say

President Clinton refers to it, `Hose off the DNA Day.'''

</P>
<P>
   ``In a recent interview, Cameron Diaz said that if Matt Dillon
ever cheats on her again, she's going to make him give $500,000 to
charity. After hearing this, the United Way sent Matt Dillon three
hookers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fan who made almost $3 million auctioning off Mark
McGwire's 70th homerun ball says he'll continue working as a
genetic scientist. Apparently, he's trying to find the gene that
makes someone pay $3 million for a $9 million baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth Dole says she's going to be doing a lot of praying
to help figure out whether or not she should run for President.
After hearing this Bob Dole said, `I hope she's praying to a
different god than the guy who told me to run.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Linda Tripp was named the `worst dressed woman' in
1998. Apparently, Tripp was singled out because her shoes never
match her recording device.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening arguments for the impeachment proceedings begin
tomorrow and, under the rules, Senators are not allowed to talk.
But they are allowed to sit quietly and receive oral sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today at the impeachment trial, one of the Republican
prosecutors said that President Clinton repeatedly put himself
above the law. After hearing this, President Clinton said, `What
can I say? I like being on top.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York City, a man is suing Starbucks for $4 million
because he says he found chunks of glass in his Frappuccino. If he
wins, he says he's going to use the $4 million to buy another
Frappuccino at Starbucks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientists have developed a new form of Viagra that works like

have sex with your nose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A 16-year-old boy was angry that his family moved from Buffalo
to Washington state so he got even with his parents by calling the
cops and showing them his parents' stash of marijuana. Apparently,
the boy was not upset that they moved, but that they drove across
the country at four miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been reported that Monica Lewinsky has been doing some
volunteer work. Apparently, she's been helping the underprivileged
achieve orgasm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During yesterday's impeachment trial, one senator was spotted
chewing gum and passing a note to another senator. Reportedly, the
note said, `Do you think Monica likes me?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, Republican Senator Bob Barr called Larry Flynt
President Clinton's `buddy.' In response, President Clinton said
that he and Mr. Flynt are not that close, but Flynt does send the
best Christmas cards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Web sites are claiming to have unedited versions of the
Pamela and Tommy Lee sex tape in which you get to see more of them.
Which is weird, because the only way you could possibly see more of
Tommy Lee is if he got an MRI.''
</P>
<P>

up because by the time they arrived at school, everyone on the bus
had already finished their lunch.''

<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM `WEEKEND UPDATE' ON NBC's `SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congressional seat being vacated by Bob Livingston could
be filled by a 48-year-old ophthalmologist named Dr. Monica Monica.
This is the last straw. The country has officially turned into a
very bad `Hee Haw' sketch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. intelligence officials want ABC News to reveal the
whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden, who was interviewed by the network
last month. The reporter claims that he was taken to a secret
location for the interview and could not find it again --although
he does remember there was a butler named Alfred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, Michael Jordan announced his retirement, saying he
wants to spend more time for himself, to be a better parent, do
some traveling. You couldn't do anymore traveling than you did when
you played the Knicks. Perhaps you can bring along a ref to
overlook it, just so you'll feel more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Executives from the Chicago Bulls insist that even without
Michael Jordan, Phil Jackson and Dennis Rodman, the team can still
repeat as NBA champions with a little hard work, luck and 90 points
per game from Steve Kerr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard was arrested last night. How many
times have I said that? Maybe we should keep the cue card on that
one. I'm getting Deja Wu. ODB was arrested last night after opening
fire on two undercover cops. But fans, don't worry about his
career. To a rapper, shooting at cops is a cure for writer's
block.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week Paula Jones received $850 thousand in a settlement
from President Clinton. She said it will help her live her dream to
beat up the guy who was mean to her on New Year's Eve at the
go-cart tracks. That money came out of Bill and Hillary's joint
checking account. You know Hillary is in charge of the checkbook in
that family. `Bill, what did you do with check 820?' `Remember, I
didn't tell you the Paula thing, I didn't put it in the book.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura has chosen the Navigator as
his official car rather than the traditional Lincoln or Cadillac.
People all over Minnesota will well up with pride when they cry
out, `Here comes the governor's truck.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A customer filed a $4 million lawsuit against Starbucks this
week after he was badly cut drinking an iced cappuccino laced with
broken glass. When asked how he came up with the $4 million figure,
the customer responded, `I just want my money back.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has re-nominated James Hormel to be
ambassador to Luxembourg after conservatives last year prevented a
vote on his nomination. How important is Luxembourg? We've been
over eight months without an ambassador and we haven't missed out
on anything. Why are we friends with them? I'm not saying we need
to be mean to them, but do we need an ambassador? Like if we see
them at the U.N., we'll give them a head nod, but that's about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The anonymous fan who spend $2.7 million for Mark McGwire's
70th homerun ball also bought five other homerun balls from the
Sammy Sosa-McGwire homerun race. He is expected to merge all the
balls together to form `the ultimate homerun ball.' I mean `he'
will then trade the ball for a trip on the space shuttle with a
naked Jewel. Sounds like a good plan.''
</P>

<P>
   First impressions last longest. The downbeat of the conductor's
baton, the first step in a tango, the opening words in a flirtation
_ these initial moves can make or break.
</P>
<P>
   So, why is the aperitif, the traditional mood-setter for the
perfect meal, so poorly understood, especially now, when
restaurants all over town seem to be bending over backward to
create distinctive pre-meal drinks?
</P>
<P>
   On most fronts, American diners have become more sophisticated
and demanding, but when faced with the aperitif moment, they
flinch. ``Something to drink before the meal?'' is a question
brimming with promise. It deserves a better answer than, ``Uh, a
glass of white wine?'' Some diners, bestirring themselves, ask for
a martini. Bad idea. The martini is many things, but one thing it
is not _ an aperitif.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, most people are confused about what an aperitif is
and what it is supposed to do, and that includes professional
bartenders. Is it the same as a cocktail? If not, then where is the
dividing line? Questions like these have challenged the finest
minds in drinkdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``An aperitif is a wine-based product, served before the meal,
to which you need only add a garnish,'' said Jean-Luc Deguines, the
food and beverage director at the Mark Hotel in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Deguines, who once worked as a bartender at the posh Mirabelle
in London, is French, of course, and so is his definition. It is
clear, emphatic and highly traditional, limiting the aperitif to
herb-infused products like vermouth, Lillet, Dubonnet, St. Raphael
and Byrrh, all of them served on the rocks with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Haigh, a drink historian who, under the name Dr. Cocktail,
oversees the cocktail discussions on America On Line, offers a more
inclusive definition. ``The aperitif is what's known as a
quinquina, or a drink that contains quinine, a bitter agent, which
is diluted,'' he said. ``The diluted bitterness is the key, I
think. Undiluted, it is a digestif, which is taken after the meal
and is intended to settle the stomach.'' (A liqueur, or cordial, he
might have added, is a sweet, spirit-based drink, usually consumed
after the meal.)
</P>
<P>
   The Haigh definition would include all the drinks on Deguines'
list, plus bitter Italian aperitifs like Campari, Punt e Mes and
Cynar, an aperitif flavored with _ believe it or not _ artichokes.
It also opens the door to the now-illegal absinthe and its
descendants, Pernod and Ricard, all of them flavored with anise.
</P>
<P>
   What all of these preparations have in common is enough
bitterness to stimulate the appetite and enough sweetness to make
the bitterness palatable. With the exception of absinthe, they are
also lightly alcoholic and therefore lift the spirits without
numbing the taste buds.
</P>
<P>
   Certain wines do more or less the same job, although not the
big-shouldered chardonnays that many diners wind up drinking before
a meal. The white Burgundy wine known as aligote, which is
mouth-puckeringly tart when drunk on its own, blends perfectly with
creme de cassis to become the classic kir.
</P>
<P>
   A chilled manzanilla or fino sherry also sets up a meal in fine
style. And Champagne has just the right crispness and acidity, not
to mention happy bubbles, to kick off a meal in memorable fashion,
especially if the restaurant, paying proper attention to the
all-important fun factor, has added a soupcon of this or that to
the glass, and perhaps a colorful garnish.
</P>
<P>
   The festive role of the aperitif should not be underestimated.
It is, in a way, a before-meal cheerleader, and part of its task is
to grab attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art and skill of mixology is to take away the boring
aspect of what to drink before lunch or dinner,''said Salvatore
Calabrese, the author of ``Classic Cocktails'' (Sterling
Publishing, 1998) and the bartender at the Lanesborough Hotel in
London. Showmanship counts, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   The world of the aperitif was calm and rational until the
Americans came along and invented the cocktail in the early 19th
century, and Europeans began experimenting with it early in this
one. The vermouth cassis and the Campari-based Americano and
Negroni have to be considered major steps forward in civilized
life, but what are they?
</P>
<P>
   Calabrese struggled with the taxonomy and found a comfortable
spot straddling the fence. ``The Americano or Negroni are aperitifs
in the sense that they open the palate and stimulate digestion,''
he said, ``but they are also classic cocktails.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Von Rock, the wine director at Verbena in Manhattan, takes
a slightly more romantic view of the issue. The aperitif, which he
calls ``the first step on that epicurean trip,'' can be defined as
much by its social function as its physical properties. ``Cocktails
celebrate sociability and bring people together,'' he said.
``That's the mental focus I have when I have a cocktail. People who
order an aperitif pay more attention to what flavors are occurring
and what wines they will select.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is ample evidence that restaurant owners and chefs around
town have been thinking hard about their before-dinner drinks
lately, and that they may even be a step ahead of their customers.
Diners who don't bother to ask what the house is serving in the
aperitif line can be missing out on a splendid way to start a meal.
</P>
<P>
   At Gertrude's, Laurent Manrique has put his stamp on a classic
Gascon aperitif known as the pousse-rapiere, a combination of
Armagnac, Grand Marnier and Champagne served with a slice of
orange. Manrique infuses his Armagnac with oranges, cloves, vanilla
and various herbs to get a complex, spicy-pruny aperitif that
triggers subliminal cravings for foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   For its 38th birthday, La Caravelle has come up with the Kir
Royale 38, adding a little Cognac and Grand Marnier to Champagne.
Garnished with a slice of orange, it makes a rich, suave pre-meal
drink. Jacques Capsouto, at Capsouto Freres, has pulled off a nifty
trick by stealing some raspberry coulis from his pastry chef and
using it to make a bright, fruity Champagne aperitif.
</P>
<P>
   Scarabee has solved the cocktail-aperitif argument by creating a
drink that can be either. Called a French martini, it starts with
blond Lillet infused with red currants. The aperitif-minded can
take it as is, chilled and pink, with a curl of lemon peel. Add
vodka, and it becomes a cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, a stiff cocktail defies the rules and manages
to sneak into aperitif territory. The Juniperotivo at Monzu is one
of these imposters. Made with Junipero, a highly aromatic,
herbaceous gin from the people who make Anchor Steam beer, it's a
sweet-and-sour special that offsets the astringency of the gin with
lime juice, mint and pomegranate syrup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although most aperitifs are in the low-alcohol range, this one
works because it has a tartness that gets the salivary glands
going, and a touch of sweetness and herbaceousness that sets up the
palate for food,'' said Jerri Banks, Monzu's food and beverage
director.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant has also done a clever variation on the
Americano, substituting the fruity, chocolatey Punt e Mes for sweet
vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer audacity, however, Tabla takes the cake. The customer
who orders a Ginger Citrus Snap gets a mixture of Stoly Oranj and
ginger eau de vie that occupies two-thirds of a curved martini
glass. A waiter then tops up the glass with Billecart-Salmon
Champagne and deposits small pile pomegranate seeds in the drink.
As the bubbles collect around the seeds, the seeds begin to rise.
The bubbles fall away, and the seeds fall. Whee!
</P>
<P>
   This alcoholic lava lamp has found an audience. One woman,
filling out a comment card, wrote, ``It makes me feel like running
naked down Madison Avenue and setting my hair on fire.'' That's a
good start to any evening. &QL;

`WHAT LOOKS LIKE CRAZY' BETTER ON TAPE THAN IN PRINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``What Looks Like Crazy On An Ordinary Day,'' by Pearl Cleage;
read by the author; abridged, approximately 4.5 hours; Simon &AMP;
Schuster Audio; $23.
</P>
<P>
   A playwright and English faculty member at Spelman College,
Cleage probably wouldn't have made much of a splash with this, her
debut novel. But after Oprah Winfrey took a liking to ``What Looks
Like Crazy On An Ordinary Day'' and proclaimed it a must-read,
normal expectations for the book's success went out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Idelwild, a fictitious rural town in northern Michigan,
``What Looks Like Crazy'' is the story of Ava Johnson finding her
place in the world after learning she is infected with HIV. A
native of Idelwild, Johnson had established herself as a first-rate
beautician in Atlanta before returning to her hometown to spend
time with her sister and contemplate what life might offer her.
</P>
<P>
   While Cleage starts her first book of fiction with a promising
premise, most of her characters are too predictable, and what
unfolds is ultimately as subtle as a made-for-TV movie. If Cleage
could have infused anywhere near as much life into her prose as she
does into the first-rate reading she gives her novel, ``What Looks
Like Crazy'' would be far more worthy of its impressive sales
figures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Gates of Eden,'' by Ethan Coen; read by Brian Boehlke, Steve
Buscemi, Matt Dillon, John Goodman, William H. Macy, Liev
Schreiber, Ben Stiller and John Turturro; abridged, approximately
5.5 hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio; $25.
</P>
<P>
   The ``write'' side of the fabulous sibling film-making duo Ethan
and Joel Coen (``Fargo,'' ``Raising Arizona,'' etc.), Ethan Coen
has had some of the short stories in this collection published
previously in Playboy and Vanity Fair. These stories, some of which
feel more like scenes for a movie than finished short pieces,
showcase Coen's energy and talent for dialogue. They also reflect
the wacky sensibilities of the author, who revels in a
predominantly male world in which the glass is decidedly half-empty
for many of his protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   This collection is further enhanced by the impressive array of
talent recruited to read the different stories. The eight actors
give terrific performances and, I suspect, magnify the author's
intentions in each story.
</P>
<P>
   The shortcoming is in the quality of the stories. While most
have good moments and fun characters, they fall below the bar the
author has set for himself in filmmaking. It's unlikely this Oscar
winner (``Fargo'' claimed an Academy Award for Best Original
Screenplay) has a Pulitzer for fiction in his future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Connections: Power, Obsession, Murder, Revenge,'' by
Jackie Collins; read by the author; abridged, approximately 4.5
hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio; $22.
</P>
<P>
   Is it OK to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed this awful book,
made worse by the author reading it? The best-selling Collins
published this originally as a four-part miniseries, and has
compiled the titles for a four-cassette audio book.
</P>
<P>
   Unequivocal trash fiction, where every woman who has not had
breast implants is blessed with a voluptuous figure, where every
man save one is either shallow or evil if not both, makes for
riotous listening in the car. Who buys this, and why, you ask
yourself. And whoever let Collins, whose British accent sounds like
her sister Joan as Alexis Carrington, read a book set in L.A.
featuring only American characters?
</P>
<P>
   So incongruous, so bad, you laugh at it more than with it.

DRESSING PEARS FOR A DINNER PARTY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA KAFKA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The pear, a fruit that is at its peak this time of
year, has more talent than it gets credit for. Picked in autumn
before it is ripe, then put in cold storage for a while, it is a
staple at Greenmarkets throughout the winter, remaining crisp and
juicy while some apple varieties are turning mealy.
</P>
<P>
   The classic way to eat this fruit is raw, of course, with
perhaps a bit of Brie or Gorgonzola. But pears can also be used in
cooked dishes, like the savory roast squab dish here. And when
there are no local berries but the winter-battered soul craves a
tart, pears are ideal.
</P>
<P>
   For cooking, I prefer Bosc pears. Their skin is a dark russet,
and their flesh is firm, with a nicely tart edge to the flavor.
Anjous, with their greenish yellow skin, are also good for cooking,
though they are not so tart. Bartletts can be substituted in some
recipes but tend to be juicier than Boscs or Anjous, which is not
necessarily what you want when making a dish with dough, for
example. Comice pears should be reserved for eating raw, as they
become mushy in cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Cooked and pureed Boscs make a pleasing and unusual sauce base
for roast squab, a dark-meat bird that has only a hint of gamy
flavor and can be served a little rare. Cornish hens, which taste
more like chicken, are a good alternative. Whatever bird you use,
the roasting time will be 15 minutes or so for one-pound birds;
larger birds will take longer and should be cooked until their
juices run clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgur, with its mellow brown color, firm bite and slightly
nutty flavor, makes a good contrast to the meat in this dish. Brown
rice could be substituted, but takes much longer to cook.
</P>
<P>
   This is hearty food just right for an elegant winter dinner
party. For a stunning presentation, I place the birds in a circle
on a large round dish, put cooked pear halves between them and
mound the bulgur in the center of the circle. I spoon a little pear
sauce over each portion of bird and bulgur; there will be enough
left over for your guests to add more if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional way of eating a tiny bird like squab is simply
to pull it apart, legs first, with your fingers and to eat it
without cutlery. But in case anyone feels uncomfortable doing this,
you can also take a large pair of kitchen shears and cut the cooked
birds into quarters.
</P>
<P>
   A lovely end to this festive meal is a pear tart made with
sheets of frozen phyllo dough. Some tips on working with phyllo:
first, make sure to leave enough time to defrost it. It will take
about five hours at room temperature or all day in a refrigerator;
do not unwrap the package until you are ready to use it. When
buttering the sheets, work quickly, so that they do not dry out.
Don't worry if the sheets tear a little; they will be layered, and
any small holes will be covered by other layers of dough.
</P>
<P>
   A cookie sheet with no sides, or only two sides, works best for
baking the tart. The finished tart can then just slide off the
sheet easily. The tart can be served warm or cool, as its layer of
ground nuts will absorb the pear juice and keep the tart from
getting soggy as it sits. Cooks who like to paint the lily can top
each portion with unsweetened whipped cream, or an ice cream, nut
or vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   SQUAB WITH PEARS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   { cup chicken stock, homemade or canned
</P>
<P>
   \ cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 firm, ripe Bosc pears (about 1{ pounds), peeled, halved and
cored
</P>
<P>
   } cup bulgur
</P>
<P>
   4 medium squabs (about 11 ounces each), wingtips removed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pear brandy
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon ground cardamom
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal ({ cup).
</P>
<P>
   1. Place a rack in middle of oven, and heat to 500 degrees. In a
saucepan just large enough to hold pears in one layer, bring
chicken stock, red wine and red wine vinegar to a boil. Add pears
in one layer, and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes, turning
occasionally, until cooked through. Take 2 pear halves, and cut
into chunks. Keep remaining pears covered to keep warm. In a
blender, puree chunks with poaching liquid.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bring 1} cups of water to a boil. Add bulgur, and return to
the boil. Reduce heat to simmer, cover pan, and cook 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. While bulgur is cooking and pears are poaching, rub each
squab with pear brandy, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place
squabs in a roasting pan, and roast for 16 to 17 minutes, or until
juices run clear.
</P>
<P>
   4. Drain any remaining water from bulgur, fluff with fork, stir
in butter, and allow it to melt. Season with salt and pepper to
taste.
</P>
<P>
   5. When squabs are roasted, remove to a platter. If pears have
cooled, reheat in microwave for 2 minutes. Place roasting pan on
stove over medium heat. Pour in 1/3 cup water, and boil, scraping
up any browned bits on bottom of pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in
pear puree and cardamom, and bring to a boil. Season with salt and
pepper, and stir in scallions. Spoon some sauce over birds and
bulgur, and pass the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Zest of { orange
</P>
<P>
   Zest of { lemon
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   4 firm, ripe Bosc pears (about 2 pounds), peeled, quartered,
cored and cut into 1-inch wedges
</P>
<P>
   6 sheets phyllo dough, defrosted
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   } cup chopped walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place a rack in center of oven, and heat to 375 degrees.
Place orange and lemon zest in bowl of a food processor, and pulse
with sugar and cloves until powdery. With the machine running, pour
the orange and lemon juice through the feed tube. Process until
fairly liquid. Scrape mixture into a medium mixing bowl. Add pears,
and gently toss to coat.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place one sheet of phyllo dough lengthwise on a cookie sheet.
Brush it with melted butter. Top it with a second sheet, and brush
with butter. Place a third sheet of phyllo crosswise to cover half
of the previous layers. Leave some of the dough hanging over each
side. Brush with butter. Repeat with another sheet of phyllo, this
time covering the other half of the layers. Place another sheet
lengthwise, and brush it with butter. Place the last sheet on top,
but do not brush it with butter.
</P>
<P>
   3. Sprinkle walnuts in the center of the dough, forming a round
8 inches in diameter. Spoon pears over nuts. Loosely fold the
phyllo up and over the pears; there will be a space in the center
where the pears show through. Parts of the dough should stick up
like a pocket handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the phyllo is golden and
the pears are tender. Carefully slide tart off pan onto a serving
plate, using a spatula, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAULIEU, France _ A soft winter rain is falling on this sleepy
farm town on the western edge of Burgundy. The old hotels and
restaurants that line the main street are as gray and somber as the
overcast sky. Except one, La Cote d'Or, at the southern end of
town, one of the legendary inns and restaurants of France.
</P>
<P>
   I park in a lot across the road and dodge through the rain to
meet my host, Bernard Loiseau, who hurries through the lobby, his
arms open wide in welcome. If anything, Loiseau is more famous than
his restaurant. Not many people in France can afford La Cote d'Or,
but all of them can see Loiseau _ and probably have _ on
television, in newspapers and in magazines. In a country where
famous chefs are as important as film stars and government
officials, Louiseau is a master at keeping himself in the public
eye.
</P>
<P>
   He is part of the elite fraternity of chefs with three stars in
the Guide Michelin, France's most important restaurant and hotel
guide. The 1998 Michelin lists more than 4,000 restaurants; only 21
have three stars.
</P>
<P>
   Once, getting three Michelin stars was a crowning achievement. A
chef so honored could rest on his laurels, confident that his
dining room and his bank account would always be full. No longer.
In 1996, for the first time since the guide began publishing at the
turn of the century, a three-star restaurant, Pierre Gagnaire, in
St.-Etienne, went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, another three-star restaurant, the Auberge de
l'Eridan, near Annecy, closed briefly because Marc Veyrat, the
owner and chef, was some $9 million in debt. A reprieve from his
bankers allowed him to reopen a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Gagnaire, too, reopened. He moved to Paris and, in three short
years, regained his three stars.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, starting up and running a three-star restaurant is
astonishingly expensive. Typically, such a restaurant has two
employees for every customer that its dining room can hold. And
with France's heavy taxes, even dinner bills of $500 a person fail
to cover costs.
</P>
<P>
   Debate is simmering in France over just how much trouble the
three-star restaurants are in. How creative must chefs be _ not
just in their cooking, but in their financing _ to be merely able
to survive? Will the wildly rising costs of running these
establishments drive the best and the brightest elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   Not all three-star chefs have had difficulties as bad as those
of Gagnaire and Veyrat, but many are constantly casting about for
other sources of income and still find themselves in financial
straits.
</P>
<P>
   I was in Saulieu to talk to Loiseau because he is handling his
own mountain of debt in a novel way: by going public. His business,
Bernard Loiseau SA (Bernard Loiseau Inc., in English) _ was listed
on the Paris Stock Exchange in December in a public offering that
netted him just over $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a happy man,'' he said over a glass of champagne. ``I
have provided for my future and created something that will last
after me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. Bernard Loiseau SA really has one asset: Bernard
Loiseau. ``Should anything happen to him, the stock would be
worthless,'' one Paris market analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it have to be a fatal accident; losing just one
Michelin star could be a telling blow to his market value. Michelin
regularly demotes famous chefs. Ten years ago, Roger Verge's Moulin
de Mougins, near Cannes on the Cote d'Azur, had three stars; today
it has one.
</P>
<P>
   If Loiseau's future is problematic, his Paris colleague Alain
Ducasse is really walking a financial high wire. Ducasse won his
first three-star rating from Michelin in 1990 for his restaurant
Louis XV in Monaco. In 1996, when he won another three-star rating
for his Paris restaurant Alain Ducasse, Michelin dropped the Louis
XV to two stars. Last year, the lost star was restored, making
Ducasse the first in recent times to hold six stars at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on his fame _ and his obvious ability _ Ducasse has
been expanding at top speed. From his office on a top floor of the
town house that is his premier Paris restaurant, he directs a small
empire that includes the two three-star restaurants, a luxury
country inn in Provence, La Bastide de Moustiers, and three other
restaurants in Paris. In addition, he is president of chain of
hotels, has produced books and recordings, endorses products,
consults with restaurants around the world and appears regularly on
television and radio. A financial publication estimated his gross
income in 1998 to be around $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Usually photographed in a white chef's jacket, Ducasse, like
most media-savvy three-star chefs, actually spends little if any
time at his ovens. Mindful that the Michelin inspectors take a dim
view of chefs who rarely visit their own kitchens, he jets between
Monaco and Paris to keep an eye on the plats du jour.
</P>
<P>
   With all his frenetic activity, and the income that accompanies
it, Ducasse freely acknowledges that his three-star restaurants
would not be viable businesses if he was paying for what he calls
``the walls'': both restaurants are in buildings owned by someone

   Outside activities are hardly new for chefs like Ducasse. Paul
Bocuse has been endorsing, consulting and opening other restaurants
since his Lyon restaurant got its third star in 1965. Although he
inherited his ``walls'' from his family, Bocuse has often spoken
out against what many restaurateurs see as Michelin's excessive
demands for luxury in three-star restaurants.

   Of the more than 4,000 restaurants in France and Monaco rated by
the Michelin Guide, these are the 21 awarded three stars, the
highest ranking. While some are struggling, others are thriving. In
fact, most of those outside the major cities are profitable. The
new ratings will be announced in March. &QL;

 &HT;    IOC MEMBER IMPLICATED IN SALT LAKE SCANDAL RESIGNS POST

<P>
   LONDON _ An International Olympic Committee member implicated in
the Salt Lake City bidding scandal resigned Tuesday, the first
resignation to follow allegations of bribery
</P>
<P>
   in the campaign to win the 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Pirjo Haggman, an IOC member since 1981, delivered her
resignation by fax to IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch at the
committee's Lausanne, Switzerland, headquarters. Haggman was one of
the first two women elected to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Haggman said in a statement that she could be accused of naivete
but not corruption. ``Even though I have not broken my Olympic oath
nor violated IOC rules, I have lost my ability to function as a
constructive IOC member,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her ex-husband, Bjarne, reportedly worked briefly for the Salt
Lake City bid committee and for 20 months in an Ontario government
job initiated by the Toronto committee lobbying for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Star on Monday reported that the Toronto bid
committee paid the rent on a house for Haggman and her husband
while the city was lobbying to win the Centennial Games. They moved
into the house in 1989 after Bjarne Haggman landed a job with
Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Games were awarded to Atlanta in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Henderson, the Toronto bid's chief, told the newspaper that
the arrangement was necessary because the couple were Finnish
nationals and the landlord would accept payment only from a
Canadian account. Henderson said he believes the committee was
reimbursed by Haggman and her ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   After resigning, Haggman said she should have been more thorough
in looking at her ex-husband's career for potential conflicts with
her duties as an IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the current perspective, I am guilty of being rash and
perhaps naive in my trust in other people,'' she said. ``My
conscience is completely clear.''
</P>
<P>
   A middle-distance runner in the 1972, '76 and '80 Olympics, she
was 12-time Finnish champion at 100 and 400 meters. Haggman, 47, is
the second IOC member to resign in a scandal. Robert Helmick
stepped down in 1991 as an IOC member and president of the U.S.
Olympic Committee amid allegations of conflict of interest in
contracts with sports
</P>
<P>
   associations.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of 13 IOC members being investigated for their
actions during Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter
Olympics. A special IOC committee headed by Dick Pound, the
Canadian IOC member who acted as the committee's liaison for the
Atlanta Olympics, is scheduled to report its findings in Lausanne
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the IOC members implicated in the scandal indicated that
they will attend the meeting in Lausanne to defend their actions.
</P>
<P>
   While saying that it intends to close the chapter on Salt Lake
City this weekend, the IOC has indicated that it is willing to look
into allegations of wrongdoing beyond the award of the 2002 Games
-- including Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a committee spokesman said that there so far is
nothing to investigate. ``No other evidence has been presented to
the IOC,'' said Alan Elias, a spokesman in the
</P>
<P>
   committee's Lausanne media center.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in other cities' Olympic bids recently have come
forward with assertions that some IOC members suggested that how
they would vote might hinge on how well they were treated.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many years, there were rumors. We have never been able to
have the beginning of evidence,'' Francois Carrard, the IOC's
director general, told reporters Monday. ''We had allegations; we
had hearsay. When we tried to get evidence, we always faced a wall
of silence, even by people who said publicly they would disclose
certain things.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations surrounding the Salt Lake City bid mark the
first time the IOC has had any solid evidence, Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In another matter, the IOC said Tuesday that it had ``absolutely
no record or recollection'' of a Japanese samurai sword having been
presented by the governor of Nagano, the host city of the 1998
Winter Games, to Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo Shimbun reported Monday that Samaranch had been given
the $9,000 sword during a visit to Nagano in May 1991. IOC rules
forbid members from accepting gifts worth more than $150. The
newspaper quoted former officials with the Nagano bidding
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC has thoroughly checked all of its records, its
archives and the Olympic Museum records and cannot locate this
gift,'' the committee said in a statement. ``On the other hand, we
can confirm that the IOC has in its possession Japanese paintings
from Nagano, which were displayed last week for the press.''
</P>
<P>
   This referred to Japanese works including a painting of geese in
flight exhibited at the IOC museum archives for reporters last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old Samaranch, facing calls for his resignation from
some figures close
</P>
<P>
   to the Olympic movement, said earlier this month he had been
given two sporting guns by
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City officials.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted that he had done nothing wrong because they were
being put on display
</P>
<P>
   in Lausanne's Olympic Museum.

MURDER COMES WITH A LOT OF LAUGHS IN RICHMOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over Carl Hiaasen, you have company. Patricia Cornwell,
known for her forensic thrillers, has switched to Hiaasen's world
of black humor and nearly conquers it in the hilarious ``Southern
Cross'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $25.95, 359 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hammer, the police chief of Charlotte, N.C., has accepted a
year's commission to overhaul the Richmond, Va., police department.
To help bring the department into the computer age, she takes with
her Deputy Chief Virginia West and officer Andy Brazil. No one in
Richmond wants them there _ the department and the locals dislike
outsiders, especially anyone from Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil gets off on a bad foot when he writes a newspaper column
about the escalating problem of juvenile gangs. The city wants to
blame just a few juvenile delinquents, not gangs, for the increase
in muggings and robberies of ATM machines.
</P>
<P>
   As the department fights against the new technology, suddenly
the computer system is shut down by a wave of blue fish on the
screen. The media call it ``fishteria'' as police computers in
other cities begin to crash.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows that Weed Gardener, 14, is behind fishteria.
Undersized, the product of a broken home following the death of his
beloved big brother Twister, Weed is only comfortable in art class
and band practice. His world gets worse when Smoke, a 16-year-old
psychopath, decides that Weed is going to be part of his gang, the
Pikes. After his initiation, Smoke takes Weed to the local cemetery
and orders him to paint the statue on Jefferson Davis' grave.
</P>
<P>
   Left alone, Weed's artistic bent soars and he turns Davis into a
University of Richmond black basketball player wearing the number
12. The city's civic leaders go berserk when the vandalism is
discovered. For Hammer and her aides, things only get worse after
Brazil's 71-year-old landlady is murdered during an ATM robbery and
the Pikes claim responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Cross'' is rich in eccentric characters and raucous
language. There's Bubba, a big, fat, stupid redneck who works for
the tobacco company, hunts coons with his pal Smudge, who has been
cheating Bubba since they were boys. Bubba's woes continue to pile
up when Smoke breaks into Bubba's garage and steals most of his
guns and ammunition just before a scheduled coon hunt with Smudge.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the passing scenery is Patty Passman, a fat
communications officer who totally loses it when she gets one
parking ticket too many. Any meter maid reading what Patty does to
the ticket-writing cop will think twice before issuing another one.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's busy-body landlady Miss Sink has run-ins with Hammer
and her dog, yet constantly bakes goodies for the tall and gorgeous
Brazil, who can't figure out why his old lover West has ignored him
since they moved to Richmond. West is jealous because she has heard
rumors that Brazil is having an affair with his landlady.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all the disparate subplots come together during the
Azalea Parade.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the city of Richmond will not be pleased that all the
characters, including the governor, are not the brightest people
walking the streets. But this is a really funny, satirical takeoff
on the murder mystery genre. Cornwell has done herself proud.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ``Billy Straight.'' By Jonathan Kellerman. Random House. $25.95.
467 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the park you see things. But not what I saw tonight,'' says
12-year-old runaway Billy Straight in the opening of Kellerman's
tension-filled thriller.
</P>
<P>
   What Billy sees is a man slash a woman to death in the parking
lot of Los Angeles' Griffith Park. The kid who fled the abuse of
his mother's boyfriend and doesn't know who his father is, now must
flee from one of his safest hiding places.
</P>
<P>
   The murder victim is the ex-wife of a television star, who on at
least one occasion beat her during their marriage. The high-profile
case gets plenty of attention from LAPD Homicide Detective Petra
Connor, the first to figure out that there was a witness to the
murder and that the witness is a child.
</P>
<P>
   After the murder, Billy walked six miles to a another hiding
place at the zoo, only to be grabbed by a pair of child molesters.
Only incredible resourcefulness enables him to escape and hunt for
one more shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the killer is interesting, but it is Billy's
story of surviving on the streets that makes ``Billy Straight'' a
compelling read. He is one sweet, naive, yet resilient kid who has
endured what no child should ever have to. Yet he has learned to
keep his head down on the mean streets of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Kellerman makes you care deeply for this child. ``Billy
Straight'' would make a terrific movie.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Kill Zone.'' By Jim Silver. Simon &AMP; Schuster. $23. 320 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's well-paced thriller covers three decades beginning with
a heinous act in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1970 and the men of Jim Linet's squad wanted to get
home, alive and unwounded. Convinced that their operations officer,
Maj. Ralph Longbaugh, is going to send them on one more mission
into the Central Highlands, the squad murders him, making it look
like Longbaugh was ambushed by the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   One of the squad confesses, but the rest cling to their denials
and the Army's Criminal Investigation Division decides not to
prosecute. But investigators Jim Manos and Tony Husta tell the
squad that someday they will be tried for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Manos meets a young Army-trained sniper, Aaron
Longbaugh, the son of the murdered officer. After Manos tells Aaron
who killed his father, Aaron quits the Army and begins his campaign
to get justice for his father. Using many identities, Aaron moves
across the country, gets hired into various police departments and
methodically hunts down and kills the squad members.
</P>
<P>
   His latest identity puts him on an Ohio SWAT team that is being
sued for the wrongful death of a carjacker and hostage taker. The
claims investigator is a beautiful Vietnamese refugee who will be
drawn into Aaron's world.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Manos and Husta figure out that the squad is being
systematically eliminated and they know it has to be Aaron. As
Aaron continues to track the last remaining squad members, Manos
and Husta try to find Aaron and stop him before he himself is
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kill Zone'' works because Aaron could be any member of the
SWAT team. Silver makes you understand Aaron's rage and need for
justice. Romance usually wrecks potentially good thrillers, but in
``Kill Zone'' the romance heightens the tension and makes Aaron a
much more believable character.

POPEYE LOSES HIS INNOCENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It won't supplant the nuptials of Charles and Diana as
the Wedding of the Century - and let's hope it has a happier ending
- but another impending celebrity marriage is worthy of note.
</P>
<P>
   In February, after 70 years of an often-bizarre dating
relationship that makes the Dennis Rodman-Carmen Electra saga look
like Ozzie and Harriet in comparison, Popeye the Sailor Man will
finally marry Olive Oyl.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Popeye's career as a bachelor draws to a close. (Some
people think this means that Swee' Pea was born out of wedlock. He
wasn't. He was left on Popeye's doorstep, and Popeye adopted him.
So relax. No ``Murphy Brown'' controversy here.)
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean the anchor-tattooed, mush-mouthed,
spinach-scarfing sailor will settle down? No more fights with Bluto
that leave the burly brute seeing stars? Will Popeye's thigh-sized
forearms be put to use only to lift a brood of children? Will
nationwide spinach consumption dip?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say. That's because the wedding is a one-shot deal. Once
the tale is told, that's it. There are no plans for a follow-up, in
which we see how Popeye and Olive settle into married life, said
Bob Palin. He owns Ocean Comics Inc., the company that is
publishing ``The Wedding of Popeye and Olive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of doubtful I'll have anything to do with it
again,'' Palin said from his Warwick, R.I., office, citing
unspecified disagreements with King Features Syndicate, which owns
the character.
</P>
<P>
   So Palin is putting a little bit of everything into the wedding
comic. All sorts of characters that haven't been seen in decades
will pop up, such as Ham Gravy, Olive's former boyfriend; Cole and
Nana Oyl, Olive's parents; Castor Oyl, her brother; Eugene the Jeep
and Poopdeck Pappy. And Wimpy, of course, whose hamburger
consumption must account for half of however many billions
McDonald's has served.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Wiffle Hen, the character that gives Popeye
his near-invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets his strength from spinach,'' Palin said. ``Spinach is
a cartoon thing, not part of the original (comic) strip.''
</P>
<P>
   Palin didn't want to give too much away, but look for Ham Gravy
to first try to win back Olive and then kidnap her, and for things
to progress from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an action-adventure fantasy with a lot of humor in it,''
Palin said. ``And at the end they do get married.''
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see them get married,'' Palin said. ``I've been
married 23 years. I think marriage is a cool thing. That's it, not
anything deeper than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is a little more to it. Palin, ``looking for a
profitable idea,'' pitched the wedding to King Features several
years ago, but was rebuffed. Then he noticed no one was doing
anything with Popeye and tried again; King Features gave the
go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Which still leaves me asking why. Granted, stunt events are
nothing new in comics. In the past few years Superman not only
changed uniforms, he (begin ital) died. (end ital) (And came back,
of course.)
</P>
<P>
   Popular culture is a living thing. That's why you can understand
George Clooney leaving ``E.R.'' or Van Halen getting a new singer
every few years.
</P>
<P>
   But there has to be a compelling reason to change. Too often
that reason is just to sell a product. We need continuity of
memory. Sure, Popeye may be just a comic book, but it's important
for us to have these touchstones, little facts that we know we all
can depend upon. They don't just say something about the comic
character _ they say something about us.
</P>
<P>
   There's something comforting about being able to count on
Dagwood as a nap-taking glutton who wolfs down sandwiches the size
of a space heater in the middle of the night and never gains an
ounce.
</P>
<P>
   If Popeye is being dragged out of mothballs just to get married,
why bother? Why not let him remain a bachelor, instead of drawing
him into a gimmick? He remains true to himself. As the man himself
might say, I yam what I yam. Too bad he no longer is. &QL;

AT 71, SIR COLIN DAVIS HAS GAINED RESPECT IN AN UNCONVENTIONAL
WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (fb)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the authoritative New Grove Dictionary of Music and
Musicians was published in 1980, the assessment of the English
conductor Sir Colin Davis by the influential critic and scholar
Andrew Porter seemed a bit tough. ``Davis is a conductor of
powerful enthusiasms rather than of steady all-round excellence,''
Porter wrote, ``and from this come both his strengths and his
failings.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter praised Sir Colin's strong responses to the music of
Mozart, Stravinsky, Tippett and Berlioz. Indeed, Sir Colin's
distinguished recordings of the complete orchestral and operatic
works of Berlioz during the 1960s and '70s on the Philips label
were revelatory, as were some landmark productions of Berlioz
operas at Covent Garden, where he became music director in 1971.
With Berlioz and those other composers, Porter wrote, Sir Colin's
fine musical instincts and technical finesse were ideally combined,
and his work was ``vivid, passionate, fresh and convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   But in other repertory, especially the weightier works of the
Romantic period, Porter complained, Sir Colin's ``determined
buoyancy'' and ``insistence upon advocacy'' defeated their own
ends.
</P>
<P>
   That was long ago. Since then, as music director of the Bavarian
Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1983 to 1992 and honorary conductor
of the Dresden Staatskapelle from 1990 on, Sir Colin has been
immersed in Romantic repertory: Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler. And he
has long been an important and persuasive exponent of Sibelius.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, in his capacity as music director of the
London Symphony Orchestra, he conducted a Sibelius festival,
``Northern Lights,'' that electrified critics and audiences at
Avery Fisher Hall. Only a music journalist based in England could
assess the state of the London Symphony in the context of its
illustrious 94-year history, but Sir Colin's relationship with the
orchestra must be excellent, for the Sibelius performances I heard
were supple, sonorous, nuanced and indisputably fine.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Colin and the London Symphony have come back to Avery Fisher
Hall for three concerts focusing on another enigmatic post-Romantic
composer, Sir Edward Elgar. The series, part of a larger festival,
``The Glory of Britain: Sir Edward Elgar,'' presented by Great
Performers at Lincoln Center, opens on Sunday with Elgar's
Introduction and Allegro, and Cello Concerto (with Steven Isserlis
as soloist).
</P>
<P>
   So what has changed since the New Grove assessment? At 71, Sir
Colin is a dean among international conductors. He may still not be
everyone's ideal for shaping a Verdian line or wringing passion
from a Tchaikovsky symphony, but since the early 1980s, several
major American orchestras have tried to attract him, at least as a
guest. Commitments in Europe and five children to raise have mostly
kept him away. But the New York Philharmonic has finally snagged
him officially. This season Sir Colin became the orchestra's
principal guest conductor; as such, he will spend at least three
weeks a season with the Philharmonic and forgo all work with other
American orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   But something else has happened in the larger field of music
that permits a different interpretation of Porter's criticism. For
too long, too many conductors have presented themselves as
all-purpose technicians who can step into any situation and conduct
any music, especially the central works of European Romanticism.
The results, even when perfectly competent, are often dismayingly
generic. In this setting, a conductor of ``powerful enthusiasms''
seems much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do everything,'' said Sir Colin, impeccably dressed
in a gray suit, his blue eyes clear, on the morning after his
latest performances with the New York Philharmonic. ``On the whole,
as you get older, you don't mind that you've never conducted
Wagner's `Parsifal.' Your ignorance is going to register pretty
much the same when you die as when you were alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The program he had just conducted was typical of the personal
repertory choices the Philharmonic encourages Davis to make as
principal guest conductor: Berlioz's concert overture ``Le Roi
Lear,'' which he had conducted in his debut season with the
orchestra 30 years ago, and which the orchestra had not played
since; the ``Petite Symphonie Concertante'' by the overlooked Swiss
composer Frank Martin, which had been programmed only twice in the
Philharmonic's history, and Mahler's orchestral song cycle ``Des
Knaben Wunderhorn,'' which, somehow, this orchestra steeped in
Mahler had not performed for 22 years. Next season, Davis will
conduct Sir Michael Tippett's oratorio ``A Child of Our Time,'' a
Philharmonic first.
</P>
<P>
   Given the orchestra's long and fruitful association with Sir
Colin, this new arrangement was a logical next step, said Deborah
Borda, the executive director of the Philharmonic. ``Some things
are complex, some are not,'' Borda explained. ``This is not. Sir
Colin makes great sense for the Philharmonic.'' What's more, she
added, he is interested in an entire area of repertory in which
Kurt Masur, the orchestra's music director, is not.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Sibelius performances with the London Symphony seemed a
culmination of everything Sir Colin has stood for as a musician.
(He has recorded the works superbly with that orchestra for RCA
Victor, his second survey of all seven symphonies.) His comments on
changing attitudes toward this still elusive composer are telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sibelius was considered the last great symphonist in his day
and, as such, was probably overpraised,'' he said. ``His reputation
fell. But now we recognize him as a real voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the symphonies, the juxtaposition of wildly divergent musical
materials, the wayward development of motifs, the unhinged harmonic
language and the strangely episodic construction have confounded
many conductors. But those who exaggerate the oddities in an
attempt to turn Sibelius into some weird proto-modernist can also
come to grief.
</P>
<P>
   Might it be Sir Colin's personal reserve, a stereotypical
British trait, that reins in his Sibelius and makes this curious
music seem almost lucid?
</P>
<P>
   ``My British reserve?'' he echoed playfully. ``Why, that's a
terribly personal question. Actually, when you are as emotional a
person as I, it is simply necessary to use your head.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sir Colin describes the scherzo episode of Sibelius' Fifth
Symphony, you sense head and heart working in tandem. He is like a
father telling his children scary bedtime stories with complete
dramatic command.
</P>
<P>
   ``It begins with a beautiful horn call,'' he said. ``It's a fine
spring morning. You hear a yawn, and someone turns over. There's a
sense of mystery, though everything is lovely. Everyone dances. But
something appalling happens. You don't know what it is, but the
beasts of human nature have been let out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Colin feels no less strongly these days about Elgar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to have another look,'' he said. ``At the
height of the new developments of British contemporary music after
World War II, it was fashionable to put down Elgar, a largely
self-taught son of a tradesman who tuned pianos and sold sheet
music in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it required a genius like Elgar to reinvigorate
British music so the modern masters could come along. But Elgar had
an emotional hang-up. He loved the grand gesture, great, big,
surging and full of noise. Like Sibelius, he had a nationalistic
side. But at the same time, he was wistful, melancholic and lacking
in self-confidence. We must try to forget his public show, his
snobbery, his friendship with Edward VII and the pomp in his music,
which is, unfortunately too well known.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sir Colin hopes to call attention to Elgar's Classicism
by pairing him with Beethoven. The program this afternoon includes
Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elgar worked in a music store and studied Classical scores
assiduously,'' Sir Colin said. ``He learned Mozart's G minor
Symphony bar by bar. We are pairing him here not with the
world-conquering Beethoven but with the Classical Beethoven, as in
the G major Piano Concerto, Beethoven as the great hope of music's
future.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, Sir Colin reveres Elgar for the spiritual enlightenment
his music represents. The maestro has little good to say about the
current state of culture and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a sad devaluation of imagination and the
intellect, and this applies to music absolutely,'' he said. ``Are
we allowed to talk about feeling the human spirit any longer? There
is this worship of technology. But people will get tired of buttons
and football, and will yearn again for something fulfilling.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sir Colin sounds like a musical conservative, the matter is
not so easily explained. True, he despairs of the stylistic
fragmentation that has occurred during the 20th century and yearns
for a common musical voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems clear that the revolution brought about by
Schoenberg, Stravinsky and Boulez has gone nowhere,'' he said.
``Everyone is struggling to find a voice. There are fanatical
devotees of Serialism and Neo-Classicism. But if a Mozart came
along today, would he be able to demonstrate what he could do?
There is no unification of style, too much just putting notes
together. It's like we are waiting for Godot.''
</P>
<P>
   Many musicians would counter that the revolution of Schoenberg,
Stravinsky and Boulez is very much alive, in that elements of all
their approaches are as current as ever. But the confusion that has
come from the jumbled diversity of styles today is indeed a
challenge to composers and audiences, and attempts at unification
have mostly amounted to tepid returns to neo-Romanticism, which are
not likely to satisfy anyone's yearning for the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Comments like those have made Sir Colin seem out of touch to
many younger composers. But it must be remembered that he has
conducted many contemporary scores brilliantly, including most of
Stravinsky's and numerous works by living composers. Indeed, in a
Philharmonic program in April he is pairing a new work by James
MacMillan, ``The World's Ransoming,'' with Bruckner's Eighth
Symphony. (His other program that month is all Mozart.)
</P>
<P>
   For now, Sir Colin is looking forward to another survey of
Berlioz's works with the London Symphony next season. ``I will do
everything again for the last time in my life,'' he said, while
acknowledging that the next big Berlioz year, the 200th anniversary
of the composer's birth is not far off, in 2003. ``I will let the
younger conductors take charge of that,'' he added. ``But my series
will be good for them. It will revive interest.''
</P>
<P>
   That it should. It will also provide a continuing example of how
to build a major career based on powerful enthusiasms.

TUNING IN TO THE SONG OF A WINTER TRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. Gusewelle  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lighted time display on the clock radio said two hours and
25 minutes past midnight _ a cheerless hour of morning. I lay abed
in the darkness, wondering what sound had wakened me.
</P>
<P>
   Then it came: the lonesome hoot of a train whistle, like a
drifter's howl of desolation, flung across the night from some far
part of the city to interrupt a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Between the whistle's blasts could be heard the thrumming power
of the engine, and also _ though possibly I only imagined it _ the
rattle of couplings and the click of wheels on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Fully awake, then, I listened for most of an hour.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen trains passed in that time, maybe more. Some sounded
nearer, some farther away. All announced themselves, and the
importance of their errands, with the same forlorn hoot.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes on a night of summer, with the window open beside the
bed, I've heard trains calling in the last moment before sleeping
or the first after waking. But never have the cries seemed so
urgent or so clear.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that sound is conducted better, somehow, on the
brittle winter air, or that it travels more freely with the trees
barren and no foliage to bar the way. You've noticed, perhaps, how
far the ringing blows of a woodcutter's ax can be heard through a
January woods. The phenomenon must be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between summer and winter trains is the
feeling that the sound of them evokes.
</P>
<P>
   A train whistle in July does not disturb the heart, for it
speaks mostly of commerce. A lumbering machine with its cargo of
coal or ore, or something else prosaic, is bound for somewhere of
no particular interest.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless the journey is of economic significance to someone.
But it has nothing to do with your life or with your dreams.
</P>
<P>
   At a hollow hour of a winter night, though, the effect can be
troubling, even /{transforming./}
</P>
<P>
   It starts you thinking...of places in the world you've been, and
have cared for greatly, and other places you meant sometime to go.
</P>
<P>
   Of chances wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Of the fleetness of time, and the way that inattention lets it
get away.
</P>
<P>
   Those are winter thoughts _ the kind that come when you're awake
at a strange hour, listening to the melancholy song a train is
flinging across the lonely dark.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, as you listen, you experience an epiphany, a
life-affecting revelation that changes you for all time. I suppose
that must occur sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, as happened with me, the moment passes. And you simply
sleep.

PBS' DICKENS FALLS SHORT OF PROMISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Errors are rare for Masterpiece Theatre, that perennial flagship
of BBC quality in our country. But here's an unfavorable report on
the three-part PBS offering of ``Our Mutual Friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again the production was sumptuous and the presentation
impressive, with every role honored by an able actor. The failing
is in the adaptation; or more accurately, the failure is in the
condensation that should not have been.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem contradictory because no author this side of
Victor Hugo is so eminently condensable as Charles Dickens, most of
the time. Dickens' novels generally may be enjoyed in their
elephantine entirety, or in editions streamlined for impatient
readers.
</P>
<P>
   David Lean's films of ``Great Expectations'' and ``Oliver
Twist'' attained strong dramatic edge because they were condensed;
and as far back as 1935 the Selznick-Cukor ``David Copperfield''
was a masterwork despite the absence of the novel's middle portion,
which focused on David's adolescence. By excising approximately
one-third of the text, the title character could be played by only
two actors _ a little boy and a grown man. This stratagem also
worked for Pip in ``Great Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier Dickens entries are those most easily _ sometimes
thankfully _ condensed. All of ``Pickwick'' is enjoyable, but it's
a succession of vignettes, of which any number may be subtracted
from the whole without loss of effect. ``The Old Curiosity Shop''
and ``Nicholas Nickleby'' spill over with extraneous material. But
the master's late, great ``theme'' novels are more resistant to
scissors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 20 years ago, the BBC delivered a more-or-less complete
``Our Mutual Friend'' over six or possibly seven consecutive
Sundays _ a superb rendering comparable with the fairly recent
six-hour theatrical film of ``Little Dorrit.'' Surely the Dickens
faithful would have preferred a repeat offering of the big number,
rather than this trimmed-down account. People lacking prior
acquaintance with ``Our Mutual Friend'' may have watched the
three-part edition without attaining a sense of what a fine novel
Dickens' last completed work truly is.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some Dickens scholars place ``Our Mutual Friend'' at the
top of the qualitative scale. Philip Hobsbaum in his Reader's Guide
to Charles Dickens notes that ``Apart from `Barnaby Rudge,' no one
of Dickens' novels had more trouble getting off to a start than
``Our Mutual Friend.'' Yet the one is almost the worst of his books
and the other arguably the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, ``best'' in the artistic sense. ``Our Mutual Friend''
may be the least read of Dickens' major novels, owing to its dearth
of comedy. But Dickens in his later works was a seriously committed
literary artist _ in ``Bleak House'' (damning the legal system); in
``Hard Times'' (damning industrial blight); in ``Little Dorrit''
(damning the penal system); in ``Great Expectations'' (damning
class structure); and in ``Our Mutual Friend,'' which damns a
monetary system that truly makes money the root of all evil.
</P>
<P>
   Money _ the quest for it, and the corruptibility of it _
pervades every page of ``Our Mutual Friend.'' It's Dickens' most
intricately plotted novel, actually a parallel construction of two
seemingly separate narrative threads that will, of course, come
together. It's another huge, sprawling novel, but here nothing is
superfluous and everything is essential.
</P>
<P>
   For myself, the novel's least interesting personage is John
Harmon (alias John Rokesmith), the actual ``mutual friend,'' simply
because others in this Dickens cast are more interesting, real
characters rather than caricatures _ the newly rich Boffins; Bella
Wilfer and Lizzie Hexam (Dickens' best heroines after Estella
Havisham); the blackmailer Silas Wegg; tormented schoolmaster
Bradley Headstone; Jenny Wren; Eugene Wrayburn, Rogue Riderhood
....
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm working up a fever to read ``Our Mutual Friend'' again.

`THE AGE OF TERROR': LOVE AND EVIL IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE SOVIET
UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(dal) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Plante's new novel, ``The Age of Terror,'' takes place
mostly in the Soviet Union during its bedraggled and dissipated
final years, but also in the feverish mind of its main character,
called, with American simplicity, Joe. A shy and uncertain
23-year-old man who lives in a house somewhere in the American
woods, Joe sees in a magazine a picture of the corpse of one Zoya
Kosmodemyanskaya (a photograph reproduced at the beginning of
Plante's book), a Russian martyr to wartime German cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Kosmodemyanskaya was ``a Soviet partisan who had fought for her
belief in the Soviet Union and was captured and tortured and hanged
by the enemy Germans.'' In fact, we learn very little about her in
this book. But Joe, looking at her picture, is seized by ``a
profound helplessness'' and an urgent need somehow to redeem the
suffering that is visible in the photograph.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing we know, he is in Leningrad during a snowstorm.
Wandering hatless and aimless in the streets, he meets a beautiful
woman whose name is also Zoya, and, for the remainder of Plante's
dark and mysterious tale, it is in her that Joe invests the vague
obsession awakened by the photo of Zoya's murdered namesake.
</P>
<P>
   This book by Plante, who has written 13 previous novels,
including ``Annunciation'' and ``The Native,'' bears some
similarity to ``The White Hotel,'' by D.M. Thomas, especially in
its exploration of the themes of historical evil and contemporary
madness. ``The Age of Terror'' is often powerful and disturbing but
also conceptually vague, fraught with its own Gothic qualities _
the unexplained coincidence in Zoya's name, the very pathological
haplessness of Joe, a wanderer in the fields of late Soviet moral
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   And while this kind of strangeness might normally be commended
in a novel, in this instance it weakens it. This is because the
themes that Plante seems to want to explore _ the struggle of the
human soul in the face of spiritual disintegration _ are
overwhelmed by Joe's very pathology. He is helpless beyond normal
understanding, almost inert, and these individual characteristics
seem almost irrelevant to the solid presences surrounding him.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Plante's book is an insalubrious triangle
formed by Joe, Zoya and a second American, a kind of cynical foil
to Joe who maintains a Svengali-like hold on Zoya. This is Gerald,
the son of a Southern American senator, who is dissolute, cynical,
alcoholic and evilly prescient, a man with an unerring sense of the
corrupt heart of things. With Gerald a dominant and scary figure in
Zoya's life, Joe is pressed to engage in three intermingled
struggles. One is against his own sluggish nature, another is an
Oedipal battle with Gerald, and the third is a desperate and losing
fight to interpose his love for Zoya against the soulless environs
of the late-era Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Parallel to this main story are brief, seemingly unrelated
historical fables of life in Russia and the Soviet Union, for
example, the story of a prince who shoots a bear just as he is
about to lose his estate to the newly risen Bolsheviks, or of a man
who arrives at a railway station to find a woman prostrate and
terror-stricken on the floor. Is the bear's death a symbol of
Russia's mortality under Soviet rule? Is the woman in the station,
who is raised to her feet by two men and forced out of the waiting
room, emblematic of the Russian fate, so Stygian in its brooding
illogic and menace?
</P>
<P>
   These matters are not made clear in Plante's story, though this
is not a fault in itself. ``The Age of Terror'' can be read as an
allegory of the incomprehensibility of human suffering, and, again,
as with Thomas' ``White Hotel,'' it tries to achieve its aim by
mingling several seemingly unrelated elements. But the elements,
sometimes suggestive, always edged with psychological terror, seem
gratuitously cryptic in Plante's book.
</P>
<P>
   They provide a kind of eerie background music that adds to the
surreally Gothic mood, but they remain enigmatic, precious, a kind
of experiment in mixed media rather than a sustained meditation on
innocence and evil. In the end, Joe's innocence and his tendency to
try to ingratiate himself have terrible consequences, but their
effect is mitigated by Plante's literary experimentalism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``The Age of Terror'' contains powerful images of
spiritual and material decay in a society whose fiber has been
corroded. At one point, Joe, ever feckless, decides to take a train
into the Russian countryside. He waits for hours in a line at a
ticket window, not even sure that he can buy the right ticket
there. For long periods, the ticket seller simply closes the
shutters of her window and disappears. After several more hours she
closes down permanently, and Joe and the Russians who have waited
with him simply turn away without a word of protest. Anyone who has
experienced the Soviet Union or another country in the grip of
socialist bureaucratic dictatorship will recognize the deathlike
helplessness in that scene.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the utterly unattractive yet mesmerizing Gerald
tells Joe why he went to the Soviet Union: ``because I knew
everything I was ever capable of imagining that was true had
already happened, in documented black and white, in Russia, because
Russia was, is and will be the country of the greatest suffering in
the world, beyond anyone's imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   What is documented in black and white, of course, seems to be
that photograph of the martyred Zoya, so Gerald and Joe have some
common ground aside from their competition over the living Zoya.
Both of them are drawn to Russia because it is a blank terrain
where the individual has the chance to draw something indelible on
the map of human experience. Despite the vagueness that shadows
this novel, that alone is an idea worth pondering.

<P>
   Every year on New Year's Eve, Austin landscaper Susan Cook and
friends gather at a cabin on Lake Texoma to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly every year, at the stroke of midnight, Cook is
driving down a dark road, toasting herself.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, she's late.
</P>
<P>
   It got to the point a few year ago that Cook's friends started
placing bets on when she would arrive at the cabin. They put a
sign-up sheet on the refrigerator, and ``whoever was the closest to
whenever I got there would win things like a night with Wayne
Newton,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone knows someone like Cook: the type who's always
15 minutes late getting out the door, who misses the first scene of
every movie, who keeps everyone from getting seated at the
restaurant because the hostess refuses to seat a table until the
``entire party is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Habitual lateness isn't just aggravating, it's a proclivity that
dissolves friendships, plagues marriages and has cost stragglers
fortunes. And getting over it isn't simply a matter of wearing a
watch, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not (a matter of) time management,'' insists Dr. Joseph
Ferrari, a social-personality psychologist at DePaul University in
Chicago. ``To tell (persistently tardy people) to just do it, is
like saying to a clinically depressed person to just cheer up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari, a leading researcher of procrastination, believes late
people and procrastinators are, more often than not, one in the
same. His studies have shown that 20 percent of the population
consider themselves chronic procrastinators. Ferrari places them in
two categories: arousal and avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   Arousal procrastinators seek the thrill of rushing around at the
last minute. Avoiders fear the task ahead of them. And we coddle
both kinds, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, our culture encourages people to be
procrastinators,'' says Ferrari. ``We let you fax it, Fed-Ex it,
E-mail it. We let people get away with it. Instead of being
flexible, we've become spineless.''
</P>
<P>
   Dena Lewis grew up in a household where, when lunch was called
for noon, family members wandered in anywhere between noon and 1
p.m. Today, she finds it impossible to be on time for almost
anything, including work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supposed to be here at 8:30 a.m.,'' says Lewis, public
relations manager at the Fort Worth Zoo. ``The saddest thing is I
get up at 6 in the morning, and I'm still late. The more time I
have, the more I piddle.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note to Lewis' boss: She swears she compensates by staying late
at the office.)
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Lewis' friends took it in stride. Everyone knew
she'd be late. ``I'd love to change, because I know it drives
people around me crazy,'' she says. ``My poor husband ...''
</P>
<P>
   Spouses suffer their loved ones' belatedness perhaps more
acutely than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the little pet peeves that all married couples have,
this is his biggest pet peeve with me,'' says Kelli Horst of her
husband, Scott. ``I can guarantee you, if it's something personal,
I'll be 15 minutes late. Scott won't even take a shower until I am
combing out my hair. It drives him nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Horst, public relations director at Witherspoon in Fort Worth,
manages to make it to work on time, which leads her husband to
believe that if she really wanted to, she could be early all the
time. ``Basically I've gotten to the point now that the best thing
I can do is let her know two hours in advance that deadline time is
coming up,'' he explains. ``Also, I find scathing sarcasm works
well.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a female thing, either. When Sarah Carstensen
started dating Jerome Kramer a few years ago, Kramer was so
reliably late that ``if he was picking me up at 8, I wouldn't start
getting ready until 7:30,'' Carstensen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always trying to do 35 things, and there's usually only
time to do 33,'' admits Kramer, a magazine editor in Chicago. ``I
always assume there's going to be just a little bit more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer fits perfectly into Dr. Bill Knaus' definition of a
``lateness procrastinator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost as a group, they underestimate the amount of time it's
going to take to get to where they need to go,'' notes Knaus,
psychologist and author of ``Do It Now: Beat the Procrastination
Habit,'' originally published in 1979 and revised most recently in
1998. ``They start putting on their makeup about the same time they
need to leave. And they're already thinking about what their excuse
is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Those excuses are often ``remarkably creative,'' Knaus says.
``They typically swear they'll do better next time, but the next
time comes, and they repeat the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Janie Spicer once missed a friend's wedding reception because
she just couldn't get out of the house. She was once asked to drop
out of a weekly morning tennis game, because she consistently held
up the start of the game. She says she's never missed an airplane,
but her family begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her motto is, `On time is when I get there,' and she lives by
that,'' says husband Vernon. ``She has no conception of time. She
thinks she can do three times as much on any given day as there is
time for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not intentional,'' says Spicer, who lives in Dallas.
Still, ``I know people who are so much worse than I am, and they
don't get fussed at. But I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Habitually late people don't just threaten their relationships
with others, they chip away at their own self-esteem, says Linda
Sapadin, a Long Island, N.Y., psychologist and author of ``It's
About Time! The Six Styles of Procrastination and How to Overcome
Them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to affect your sense of being in charge of your own
life,'' says Sapadin, who acknowledges that, for some people, time
is a difficult concept to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very time-obsessed society,'' she says. ``We have a
lot of time obligations, and it is a rare person who can walk
around without a watch and not look at it 20 times a day. ... We
create very artificial rhythms that are OK for some and not for
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Like latecomer Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time doesn't exist, for starters,'' Cook claims. ``It's a
completely abstract construct (created by) a whole lot of people
who have all come to the agreement that there's a certain time to
do certain things and anyone who doesn't want to do it then is
wicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook's lucky she has open-minded friends. Every year, they will
stop the clock at 10 minutes to midnight and wait for her arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is just another example,'' she says, ``of how time is
irrelevant.''

LOUISIANA MEN HELD IN CRIME SPREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Iowa, Louisiana, Texas)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Two shackled Louisiana men were marched before a
federal magistrate Tuesday and ordered held in connection with a
nine-day crime spree that included a bank robbery and the slaying
of a car salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Andrew Taylor and Timothy David Taylor, both 20, are
accused of first-degree murder, robbery, the wounding of a police
officer and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Taylor entered the federal court in Laredo with ``Serial
Killers'' scrawled in black marker across the back of his orange
jail jumpsuit and a Batman emblem drawn on his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   The other man sported a Chinese yin-yang emblem and ``Serial
Killer'' scribbled on his sleeve. The men are not related.
</P>
<P>
   The men, chained hand and foot, stood silent as U.S. Magistrate
Marcel Notzon read them their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to comment on the writing on the men's
coveralls.
</P>
<P>
   The slender men with slight goatees are believed responsible for
a crime wave that triggered a manhunt from Iowa to the Mexican
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were two very dangerous young men we were very anxious
to find,'' said Kevin Curran, supervisor for the FBI in Des Moines,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not spare expense, manpower or time,'' Curran said.
</P>
<P>
   Wanted posters were printed and a $20,000 reward had been
authorized hours before the men were captured Friday by U.S.
Customs Service inspectors in Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities grew suspicious of the men, who are believed to be
from Shreveport, La., when they were kicked out of Mexico for not
having passports. They were ordered to walk across the
international bridge to Laredo, Customs spokesman Rick Pauza said.
</P>
<P>
   Customs agents found almost $127,000 cash in the men's bags and
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The crime spree they are accused of began Jan. 7 in Shreveport,
where a car salesman was found shot to death along a rural road
after taking two men for a test drive in a sports car. Both Taylors
have been charged with first-degree murder in connection with the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Other crimes they are suspected of having committed are a bank
robbery in Lamoni, Iowa, and the wounding of Lamoni police chief
Dale Killpack, who was shot in the eye during a high-speed chase on
Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   Notzon ordered the men held in lieu of bond at the Webb County
Jail pending a hearing on possible extradition. Both Taylors told
the judge they could not afford lawyers and were assigned public
defenders.

 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star While lawmakers in Washington remain
fixated on impeachment proceedings and sex scandals, legislators in
at least 20 states, including Missouri, are working to improve the
lives of working women and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of lawmakers from Boston to Atlanta, and Denver to
Jefferson City, launched on Thursday a nationwide effort to help
working women through legislative initiatives. The wish list
includes quality child care, expanded job training, affordable
health care and more capital for women business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Challenging? Maybe. Necessary? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   These lawmakers are finally recognizing that a woman's economic
security affects not only herself but her family and her community,
according to the Center for Policy Alternatives, which is
coordinating the effort. With that in mind, the numbers paint a
pretty grim picture.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 million families maintained by women, 4.2 million were
below the poverty level in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Women make up three-fifths of all adults living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of women 65 or older are poor, compared with
less than 13 percent of men the same age.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the women in the work force do not have a pension
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have successful families if we don't pay attention to
women in the workplace,'' said Rep. Vicky Riback Wilson, who is
coordinating the effort in Missouri with the Missouri Women's
Network. ``Clearly, policies that support women also support
families and affect the economic vitality of our state.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursdays, Missouri legislators traditionally return home for
the weekend, but at least 20 men and women from both parties stayed
late last week to promote the family-friendly legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri list includes legislation that deals with child
care, domestic violence, an earned income tax credit and health
insurance for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we tried to do is show everyone that women are central to
the workplace,'' Wilson said. ``Women are in the work force, and
their economic success affects their families. That means they need
access to safe and reliable day care. That means they need access
to affordable health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is absolutely right and needs our support. When we invest
in the economic and human potential of a woman, we improve not only
her life but also her family, her community and her state. Women at
Work is published on Mondays. Write to Jilian Mincer at the

THEIR LEGISLATIVE GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   SENATE REPUBLICANS INCLUDE TAX CUT IN (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (EDS: Filed in the ``w'' cand ``f'' categories.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans, seeking to send the message
that the Senate can both legislate and conduct President Clinton's
historic impeachment trial, endorsed a 10 percent across-the-board
cut in income tax rates Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on both sides of Capitol Hill unleashed a flurry of
legislative proposals to begin the first day of legislative
business for the 106th Congress and to hear Clinton's State of the
Union address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here today to announce that the people's business is
going forward in the United States Senate,'' Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said as he introduced the Republican
legislative agenda for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan to cut taxes would take effect Jan. 1 of
this year. The 10 percent reduction, for example, would cut the 28
percent tax rate to 25.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' proposal contrasts with Clinton's more narrow
approach to tax cuts. He will seek a $500 tax credit for parents
who stay home with children age 12 months or under as well a $1,000
tax credit for people who care for a disabled child or parent.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, introduced another bill that
aims to reduce the marriage penalty by allowing married couples to
take a larger standard deduction. Because the tax code takes a
bigger bite out of higher incomes, married working couples often
pay more taxes than if they filed their tax returns as unmarried
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican tax-cut goals set up a major battle with the
White House over the use of projected federal budget surpluses.
Clinton favors using most of the money to shore-up the nation's
Social Security retirement plan. Unless Social Security is fixed,
the system is scheduled to go broke sometime after the baby boom
generation begins retiring a decade from now.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, saying that fixing Social Security also is a top
priority for them, called on Clinton to submit his plan to Congress
by March 1; they offered no details of their own plan.

   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said he favors using up to $600 billion of the $700
billion in projected federal budget surpluses over the next 10
years for tax cuts and using the rest for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the surplus is given back to the taxpayer the
government will spend it,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who said he plans to
sponsor a plan that would increase the annual IRA limit from $2,000
to $5,000 and allow after-tax contributions to 401(k) retirement
plans. The money could then be withdrawn tax-free upon retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders also introduced legislation designed
to give local school districts more control over federal education
money. A plan to require routine testing of teachers may be added
to the bill in the future.

<P>
   Lott introduced another bill Tuesday that would give U.S.
military personnel a 4.8 percent pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative schedule could be delayed by the continuing
impeachment trial.

<P>
   ``Clearly there's the possibility of an agenda disruption
because we don't know what's going to happen in the next few
weeks,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn. But he and other senators
said they could actually get more done because they are forced to
stay in town during the trial. They noted that Congress usually
doesn't get rolling on big issues until March, even in a normal
year.

SENATE REPUBLICANS INCLUDE TAX CUT IN THEIR LEGISLATIVE GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans, seeking to send the message
that the Senate can both legislate and conduct President Clinton's
historic impeachment trial, endorsed a 10 percent across-the-board
cut in income tax rates Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on both sides of Capitol Hill unleashed a flurry of
legislative proposals to begin the first day of legislative
business for the 106th Congress and to hear Clinton's State of the
Union address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here today to announce that the people's business is
going forward in the United States Senate,'' Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said as he introduced the Republican
legislative agenda for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan to cut taxes would take effect Jan. 1 of
this year. The 10 percent reduction, for example, would cut the 28
percent tax rate to 25.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' proposal contrasts with Clinton's more narrow
approach to tax cuts. He will seek a $500 tax credit for parents
who stay home with children age 12 months or under as well a $1,000
tax credit for people who care for a disabled child or parent.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, introduced another bill that
aims to reduce the marriage penalty by allowing married couples to
take a larger standard deduction. Because the tax code takes a
bigger bite out of higher incomes, married working couples often
pay more taxes than if they filed their tax returns as unmarried
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican tax-cut goals set up a major battle with the
White House over the use of projected federal budget surpluses.
Clinton favors using most of the money to shore-up the nation's
Social Security retirement plan. Unless Social Security is fixed,
the system is scheduled to go broke sometime after the baby boom
generation begins retiring a decade from now.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, saying that fixing Social Security also is a top
priority for them, called on Clinton to submit his plan to Congress
by March 1; they offered no details of their own plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said he favors using up to $600 billion of the $700
billion in projected federal budget surpluses over the next 10
years for tax cuts and using the rest for Social Security.

to $5,000 and allow after-tax contributions to 401(k) retirement

JUSTICES REFUSE TO REVIEW CALIFORNIA'S `THREE STRIKES' LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to review the
appeal of a California man sentenced to 25 years in prison for
stealing a bottle of vitamins under a controversial state law that
imposes long sentences on three-time offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member court's four most liberal justices expressed
concern with the California ruling, but only one _ Stephen G.
Breyer _ voted to hear Michael Wayne Riggs' appeal. Riggs had
claimed that California's ``three strikes'' law violates the
Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In other Supreme Court action, the justices without comment
refused to review Texas' appeal of a lower court decision that a
bankrupt University of Texas professor in Houston need not repay a
debt he allegedly owed the state. The high court also declined to
consider Fort Bend County's appeal of a decision that found the
Texas county liable for a sheriff's dismissal of deputies who had
campaigned for his vanquished opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In the California case, Riggs, homeless and hungry, stole the
vitamin bottle from a supermarket in Banning, Calif., in 1995.
Because Riggs had been convicted of robbery twice before, the
California judge was required to treat the misdemeanor as a felony
and impose the statute's minimum sentence of 25 years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   A California appellate court upheld the sentence. When the state
supreme court refused to review his case, Riggs appealed to the
U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the 25-year sentence was ``grossly
disproportionate'' and violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel
and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But Riggs was unable to convince four of the nine justices to
consider his appeal, as court rules require. Breyer, in a
two-sentence written statement, said that the court should hear the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in a statement joined by two of his
colleagues, said the question of whether Riggs' constitutional
rights were violated was ``obviously substantial.'' But, noting
that states often increase prison terms for repeat offenders
constitutionally, Stevens added that the Supreme Court should wait
for more lower court decisions on the three-strikes law before the
justices enter the legal fray.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter joined Stevens'
statement. The five other justices did not comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas case, the state in February 1995 sued Dr. William
Walker, a tenured cardiologist at the University of Texas Health
Science Center in Houston, claiming he owed the state professional
fees that he allegedly converted to personal use improperly. But
U.S. District Judge Simeon Lake III of Houston ruled against Texas,
saying that any debt Walker may have owed the state was discharged
when he filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 1, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans agreed,
prompting Texas to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Texas argued it had no notice of Walker's bankruptcy because he
had failed to identify the state or its university as a creditor on
his bankruptcy petition. State Attorney General Dan Morales added
that a state's sovereign immunity from adverse court decisions,
embodied in the 11th Amendment, bars bankruptcy courts from
relieving a debtor of money owed to a state unless the state
consents.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Fort Bend case, the county's justice of the peace, R.
George Molina, ran against the incumbent sheriff, Perry Hillegeist,
in 1992. Seven sheriff's deputies campaigned for their boss but to
no avail; Molina won the election in November 1992 and notified the
deputies the following month that their services would no longer be
required once he was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies sued the county, arguing that its employee, Molina,
had violated their First Amendment right to free speech by firing
them for endorsing his opponent. A U.S. district court jury in
Houston agreed, as did the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In its unsuccessful appeal to the justices, the county argued
that deputies serve at the pleasure of their elected bosses who
have the right to hire people of their own choosing.

IN BELFAST ASSEMBLY, DEBATE HITS NEW METAPHORIC HEIGHTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The quality of debate in the
Northern Ireland Assembly is reaching new metaphoric heights, or
depths, in the language of Ulsterspeak, the tongue used here by
politicians in which traditional euphemism is now increasingly
enhanced by fulmination.
</P>
<P>
   In the Assembly debate on a procedural motion on Monday, the 108
Protestant and Catholic members, including some of the most skilled
inveighers in the province, continued to avoid use of the words
``Catholic'' to describe Catholics, or ``Protestant'' to describe
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern Ireland, in public, Catholics are nationalists or
republicans and Protestants are unionists or loyalists. Republicans
and loyalists are accused of favoring sectarian violence;
nationalists and unionists are for political talks. The members
call themselves representatives not of a religion, but of a
tradition or a community. The sectarian killing of more than 3,200
people in the last 30 years is ``the troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the debate in the Assembly rambled on for seven hours on
Monday, it seemed as if swords of Damocles were everywhere hanging
ominously over Pandora's boxes.
</P>
<P>
   In Ulsterspeak, the peace effort was an airliner preparing to
land. Nazi jackboots stomped around the Assembly chamber in
Parliament Buildings in the Stormont area of Belfast. Little Orphan
Annie was a voice in the crowd. Guillotine blades flashed. Macho
men were wrecking the peace effort. If this kept up, the members
would all lose their jobs and the paychecks they have been getting
since the Assembly was created last year.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Assembly, by a vote of 74 to 27, accepted a
preliminary report from its Protestant and Catholic leaders that is
to be put to a definitive vote, after amendment, on Feb. 15. The
report recommends new structures of home-rule government that would
pave the way for the British government to return to Northern Irish
officials the powers it has exercised directly from London since
1974. The local officials now control only garbage removal and
burial of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Under Assembly rules, the report was approved by a simple
majority of all 108 members. But in the February vote, approval
will require a majority of both Catholic an Protestant factions,
which will probably make approval more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the procedural vote was the rising fear among
officials that the process would be interrupted, or collapsed, by
failure to solve the main problem on the peace effort: the Irish
Republican Army's refusal to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, says that the IRA will not
disarm and that its current cease-fire, now 17 months old, is
tantamount to disarmament. Protestants say there must be actual
disarmament before Sinn Fein may take part fully in the new
structures proposed in the report on Monday. The political
subtleties were mixed with opponent-bashing again and again by 30
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up against republican intransigence,'' said David
Trimble, the Protestant leader and first minister of the Assembly,
who calls himself a unionist. ``It's a question of them not
carrying out the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, the Catholic who is deputy first minister and
calls himself a nationalist, said it was like an airliner. ``Your
approval,'' he said, ``will lock us on to a flight path for
devolution by March 10,'' referring to the transfer of powers.
``There may be heavy clouds; there may be storms; there may be
flak; there may even be hijackers on board. But we can see the
lights on the runway ahead and we now know there is no going
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he finished, Mallon was interrupted by the Rev. Ian
Paisley, the flamboyant anti-Catholic leader of the Democratic
Unionist Party, who opposes the peace effort as a sell-out of
Protestants in this predominantly Protestant British province.
``We'll not ride in your plane if it has hijackers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paisley, who was ejected from the European Parliament in
Strasbourg, France, in 1988 for disturbing an address by Pope John
Paul II, said of the leaders that he could hear ``the jackboots of
their fascism'' in their report.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon had the last word. ``They may guillotine the speech,'' he
said, ``but they will not guillotine the process.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the mainstream Ulster Unionist Party's leaders, Sir Reg
Empey, advocating approval, was interrupted by Robert McCartney,
who is the only member of his U.K. Unionist Party in the Assembly,
having been abandoned by its other four members last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, poor Little Orphan Annie is making a comment,'' Sir Reg
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sharpest stings, to all members, was delivered by
David Ervine, a former Protestant paramilitary prison inmate who
now heads the Progressive Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is going down because of the macho men on both
sides,'' he said of the peace accord approved last spring. ``I
would love to see the day when I could advocate it, and stay
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm right,'' he continued, but was interrupted by a
sarcastic shout of ``You're always right!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, wouldn't it be awful,'' Ervine persisted, ``if I was
right this time because then your 29 and a half grand is going down
the tube,'' a reference to members' salaries, equivalent to about
$48,000 in a province starved for political jobs since Britain took
direct control.
</P>
<P>
   There were oooohs and guffaws in the chamber. Money was talking.

function as a constructive IOC member,'' she said. (Roughton, Cox

   Early Tuesday afternoon, visibility fell to one-quarter of a
mile as a burst of snow developed over Peoria, Ill. The small
pocket of snow was part of a swath of generally light snow and rain
that moved across the Middle West in association with a fast-moving
jet stream disturbance. Wednesday, a stripe of splotchy light rain
and snow will streak across the northern Middle Atlantic States.
Small accumulations of snow are possible, mainly in the mountains
of West Virginia. The narrowness of this stripe of precipitation
will insure partly to mostly sunny and rather mild conditions for
much of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heavy snow will fall in the central Sierra Nevada
Wednesday as a moist Pacific disturbance arrives. Snowfall in
excess of two feet is possible by Thursday morning. Farther east,
snow will accumulate on west-facing slopes of the Rockies from
Idaho to northern Arizona as moist, high-level Pacific winds are
forced to rise over the terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of dense fog will shroud east Texas Wednesday morning,
where moist air from the Gulf of Mexico settled over cooling ground
Tuesday night. Later Wednesday and Wednesday night, a batch of
showers and thunderstorms will develop across parts of the western
Gulf States and lower Mississippi Valley as moist air from the Gulf
of Mexico streams northward ahead of another disturbance emerging
from the Rockies. A few nocturnal storms may approach severe levels
across Louisiana and Arkansas before dawn Thursday morning.
Damaging winds and hail are possible in a few areas.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Gustnadoes
</P>
<P>
   Small tornadoes corkscrewed across the snow-covered landscape of
southwestern Pennsylvania on Monday. These short-lived `gustnadoes'
sprung to life as gusty thunderstorms erupted along a cold front
from the Ohio Valley. Within the storms, sinking currents of air
transferred momentum from fast winds aloft toward the Earth's
surface. As a result, strong wind gusts, with speeds over 70 mph in
spots, were observed at the ground. Like spinning a toy top, strong
horizontal winds blowing from different directions at different
speeds generated `gustnadoes' near the leading edge of strong
gusts.

   ANNIE-GET-YOUR-GUN (New York) _ The birth of a new musical: it's
all so ``Act One,'' all so invigorating. Hey, hold on a sec. Did I
say new? The show in question is ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' and while
the frantic pre-Broadway preparations, with Bernadette Peters as
pistol-packin' Annie Oakley, are indeed occurring in 1999, the date
on the musical's copyright is 1946. Although it was a critical and
popular success in the 40s, running on Broadway for 1,147
performances, the show, with music and lyrics by Irving Berlin and
book by Herbert and Dorothy Fields, has long been considered
unrevivable, in large part because of its hopelessly outdated
portrayal of Indians. The solution that the show's producers, Fran
and Barry Weissler, came up with for ``Annie Get Your Gun,'' which
begins previews on Feb. 2 at the Marquis Theater on Broadway, is
one that has become increasingly common in musical theater:
wholesale renovation. ``Basically, it's a new book,'' said Peter
Stone, the veteran librettist, with credits stretching from
``1776'' to ``Titanic,'' who was hired to bring the structure and
sensibility of ``Annie Get Your Gun'' into line with musicals of
the late 1990s. By Peter Marks.

   MODERN-MUSEUM-FILMS (Undated) _ Since 1996, the Museum of Modern
Art has waged a campaign to rescue contemporary film works
foundering in back rooms and warehouses, and to fill in a gap in
their collection in the process. ``200 for 2000'' is exactly what
it sounds like: the museum's goal of acquiring 200 films by
esteemed directors, all by the year 2000. With two more years to
go, the museum is not quite to the halfway point. With more than
16,000 titles spanning the century of cinema, the museum boasts one
of the finest collections in the world. By Kathryn Shattuck.

<P>
   DRY-CLEANING-FILM (Paris) _ Miou-Miou, 48, has appeared in good
films and bad, hits and flops, yet for 25 years France's affection
for her has not wavered. True, being loved has been no guarantee of
good screen roles or healthy box-office returns. Yet, for an entire
generation of French moviegoers, she remains reassuringly familiar.
Her very stage name, Miou-Miou, given to her by a lover when she
was barely 18, makes her sound like the gamine next door. Her
latest film is Anne Fontaine's ``Nettoyage a Sec,''or ``Dry
Cleaning,'' which was well received in France 15 months ago and
opens on Feb. 5 in New York. By Alan Riding.

   BALLET-BRITISH-COLUMBIA (Vancouver, British Columbia) _ Back in
1985, when the latest of a series of West Coast balletic phoenixes
rose tentatively from the ashes of Pacific Ballet Theater, nothing
so ambitious as a passport appeared on the agenda for the new
Ballet British Columbia. It was to be a Vancouver-based company
with a regional mission, to bring ballet to the various centers of
its home province. Less than a decade later, the company was
dancing at Whitman Hall at Brooklyn College, where it was
characterized by Anna Kisselgoff in The New York Times as ``a
handsome group of 16 classical dancers whose bold demeanor evokes
the tough, frank manner of contemporary ballet troupes in Europe.''
In its return one-week New York engagement starting Tuesday at the
Joyce Theater, the program will consist of contemporary Canadian
works, according to its artistic director John Alleyne. By William
Littler.

``The Glory of Britain: Sir Edward Elgar,'' presented by Great
Performers at Lincoln Center, opens Sunday afternoon with Elgar's
Introduction and Allegro, and Cello Concerto (with Steven Isserlis
as soloist). By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   GERMAN-SONGS-CLASSES (New York) _ At a lecture before a recent
lieder recital in Los Angeles, Graham Johnson made a case for
balkanizing Schubert, after a fashion. Johnson, a piano
accompanist, scholar and teacher based in London, suggested that
the six songs Schubert wrote to texts by Heine included in the
posthumous song cycle ``Schwanengesang'' be split off and viewed as
a free-standing work. The idea is vintage Johnson, unconventional
yet compelling. Monday, at the Juilliard School, Johnson begins a
series of five master classes for singers and accompanists focusing
on German song. By David Mermelstein.

<P>
   STEVE-LACY-JAZZ (Undated) _ Many expatriate Jazz musicians cut
off from urban America, with is racing nervous system and
Afro-Latin rhythms, often falters abroad. But Steve Lacy, a soprano
saxophonist and native New Yorker who has been living in Paris for
30 years, is an exception to the rule. Like the writer Paul Bowles
and the theatrical innovator Robert Wilson, Lacy has been nourished
by exile; he has made it his muse and, at times, his subject. He is
an urban nomad in search of routes rather than roots. By Adam
Shatz.
</P>
<P>
   VERNON-DUKE-MUSIC (Undated) _ There is something so improbably
consoling about the sadness at the heart of the best Vernon Duke
melodies. This redemptive afterglow could be a consequence of sheer
melodic sophistication; Duke knew how to construct a song,
elegantly, with surpassing craft and harmonic flair. An
aristocratic White Russian emigre turned Broadway songwriter, he
seems to have had a rather good time of it all, dressing with
notorious sartorial dash, charming in a polyglot of romance
languages chorus girls and theatrical producers alike. Among some
of his popular songs were ``Autumn in New York,'' ``April in
Paris'' and ``I Can't get Started.'' By Barry Singer.
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   PHILLY-INDIAN-ART (Undated) _ Thirty years ago, the Philadelphia
Museum of Art presented a ground-breaking exhibition titled
``Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village.'' Organized by
the art historian Stella Kramrisch (1896-1993), it brought together
work from outside India's ancient classical traditions. Much has
changed since the 1960s. Qualitative distinctions between fine art
and folk art have been rethought. Vernacular art is taking its
rightful place in elite collections. Maybe that's why the small
exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum until Feb. 3, ``Threads of
Cotton, Threads of Brass: Arts of Eastern India and Bangladesh from
the Stella Kramrisch Collection,'' carries a thrill of delight
rather than a shock of surprise. The show is, in a sense, a reprise
of ``Unknown India'' three decades later and in miniature. By
Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   TV-DILBERT (Culver City, Calif.) _ If anyone in the television
industry is afraid of corporate downsizing, it is UPN. The
struggling four-year-old broadcaster is widely seen to be on the
verge of eradication after a string of hitless seasons and notable
public relations fiascoes, like last season's ``Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a very short-lived alleged Civil War satire.
For public consumption, network officials grit their teeth and deny
it, but it is widely believed in the industry that the success or
failure of ``Dilbert'' an animation show by Scott Adams, will be a
definitive marker of UPN's ultimate _ or, ominously, short-term _
viability. By Andy Meisler.
</P>
<P>
   TV-FAMILY-GUY (Los Angeles) _ One of the things Seth MacFarlane
liked about animation when he was growing up was the way it
elasticized reality. Anvils dropped without consequence and skunks
sang in French, creating a sort of pluperfect pliability where he
could retreat from a world in which people treated him, shockingly,
like a child and enter one where he was in complete control. There,
in the manner of a visiting deity, he spoke for everyone, he had
all the money in the world, and a thought never entered anyone's
head that he didn't put there. This was, of course, perfect
training for Hollywood, where MacFarlane _ now 25, but still
growing _ remains in almost complete control of the new world he
has created: an animated half-hour comedy called ``Family Guy''
that will have its premiere on Fox next Sunday following the Super
Bowl. By Bruce Newman.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-COMEDY (Moscow) _ It's not hard to make fun of what is
happening in Russia these days. New jokes about the new rich (now
the new poor after last summer's sudden financial crisis) are
posted on the Internet. President Boris Yeltsin's fumbling speech
is always an easy laugh. There may be more comedy routines about
bank failures than there are solvent banks in Russia. But real
humor _ the deep, biting, funny-sad satire that makes Russians
laugh, usually at themselves _ has become rarer, or at least so
says Mikhail Zhvanetsky, the country's premier stand-up comedian
and humor writer. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   NY-RUSSIAN-COMEDIANS (New York) _ Everyone's a comedian. Wander
along the boardwalk in Brighton Beach, as a team of young immigrant
comics does for their twice-monthly television show. Shove a
microphone at any ordinary-looking guy in a fur hat. Has he got a
joke for you? Has he got a joke for you! Humor, the elixir that
helped relieve the aches and pains of life in the former Soviet
Union, has survived the Russian immigrants' voyage to Brooklyn. Not
only are the streets filled with wags; the Russian newspapers are
filled with page after page of jokes. The Russian-language
television and radio station, WMNB, broadcasts two locally produced
comedy shows. Transplanted Russian comics work the private-party
circuit, while the most successful of the New York City immigrant
troupes, Kanotiye, fills the 600-seat National restaurant in
Brooklyn every time the group opens a new variety show. By Susan
Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   MEDIEVAL-ARCADE-ANTIQUES (New York) _ A few months ago, Ward and
Co., New York dealers of ancient and medieval art, sent out a
lavish, fold-out booklet of photographs to display some of the rare
objects from its collection. Most of the objects were from
prehistoric or classical times, but an arresting one was from the
medieval world: an arcade, or arch, from a 12th-century Romanesque
choir screen from the church of the Abbey of Cluny in Burgundy.
This architectural fragment was enticing because it conjured up an
entire structure yet stood on its own as a piece of sculpture. By
Paula Deitz.

VAN GOGH IS AT HIS BEST IN LOS ANGELES EXHIBIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As we approach the start of the third Christian
millennium, it is probably safe to say that Vincent van Gogh
(1853-1890), the Dutch artist whose life and death now comprise the
central chapter in the modern myth of madness and creativity, is
the most popular artist of the second millennium by current
standards of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Raphael, who might have come in first 150 years ago,
would attract the crush of visitors even a modest van Gogh
exhibition generates today.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which has topped its
string of recent achievements by booking ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs:
Masterpieces From the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam,'' has prepared
for the onslaught. Installed in museum's new annex in the former
May Co. department store, the exhibition could attract as many as
900,000 visitors during its run.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, van Gogh shows have consistently
generated excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh is so popular because he is so good. Whatever their
knowledge or background, alert viewers confronting a van Gogh
canvas, even having to share space with a number of others, will
have an experience close to what the artist intended. Although it
is true that poor Vincent, who died before his work reached any
sort of public beyond his closest friends and family members, would
be astonished by the crowd that turns out to see his work today.
</P>
<P>
   Astonished but gratified. Van Gogh, a one-time evangelist to the
poor, painted for the people, not for an elite. He had simple
things to say about how he felt, how the world looked to him, how
experience was rich in both joy and pain and all the gradations of
feeling in between, and he found a way to communicate his feelings
that was uniquely expressive. At the start of his painting career,
he wrote, ``I want to get to the point where people say of my work:
That man feels deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   With no other painter do we feel so close. And a large part of
the reason why is that van Gogh left his painting process visible
on the surface of the canvas. In his mature works from 1887 until
his death, we can see virtually every stroke of paint he applied to
the canvas. Not only did he leave a uniquely sensuous record of his
process, he left a record of how he thought and felt from moment to
moment. The liberation of the brush stroke that forms a major theme
of modern painting shifts into high gear with van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   The trajectory of van Gogh's brief career _ he painted for only
eight years, from 1882 to 1890 _ is revealed in the exhibition,
which was made possible by the closing for renovation and expansion
of Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum. (It appeared earlier, to tremendous
crowds, at the National Gallery in Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   Including only 70 paintings, it shows the artist grappling with
subject and technique. His triumphant discovery of color as an
equivalent to personal feeling is its central event.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent's rapid progress is marked by a number of masterpieces,
several of which _ ``Potato Eaters'' (1885), ``The Bedroom'' (1888)
and ``Wheatfield with Crows'' (1890) _ are icons of modern art.
There are seven of the remarkable self-portraits that have helped
fuel his posthumous celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the promise in its title, the exhibition is not all
masterpieces, but the inclusion of many secondary works helps to
make the great paintings appear as the great achievements they are.
(And what a delight some of the minor works are. ``Flowerpot with
Chives,'' a tiny still life from 1887, is as beautiful as any work
in the genre.)
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition catalog (Abrams, $37.50), which serves as a good
introduction to van Gogh's life and career while focusing
discussion on paintings in the show, emphasizes the hard work and
intelligence van Gogh brought to his art. It attempts, perhaps
futilely, to downplay the more dramatic events of his life, and it
stresses that he was a lucid and rational being while he painted
and that his violent episodes were brief, if extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is spaciously installed. Paintings are grouped
together in chronological order according to where they were made _
sequentially, Holland and Antwerp, Paris, Arles, St. Remy and,
finally, Auvers. Inexplicably, the moment in 1886 when Vincent
first experienced color's liberation is muddied by deviation from
strict chronology.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest painting on view, ``Scheveningen Beach in Stormy
Weather'' (1882), is crude, but it shows that the essential Vincent
was already there. The characteristic thickly laid paint is present
in the heavy gray sky looming over the beach, and he is already
using bold parallel lines of hatching, a crucial part of the
abstract visual language he invented, to delineate beach grass in
the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   The work Vincent did in the low countries is dark in an
old-masterish manner. Browns dominate such masterpieces as ``Potato
Eaters'' and ``Basket With Potatoes'' (1885), which looks as if it
were painted with dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Color, a characteristic of his work that helps guarantee its
popularity today, started to enter his painting boldly when he
first moved to Paris, but it was only after he moved to Provence
that it began to sing. In one of his memorable letters to his
brother Theo, painted here on the gallery wall, van Gogh wrote in
August 1888, ``Instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have
before my eyes, I use color more arbitrarily in order to express
myself forcibly.''
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of his liberation are evident in the galleries
devoted to painting from Arles. The famous ``The Bedroom,'' with
its looming yellow bed, is an image of unrestrained, almost
childlike joy. A modest interior with no sign of luxury, it is a
brave emblem of van Gogh's hopes for a better life in the warm
South in a community of his peers. That it didn't turn out the way
he intended is indeed tragedy, but the fact that he left such a
record of his aspirations is the sign of his victory as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' continues at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, 5900 Wilshire Drive. It is open seven days a week
from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. through May 16. Tickets are $20 for an adult
on the weekend, $17.50 during the week, and are available from
Ticketmaster, 213-462-2787. Museum members receive two free tickets

   Thirty years ago, the Philadelphia Museum of Art presented a
ground-breaking exhibition titled ``Unknown India: Ritual Art in
Tribe and Village.'' The show was aptly named.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the art historian Stella Kramrisch (1896-1993), it
brought together work from outside India's ancient classical
traditions. Instead of grand temple sculptures, one found
pocket-size metal images cast in a threadlike filigree technique
and intended for home altars. Rather than court paintings, there
were embroidered textiles stitched by women from recycled saris
with scenes of local weddings, and storytelling scrolls
illustrating Hindu epics in a style as vivid and fantastic as
anything produced by Bombay film studios today.
</P>
<P>
   This was, in short, art for everyday life, of a kind still
produced in rural India. But with its relatively modern dates
(mostly 19th and 20th century), and its ``folk art'' look, it was a
kind of material seldom on display in mainstream museums and little
known to Western audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since the 1960s. Qualitative distinctions
between fine art and folk art have been rethought. Vernacular art
is taking its rightful place in elite collections. Maybe that's why
the small exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum, ``Threads of
Cotton, Threads of Brass: Arts of Eastern India and Bangladesh from
the Stella Kramrisch Collection'' (through May 30), carries a
thrill of delight rather than a shock of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The show is, in a sense, a reprise of ``Unknown India'' three
decades later and in miniature. But the real ``unknown'' here may
be Kramrisch herself, a former curator at the museum, and one of
the century's outstanding art historians. When she died, obituaries
in the national press were few. Although she had been a pioneering
figure in her field, the field itself _ the art of South Asia _ is
one that only a handful of people in the West know or care much
about.
</P>
<P>
   Kramrisch knew it intimately and cared about it passionately.
This comes across in her writing. Her two best-known books, ``The
Hindu Temple'' (1946) and ``The Presence of Shiva'' (1981), are
total immersion experiences, almost trance-inducing with their
insistent verbal cadences and their dense web of references to
myth, literature and visual symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   But her investment in Indian culture is perhaps most evident in
the life she lived, a brief account of which was written by the
Sanskrit scholar Barbara Stoler Miller in 1983 as an introduction
to a book of Kramrisch's essays, ``Exploring India's Sacred Art''
(out of print in the United States, but available in an Indian
edition).
</P>
<P>
   Kramrisch was born in what is now Czechoslovakia, the only child
of two bookish, upper-middle-class parents, who moved to Vienna
before she began grade school. The city was rich in cultural
ferment. Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele were the contemporary
artists Kramrisch grew up with; she saw Nijinsky dance with the
Ballets Russes. (She studied dance herself and performed publicly
while still in her teens.)
</P>
<P>
   She was fascinated by the work of Northern European mystical
writers like Meister Eckhart and Jakob Boehme, and Asian philosophy
was in the air in the years around World War I. She encountered it
in Kandinsky's writing on art and in the Theosophy of Rudolf
Steiner (whom she knew). Her early discovery of the Bhagavad-Gita
in German translation confirmed her specific interest in Indian
culture.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only after she finished a dissertation on early
Buddhist sculpture at the University of Vienna in 1919 that she
visited India for the first time. On a trip to England she met the
poet Rabindranath Tagore, who invited her to a school he had
established in Bengal. She went straight from London to Bombay,
stopping in Vienna only long enough to meet with her parents in the
railway station.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years she was teaching art at the University of
Calcutta, the only woman and the only European on the faculty. She
remained something of an outsider to both Indian and colonial
social circles, neither of whom knew quite what to make of her. But
she seems not to have cared. She lived alone in a house in the
grounds of the university's botanical garden, accompanied by a pet
hyena and steeped in her work.
</P>
<P>
   That work resulted in extensive travel across the subcontinent
to visit and document Buddhist sites and Hindu temples, some of
them renowned, many crumbling and forgotten. In the countryside she
studied the dynamic world of Bengali village life and culture, and
many of the objects in ``Threads of Cotton, Threads of Brass'' are
among those she collected in the field in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   She also experienced Indian religion firsthand when she became a
devotee of Shiva and the disciple of a Tantric monk. In Miller's
account, he subjected her to a harrowing initiation at Kalighat
temple in Calcutta, having her sit on a corpse ready for cremation,
and pulling her off only when the fire had been lit. Kramrisch did
not, one suspects, undergo the ordeal in a spirit of scientific
disinterest, and the emotional commitment and risk it entailed
subtly warms her scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, she married an India-based Hungarian economist, Laszlo
Nemenyi, though they spent most of their 21-year marriage apart,
absorbed in separate careers. He was named economic adviser to the
new government in Pakistan in 1947. Nationalist sentiment ran high
at the time and Kramrisch's position in Calcutta grew
uncomfortable. She had planned to spend her life in India, but when
Nemenyi was shot and killed in Karachi in 1950, she left for
America. Within a few years she began working at the Philadelphia
Museum and teaching at the University of Pennsylvania and New York
University's Institute of Fine Art.
</P>
<P>
   Academic fashions come and go, and research is, to some degree,
based on a principle of planned obsolescence. The work of any one
scholar is, after all, meant to be refined or challenged or simply
superseded by that of another. And in an era when sociologically
derived Western theory has been a primary interpretive lens through
which non-Western art is viewed, Kramrisch's metaphysical approach
to Indian art and architecture, always criticized by some
historians, has fallen somewhat out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   But the tides are always shifting; the present climate seems
increasingly to encourage the synthesis of a wide range of
disciplines and approaches, old and new, orthodox and otherwise. In
any case, the catalog Kramrisch wrote for ``Unknown India'' remains
one of her monuments. So does the extraordinary collection of
Indian art she brought to the Philadelphia Museum, now overseen by
her curatorial successor, the gifted young American art historian
Darielle Mason.
</P>
<P>
   Some pieces arrived with Kramrisch in 1950 and were sold to the
museum a few years later. Such was the case with a fabulous
sandstone sculpture of the multiarmed goddess Durga, bursting with
aggressive energy from her carved niche. Other works, including
most of the pieces in ``Threads of Cotton, Threads of Brass'' she
willed to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Durga is on permanent display; most of the village and
tribal objects, many not exhibited since ``Unknown India'' 30 years
ago, will return to storage at the end of the show. It's great to
see them together now. As one moves back and forth from classical
stone icons of Buddhas and Hindu deities to the tiny images of
brass horses and quilts sewn with scenes of village life, the
marriage of elite and popular traditions that is the essence of
Indian art becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   And popular traditions are, after a long period of apparent
decline, on the upswing, as was evident in a show of contemporary
embroidered quilts organized by Molly Aitken at the Asia Society
last summer. These quilts were executed with exactly the same
technique as the 19th-century pieces in Philadelphia, but their
narratives now dealt with pressing, up-to-the-minute social issues
like spousal abuse, female infanticide and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Kramrisch would doubtless have found the results fascinating and
heartening, both as evidence of continuity with the past and
spiritual tenacity in the present. This is the kind of response
that profound cultural empathy can produce. Kramrisch had such
empathy and it is a hidden thread that binds together a museum
collection that she shaped equally with her scholarship and her
spirit. &QL;

IN THE DUST OF EMPIRES, ST. PETERSBURG EMBRACES GREAT WRITERS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By HERBERT MITGANG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Below a Byronesque statue of Alexander
Pushkin that stands in a small park in front of the Russian Museum
near Nevsky Prospekt, some present-day romantic has placed three
long-stemmed red roses, now fading, at the poet's feet. Wandering
around the canaled streets of the old capital, which bears far
greater witness to its czarist legacy than to its scarred Leningrad
past, a visitor is struck by the respect paid to literary
eminences.
</P>
<P>
   Authors and even their fictional characters are regarded with
adulation. Though nothing is closer in memory here than the Great
Patriotic War, as World War II is known, poets and novelists are
also celebrated, a reminder of the burning desire of litterateurs
to be heard despite harassment and censorship during the Stalinist
era. Poets do outlast tyrants.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more personal museums is the 11-room Pushkin Museum,
with his documents, writing desk, canes and the waistcoat he wore
when he was shot in a fatal duel.
</P>
<P>
   The Dostoyevsky Memorial Museum includes manuscripts and
photographs and maps illustrating places connected with his life
and characters. A walking tour embraces sites related to ``Crime
and Punishment,'' including Raskolnikov's flats and the murder
route in the novel.
</P>
<P>
   The most amusing outdoor monument shows a sculptured granite
nose, with no other facial features. It can be found at the
supposed spot on Voznesensky Prospekt where in Gogol's classic
story ``The Nose,'' the character known as Major Kovalev, an
official assessor and shakedown artist, lost his nose, which then
acquired a life of its own. With a wink at the reader, Gogol ended
his story: ``Say what you like, but such incidents do happen in the
world _ rarely, but they do happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest literary museum honors a naturalized American,
Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, and is situated in the very
building at Bolshaya Morskaya, 47, near St. Isaac's Cathedral in
the fashionable Admiralteiskaya neighborhood, where he was born 100
years ago this April. The building survived the German siege of
Leningrad in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov himself described its appearance in ``Speak, Memory,''
his 1967 memoir: ``We have moved now to our town house, a stylish
Italianate construction of pink Finnish granite built by my
grandfather circa 1885, with floral frescoes above the third
(upper) story and a second-floor oriel, in St. Petersburg (now
Leningrad), 47 Morskaya (now Hertzen Street). The children occupied
the third floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin was born 200 years ago
this June, joint literary celebrations for the authors are being
planned in the spring and summer. Scholars will gather in Pushkin's
more spacious museum, at 12 Moyka Embankment, and visitors will be
able to see the refurbished Nabokov birthplace and one of his
family's former estates outside St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   It makes literary sense to commemorate them together. Nabokov
translated ``Eugene Onegin,'' the verse-novel that is Pushkin's
masterpiece. After Pushkin's ``Ode to Liberty'' and some of his
satirical verses offended the czarist court, he was exiled to
southern Russia. Nabokov went into self-imposed exile, emigrating
in 1940 to the United States, where he taught Russian and English
literature at Wellesley and Cornell. ``My course is a kind of
detective investigation of the mystery of literary structures,'' he
said. Because of his work as a lepidopterist, he was also
affiliated with Harvard as a research scientist.
</P>
<P>
   After the success of ``Lolita,'' ``Pnin'' and other writings, he
and his wife, Vera, made their home in the Montreux-Palace et
Cygne, a grande dame of a hotel overlooking Lake Geneva in
Montreux, Switzerland. Nabokov rather enjoyed the nickname
conferred on him in his cygnelike setting, ``The black swan of
Montreux.'' They lived there for 18 years, until his death in 1977
at the age of 78.
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov's writings were banned in the Soviet Union at the time,
but his books were smuggled into the country. Now they are
published in St. Petersburg and Moscow; both film versions of
``Lolita'' have been shown on Russian screens.
</P>
<P>
   The V.V. Nabokov Museum opened last spring as a private
enterprise after a determined effort by a small group of Nabokov
admirers. Its space included only the Nabokov family's foyer,
library, dining area and a large meeting room. The upper two floors
are occupied by Nevsky Times, an independent daily paper of
cultural and educational news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the museum off the ground was very difficult,'' said
Dr. Vadim Potrovich Stark, its director. ``The St. Petersburg
administration said it had no funds, but if we could raise the
money ourselves we had their permission to go ahead. We slowly
gained sponsors from Russian and foreign sources. We're now
planning an international conference in April, putting together an
educational program for students and visitors and trying to make a
film about the museum.''
</P>
<P>
   A seedy luxury is visible in the carved wooden ceilings,
fireplaces, piano and period furniture, some of which resembles the
century-old originals. In the largest room there is a long table
with dozens of high-backed chairs, once used for meetings conducted
by Nabokov's father, who was a leader of the independent
Constitutional Democratic Party before World War I. Nabokov had
boxing and fencing lessons in that room.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent exhibition illustrates Nabokov's life in Russia,
England, Germany, France, the United States and Switzerland.
Dangling from the ceiling is a rather primitive painting of the
Nabokov family's coat of arms, two fierce lions and a raised arm
holding a sword aloft. A second painting shows a forlorn but
accurately detailed butterfly drawn by Nabokov himself. There are
photographs of the Nabokov family and their three former country
houses. The photographs were donated by Nabokov's son, Dmitri, and
Nabokov's sister, Elena.
</P>
<P>
   Three groups support the museum: the Nabokov Foundation in St.
Petersburg; DORN, a small publishing house that issues Nabokov's
books as well as those of Pushkin and other Russians, and a
privately owned Internet provider called Computer Net that works
with museums. There are a couple of Russian movie posters under a
glass case showing Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert in the recent
film version of ``Lolita.'' While he was in Russia for the opening
of the movie last year, Dmitri Nabokov visited his grandfather's
mansion and admired the work being done to establish the museum.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent telephone conversation with Dmitri Nabokov at
his home in Montreux, he commented on the two movie versions of
``Lolita.'' ``The old Stanley Kubrick film was not bad, but my
father felt that it had nothing to do with his novel,'' he said.
``The current film by Adrian Lyne is more faithful to the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his own Nabokov Literary Foundation, Dmitri Nabokov has
been coordinating a number of events honoring his father in Russia,
Europe and the United States. There is to be a traveling exhibition
in Europe, a colloquium of scholars in St. Petersburg, discussions
at Town Hall in New York and an exhibition in the Berg Collection
at the New York Public Library in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Where will he be at birthday time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be celebrating my father's two birthdays in two different
places,'' he said. Two?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied. ``I'll be in St. Petersburg on April 10;
that's his birthday on the old calendar. And I'll be back in
Montreux on April 22, where the town is planning big doings in his
honor. Actually, my father considered April 23rd his real birthday,
abiding by the new calendar. Wherever, 1999 is going to be a
Nabokov year.''

FRIENDS DON'T HOLD BACK IN `ART'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 Stars 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While you're standing in line to get into the van
Gogh exhibit at LACMA, strike up a conversation with your
companion(s) on the question ``What is art?'' (Don't worry _ you'll
have plenty of time.) Whether you're still talking to one another
by the time you've fought the crowd for a look at ``The Potato
Eaters'' will say volumes about your friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing art, after all, is a slippery slope. Talk in
absolutes, and you're likely to fall on your ass _ or sound like
one. Inevitably, whenever you express an opinion about art, you
are, in essence, expressing something about yourself, too, no
matter how sophisticated, educated or erudite you may be.
</P>
<P>
   That is at the heart of ``Art'' at the Doolittle Theatre in
Hollywood, Yasmina Reza's Tony Award-winning play that is every bit
as good as the hype _ witty and wonderfully acted and staged.
</P>
<P>
   The art in this case is a 5-by-4 foot painting that Serge
(Victor Garber), a dermatologist, has bought for 200,000 francs
($40,000). A pretty pricey purchase even for a successful
dermatologist, but when his friend Marc (Alan Alda), a successful
aeronautical engineer, sees it, he is stunned. The painting is all
white. Well, it does have these diagonal lines that they argue
about. Marc ridicules Serge for buying it, for spending so much
money and thus validating what he considers garbage. Serge shoots
back that Marc is an enemy of modernism, a nostalgia merchant. But
the argument becomes more personal: Marc, who has been a mentor to
Serge, feels betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, both turn to their mutual friend, Yvan (Alfred
Molina), sort of the class clown of this middle-age trio. Unlike
his friends, he has never found professional success (only recently
venturing into the stationery business through connections with his
bride-to-be). Unlike his nattily dressed pals, Yvan is rumpled and
stressed out by the upcoming wedding. More eager to please his
friends than express an opinion, Yvan is uncomfortable being drawn
into what he sees as a silly quarrel. Of course, his attempts to
smooth things over only meet with contempt from Serge and Marc.
</P>
<P>
   It becomes clear after a while that the argument is only on its
surface about the dynamics of Serge's white painting and its worth.
``Art'' is more about the dynamics of friendship and its values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art'' was originally written in French, and the trio are
Parisians. And despite its Americanized translation, some critics
have argued that no trio of red-blooded American men would be
caught dead arguing about the aesthetics of modern art. But change
the subject to fishing, and it's the same dynamic _ Serge with his
new gizmos and lures, Marc with an old-fashioned bamboo pole and
Yvan who likes to be out on the water because it's a respite from
the chaos of his life and just wants his friends to quit rocking
the boat.
</P>
<P>
   But making the spat about a work of art (or whether it is or
not), takes the play beyond mere male competitiveness and rituals.
On stage, Marc sits in a Queen Anne-style chair, Serge a modern,
angular model and Yvan in an overstuffed armchair to define their
territories. The aesthetics of art are a secular religion to Marc
and Serge, and, as with all people with belief systems, much of who
they are is invested in them, which is why Marc can't abide Serge's
purchase and why Serge can't stand Marc's inflexibility. Yvan is
the agnostic of the group. He's not sure what art is. He's not even
sure what he likes.
</P>
<P>
   While Reza provides the actors with a laugh-filled, razor-sharp
script, there is no question there are three artists up on the
stage. Under the direction of Matthew Warchus, the trio of Alda,
Garber and Molina simply sparkle with impeccable comic timing. Reza
couldn't have written it as funny as these three make it. There is
one scene in which the three _ sitting around trying to calm
themselves after a heated argument _ are eating olives, spitting
out the pits and putting them into an ashtray. The night has
already been the pits, and they've been chewing each other up
anyway. The nonverbal scene goes on for a couple of minutes and is
hilarious. There is another scene in which Molina spews out his
personal problems for what seems like five minutes. After a while,
you have no idea what he's saying, but it doesn't matter. It's just
an amazing bit.
</P>
<P>
   As I was leaving ``Art'' _ after the curtain calls and standing
ovations _ a middle-age woman turned to her male companion
(presumably her husband) and said, ``I know which one you are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean?'' he countered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know which of the three you are.'' And then, seeing my
interest, she said, ``We'll talk about this at home.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's ``Art,'' a great theater experience you can take
home.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: ``Art'' _ though, of course, I'm opening myself
to criticism _ is art. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Facing strong opposition to the possible sale of
Jasper Johns' only public artwork, the board of Lincoln Center for
the Performing Arts has called a special meeting for Monday to
discuss the disposition of the painting, the monumental ``Numbers,
1964,'' which has been on view in the New York State Theater for 35
years.
</P>
<P>
   The center has received offers of more than $15 million, and the
board has endorsed the idea of a sale. But the mere suggestion of
parting with the signature artwork, which hangs just east of the
box office, has drawn what center officials described as
unexpectedly heavy opposition, some of it coming from board
members, a major donor, the directors of the Metropolitan Museum of
Art and the Museum of Modern Art, and Johns himself.
</P>
<P>
   The State Theater's two longtime tenants are divided on the
sale, with the New York City Opera endorsing it and the New York
City Ballet arguing against it. This would be the first time
Lincoln Center has sold off one of its artworks.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum to the board dated Friday, Beverly Sills, the
center's chairwoman, and Nathan Leventhal, its president, wrote,
``There is no denying that the potential sale has struck a raw
nerve in a segment of the city whose wholehearted support of
Lincoln Center will be critical in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   While noting that ``it is very disconcerting at the very least
that the potential sale of the painting has evoked such a uniform
negative reaction,'' Ms. Sills and Leventhal emphasized that the
proceeds would go toward the center's endowment and capital needs
at a critical time. ``Among other things,'' they wrote, ``any sale
proceeds could be used to help defray the costs of capital
renovations of most of our campus buildings, which, with one
exception, are approaching 40 years in age.''
</P>
<P>
   They described the State Theater as ``most in need of
renovation.'' And they wrote that ``consideration should be given
to insuring that the painting, either immediately or after a
certain number of years, is placed on more suitable public display
in a major museum.'' They also wrote that Lincoln Center intended
to set aside a portion of any sales money for the purchase of
additional art.
</P>
<P>
   But while the center has retained a lawyer to handle inquiries
about the painting and even to solicit new offers, broad sectors of
the New York cultural world are declaring their outrage over the
possible sale.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Gund, president of the Museum of Modern Art, wrote to Ms.
Sills and Leventhal, ``The sale of an important work by a living
artist, specifically created to celebrate an art institution,
cannot help but undermine that institution's commitment to the
public and to art generally.''
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Museum director Philippe de Montebello and Modern
director Glenn Lowry have strongly opposed the sale. In a letter,
Lowry said that removing the painting ``would be to fundamentally
alter its meaning, not to mention the intention of the artist.'' He
continued, ``It is no more a disposable asset than are the arches
of the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of this, Leventhal and Ms. Sills reported in their memo
that they had already ``received word from one foundation that
provides major funding to Lincoln Center that it will cease its
support if we sell the Johns.'' They added, ``We fear there may be
others who share similar concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possible sale won the endorsement of the financially
struggling New York City Opera. ``We feel that something of this
quality and now of this value requires to be in a private home or a
museum,'' said the company's general and artistic director, Paul
Kellogg. ``To keep it at the New York State Theater is dangerous.''
He said the cost of guards for the painting was $120,000 a year
``and that's hard for us to sustain.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the State Theater was in need of repair, Kellogg
said that money had just been raised for a feasibility study on
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet company, on the other hand, opposes the sale of the
painting. The memo from Ms. Sills and Leventhal said that Randal
Craft, the City Ballet's counsel, had asked them to ``refrain from
taking any action on the sale of `Numbers' at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Craft asked for a clarification of the ownership of the
painting, which was commissioned for the site by Philip Johnson,
one of the theater's architects. Craft said the ballet company
believed that a sale would be contrary to understandings reached
with Johns at the time the painting was made.
</P>
<P>
   Although Leventhal and Ms. Sills wrote that there was an
``overwhelming sense of the board that it was in favor'' of a sale,
two members spoke out in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon Davis and I voted against it and we were totally
ignored,'' said Dorothy Cullman, a philanthropist. ``They looked
upon us as though we were lepers.'' Davis, a real estate lawyer, is
the chairman of Jazz at Lincoln Center and the former New York City
Parks Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cullman said she thought ``the whole thing is greed, greed,
greed. They could easily raise the money. No cultural institution
should behave this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gund has offered to help raise money and write some checks
herself to help out the ailing State Theater. The theater is owned
by the city and leased to Lincoln Center, which in turn leases it
to the City Center of Music and Drama Inc., the original parent of
the City Ballet and the City Opera. Lincoln Center maintains it is
free to sell the painting, but the state Attorney General's office
is looking into the ownership issue and has approached Lincoln
Center about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   While auction house experts say the painting is worth about $10
million, people close to the board who spoke on condition of
anonymity said there were private buyers willing to pay as much as
$15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers,'' measuring 9 feet by 7 feet, is a historically
important painting. It is the largest of the artist's numbers
motifs and the only one in which each number is a separate unit, on
a separate stretcher, fashioned from a material called Sculpmetal
and then bolted to the other units. Johns chose to work in
Sculpmetal because of its durability.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding whether to sell the work, Leventhal and Ms. Sills
wrote, ``perhaps the most serious risk that we have to weigh is the
reaction of both major opinion makers and potential donors to
Lincoln Center.''

SIX COMPANIES SETTLE CHARGES OF MISUSING `MADE IN USA' LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in the ``f'' and ``w'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Trade Commission announced Tuesday that
it had reached settlements with six companies that had been charged
with misleading consumers by labeling a variety of their products
with the ``Made in USA'' logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this will get out the message to businesses and to
consumers that the FTC will not allow the `Made in USA' label to be
misused,'' commission spokesman Howard Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the six companies, while not admitting that they misled
consumers, agreed to stop using the label on products identified by
the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires that a product using the label be
manufactured in the United States using parts that are primarily
made here.
</P>
<P>
   The six companies are Stanley Works, a tool manufacturer; the
American Honda Motor Co. Inc., a distributor of Honda automobiles,
motorcycles and power products; Kubota Tractor Corp., which
distributes lawn tractors, lawn mowers and related products;
Johnson Worldwide Associates Inc., which makes outdoor recreation
products, such as fishing poles and boat motors; USDrives Corp., a
manufacturer of CD-ROM drives; Rand International Leisure Products
Ltd., a wholesaler of imported bicycles and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the FTC proposed easing the definition of ``Made
in USA'' to reflect changes in the economy. The new guidelines
would have allowed a product to use the label if 75 percent of its
parts were made in America.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed guidelines were met by a wave of resistance,
including more than 1,000 letters to the agency demanding that the
label be allowed only for goods that are totally produced in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes also came under fire from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good enough for the FTC to require that the truth be
a 75 percent item,'' Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., said in August
1997. ``We think the American people want to know whether a product
is made in the USA. Lying, or lying just a little bit, is not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Many economists and manufacturers, however, say the current
guidelines ignore the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are imported components in virtually everything,'' said
Robert Cumby, a professor of economics at Georgetown University.
``From textiles to electronics, it's quite difficult to find
products made 100 percent in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Cumby said changes in the U.S. economy have made questions over
manufacturing content irrelevant and outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the modern world, and particularly in the United States,
employment has shifted from workers on the assembly line to office
workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on factory workers focuses attention on what drove
the American economy in years past and fails to recognize that the
United States is now a service-based economy, Cumby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the research and design that goes into a product?
Or the marketing to make Nike shoes popular? Or even the
distribution networks that get the product to the store?'' he said.
``These jobs, which are almost exclusively in the United States,
are the kinds of jobs we want in our country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are also often a bigger factor in the overall cost of a
product than the cost of manufacturing it.''

GORE APPRAISES TORNADO DAMAGE, TALKS WITH VICTIMS' SURVIVORS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Tenn. _ Anna Bledsoe stood quietly Tuesday in front of
the house on Fleming Road where she grew up. Half of it was still
standing. The rest lay all about, shredded by tornadoes that
whipped through Western Tennessee on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   She thought of her 91-year-old mother, Bertha Garrett, who lived
in the house until recently, when Ms. Bledsoe moved her into a
nursing home. ``At least I've still got my momma,'' she said.
``This fella who lived next door doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Garrett's 81-year-old neighbor, Lurabelle Dorris, was one
of eight people in three counties who were killed by the tornadoes.
All that remained of her house was its foundation. She was home
alone when the winds blew ferociously, pushing the house and all
her belongings well beyond her yard, ripped to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of houses and businesses damaged, cars and school
buses overturned, electrical towers crumpled and more than 100
people injured, Tennessee authorities have not assessed the cost of
damages throughout the region. Vice President Al Gore, who toured
Madison County by helicopter Tuesday with federal and state
officials, told a group of neighbors in one hard-hit subdivision
that at least 10 counties would be eligible for federal disaster
relief.
</P>
<P>
   In a quick trip here, designed to get him back to Washington in
time for President Clinton's state of the union message, Gore
walked along several streets that were littered with fallen trees,
debris from damaged roofs and front yards filled with furniture and
other personal belongings. Many neighbors thanked him as he chatted
with families along Chester Levee Road and Park Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   But as his entourage left, some residents just stood staring
blankly at what was once a home and a life.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, a veteran of post-disaster inspections, this one
carried heavier weight than usual. His mother, Pauline Gore, grew
up in Jackson County, and many of the vice president's relatives
still live there. Mrs. Gore's brother, Whit LaFon, 80, a retired
circuit court judge, accompanied his nephew on the neighborhood
tour, but viewing far worse than he suffered, only a damaged roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one that really hits home for me,'' Gore said,
speaking to reporters and neighbors at a street corner. ``I have
been to quite a few disaster sites around the country. When it hits
this close to home, when your family members are in the tornadoes'
line, it really hits you in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Tanner, a Democrat whose district includes Jackson,
shook his head in amazement. ``I've been around here a long time,
and I've never seen anything like this,'' he said. ``One
subdivision we didn't go to today, there's nothing higher than my
waist for a half a mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said they could hardly believe that more people
did not die, given the widespread destruction. While Madison
County, where six died, was hit hardest, many homes and businesses
in surrounding counties also suffered damage.
</P>
<P>
   Here along Chester Levee Road, neighbors gazed in wonderment at
the haphazard path the tornadoes took, decimating some houses,
leaving others untouched. Ken Bowman pointed down the street toward
his house, which suffered major structural damage, and his red
truck, which was destroyed by falling trees. ``It's totalled,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least he found a moment to chuckle. Bowman is a collision
appraiser for a local auto body shop. ``Guess I'll appraise
myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After walking the neighborhood, Gore visited several injured
people at Jackson-Madison County Hospital. One was Logan Jordan, a
5-year-old boy who suffered head injuries and sat in a wheelchair
with his head bandaged as Gore tried unsuccessfully to coax a smile
out of him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also met with Jamie Thomas, 18, whose father was killed
when their house was lifted off its foundation and flew 50 feet
before landing on top of them.
</P>

   James Lee Witt, director of the federal Emergency Management
Agency, who flew here with Gore, declined to compare the
devastation here with any other caused by tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always found that whether it's five houses or 300, the
impact on a family or business is always the same,'' he said.
``It's always tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt said that federal officials in Tulsa are about to test a
cement-made ``safe room,'' an above-ground structure that could be
built into new houses to withstand tornado-force winds. It is
expected to add up to $3,000 to the price of a home and would be
especially effective, Witt said, in tornado-prone areas like
Florida and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to save the house,'' Witt said. ''But it could
save a life.''

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT TO LIFT BAN ON HUMAN EMBRYO EXPERIMENTS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government said Tuesday it would move ahead
with plans to fund research on ``stem cells'' from discarded human
fetuses and embryos, despite a law that prohibits the use of
federal funds to create the controversial but medically promising
cell lines for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health,
told members of a presidential ethics commission that the decision
to fund the experiments was based on a conclusion by government
lawyers that the prohibition against creation of the cell lines
does not apply to research, once the cells are created with
non-government funds.
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits embryonic research, he said, not research on
cells that have been grown from embryos. He noted that the cell
lines cannot possibly become human beings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is ensure that our investigators are
following the law and that they're following a set of guidelines
that we will design according to the kind of advice we have
received over the years and the kind we expect to receive over the
next few weeks,'' Varmus said.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells _ primitive cells that have not yet
``differentiated'' to form specific organs _ theoretically could be
used to produce specific types of mature cells such as the nerve
cells that degenerate during conditions such as Parkinson's disease
or Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their capacity to become various types of tissue, the
cells are known as ``pluripotent'' cells. Guided by the mother's
hormones, such cells quickly set off on their individual growing
paths in the womb, with some becoming bone, others cartilage,
others skin and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Converging lines of research in such areas as genetic
engineering, cloning and reproductive biology have led to the hope
that the differentiation process can be artificially controlled,
and the stem cells induced to develop into specified tissues. The
tissues might be used to treat such diseases as Parkinson's
disease, Alzheimer's, AIDS and cancer, or even to grow
``autologous'' organ transplants from a patch of the recipient's
own skin.
</P>
<P>
   These prospects cleared a basic hurdle last November with
separate announcements by researchers John Gearhart of Johns
Hopkins University and James Thompson of the University of
Wisconsin in Madison that they had successfully isolated the cells
from fetuses and fertilized human eggs and induced them to grow in
laboratory dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The cells appear to multiply eternally without aging and
eventually dying the way cells in a fully developed individual do,
the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus denied that by funding research on the existing cell
lines, the government will be encouraging their creation.
Bio-engineering companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers are
rushing into the field in the hopes of creating new classes of
drugs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, far more embryos are discarded at in-vitro
fertilization laboratories than would be needed for the research.
The same is true of stem cells harvested from aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus told members of the National Bioethics Advisory
Commission the ban would be lifted only after ``consultations''
with the White House and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Congress since 1994 has prohibited the use federal funds for
human embryo research.
</P>
<P>
   But Gearhart and Thompson both told the commission that NIH
funding is necessary to attract top scientists to the field and to
provide government guidelines and oversight of the developing
science. Gearhart said his research is funded by a private company,
which retains commercial rights to it.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Smith, a researcher from Scotland's University of
Edinburgh, told members of the commission of research in which he
had successfully induced pluripotent stem cells from mice to grow
only into nerve cells, removing genetic directions that would have
led to other types of tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning techniques suggest it might be even possible to create
pluripotent stem cell lines without egg-sperm fertilization, but in
the merger of ``somatic'' cells, such as those in a patch of skin,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an unparalleled opportunity in human medicine for
ultimately generating tissue replacement, using our own cells,''
Smith said. ``These are all dreams, if you like, and if we're to
make any progress, there are major scientific questions to be
answered.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Through dark clouds and heavy rain, Jordan's
King Hussein piloted his own plane home Tuesday after six months of
cancer treatments and received an emotional welcoming by hundreds
of thousands of loyal subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Operating the controls on his royal jet as he landed at Marka
military airport seemed a perfect symbol for a monarch who has
steered his tiny kingdom through political turmoil, regional war,
economic uncertainty, and peace with neighboring Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Through nearly a half-century of rule, Hussein has taken Jordan
from a backward desert outpost to a stable, modern and vibrant
society.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his ill health, Hussein remains firmly at the controls
of government. But he comes home to a royal palace awash in rumors
of succession to his throne. And Hussein, 63, has strongly hinted
at changes to the country's monarchical government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then we have to review, we have to see what
needs to be done,'' he told reporters upon his arrival Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a few words of appreciation for overseeing the
country's affairs during the king's absence, there was little
mention of Crown Prince Hassan, the king's brother, or of his
future role in the government.
</P>
<P>
   One palace source said that for Hassan to be overlooked as heir
to the throne would be a surprising and unlikely development. The
family tension instead surrounds the next succession, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jordan's constitution, if Hassan became king the
crown would pass to his oldest son, Rashid. But Hussein has for
years spoken vaguely of ``democratizing'' the throne. This has
fueled speculation that Hussein wants the crown eventually to
revert back to Hamzah, 19, his oldest son by his fourth wife, the
American-born Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the palace intrigue, relations between Queen Noor and
Hassan's wife, Princess Sarvath, are said to be cool.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the family troubles, there was a genuinely warm
welcome home. Hussein, wearing a dark blue suit and a red-and-white
kaffiyeh, fell to his knees and prayed on a carpet set on the
tarmac after departing the aircraft. Several family members wiped
tears from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat was among hundreds
of dignitaries who were on hand to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was discharged last month from the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., where he had been undergoing treatment. He has
endured six rounds of chemotherapy since mid-July to treat
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a type of cancer affecting lymph glands, and
recuperated in London for two weeks ahead of his return home.
</P>
<P>
   From the airport, he and Queen Noor, dressed in white with an
aqua scarf, were chauffeured in a cream-colored Mercedes Benz
through the streets of Amman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rain, Hussein poked his head through the sun roof
and waved to hundreds of thousands of cheering Jordanians who lined
the streets. The motorcade rolled past modern skyscrapers, Amman
University, the Hussein Medical Center, and solidly middle class
apartment buildings, all testimony to the king's success in
transforming Amman from a desert wilderness to a shiny, modern
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not standing here in the rain because he is a king, but
because he is such a great servant to this country,'' said Zeydoon
Halaseh, 33, an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Streets were festooned with lights and banners and
billboard-sized portraits of the king. One banner read, ``Your
return home is like the return of the soul to the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians honked horns, waved flags and danced to loudspeakers
blaring with ``Hashmi, Hashmi,'' a popular Jordanian song honoring
King Hussein's descent from Hashem, the grandfather of the Prophet
Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   Bedouin tribesmen set up tents along the roadside and
slaughtered sheep and camels, to be donated to the poor, as a way
to offer their thanks for Hussein's safe arrival.
</P>
<P>
   It is a unique relationship that this king has to his people.
Today most of Jordan's citizens are the children of Palestinian
refugees dispossessed by the creation of Israel in 1948 and the
subsequent 1967 Six-Day War. There are also Bedouin tribes,
indigenous Christians, secular democrats and a vocal Muslim
fundamentalist minority.
</P>
<P>
   That Hussein holds together this diverse population with such
popularity is extraordinary in a region where corrupt and inept
kings, emirs and dictators often engender resentment and insurgency
among their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemite dynasty took power of the land in 1920 after a
British-backed Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Hussein
inherited the throne in 1952 at age 16, a year after he stood next
to his grandfather as King Abdullah was assasinated in Jerusalem.
Hussein has been king for nearly a half century, and more than 80
percent of Jordanians have known no other ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Many on the streets, including traditionally dressed housewives,
chanted: ``With our blood, with our souls, we sacrifice to you,
King Hussein.''

   ATHOME-EXCITE _ High-speed Internet provider At Home Corp. is
buying Excite Inc., one of the leading destinations on the World
Wide Web, for about $6.7 billion in stock in one of the largest
Internet company deals ever. The deal announced today would surpass
America Online Inc.'s $4.2 billion acquisition of Netscape
Communications Corp. last year. Based on closing stock prices
Friday, Excite is worth about $3.4 billion, meaning that At Home
would be paying a huge premium. The deal could eventually give AT&AMP;T
Corp. control of one of the highly sought-after portals that serve
as entry points onto the Internet. At Home is owned by
Tele-Communications Inc., Cox Communications and several other
investors. TCI is in the process of merging with AT&AMP;T Corp. in a
$39 billion deal that is expected to be completed by spring.

loss for the fourth quarter. The onetime charges resulted mostly

naivete but not corruption. ``Even though I have not broken my
Olympic oath nor violated IOC rules, I have lost my ability to
function as a constructive IOC member,'' she said. (Roughton, Cox

   LUANDA, Angola _ In the office where he is a typist, 24-year-old
Paido said, he sits near a window on the street. If he sees
soldiers starting to grab young men, he can slip out the back door.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in high school, he had no warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking with two girls,'' he said. ``And they called me.
I was too close to them, so I couldn't run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though my identification card said I was underage _ and
that was true _ I was big,'' he continued, puffing out his chest,
``they insisted I was old enough, and they grabbed me and took me
to a police station. It was full of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put me in a cell with the other kids while the cops went
to get trucks. When they capture you they immediately send you to
the provinces for training, far away where you don't know anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very lucky. A neighbor saw me being taken and told my
mother. My uncle is a policeman, and he talked to the station
commander. When the rest of the guys were loaded on the trucks, my
uncle got me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Paido, who declined to give his surname, was describing army
recruitment, Angolan style.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the war in this country has again grown so fierce that
the United Nations is on the verge of abandoning its peace observer
mission here, the fear of press gangs is once more very real. As
combat spreads and the war in the Congo consumes other troops, the
government needs new cannon fodder.
</P>
<P>
   But after 30 years of civil war, volunteers for the watersheds
of glory that have sent a river of one-legged men back to beg on
the streets of Luanda are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Angola does not have a consistent draft system, but in times of
need, the government has demanded that young men register and then
called them up.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, during periods of crisis, though, neither the
government nor the rebels have been shy about simply seizing the
troops they needed.
</P>
<P>
   It has not yet come to that in Luanda. A period of draft
registration started this week for 18-to-20-year-olds, and lines
formed around police stations as the young men lined up to comply.
But some quickly ran out of registration forms for the second day
in a row, leaving crowds of young men milling around aimlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Some were angry. At a center in the Maianga neighborhood, the
rumor spread that there were 170 exemption cards to be handed out
in the district and that 160 had been sold to rich families.
</P>
<P>
   At the Maianga center, Silas Ignacio, 18, said he had been there
at 7 a.m. to do his duty by signing up, but that he had no taste
for the fight. Twenty years ago, he said, when men his father's age
were fighting alongside Cuban trainers to drive out the South
Africans helping the Unita rebels, he would have gone willingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your country is invaded, you have to defend it,'' he
said. ``But in this case, we don't want to make fire on our
brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   All the young men had heard that their foe, the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, uses child soldiers. Osman
Silva, 19, said the rebel group, known by its Portuguese acronym,
Unita, had forcibly conscripted his sister when she was 17.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would feel about possibly facing women and children
in combat, Simon Luis Manuel, 18, said: ``It would make me very
sad. I feel bad for these kids, 10, 12 years old, roped in like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   None had heard anything enticing about military life. Manuel
said his elder brother had come back from years of service missing
an eye, lame, and mentally unbalanced. ``He is in the street now,''
he said. ``He gets no support from the government.''
</P>
<P>
   In a long war of attrition, military analysts say, the odds
favor the government. It keeps finding new offshore oil reserves,
while the diamond-studded riverbeds that fund the war machine of
Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader, have been heavily dug over and
require expensive deep mining.
</P>
<P>
   And the war has chased many of this country's 11 million people
to the cities, which the government controls, making recruitment
easier for it and harder for Unita. But it could keep up guerrilla
warfare for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   As in many wars, it is the poor who are called to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos, a 22-year-old friend of Paido's, said he had registered
at 18 and again at 20, but was saved from call-up by the 1994 peace
treaty that has just collapsed. To avoid being pressed into
service, though, he used to sneak into high school by climbing a
back wall because the police would set up checkpoints 150 feet from
the front gate. ``And you wouldn't ride in cars,'' he said. ``They
got stopped all the time. You walked everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had the money, he said, he would bribe someone for a
tourist visa to Europe, fly there and just disappear. After
Christmas, as the rumor spread that the army would start forcible
recruiting in January, 14 young men from his apartment building
alone absconded to Portugal, Angola's former colonial power, or to
Holland, Switzerland or Canada. Most had relatives in those
countries who sent money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Older former soldiers are sometimes sympathetic. ``I lost two
toes on a land mine _ it's time for somebody else to go lose body
parts now,'' said Pedro Benjamin, 32, a taxi driver. ``But it's not
the same cause any more. We were fighting the South Africans
before, or the colonialists.''
</P>
<P>
   In his office, Paido stared out the window at the street. There
were no press gangs in sight yet, and he hoped there would not be.
But the new rumor is that those up to age 26 will have to register
next, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't life,'' he moaned. ``If you are young in this
country, life stops. You are on standby until the government
decides what to do with you.''

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS OPEN DEFENSE OF CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff tried to
plant seeds of doubt Tuesday at the Senate impeachment trial of
President Clinton, characterizing the House Republican case against
the president at one point as ``prosecutorial ... fudge.''
</P>
<P>
   In a two-and-a-half hour overview of the president's defense,
Ruff contended that the facts of the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal
are open to interpretation and do not prove Clinton lied and
obstructed justice in hiding his affair with the former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they did, Clinton's actions do not rise to the level
of impeachable offenses, Ruff argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that
have been preferred against him,'' said Ruff, speaking in the well
of the Senate on the fourth day of Clinton's trial. ``He did not
commit perjury. He did not obstruct justice. He must not be removed
from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, who suffers from a paralyzing disease he contracted as a
young man in Africa, spoke from his wheelchair to the senators who
listened attentively at their desks. The audience in the packed
galleries included actress-comedian Whoopi Goldberg and actor Frank
Langella.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, Ruff said, ``is not a remedy for private wrongs;
it's a method of removing someone whose continued presence in
office would cause grave danger to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's goal Tuesday was to sow the seeds of doubt among senators
about the case against Clinton presented last week by House
prosecutors. It would take a two thirds of the Senate _ 67 if all
100 senators are voting _ to convict and remove Clinton from
office. Republicans, who dominate the chamber by a 55-45 margin,
would need at least 12 Democratic votes to reach that number.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ruff called the House GOP presentation a
``witches' brew of charges.'' He also called it ``nothing more than
a rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   His presentation won praise even among some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ruff did present a forceful case, an emotional case,''
said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The White House team ``poked holes where they wanted to poke
holes,'' said Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont. ``They made a good
presentation.'' But there was little evidence that Ruff altered
Republicans' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Democrats seemed impressed. ``I think Mr. Ruff
really did poke some holes in the allegations by the prosecution,
holes that I didn't know existed,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said that while she had problems
hearing Ruff at first, ``at the end, well, you could have heard a
pin drop ... It was powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors who sat silently at their table throughout
Ruff's presentation were critical. ``Our case isn't made of
spider's webs and sealing wax,'' as Ruff had charged, said Rep.
James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. ``It's made of testimony under oath.
It's made of facts. It's made of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House defense will continue Wednesday and Thursday
with a more detailed examination of the facts and the law by White
House special counsel Gregory Craig and Clinton's private lawyer,
David Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, a former Watergate prosecutor and U.S. attorney in
Washington, D.C., opened with a recitation of the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, in which Jones, a former
Arkansas employee, charged that in 1991 Clinton, then governor of
the state, made crude advances and asked her for oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyers subpoenaed Lewinsky in an effort to prove Clinton
had improper relations with other women. That subpoena, plus
Pentagon employee Linda Tripp's surreptitious taping of phone calls
in which Lewinsky discussed her sexual relationship with Clinton,
set the current scandal in motion.
</P>
<P>
   As he has on past occasions, Ruff drew a distinction between
Clinton's conduct with Lewinsky and his role as a twice-elected
president. ``We are not here to defend William Clinton the man,''
Ruff said. ``We are here to defend William Clinton the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff accused the Republican House prosecutors of spinning the
facts in a way that was least favorable to Clinton, citing examples
of what he labeled ``prosecutorial _ what shall we call it? _
fudge.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of Clinton's alleged obstruction of justice, the
prosecutors told senators last week that during the final
Clinton-Lewinsky meeting in the White House on Dec. 28, 1997,
Clinton responded ``I don't know'' or ``let me think about that''
when Lewinsky suggested that his secretary, Betty Currie, should
take the gifts he had given Lewinsky in order to hide them from
Jones' lawyers, who had subpoenaed them.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff argued Tuesday that Lewinsky talked or wrote about that
conversation at least 10 times during the course of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation last year. On some of those
occasions, Lewinsky reported Clinton did not respond at all to her
suggestion, Ruff said. He added that in all of her accounts of the
discussion Lewinsky never said Clinton directed her to hide gifts
the two had exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff also asked why, if Clinton wanted to conceal gifts, did he
give Lewinsky more gifts at the Dec. 28 meeting. Last week, House
prosecutors argued that those gifts was part of a strategy to keep
Lewinsky in Clinton's orbit at a time when the Jones lawyers were
closing in.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said House prosecutors overlooked what he characterized as
the most obvious explanation: Clinton ``simply was not concerned''
about gifts in the context of the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   He also attacked as ``prosecutorial fudge-making'' another House
GOP argument _ that the efforts of Clinton and his friend Vernon
Jordan to find Lewinsky a job in New York intensified after Clinton
learned on Dec. 6, 1997, that Lewinsky would be subpoenaed in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff focused on Dec. 11, 1997, the day that Jordan called two
prospective employers in New York and met with Lewinsky. On that
day, the federal judge in the Jones case, Susan Webber Wright,
informed lawyers on both sides she would permit Jones' lawyers to
probe for information on female government employees that Clinton
propositioned or with whom he had sex.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House prosecutors suggested that the judge's
order put pressure on Jordan and Clinton to intensify their job
search for Lewinsky. Actually, Ruff said, the judge did not inform
the lawyers of her decision until she convened a conference call at
5:33 p.m. central time. Ruff said Jordan had made his calls to New
York hours earlier and at the time of Wright's call was on a flight
to Amsterdam. Since he was unaware of the judge's decision, it
could not have influenced his efforts earlier that day on
Lewinsky's behalf, Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   He also took aim at the Republicans' invocation of patriotic
themes in arguing that Clinton must go. In his closing argument
last Saturday, House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
said the nation's war dead would be dishonored if Clinton is
allowed to remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, his voice choked with emotion, cited his own father, who
fought in the Normandy invasion in World War II. ``He didn't fight,
no one fought, for one side of this case or the other,'' Ruff said.
``He fought as all those did, for our country and our Constitution.
And as long as each of us ... does his or her constitutional duty,
those who fought for their country will be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Ruff chided House prosecutors for declaring their case
against Clinton airtight while insisting that witnesses must be
called at the Senate trial to resolve factual contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   After Ruff's presentation, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said it
made a stronger case for calling witnesses because Ruff challenged
the testimony of key witnesses including Lewinsky and Currie.
Senate Democrats and the White House have opposed calling
witnesses.

SATELLITES KEEP AN EYE ON CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The old joke that Californians are spaced out
has a whole new meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden State's glorious, complex, sometimes scary ecosystem
_ with soaring hawks, snow-capped peaks and skyscraper-shaking
quakes _ is increasingly monitored from space by satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental satellites orbit hundreds or thousands of miles
above Earth. State agencies increasingly use satellites to monitor
the 800-mile ecological wonderland from the Oregon border to the
U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades after former Gov. Jerry Brown drew national ridicule
(and the label ``Governor Moonbeam'') for urging the state to
exploit space technology, it has done just that.
</P>
<P>
   California now operates the largest nonfederal satellite
communications system in the United States, said Terry Keel,
satellite system administrator for the state Office of Emergency
Services. ``Brown was ahead of his time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the satellites can:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep an eye on rising rivers during winter floods.
</P>
<P>
   _ Track migrations of endangered birds and bighorn sheep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Help in search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assure communications during natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monitor the health of forests threatened by vehicle exhaust,
loggers and arsonists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Measure air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spot earthquake faults.
</P>
<P>
   A joint state-federal project is using a satellite to assess the
health of forests and other vegetation. As part of the ``Change
Detection Project,'' analysts recently studied the forests of the
southern Sierra Nevada from Calaveras County in the north to Kern
County in the south.
</P>
<P>
   According to the still-unpublished findings, there is no
evidence in satellite images taken between 1990 and 1995 of
significant tree losses in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's stunning about the southern Sierra results is how
nonapocalyptic they are. The forest cover seems pretty stable. ...
Very local areas have ozone damage (to trees), but it hasn't led to
a big die-off. ... There are some moderate declines in areas, but
they're matched by moderate increases in other areas,'' said Greg
Greenwood, a research manager in the Fire and Resource Assessment
Program at the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone gas is generated by vehicles and agricultural equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, the agency plans to begin using satellite
photos to assess the fate of trees on the north coast, stretching
up to the Oregon border and east to the western edge of the
Sacramento Valley. It is an area so politically contentious that
environmentalists have chained themselves to trees to discourage
loggers.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood expects to issue the report on north coast forests
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The images for such work are taken by an instrument called the
thematic mapper. The terrain is depicted in different wavelengths
of light, ranging from visible light to the near-infrared region of
the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   In near-infrared images, ``healthy vegetation is very, very
bright red,'' said Lisa Levien of the U.S. Forest Service, which is
assisting the state.
</P>
<P>
   On July 10, 1996, tens of thousands of tons of rock fell off a
Yosemite cliff, killing a hiker and shredding a forest. The
resulting thicket of broken trees and shattered boulders was
difficult for rescuers to penetrate in their search for other
possible bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a jumble of tree branches and tree stumps, and you had
to pick your way through,'' recalled Dave Kehrlein, a geographer
for the Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   To keep them from repeatedly covering the same ground, rescuers
used radio transmitters linked to satellites to map the terrain. As
it turned out, only one person died.
</P>
<P>
   The mapping system has been used for other projects, such as
monitoring the shifting perimeters of large forest fires and
brushfires.
</P>
<P>
   Such information is valuable for fighting big fires, especially
in mountainous areas. During vast blazes, firefighters can become
scattered and confused by uneven topography.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a major disaster, such as an earthquake that
could cripple conventional phone lines, the authorities can use a
$10 million satellite communications network for communication.

WHERE SEXUAL LINES ARE EASILY CROSSED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILL JOYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to issues of sexual identity, European films can
be difficult for American viewers to talk about or even understand
fully. We assume that Europeans, whose leaders can carry on
extramarital affairs without falling from grace, are more
sophisticated, more laissez-faire about sex in general and,
specifically, about the blurring of hetero-, bi- and homosexuality.
But we can't quite figure out how they achieve this nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, as heterosexual and gay Americans have
used movies to discuss our sexual differences and how they still
matter, we've mainly chatted about a string of Hollywood romantic
comedies: ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' ``In and Out,'' ``As Good
as It Gets,'' ``The Opposite of Sex'' and ``The Object of My
Affection.''
</P>
<P>
   We may object to their glossy, picture-perfect unreality, their
need to wink and underline their own hipness on matters sexual. But
it's probably these very qualities that help us talk so freely. In
``The Object of My Affection,'' Jennifer Aniston is a heterosexual
mother-to-be who wants her gay roommate (Paul Rudd) to rear a child
with her. ``We can make this up for ourselves; none of the old
rules apply,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   We may groan, but deep down we're cheering on the unlikely
couple, because making this up for ourselves is just what most of
us are trying to do as we adjust to the vagaries of relationships _
sexual, racial, familial _ in 1999 America.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a rare exception like the delightful 1997 ``Ma Vie en
Rose,'' in which a young boy disrupts a Belgian suburb because he
knows he should be a girl, European films offer little of the
playful unreality that lets viewers laugh, identify and scoff at
once. Instead, a European film often plunges Americans into a
spare, hyper-realistic world that seems almost futuristic because
labels like gay or straight are rarely mentioned and the old rules
really (italics)don't(end italics) apply.
</P>
<P>
   Such hyper-realism works by forcing viewers to feel unsettled,
threatened and inarticulate while deciphering psychosexual
situations they might never have envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of creative disruption is certainly achieved by three
European films that Americans will have a chance to see in the next
several weeks. Two of the films, Anne Fontaine's ``Dry Cleaning''
and Benoit Jacquot's ``School of Flesh,'' are French; ``The Trio,''
directed by Hermine Huntgeburth, is German. Although they are by no
means equally accomplished, all of these films use coupling across
the sexes and within the sexes to make particular questions of
sexual identity and sexual courage resonate more broadly _
becoming, simply, questions of identity and courage.
</P>
<P>
   As unalike as they are in tone, ``Dry Cleaning,'' which opens on
Friday, and ``The Trio,'' which will open Feb. 12, start with a
similar, fairly unoriginal dramatic premise: a stranger falls into
the midst of a troubled domestic arrangement and acts as a catalyst
for reassessment.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dry Cleaning,'' which is set in a small city in eastern
France, the stranger is Loic (Stanislas Merhar), a scruffily
handsome young man who performs with his sister Marylin in a
transvestite singing act, the Ladies of the Night. When Marylin
decides to retire, Loic befriends and goes to work for Nicole
Kunstler (Miou-Miou) and her husband, Jean-Marie (Charles Berling),
who operate a dry-cleaning business and lead a highly conventional
life but had been intrigued by the Ladies on a rare night out.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Loic is intent on not-so-subtly helping Nicole regain
a sense of herself as a sexual being and as a misfit (those who
remember Miou-Miou in Bertrand Blier's anarchic ``Going Places'' of
25 years ago will wince at the irony). Gradually, however, as he
learns the business, his attention turns to Jean-Marie, and the
film takes on a darker mood as the two men try to parse currents of
friendship, mentorship and passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dry Cleaning'' at times feels too much like a psychology
experiment: the director, Ms. Fontaine, has said that her film is
about decontrolling in the face of mutation of identity. But it
becomes something more. Just as Loic jars Nicole and Jean-Marie
into questioning convention, Merhar, a powerful newcomer, seems to
draw Miou-Miou and Berling, two fine veterans, into the sort of
ensemble performance that is incidentally insightful _ greater than
the material itself.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ambisexual interloper in ``The Trio,'' an altogether more
amiable movie, is Rudolf (Felix Eitner), an altogether more amiable
young man who is invited to join a father-and-daughter team of con
artists, Zobel (Gotz George) and Lizzie (Jeanette Hain), after
their partner Karl (Christian Redl) is incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   Zobel is an aging, flamboyant homosexual who has reared Lizzie
while loving and browbeating Karl; Lizzie is a cute, cynical
observer, ready to strike out on her own as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The elements of the sexual equation are clearer here than in
``Dry Cleaning'' _ the competition between father and daughter for
Rudolf's affections is outright, occasionally comic and almost
sentimental. But again, the fact that the story unfolds naturally,
without self-conscious references to the designations or
assumptions of sexuality, means that the gamesmanship can serve a
deeper purpose. In this case, that purpose is to examine how trust
between two humans survives beyond the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is also at the center of ``The School of Flesh,'' which
opens Feb. 26. But in Jacquot's experienced hands, the subject is
dissected in a much more complicated manner. Adapted from a novel
by the Japanese master of sensual brinksmanship Yukio Mishima, this
movie stars Isabelle Huppert as a well-to-do Parisian divorcee
named Dominique who is a powerful but lonely fashion-industry
executive. Late one evening, she and a female friend stumble into a
gay bar, where she spots a gorgeous young bartender named Quentin
(Vincent Martinez). Mesmerized, she seeks out information about him
and eventually proposes to him that he live with her as a kept man.
</P>
<P>
   Here, again, a young man of unclassifiable sexuality represents
a challenge to a status quo beyond a mere sexual status quo.
Because Quentin is clearly an unrepentant creature of the streets,
and is of Algerian descent, Dominique's experiment has to do not
just with sex and the possibilities of romance but also with
expectations about class and ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   And about male-female roles: she uses her money to manipulate
Vincent as, more traditionally, an older man might buy a younger
woman. Several of the best scenes in ``The School of Flesh'' are
discussions between Dominique and Cordier (Bernard Le Coq), a
powerful, homosexual lawyer who once supported Quentin in a similar
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Sexuality, it's implied, is not so much a closed-door,
delimiting area of one's existence as it is a currency of
possibility for young and old, man and woman, rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   As far from the gloss of Hollywood as they are, ``The School of
Flesh'' and ``The Trio'' both end as ``The Object of My Affection''
does: with a coda set in years hence, whereby the viewer can find
out the results of the risks taken by the principals, sexually and
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to have seen ``The Object of My Affection'' to
know that its coda is a happy one. Nevertheless, perhaps this slim
similarity indicates something important about the riddles of
sexual identity: we all are alike in wanting others to know and
accept us as we are _ and also as we can imagine being.

PERRY TAKES OFFICE AS FIRST REPUBLICAN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF
TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Rick Perry was sworn in Tuesday as the first
Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, vowing to set aside
political partisanship and serve as the state's second-highest
ranking politician ``with honesty and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Democratic state representative from Haskell County,
the 48-year-old Perry follows in the footsteps of the colorful and
often irascible Bob Bullock, a Democrat from Hillsboro, who did not
seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred years from now, I want the members of the 126th
Legislature to look back on our work and recall that we made life
better for our citizens _ particularly our children, our senior
citizens and the less fortunate among us,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated many of the messages from his campaign, saying
Texas must continue to invest in its public schools, improve its
criminal justice system and meet its human service priorities.
</P>
<P>
   That done, Perry added, ``we should give the people of Texas
some of their money back in the form of tax cuts'' _ a line that
drew applause from the crowd that swarmed the south lawn of the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts, fewer governmental regulations and limited government
would help ``create the jobs, the opportunity and innovation Texas
needs to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry also acknowledged two of his heroes, his father, Ray Perry
_ a former Haskell County commissioner, farmer and rancher _ and
former President Bush. Both were at the swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   And he praised Gov. George W. Bush, saying the governor
``brought respect, civility and unity to state government. He's cut
taxes, he's restrained government growth, and he's improved the
health, education and welfare of the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry also said the governor is ``the type of person we can
point out to our children and say, `I want you to grow up and be
like him.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush runs for president in 2000 and wins, Perry would move to
the state's No. 1 position.
</P>
<P>
   Perry switched political parties in 1989, about a year before he
left the Texas House; he successfully ran for state agriculture
commissioner in 1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any way we can predict what the next
century will bring any more than those who stood on these grounds
100 years ago could,'' Perry said. ``But we can be sure that Texans
will continue to lead, to innovate, to improve the lives of our
children and those in need, and to change the world into the next
millennium.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT SEES ANTITRUST TRIAL AS FOILING ITS INTERNET DEALS
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft Corp. official suggested Tuesday that
the company's high-profile antitrust battle with the government may
have had a chilling effect on the company's capacity to enter into
blockbuster deals to enhance its Internet clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting question and that may well be the case,''
said spokesman Mark Murray when a reporter raised the issue. ``What
is clear is that the government is trying to restrict Microsoft's
ability to compete. But the company's policy remains to focus on
the best interests of our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray spoke on the federal courthouse steps a day after At
Home, which provides broadband cable services to a potential 60
million users, said it will acquire Excite Inc., an Internet portal
site, in a stock swap valued at about $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft maintains its own gateway to cyberspace,
Silicon Valley insiders speculate that the Redmond, Wash., software
giant might be interested in entering into a mega-deal with Yahoo,
another popular portal which also has become a darling of Wall
Street investors. Microsoft enjoys a huge market capitalization,
the second largest of all traded companies, and has about a $19.25
billion war chest to spend on potential acquisitions. But while the
company theoretically has the resources to enter into any merger it
chooses to, it must take into account the prospect of further
antitrust litigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the company reported a profit of $1.98 billion, or
73 cents a share, for its second fiscal quarter, on record sales of
$4.94 billion. Microsoft shares closed at a 52-week high of $155.62
a share, up $5.87 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials credited the strong earnings' showing to
high-volume shipments of personal computers pre-loaded with its
flagship product, the Windows operating system. In addition, they
cited improved demand for Microsoft's Windows NT servers,
workstations and the Office '97 applications suite.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock has continued to soar during the 13-week-old
trial _ without seeming regard to the struggle with the Justice
Department and 19 states, which have accused the company of seeking
to use its vast market power to dominate the Internet. Many
financial analysts have said that while the trial is worth
watching, it should not pose a major concern for investors.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Microsoft's litigators had urged that government
to drop its case, citing the planned merger between America Online
Inc. and Netscape Communications Co. as evidence of a seismic shift
in the industry. Witnesses from both AOL and Netscape testified
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, within the courtroom, David Boies, the government's
lead lawyer, sought to show that Microsoft's only expert witness,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Richard
Schmalensee, served as a gun for hire. Boies cited a slew of cases
where Schmalensee had taken positions opposed to his current stance
when it suited the interests of his other clients.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his lengthy cross-examination, Boies hardly
referred to Schmalensee's 328 pages of direct testimony, buttressed
by a voluminous appendix. This technique, on Schmalensee's third
day on the witness stand, caused the Microsoft defense team to
mutter unhappily during each break in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee also proved unable to state when Microsoft decided
to include Internet Explorer (IE) in its Windows package.
</P>
<P>
   But, much to Boies' evident delight, Schmalensee admitted that
when Microsoft first shipped its retail version of Windows 95, the
browser was not included. The subsequent bundling of IE in Windows
is a key aspect of the government's claim that Microsoft has
behaved in an illegal predatory manner.
</P>
<P>
   Boies said he expects to finish questioning Schmalensee
Wednesday morning. Microsoft officials said they expect their own
redirect questioning to take up at least another full day.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee's extended testimony is likely to push the
appearance of Microsoft's next defense witness, Group Vice
President Paul Maritz, into late this week or perhaps early next
week.

 &HT;    At Home/Excite: A glossary for understanding
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Excite: This company hopes to provide the first page you see
everytime you log onto the World Wide Web. To make that an
attractive idea, Excite's page furnishes links that can take you
almost anywhere on the Web. For instance, you can search for
information, check your horoscope, get the weather forecast, find
out what your stock is worth and get the latest news _ all by
clicking on a link. The site, located at http://www.excite.com,
belongs to a relatively new category of pages called portals that
offer a cafeteria-style menu of information.
</P>
<P>
   _ At Home: It offers a total package: Both a high speed way to
connect to the Internet using a cable modem and some features that
take advantage of all that speed. For instance, customers can
routinely use video including an exclusive arrangement with CNN for
the Video News Daily. You'll find the company's home page at
http://www.home.net. The At Home service is about 100 times faster
than that offered by a conventional modem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Broadband: That's shorthand for the electrical engineer's
term: Bandwidth. Think of the bandwidth as the pipeline that data
travels through. Broadband is simply a much larger pipe that makes
data-intensive applications such as video, music and interactive
games possible on the Internet. Cable television modems, high-speed
data lines (called T-1s or T-3s), ISDN, ADSL, are all ways to offer
broadband services.
</P>
<P>
   _ ADSL: Those are initials that stand for asymmetric digital
subscriber line. It's a high-speed data service that has special
attraction because it can use _ in fact must use _ regular copper
cable instead of fiber optic cable. That means that data providers
have a way to create broadband service in areas not yet served by
fiber optic cable. It's imposible to give a precise speed for ADSL,
or cable modems for that matter, because there's no standard top
speed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dial-up connection: That's the old fashioned way of reaching
the Internet, using an analog modem and conventional telephone
lines. For all practical purposes, the top speed possible using
this method is 53k bps and most dial-up Internet customers don't
even attain that speed.
</P>
<P>
   _ ISP: Internet Service Provider, a company that offers
connections to the Internet.

 &HT;    First there was ADAM Software; Now there's ADAM Internet Health,
Inc.By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For better or worse, the aura of the Internet is now
upon ADAM.
</P>
<P>
   After a unanimous vote of the board of directors, the name of
ADAM Software was changed last week to ADAM Internet Health Inc.,
an effort to reflect in its name the nine-year-old company's new
focus, according to Robert S. Cramer Jr., co-founder, chairman and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM got started making CD-Roms for use primarily by healthcare
professionals for training and by schools for educating students.
But it is also increasingly putting resources into its own Internet
site, while licensing its work to other Net companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company's image has been somewhat vague or even confusing,
he said. Using the word Internet is an effort to crystallize the
impressions of potential customers and investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons that we are changing our name is so that
when people think of online health, they will think of ADAM. It's a
very big step for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the Net-centric name draws investor attention, the
company's stock may board the same roller-coaster that has shaken
up other Internet stocks in recent months. Internet speculation has
sent any number of stocks soaring.
</P>
<P>
   After making the name change announcement Friday morning, ADAM
saw more than 300,000 shares of its stock traded _ compared to a
typical trading volume of 36,000. Shares of ADAM rose nearly 10
percent, closing at $5.75. Tuesday, ADAM was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   That represents an impressive 92 percent increase in value since
Jan. 6 when ADAM closed at $3 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM is now flirting with its 52-week high of $6.625, which was
reached in April.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer said the Net connection is earned, not an attempt to
capitalize on the current buying binge in Net stocks. ``We really
have the substance to back that up. It's not just a decision to
inflate the stock. We are clearly a major player already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the name puts us in a category, in the proper category
for investors to come and take a look at us,'' Cramer said. ``The
ADAM brand is known for the quality of health and medical
information we provide. We are a content powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the power, the company in October won a $1.2 million
grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology that
will pay for development of ``an online repository of medical
information,'' Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web site (www.adam.com) recorded 2 million hits in
the past month, and should draw more as time passes, he said. ``We
think those statistics mark us clearly as one of the leading
players already in consumer health information. We feel we are just
warming up. ADAM.com is going to turn into a full-fledged consumer
health destination.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is creating a business unit, based in San Francisco
that will run its Web business, Cramer said. ``We felt it was
important to be in the heart of the Internet development going on
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Wall Street hysteria about Internet stocks, making
money on the Net has proved a mystery to many.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM expects revenue from a combination of sources: advertising,
subscribers to some services, licensing ADAM's products to others
and licensing and selling things via the Net itself. Cramer said he
expects eventually to draw 75 percent or more of company revenues
from its Net business.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM is not in direct competition with the other
healthcare-oriented Web sites, Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, WebMD of Atlanta is more focused on physicians,
while ADAM aims more at consumers. WebMD licenses ADAM products.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM, despite its long track record, currently draws no coverage
from industry analysts. Perhaps that is because it remains fairly
small, perhaps because it has had its share of financial troubles
and perhaps because its promise seemed limited.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes its change in name and focus will draw more
attention while waiting for its fortunes too shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Adam should be synonymous with health and medical
information the way Amazon.com is synonymous with books and
video,'' Cramer said.

 &HT;    At Home/Excite: What the merger means to Cox Communications
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications originally invested in AtHome to
have a content provider that took advantage of the features
high-speed Internet access allows.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed cable access lets data-heavy features such as video,
moving graphics and other multi-media applications appear more
quickly on a PC user's screen.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome started operations in August 1995. Cox originally had a
12.3 percent share of the company. If AtHome's $6.7 billion deal to
buy Excite is approved, Cox's share would be reduced to 7 percent.
Cox would keep a seat on the board. Cox Communications is a public
company controlled by Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises, which owns The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Woodrow, Cox Communication's senior vice president of new
business development, said Cox wanted to offer its customers
high-speed access and content that takes advantage of it. For
online shopping, high-speed access would offer prospective home
buyers the chance to take video tours of homes for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw it as a way to offer something unique,'' Woodrow said.

 &HT;    Fee-based income partly blamed as BankAmerica misses
expectations
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BankAmerica Tuesday reported earnings that failed to
meet analysts' fourth quarter expectations. Earnings were dampened
by a decline in fee-based income and continuing charges from the
company's investment in a New York trading firm, D.E. Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte-based BankAmerica, the largest domestic banking
organization in the United States, posted operating income of $1.6
billion, or 91 cents per share, compared to $1.68 billion, or 94
cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The per share results were two pennies below the First Call
consensus estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for a $50 million charge for California litigation
concerning municipal bond operations, the company would have earned
about 96 cents in the fourth quarter, said Interstate/Johnson Lane
analyst John Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the quarter, which included merger charges, was
$1.16 billion, or 66 cents, versus $1.46 billion, or 81 cents, a
year earlier. The company took a $441 million after-tax charge for
the Sept. 30 merger of NationsBank and the old BankAmerica. There
had been a $220 million after-tax charge in 1997 for the
acquisition of Barnett Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Fee-based income in the fourth quarter declined 18 percent, to
$2.66 billion. The company cited a $286 million reduction in
investment banking fees stemming from last fall's market turbulence
and from the sale in August of the Robertson Stephens investment
banking firm. There was also a $255 million decline in other income
from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the decline in other income stems from a $158
million markdown in the D.E. Shaw investment, said bank spokesman
Richard Beebe. There also were $43 million in trading losses tied
to D.E. Shaw. All told, D.E Shaw cost BankAmerica 7 cents per share
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, average loans grew 11 percent to $381.85
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus: noninterest expense decreased 1 percent to $4.69
billion as a result of merger efficiencies. Moore said that these
expenses should decline more this year, by as much as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter was $510
million, up slightly from $498 million a year earlier.
Nonperforming assets were $2.76 billion, or 0.77 percent of net
loans, up from $2.42 billion, or 0.71 percent a year earlier. Net
charge-offs rose to $544 million, from $491 million, a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the quarter, BankAmerica had assets of $617.68
billion.

 &HT;    Delta's profits end up on high note in '98
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falling fuel prices offset stagnant revenue to help
Delta Air Lines post better-than-expected profits for the final
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta on Tuesday reported a $194 million profit
for the three months ended Dec. 31, the second quarter in its
fiscal year. That compared with a $190 million profit in the same
period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The latest result translated to $1.29 a share -- slightly above
analyst forecasts -- versus $1.20 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Jet fuel costs, which dropped steadily throughout 1998, fell
another 14 percent in the latest quarter. Without that decline,
Delta's profits would have been reduced about $35 million, said
analyst Thomas Longman, of Arnhold &AMP; S. Bliechroeder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings would have been down had it not been for the fuel
price bonus they got,'' he said. For the full calendar year, Delta
spent $280 million less on jet fuel than it did the prior year.
</P>
<P>
   Longman said Delta also is keeping controllable costs in line
and noted that overall unit costs declined to 8.71 cents per
seat-mile, down from 8.89 cents a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But revenue was nearly flat at $3.45 billion versus $3.43
billion, and unit revenue -- the amount generated from each
seat-mile flown -- declined 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Longman said the decline reflects weakness on Florida routes
owing to warm early winter weather in the Northeast and
fare-cutting by struggling competitor AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Longman said moves by US Airways' MetroJet discount
division, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines to expand their
presence along the East Coast means more low-fare competition for
Delta in key markets. That could dilute unit revenue even if
ridership remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta for the last few years has lived with the impact of
ValuJet and then AirTran,'' he said, ``but now you're starting to
see the battle really joined.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fallout from a September pilots strike weighed
heavily on Northwest Airlines, which has a maintenance base in
Atlanta. Northwest on Tuesday posted losses of $181 million for the
fourth quarter and $285.5 million for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   Other big airlines post earnings in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a Delta spokesman declined to comment on a
Peruvian newspaper report that it might withdraw from its
involvement with struggling AeroPeru. Delta bought a 35 percent
stake in the carrier last year, with an eye toward marketing ties
to feed its new Atlanta-Lima flights.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper El Comercio reported AeroPeru needs a cash
infusion, and neither Delta nor Aeromexico, which also owns a
stake, wants to invest more.

 &HT;    Sprint still likes being single
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sprint's top executive sees his company as a long-term
solo act but thinks BellSouth had better fill its dance card.
</P>
<P>
   William T. Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of the
$15 billion-a-year Sprint, came to town last week for a two-day
session among several hundred ``director level'' area employees.
Esrey's arrival came just days after Sprint launched its wireless
service in metro Atlanta, leaping into a crowded market that is now
led by BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey and his top lieutenants were going to give the local group
a briefing on company strategic planning, listen to the local
talent and just generally talk about what the future looks like for
the ambitious, Kansas City, Mo.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   He also presided over a grand opening of a Sprint store in Sandy
Springs, Ga., an event featuring musicians and singers from
Spalding Drive Elementary School and Braves outfielder Andruw
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview afterward, Esrey talked about dramatic change,
predicting Sprint will increasingly sell a range of services to all
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to what we call One Sprint, where we show one
face to customers. We are going to change dramatically the way we
price, the way we deliver service.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-touted but long-awaited ``bundling'' of
telecommunications _ the idea of ``one-stop shopping'' for all
services _ is truly about to happen, he said. ``We are really at
the doorstep. About 18 months from now, you will see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey shrugged off speculation about a merger between Sprint and
some other telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always said we would prefer to go it alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for its ``pin-drop'' advertisements and its
long-distance service, Sprint is the nation's third-largest
long-distance company but is far more diversified than its image.
Although its national ads make scant mention of it, much of the
company revenue comes from local service, where it has about 7.5
million customers in 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   There is more. Sprint PCS is an aggressive wireless operation
with more than 1 million customers and plans to provide
coast-to-coast digital service. Sprint is also a large stakeholder
in Earthlink, one of the nation's largest Internet service
providers. Moreover, Sprint itself is 20 percent owned by two
European national companies, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint simply doesn't see a vital gap it must fill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every single piece,'' Esrey said. ``I understand why
other people want to merge with Sprint, but when someone talks
about merging with Sprint, my question is, what do they bring us?''
</P>
<P>
   What about BellSouth, which some analysts have suggested as a
merger match with Sprint? After all, the two companies both
increasingly face competitors with global reach and very deep
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the wireless services of BellSouth and Sprint overlap, but
only in the Southeast. Sprint has other major U.S. cities, plus a
substantial European presence. BellSouth is the largest wireless
investor in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprint isn't interested in any merger, Esrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he acknowledged his legal obligation to consider a serious
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at everything and evaluate it and see what it
means as additional value to our shareholders, so you never say
never,'' he said. ``But in a year and a half, we will be growing at
a rate of 20 percent annually. For a company this size to have that
kind of growth, that is explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth revenue is larger than Sprint's _ $22 billion in the
most recent fiscal year reported. BellSouth officials have
repeatedly and vehemently rejected criticism of their go-it-alone
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``BellSouth is obviously on a different course from the one that
we are on. I think that at a minimum, they are going to have to
partner with somebody because the regional presence will not be
enough.''

 &HT;    SEC firm on Y2K corporate efforts
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Senior executives have looked the other way as Y2K
descended upon them, warned James Blanchard, chief executive of
Synovus Financial, in a speech last year. But now the millennium is
less than 365 days away and liability lawyers are on the prowl.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the prior avoidance are various and include top
execs' unwillingness to drag down near-term earnings because of Y2K
projects that offer no cash payback and no proof, except the
absence of breakdowns, that large expenditures of cash and manpower
were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ignorance of and discomfort with technology
among many senior managers. Another reason that Y2K hasn't received
top level attention is the simple fact that technology experts may
be a step or five below senior managers in the company's reporting
hierarchy, leaving the techies and their Y2K thoughts out of the
upper echelon's communications loop.
</P>
<P>
   But for top managers at public companies, Y2K avoidance is
legally no longer possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Securities and Exchange Commission formally required last
August that listed companies specifically disclose details about
their Year 2000 compliance plans, including progress to date,
related expenses, and contingency plans,'' said Lynn Walsh, a
securities partner in the technology group at Alston &AMP; Bird in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC has just sent a letter to companies that haven't
included that information in their third quarter reports telling
them that the Y2K Task Force is aware of the non-compliance, and
that the SEC Division of Enforcement intends to monitor the company
for future compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said that ``failure to heed the SEC may subject these
companies to future fines or to other sanctions by the SEC ... as
well as to subjecting companies to shareholder lawsuits for failing
to disclose important information.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC spokesman John Heine in Washington, D.C., said the
commission wasn't issuing a list of Y2K disclosure offenders. To
determine how, or if, a metro area company is complying, look at
that company's most recent 10Q filing.
</P>
<P>
   Partners at another Atlanta law firm, Hunton &AMP; Williams, have
just published an article that clues corporate top dogs into their
Y2K responsibilities. The piece appears in the most recent issue of
``Directorship,'' a magazine for corporate chief executives,
chairmen, and boards of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Ippollito Strobl, one of the authors, said, ``Board
members and senior executives should not only be familiar with
their company's Y2K efforts but should also be a driving force
behind those efforts. Their cooperation with and support for the
information systems department is likely to lead to a more
efficient, successful Y2K project and, therefore, to less liability
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The article maintains that, ``in litigation, even an
eleventh-hour effort to beat the deadline will seem more reasonable
to a judge and jury than no effort at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Reprints of the article can be obtained from Hunton &AMP; Williams.

HUSSEIN RETURNS HOME TO JORDAN AFTER CANCER TREATMENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Piloting his own plane, King Hussein of Jordan
returned to his kingdom on Tuesday after six months of cancer
treatment. His arrival prompted scenes of widespread jubilation,
but also speculation about who might next take the reins of the
country he has governed for nearly half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old king has promised only ``a comprehensive
review'' of Jordan's course. But senior officials said on Tuesday
that he was contemplating succession by one of his five sons rather
than by his long-designated successor, his brother, Crown Prince
Hassan, who has ruled the country during his long absence.
</P>
<P>
   Never before during his reign has Hussein been away from Jordan
for so long. He was welcomed home on Tuesday by hundreds of
thousands of Jordanians, who braved unseasonably chilly, rainy
weather to pay tribute to a king who has been the only leader the
vast majority of them have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   After landing his jet at a military airport on Tuesday, during
the Id al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan, the king, gaunt and hairless from his cancer therapy,
knelt on a prayer rug to give thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Before his return, the king had fueled much talk here that he
might be reconsidering a succession plan that for more than 30
years had put his brother next in line for the throne. He has kept
people guessing with comments like, ``No one knows what is in the
mind of Hussein until it crystallizes into a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the king praised Hassan for serving as his
``deputy,'' but gave no clue about his intentions. A senior palace
official said, though, that the king's ``difficult days of life and
death'' during his treatment had ``naturally rekindled a wish to
seek posterity through passing the succession to one of his sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once before, in 1992, after treatment for an earlier bout
with cancer, had the king's return from abroad prompted the kind of
rejoicing that burst forth on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks exploded over Amman, and streets were decorated with
pennants and banners and crowded with hundreds of thousands of
people. Dancers from around the kingdom joined in what by any
measure was a most extraordinary pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein has ruled Jordan since 1952 _ when Harry S. Truman was
president _ and there is no doubt that he has been sorely missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God he has returned,'' Amira al-Awahdi, a 42-year-old
homemaker, said on Tuesday afternoon as she took part in the
celebration. ``I can't imagine what we will ever do without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, with its 4 million people, has a strategic location,
sandwiched between Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Jordan has reached out to Israel,
joining Egypt as the only two Arab countries to make peace with
Israel. But it has never fully forsworn its ties with Iraq _ on
which it still depends for oil _ and that prompts distrust in
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries that joined the United
States in waging war against Iraq in 1991 after it invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   This has left Jordan a bit lonely, despite Hussein's efforts to
bridge gaps through his charm and diplomacy. The king took time out
from his treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., to join
President Clinton last October for Middle East peace talks at the
Wye Plantation in Maryland. Then, as happened several times in the
past, he was credited with helping to bridge the gap between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the country was led by Hassan, the king's
understudy for more than 33 years, who is seen both at home and
abroad as a competent and effective leader.
</P>
<P>
   But still, at 52, Hassan seems to lack the common touch that
might be necessary to guide Jordan though what many expect will be
tumultuous years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jordan had depended for much of its revenue on trade
with Iraq, most of which was halted under the U.N. sanctions that
stemmed from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Jordan's people are Palestinians whose
homeland is the West Bank, but for whom returning there has become
an increasingly distant prospect.

<P>
   Jordan has yet to reap clear dividends from its accord with
Israel in 1994, which remains deeply unpopular among many
Jordanians. In the years since, the economy has suffered and
unemployment has soared.
</P>
<P>
   In the days preceding his return, Hussein had seemed intent on
pre-empting his critics. In a televised address from London over
the weekend, he declared that there was ``no choice but to engage
soon in a comprehensive review of our national course and dealing
with all the issues and challenges that occupy our minds or
obstruct our blessed path.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials have interpreted that statement as a signal
that the king may be reconsidering the succession. For many
Jordanians, that kind of speculation was fueled again on Tuesday
when the king, in a statement on his arrival, made no more than
passing reference to his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Jordan believe that he would prefer to be
succeeded by one of his five sons from his four marriages. The one
most often mentioned is Prince Hamzeh, 18, the king's eldest son by
his current wife, the American-born Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   As his father was, Prince Hamzeh is being educated at the
British military academy at Sandhurst. His eloquence in Arabic and
English has been widely admired in Jordan, and he has been at the
king's side through most of his illness.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation was fed on Tuesday by the very public presence
of Queen Noor at the king's side as the royal party rolled through
the streets of Amman in a 1960s Mercedes-Benz limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Jordan, which has a more relaxed attitude toward public
roles for women than most Arab countries, it is unusual that the
wife of a leader would be presented so prominently.
</P>
<P>
   The king has pronounced himself ``fully recovered'' from his
lymphoma. Since July he has undergone six courses of chemotherapy,
which he has acknowledged left him physically and emotionally
weakened, and Tuesday he appeared a bit frail.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout his illness, the king has appeared determined to
display his physical vigor, most often by taking control of his
aircraft, as he did Tuesday by flying his Gulfstream jet here from
London, where he had been recovering in a holiday home.

`THE WINNERS': WHEN WINNING ISN'T THE ONLY THING
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review)

   One lesson to be drawn from ``The Winners,'' a searching,
melancholy Dutch documentary about the lives of four classical
musicians who won the prestigious Queen Elisabeth Competition in
Brussels, is that victory is not a guaranteed ticket into the
classical music pantheon. Politics, personal health, changing
musical fashions and the mysterious vagaries of personality, not to
mention sheer luck, can be as strong determining factors as raw
talent in the trajectory of a career.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's most compelling and saddest case history is the
downward spiral of Philipp Hirschhorn, a gifted Russian musician
who upon winning the 1967 violin competition was hailed by many as
a new Paganini. Vintage film clips show the dashingly handsome
Hirschhorn (who died in 1996, shortly after his interviews were
filmed) in his youthful glory, when he embodied the classical
virtuoso as a fiery Byronic hero.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed nearly three decades later and shown old film clips
of himself, Hirschhorn is bitterly scornful of his youthful
naivete, yet retains a spark of his old fervor as he recalls the
``euphoria'' of performing and compares that feeling to driving a
racing car at high speed and taking LSD. After he emigrated to the
West in 1973, his career never took off, and it was undermined by
an unspecified illness. The film, directed by Paul Cohen, contrasts
Hirschhorn's burnout with the more gradual ascent of Gidon Kremer,
who came in third in 1967 but eventually became an international
star.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian pianist Yevgeny Mogilevsky, who won the same
competition in 1964, found his career hindered by politics. Because
the Communist Party bosses considered him unreliable, he couldn't
take advantage of his victory and travel abroad until 1969, and he
didn't make his American debut until 1991. Although he is just
beginning to gain international recognition, the novelty value of
Russian musicians in the post-communist era is not what it used to
be, and he may never attain the status he might have achieved 30
years ago had he been allowed to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Bezverkhny, a Russian violinist who won the 1976
competition, also never achieved the fame predicted for him,
although he has established a comfortable career as founding member
of the Shostakovich Piano Trio in Brussels. In the movie's most
detailed musical sequence, he and his wife, Olga Bezverkhnaya, a
pianist, are shown rehearsing a transcription of the Rachmaninoff
``Vocalise'' for violin and piano. Bezverkhny is outspoken in his
disdain for a classical music world whose values he believes are
determined by record companies that he says prefer ``gray''
musicians over quirky geniuses with strong personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is Berl Senofsky, a Ukrainian-born American
violinist who won the competition in 1955 and recorded for RCA in
the early 1960s. Senofsky, who became an important teacher and a
judge for the Queen Elisabeth Competition, is philosophical about
his relative lack of success after his days as a Wunderkind.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to show the medal he won four decades earlier, he
rummages through a drawer and can't find it. Yes, he admits, he
dreamed of fame and fortune, but ``when making music you just don't
think of these things _ you think of more exalted things.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the movie, which opens today at the Film Forum,
we're finally shown the medal, which he was eventually able to
locate. It doesn't look like much.

SUPREME COURT DECLINES TO HEAR 3-STRIKE CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Ohio, Fla.)  (Eds., in 9th graf, California Court of Appeal (singular) is CQ)  
(dal) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A California prison inmate, serving a sentence of
25 years-to-life under the state's ``three strikes'' law for
shoplifting a $20 bottle of vitamins, failed to persuade the
Supreme Court on Tuesday to hear his argument that the law imposes
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But four justices said the case raised ``serious questions''
that warranted further judicial scrutiny. Only one of the four,
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, said the court should take up this
particular case at this time. But a statement by Justices John Paul
Stevens, David H. Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, labeling the
issue as ``obviously substantial,'' essentially invited other
inmates to bring challenges and urged the California and federal
courts to pay attention. The inmate in this case, Michael Riggs,
can pursue his constitutional argument through a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus in federal court, they said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment or rejoinder from the other five justices.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision not to take the case today ``does not
constitute a ruling on the merits,'' Stevens, Souter and Justice
Ginsburg said, but rather reflected possible weaknesses in the
record and in the procedural setting of the appeal that Riggs sent
to the justices himself without a lawyer's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The California Supreme Court had refused to hear Riggs' appeal,
with the result that the justices lacked an authoritative
interpretation of the 1994 three-strikes law. The law appears at
least to authorize, and perhaps to require, a trial judge to treat
a defendant's third offense, even a petty crime such as this one,
as if it were a felony for purposes of applying the law's mandatory
sentencing provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``California appears to be the only state in which a misdemeanor
could receive such a severe sentence,'' the three justices said.
Thirty-seven other states have some version of a three-strikes law
that imposes stiffer sentences on repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   A further complication in the case today was that Riggs had not
just two previous felony convictions, but eight, and had served
prison time for such offenses as car theft and robbery, all
committed before the California law was enacted as a voter
initiative in 1994. He also raised the issue of whether any of
those crimes could count as prior ``strikes'' without violating the
constitutional prohibition against ex post facto legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The crime that put Riggs away for a minimum of 20.8 years,
before parole eligibility, would ordinarily have earned a maximum
sentence of six months. In his Supreme Court appeal, Riggs vs.
California, No. 98-5021, he noted that a person convicted of murder
in California can ordinarily expect parole after 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   The California Court of Appeal, while rejecting his
constitutional arguments in a December, 1997 opinion, depicted a
scene out of ``Les Miserables.'' The shoplifting offense ``was a
petty theft motivated by homelessness and hunger,'' the court said,
adding that Riggs had a drug abuse problem ``apparently
precipitated by the death of his young son.'' Nonetheless, the
appeals court indicated that Riggs had forfeited whatever sympathy
his plight might otherwise have earned; by his numerous prior
convictions, the court said, ``defendant has proven that he cannot
conform to society's rules.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These were among the other cases the court disposed of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Medical Equipment: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The court vacated a much disputed ruling, issued last year by
the federal appeals court in New York, that limited the obligation
of states under the federal Medicaid program to pay for equipment
needed by people with rare conditions or unusual medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   The February, 1998 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals had alarmed disability rights groups and prompted a Clinton
administration review of the issue that led to a change in federal
policy. The court on Tuesday ordered the decision, originally known
as the DeSario case but now called Slekis vs. Thomas, No. 98-5070,
vacated and the case returned to the appeals court ``for further
consideration in light of'' the new federal policy.
</P>
<P>
   The question in the case was whether states could refuse to
provide equipment that met the medical needs of a small number of
people as long as the state's plan for ``home health services''
provided adequately for ``the needs of the Medicaid population as a
whole,'' as the appeals court said in permitting Connecticut to
deny equipment such as special mattresses, communication devices,
and a system that permits quadriplegics to control their home
environment with voice commands. As long as the state program was
generally adequate, the court said, people with unusual needs
``will have to look for other sources of assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to state Medicaid directors in September, the Health
Care Financing Administration said a state ``may not impose
arbitrary limits,'' such as those apparently endorsed by the
appeals court, on necessary equipment ``based solely on diagnosis,
type of illness, or condition.'' The administration and the
plaintiffs' lawyers, represented by the New Haven Legal Assistance
Association, then asked the court to vacate the 2nd Circuit
decision.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Campaign Limits &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the court refused to hear an appeal by the
state of Ohio from a federal appeals court ruling that struck down
limits on spending for judicial campaigns. The Ohio Supreme Court
had imposed the limits, ranging from $50,000 to $500,000 depending
on the judicial office involved, as a canon of judicial ethics in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Cincinnati, ruled last
year that the spending limits were unconstitutional under the
Supreme Court's 1974 ruling in Buckley vs. Valeo, which treated
election expenditures as political speech. In the case on Tuesday,
Marshall vs. Suster, No. 98-737, Ohio argued that judicial
elections were different and that courts should recognize a state's
compelling interest in preserving the integrity, independence and
impartiality of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Electric Chair &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The court turned down, also without comment, a constitutional
challenge to Florida's use of the electric chair as the sole means
of execution. The chair has malfunctioned several times, sending up
smoke and flames and leading to a one-year moratorium on its use in
1997. A death-row inmate, Eduardo Lopez, argued in this case that
``evolving standards of decency and current legislative trends''
established that electrocution was cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 38 death-penalty states, only Alabama, Georgia and
Nebraska, in addition to Florida, still use the electric chair as
the sole means of execution. The Florida Supreme Court rejected the
challenge in an opinion last year. The case was Lopez vs.
Singletary, No. 98-6065.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Telephone Case &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The court refused to hear appeals by the regional Bell companies
in their ongoing battle to break into the long-distance market. The
question was whether the regulatory obstacles placed in their path
by the 1996 Telecommunications Act amounted to an unconstitutional
bill of attainder, as a federal district judge in Dallas had ruled
a year ago in a case brought by SBC Communications Inc. The 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, had overturned that
ruling in September. The cases on Tuesday, appealing the 5th
Circuit's ruling, were SBC Communications vs. Federal
Communications Comm., No. 98-652, and Bell Atlantic Corp. vs. FCC,
No. 98-653.

OFFICES OF LABOR PARTY ADVISER BURGLARIZED AGAIN; CAMPAIGN FILES
STOLEN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For the second time in a week, the Washington
offices of a prominent American polltaker advising the Israeli
Labor Party have been burglarized, and Labor campaign files were
once again stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Monday or early Tuesday morning, thieves entered through
a second-floor window into the Capitol Hill offices of the
polltaker and consultant, Stanley Greenberg, Labor Party officials
and the Washington police said. They disconnected a new alarm
system, installed after the burglary last week, and made off with
research material related to the campaign of the Labor Party
leader, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli reporters were quick to revive the label they applied to
last Tuesday's break-in, calling the incident another chapter in
Barak-gate, or Israel's Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Jeremy Rosner, a vice president at Greenberg
Quinlan Research Inc., where the burglary occurred, said it
``increasingly appears'' that the break-ins were connected to the
Israeli election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have increasing reasons to believe that whoever is doing
this is targeting our work on the Israeli election campaign,'' he
said, although he declined to give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Rosner said the firm had never been burglarized before.
</P>
<P>
   Break-ins are rapidly becoming a bizarre subplot of the
volatile, protracted Israeli campaign season, in which Barak and a
host of other contenders are challenging Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. The election is scheduled for May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Four Labor Party campaign workers reported forced entries to
their private homes in Israel at the end of last week. And Labor
officials said over the weekend that the homes of three other
campaign officials had also recently been broken into and searched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very weird,'' said Aliza Goren, the Labor spokeswoman.
``But all I can tell you is that we're really not afraid. Nothing
taken _ no paper, no disk _ can change the fact that the Netanyahu
government has fallen and it's not getting back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Netanyahu, leader of the conservative Likud Party,
and Barak, a retired army general, running neck and neck. They are
trailed by Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, another former general, who is
building a center party and who is the predicted winner if a runoff
election becomes necessary.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the burglars in Washington stole computer disks,
files and a laptop computer, all of which contained strategic
political information. Nothing was taken from the houses broken
into in Israel, which included those of three secretaries, two top
advisers to Barak and the campaign's director and deputy director.
</P>
<P>
   Likud Party spokesmen have denounced the break-ins, as well as
any implication that they might be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any break-in is a crime, and those who do it should be in
jail,'' a spokeswoman said on Sunday. ``Those that hint there is a
political motivation to the act should be ashamed of themselves.
This is not the way that political debate in Israel is conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the
burglaries in Washington.

SEANTORS GIRD FOR THE QUESTION PHASE OF THE CLINTON TRIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders were collecting and editing
written questions from their colleagues Tuesday so that the queries
can be posed later this week by Chief Justice William Rehnquist at
President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has set aside 16 hours starting Friday to question
the House prosecutors and Clinton defense team. The questions will
provide a window into the thoughts of the 100 senators who have
silently crouched over their wooden desks as both sides have
presented their cases.
</P>
<P>
   Senators are asked to write out their questions on preprinted
forms. The forms then will be time-stamped and handed to Senate
parliamentarian Bob Dove who will give them in order to Rehnquist.
the chief justice then will pose the question to the appropriate
party, either a particular Clinton defense lawyer or one of the 13
House prosecutors, or to one legal team or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has asked Sen.
Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
along with Sens. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, and Fred Thompson, R-Tenn. to
coordinate questions from Republican senators to avoid repetition.
Hatch said he has received 20 to 25 questions so far and has
created a computer database to collect them.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said Republican senators and staffers are meeting every
day to sort through the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inviting questions from everyone,'' Thompson said.
However, in the end, it may not be as orderly as planned, Thompson
said. ``After all, we can make recommendations, but members can do
what they want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ranit Schmelzer, spokeswoman for Senate Democratic Leader Thomas
A. Daschle, D-S.D., said the Democratic senators are pursuing a
less organized approach to the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said her questions are
likely to concern obstruction of justice, adding that she sees
conflicts in the testimony of former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and Clinton's secretary Betty Currie. Hutchison said she
hopes the senators will follow the trend established by House
prosecutors and be brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could well use under 16 hours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, said she was finding it tough to
drum up questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that a thousand questions jump out at me,'' Snowe
said. ``It's a slower process than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, a Democrat who has been critical of
Clinton, said if there were a vote to dismiss the case today, he
would vote against it because he still has unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Graham has kept notes by scribbling in both
sides of a palm-sized notebook, with questions scrawled on a
separate page.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has come up with about a dozen questions so far, most
of which relate to the obstruction of justice charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the more serious charges,'' he said, adding he is
particularly concerned about White House efforts to find a job for
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul David Wellstone, D-Minn., said he has so far jotted
down about 10 questions, but said he feels he is at a ``severe
disadvantage'' sitting next to Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who has
meticulously recorded heaps of comments and questions in his
notepad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel like I'm in school and I want to cheat,''
Wellstone said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bull market in stocks, running hard for more than
eight years now, has already lived longer than any other in
history. And if President Clinton gets his way, the gallop will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan to shore up Social Security would put $700
billion into the stock market. His idea is to transfer almost
two-thirds of the projected United States budget surplus, roughly
$2.7 trillion, to the Social Security trust fund in the next 15
years and funnel $700 billion of that amount into stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted tepidly to the proposal on Tuesday. But make
no mistake, the prospect of a such a shift into stocks would be a
powerful, positive force on a bull market that investors fret is
long in the tooth.
</P>
<P>
   The $700 billion earmarked for stocks is equal to roughly 5
percent of the value of the entire United States stock market right
now. If this money went into mutual funds whose holdings reflect
well-known market averages, like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index, those shares might become stock rockets. They are already
valued exceedingly high by historical standards.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans need not be sold on the merits of stock
investing. According to the Federal Reserve's most recent data,
American households own $5.3 trillion in corporate equities
directly. This dwarfs the equity holdings of mutual funds _ $2
trillion _ and those of state and local government retirement funds
_ $1.3 trillion. Five straight years of at least 20 percent returns
in stocks have made even the most cautious investor a believer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Social Security's returns have been woeful. On
average, the fund's investments have yielded 2 percent to 2.5
percent annually since 1937, a rate based on a composite of
short-term and long-term interest rates paid on a special
nonmarketed type of U.S. Treasury security that matures in four
years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors were blase after the president's plan became
known on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average bounced back
from a decline of approximately 130 points to end 14.67 points
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Market strategists say investors are waiting to express euphoria
for two reasons. One is that Clinton's plan is likely to meet some
stiff opposition. Issues such as how the government would manage
its investments in private businesses loom large. What a spectacle
it would be if the Social Security fund had a large position in
Microsoft even as the Justice Department was pursuing a vigorous
antitrust case against the company.
</P>
<P>
   And how would the government vote its beneficiaries' views on
proxy issues such as mergers and acquisitions and chief executive
compensation?
</P>
<P>
   If the government were to wind up controlling a large portion of
a company's shares outstanding, what would happen when it came time
to sell? It would surely disrupt the market in that company's
shares. Finally, if the market fell _ and markets do _ how would
the throngs of investors exit? Who gets to leave the party first?
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is correct in realizing how difficult the endgame
is going to be,'' said Charles Gabriel, a senior Washington analyst
at Prudential Securities. ``I don't think it is inevitable at all.
There are so many things that could torpedo this.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the idea of putting Social Security funds into equities
has not been the subject of furious lobbying in recent years.
Merrill Lynch and State Street Bank, two administrators of
retirement accounts that stand to benefit from a switch to
equities, have pushed the idea somewhat in the last three years or
so.
</P>
<P>
   But the Investment Company Institute, which represents the
mutual fund industry in Washington, has not been a cheerleader for
investing Social Security assets in stocks. ``We will look closely
at what the president is imposing,'' said John Collins, a spokesman
for the institute. ``We will withhold our enthusiasm until we see
the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of choosing money managers, for example, have not
yet been explained. And there is a companion proposal to allow
individuals to direct a portion of the money deducted from their
pay for Social Security into an individual account that could also
be invested in stocks. Such individual accounts raise even more
complex issues of administration and costs. ``If there are private
accounts in Social Security reform that gets adopted, there has to
be education so people don't get burned,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the lobbying was low key because the major banks and
brokerage firms knew it would be overkill: the stock market, after
all, did the work for them. The rip-roaring performance of the S&AMP;P
500-stock index in recent years has convinced people from all walks
of life that stocks are the only place to be.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Wall Street firms would love to get their hands on
$700 billion in Social Security funds, American corporations may
not be so sure of the idea. ``This would be a significant transfer
of ownership from the private sector to the government,'' said
Michael Tanner, director of Health and Welfare Studies at the Cato
Institute, a research organization influential with conservative
Republicans. ``American corporations are rightly concerned about
the government getting into owning businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence J. White, professor of economics at the Stern School of
Business at New York University, thinks funneling Social Security
assets into the stock market is a bad idea because the money will
probably wind up at the nation's largest public companies and
therefore reduce funds available for small businesses. He points
out that as recently as the early 1990's, one-third of all Keogh
retirement plans and individual retirement accounts were invested
in bank accounts or an eqivalent account at an insurance company.
Much of this money was then loaned to small businesses, the engine
of job growth in the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the money ultimately ends up is what concerns me,''
White said. ``I don't like it only ending up at the disposal of the
10,000 public companies. I want to see the other 10 million getting
a shot at it as well. And there's no way the Social Security
Administration is going to be able to do that.''

BUSH FOCUSES ON ETHNIC DIVERSITY IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While the audience at the inauguration of Gov.
George W. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry was predominately Anglo
Tuesday, the theme was one of ethnic diversity and inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in his inaugural address, said one of the main challenges
to Texas' future will be to ensure ethnic harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the near future, there will be no majority racial group in
Texas,'' Bush said in his inaugural speech. ``Children enrolled in
Houston schools speak 63 different languages; 57 different
languages in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush last year set a record for the percent of the Hispanic vote
received by a Republican in Texas, capturing 37 percent to 49
percent depending on which exit poll is used. The previous high had
been 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bush made a special effort to include an appeal to
Hispanics in his speech and the inaugural festivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our diversity gives Texas new life, new energy, new blood ...
and we should not fear it but welcome it,'' Bush said in English.
He then repeated the sentiment in Spanish to scattered applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his attitude toward diversity and minorities,'' said
Rafael Adame, 49, a computer salesman and Democrat who worked for
the Republican governor's re-election last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the courage to stand against the Washington Republicans
and that mind-set against minorities,'' Adame said. ``Being from El
Paso, we find that a welcome relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The inauguration's theme was ``Together We Can _ Juntos
Podemos.''
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Sosa of San Antonio, Bush's Hispanic political
coordinator and member of the inaugural planning committee, said
that slogan set the tone for everything in the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of any other major candidate doing that after
the campaign,'' Sosa said. ``George W. is not like that. It's top
of his mind. It's ingrained in his head. He makes sure it's not
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural committee's finance chairman was Raul Romero of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural's invocation was delivered by Archbishop Patrick
Flores of San Antonio, while the benediction was given by Rabbi
Samuel Karff of Houston. At the inaugural ball at the Frank Erwin
Center, the featured singer was Emilio, who cut a bilingual
television commercial for Bush's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries at the inauguration included Mexican Ambassador
Jesus Reyes-Heroles and six governors from Mexican states.
</P>
<P>
   Gracie Saenz, an attorney and former Houston City Council
member, said she found the references to Hispanics in Bush's speech
resonant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I particularly appreciated the recognition the governor gave
to the guest from Mexico, and the inclusion of Spanish in his
speech also meant a lot to people,'' she said. ``I liked it.''

SERBIAN GOVERNMENT ON DEFENSIVE IN PROBE OF MURDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ As a horrified world demands answers to
the brutal slaying of scores of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the
Serbian government has gone into bunker mode, balking at efforts by
international officials to find the truth about the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Two NATO commanders, here Tuesday to deliver a stern
cease-and-desist message to Slobodan Milosevic, came out of a
marathon meeting with the Serbian leader with no reported progress.
</P>
<P>
   General Wesley Clark, the American supreme allied commander in
Europe, and Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany, chief of NATO's military
committee, huddled for more than seven hours with Milosevic
Tuesday, returning to Brussels late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not encouraged,'' US State Department spokesman James
Rubin said of the meeting, adding that the Western generals would
seek more comprehensive instructions from NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Naumann strongly demanded that Milosevic stop military
operations in Kosovo, allow an independent investigation of the
apparent massacre of the 45 Albanians, withdraw most of his troops
from the troubled province, and allow UN chief war crimes
prosecutor Louise Arbour to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   None of these demands was reportedly agreed to Tuesday by
Milosevic, whose relations with the international community, along
with the crisis in Kosovo, are getting progressively worse.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter, discovered Saturday by observers from the
Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe's verification
mission, has brought tensions in Kosovo and between Milosevic and
the international community to a critical level.
</P>
<P>
   OSCE mission chief and US Ambassador William Walker was quick to
blame the grisly deaths on the Serbs, calling it ``a crime very
much against humanity'' _ a statement that made the Serbian
government furious and defensive. The United States, meanwhile, has
reiterated its threat of a NATO strike, which technically has been
on the table since Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire in October,
should the agreement be broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is on the edge, and it is very serious, more
serious than it was in October,'' the independent B-92 Radio in
Belgrade quoted Balkan peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army, a guerrilla group
bent on independence for Kosovo Albanians, have been accused of
breaking the fragile cease-fire. But Saturday's discovery was
undoubtedly the most horrific evidence of a breach-of-peace so far
in the nearly year-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Danica Marinkovic, the Serbs' investigatory judge in the Kosovar
capital of Pristina, insisted Tuesday that the 45 Albanians ``had
not been mutilated,'' despite on-the-scene observations to the
contrary by the OSCE verifiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The examinations so far showed no signs of mutilation on the
bodies of the terrorists, as Kosovo Verification Mission head
William Walker had alleged in an extremely tendentious manner,''
Marinkovic was quoted by the state-run Tanjug news agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Walker on Monday was declared persona non grata by the Serbian
government, and ordered to leave the country within 48 hours.
Tuesday, he was given a 24-hour extension.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj _ whose rhetoric in
the crisis has been even more hard-line than Milosevic's _ demanded
Tuesday that Walker leave the country. Other opposition leaders,
however, said it was wrong to force out Walker.
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans to pull out the 700 unarmed OSCE verifiers,
Norweigian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek told Reuters news
agency. But ``appropriate measures are being taken to ensure the
safety of the personnel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   International observers who on Saturday viewed what they called
the mutilated remains of 45 ethnic Albanians, including several
women and a 12-year-old boy, want an independent investigation of
the murders. Arbour was summoned to Kosovo Monday to begin an
inquiry, but she had no visa and was refused entry. Arbour is still
in Skopje, Macedonia, waiting for an opportunity to enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, violence continued in the southern Serbian province
Tuesday. Official Serb sources reported that one Serbian police
officer had been killed, and two injured. Serb police also
reportedly stepped up their military offensive in the villages of
Petrovo and Malopolje.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign observers were nervous Saturday that the gruesome deaths
of the Albanians might provoke some kind of retaliatory action,
further pushing Kosovo toward an all-out war. The Serbia Media
Center did not say who had shot the police.
</P>
<P>
   The murders made the weak diplomatic thread between Milosevic
and the rest of the world even more fragile.
</P>
<P>
   The Prime Minister of Albania, Pandeli Majko, called for
Milosevic to be investigated as a war criminal _ a demand that was
also backed by Majko's opposition, former Prime Minister Sali
Berisha.
</P>
<P>
   Even Russia, the closest thing Yugoslavia has to a sympathetic
voice on the UN Security Council, Tuesday condemned the expulsion
order for Walker, saying it ``would only further destabilize the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see no easy or appealing solution for the West.
Milosevic appears to be employing the same strategy he used in
Bosnia, observers say, pushing the West to the edge of military
intervention and then pulling back a bit just in time.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of a NATO air assault say that such a move is the only
language Milosevic understands. They note that it was only after a
NATO strike in 1995 that Milosevic agreed to come to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Now, NATO is again being tested. If it doesn't strike, it may
make its outstanding threat look hollow and meaningless. But if it
does strike, it risks making the already deadly and complex
situation even worse.
</P>
<P>
   While the United Nations is appalled at the violence in Kosovo,
it also is reluctant to get involved in what is a civil conflict.
Kosovo is recognized internationally as being Serbian territory,
and the Albanians _ while charging serious human rights abuses and
murder by the Serbs _ are still fellow Yugoslav citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO assault would be the first time since World War II that
it bombed a sovereign nation in Europe, notes Robert Hayden, a
University of Pittsburgh professor and Balkan expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bomb, you're operating as the KLA's air force,'' Hayden
said, since _ as the Serbs fear _ it would give the Albanian army
an opportunity to re-take land when the Serbs retreat from air
fire.

WARM WINTER, ETHNIC HATREDS ABET LATEST CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ While the massacre of 45 Albanians last weekend in the
Kosovo village of Racak triggered the latest crisis in the
rebellious Serbian province, both sides in the conflict _ Serbian
forces and Albanian separatists _ have been making a mockery of the
cease-fire since it was brokered by US envoy Richard Holbrooke last
October, averting NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels and representatives
of the six-nation Contact Group overseeing peace efforts in the
Balkans have acknowledged that Holbrooke's deal was at best a
tactic to get the Serbs and ethnic Albanians to the negotiating
table to avert new fighting in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   But while Balkan winters normally are brutal, this winter has
been mild. As a result, the Albanian rebels in the Kosovo
Liberation Army are re-arming themselves faster than expected with
weapons smuggled across the border from Albania. The mild weather
also has taken away any incentive for the Serbian police and Army
to remove their heavy artillery from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of heavy snow has provided no break in the fighting
_ a prerequisite for negotiations between the ethnic Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of the 2 million people living in Kosovo, and
the Serbs who control the province.
</P>
<P>
   But as NATO Secretary General Javier Solana put it, ``This
problem did not develop overnight. It will not go away overnight.''
Speaking privately, a US official in the Balkans added, ``These
people hate each other. I never believed for a minute that they
were prepared to compromise with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials are despondent but not surprised over the recent
events. The 700 international observers on the ground in Kosovo
have neutralized the only trump card NATO still holds. While NATO
never lifted the ``activation order'' authorizing NATO jets to bomb
Serbian targets, it cannot bomb because of a threat by the Serbs to
take observers as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has a 2,000-member ``extraction force'' stationed in
neighboring Macedonia ready to rescue the unarmed observers. But it
is hard to find an objective military analyst who believes that the
unit would be able to rescue all of the observers before some would
be taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials privately acknowledge a more fundamental problem.
By launching airstrikes, they would reward the aggression of the
KLA, which, while not on the scale of the Serbs, is disturbing
nonetheless. Some NATO officials believe the KLA has been
deliberately trying to provoke an overreaction from the Serb forces
to precipitate NATO action.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is full of zealots who will settle for nothing short of
independence from Belgrade _ a status that no nation other than
Albania supports. Many governments, including the United States,
fear that independence in Kosovo will trigger revolts by Albanians
in Macedonia and Montenegro, further destabilizing the region.
</P>
<P>
   Solana is resolute that NATO will not ``serve as the KLA's air
force.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian leader in Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, has called for
NATO to commit ground forces to Kosovo to end the fighting. But
Washington, whose opinion counts most within NATO, is appalled at
that prospect. It has nothing close to the political or popular
support necessary for US troops to quell what is essentially a
domestic dispute within the borders of Serbia. And in its 50-year
history, NATO has never taken action against a country over a
dispute, however violent, within that country's borders.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, has reacted with
characteristic defiance since the massacre by expelling William
Walker, the American diplomat who leads the monitoring mission, and
denying entry to Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the UN war
crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   After viewing the bodies of 45 Albanians, all of whom who
appeared to be civilians and all of whom who appeared to be killed
at close-range, execution-style, an emotional Walker described the
massacre at Racak as ``a crime very much against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic regime branded Walker an ``ambassador of lies''
who has overstepped his jurisdiction and chosen sides before
knowing the facts, and turned Arbour away at the Macedonian border,
saying she lacked the necessary visa to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has given conflicting accounts of what happened at
Racak. It first said the dead were uniformed members of the KLA.
But international observers and journalists found the bodies clad
in civilian clothes. They noted the mutilation of bodies and
counted three women, a 12-year-old boy, and an elderly man among
the dead. The Serbian government then suggested that the KLA had
``staged'' the massacre by substituting KLA uniforms with civilian
garb.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Serb forces shelled Racak, then entered the town and
took the bodies from the mosque that served as a temporary morgue.
Thus, any attempt to establish independently the circumstances
surrounding the massacre will now be flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Serb anger is the conviction that the international
observer mission has been biased against them from the start. They
believe the international community has condemned only the deaths
of Albanians and ignored the murders of Serbs who are killed in the
countryside as the KLA practices its own brand of ethnic cleansing.
In particular, the Serbs believe there should have been more
forceful condemnation of the murder of six Serb civilians at a cafe
in Pec last month.

FED OFFICIAL DISPUTES Y2K ECONOMIC CRISIS THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Casting aside gloomy predictions about the impact of
Year 2000 computer glitches on the economy, a top Federal Reserve
official said Tuesday she does not expect the US economy to go into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Minehan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
and one of the co-chairs of the Fed's Y2K committee, disputed a
widely cited forecast that there is a 70 percent chance software
problems caused by the date change to Jan. 1, 2000 would lead to a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The bleak forecast comes from the prominent Wall Street
economist, Ed Yardeni, who is chief economist of Deutsche Bank
Securities in New York. He predicts that software disruptions could
slow transportation, knock out telephone services, and generally
throw business operations off stride.
</P>
<P>
   By Yardeni's thinking, the impact of turning the calendar over
to Year 2000 would be comparable to the oil-price shocks of 1973,
which threw the United States into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Although Minehan has ``a lot of respect for Yardeni,'' she said
in an interview Tuesday, ``It just doesn't seem realistic to say
that it would produce, all by itself, a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Minehan said she believes that a more moderate forecast by
DRI/McGraw Hill, the economic forecasting firm Lexington, Mass., is
more realistic. Released last March, DRI described a scenario in
which businesses are required to spend more and stock up on
computer hardware, adding about 0.1 percent to the economy's total
product in 1999. Then, in 2000, limited disruptions caused by
computer malfunctions as well as a loss of productivity by workers
could reduce GDP by just 0.2 percent. There is ``a 20 percent
probability that reality will be this bad or worse,'' DRI/McGraw's
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Minehan suggested it is also conceivable that businesses would
build inventories later this year. ``Just as some people might
themselves prudent if they took out a little extra cash, some
businesses might attempt to stock supplies and other things'' in
expectation of problems with their electricity or other services,
Minehan acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, the impact would be minimal, she said. The inventory
buildup would be adjusted in 2000 in what is known as an
``inventory cycle''; the two would cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
   Minehan's comments were part of a broader push by the Fed to
bolster public confidence in the ability of large financial
institutions and the central bank system _ the lifeblood of the
economy _ to cope with the looming date change.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming specific economists, Fed Governor Edward W. Kelly
told a Senate committee last April that forecasts of a Y2K-induced
recession were ``probably a stretch.'' Kelly and Minehan are among
four co-chairs of a Fed committee preparing the US central bank for
2000 and assessing the potential impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Minehan's critique of Y2K economics appears to be the first
direct comment by a Fed official specifically about Yardeni's
forecast. Her comments take on added significance because she is
also chairwoman of separate Fed committee that has been working for
more than two years with the 12 regional banks and their member
financial institutions to prepare for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On that point, Minehan sought to reassure: ``Everything at the
Fed that is mission critical is Y2K ready,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not realistic to think there will be no glitches either.
There will be glitches,'' she said. ``But, as far as we can see, at
this point, a reasonable scenario is that most important things
will work, at least from the perspective of the financial services
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Yardeni in an interview Tuesday, reiterated his
recession forecast, which was based in part on his reviews of
company filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be right about this,'' Yardeni said.

IOC OFFICIAL QUITS AMIDST ALLEGATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as IOC-Firings)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee's expected purge began
Tuesday when Finland's Pirjo Haeggman, one of 13 members under
investigation in the widening Olympic bribery scandal, resigned
after her ex-husband was alleged to have obtained jobs through two
bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that my reputation has been blackened so much that I no
longer am able to function as a member of the IOC,'' said the
47-year-old Haeggman, a three-time Olympic middle-distance runner
who had belonged to the committee since 1981 and was one of the
first two women selected.
</P>
<P>
   Haeggman's resignation, the first by an IOC member since Robert
Helmick of the United States stepped down under pressure in 1991,
is the first of what may be as many as a dozen departures amid the
IOC's expanding inquiry into bribery and vote-peddling involving
Olympic bids.
</P>
<P>
   After a special investigative panel headed by IOC vice president
Richard Pound of Canada makes its report Saturday at Olympic
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, the 11-member executive
board is expected Sunday to ask at least nine more members to step
down and to punish several more.
</P>
<P>
   ``IOC members will have resigned or been suspended or
reprimanded,'' said vice president Anita DeFrantz of the United
States, who sits on the executive board. ``There may be an
assortment. There may be fewer of the resigned than we would wish.
But we're not going to let this languish.''
</P>
<P>
   If the members involved do not resign, the IOC's full 115-member
body is expected to expel them at its special session March 17-18
in Lausanne, where it will also consider changes in the bidding
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will take the most innocent of the guilty and get them to
step down to deflect attention toward the bad apples,'' said
Helmick, an Iowa attorney and former US Olympic Committee president
who left the IOC amid allegations of conflict of interest. ``But
the real problem is the structure, which breeds excess.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the bribery scandal stemmed from the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee giving cash, college tuition payments, free medical care,
and lavish gifts to IOC members in an apparent attempt to land the
2002 Winter Games after several failures, the IOC is also
investigating bids from other years, including Nagano, Japan, in
1998 and Sydney in 2000, and has asked cities for evidence of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll come forward. Maybe we'll find some additional
names. Maybe we'll find the same people,'' Pound said Monday night
on ABC's ``Nightline.'' ``It's not something we're shirking. It's
going to be painful and it's embarrassing, but we're going to come
out of it, I think, a stronger and better Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC vice president Marc Hodler of Switzerland, the longtime head
of the international ski federation and a member since 1963, has
said that the awarding of the 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002 Games were
all tainted by vote-peddling and that more than two dozen of his
colleagues were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC is going to get one bite at this apple and they have
to do it right,'' said David D'Alessandro, president of John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., an Olympic worldwide sponsor
that will ``wait and see'' about staying on past 2000. ``They're
going to have to look beyond Salt Lake. They're going to have to go
back a couple of Games and forward a couple of Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The 13 IOC members under investigation _ among them, reportedly,
Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, David Sikhulumi
Sibandze of Swaziland, Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of Libya, Vitaly
Smirnov of Russia, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Sergio Santander of
Chile, and Anthonius Geesink of the Netherlands _ are all involved
in the Salt Lake case.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, the longtime IOC president from Spain
who is under fire himself but has vowed to serve ``until the last
minute'' of his term in 2001, said nine of the cases are ``grave''
and four are ``less hanging.''
</P>
<P>
   Haeggman's case reportedly was not grave. Her ex-husband,
Bjarne, reportedly worked briefly for the Salt Lake City bid
committee and for 20 months in an Ontario government job arranged
by the Toronto committee bidding for the 1996 Summer Games, which
went to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not guilty of anything other than naivete,'' said
Haeggman, who added that she did not know that her rent was being
paid by the Toronto bidders while she lived with her husband in
Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. ``My conscience is completely clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The more serious cases involve cash payoffs up to $70,000, free
surgery worth thousands of dollars, tuition payments worth nearly
$500,000, and a Utah land deal that reportedly netted Ganga
$60,000. IOC rules forbid members from accepting any gift worth
more than $150, although Olympic insiders say the limit was
frequently ignored during the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be a different gift every day in our room,'' said
Helmick.
</P>
<P>
   Besides pushing for more resignations next weekend, the
executive board is expected to recommend the end of the
junketeering culture that evolved into payoffs. Besides forbidding
members to visit the six European cities bidding for the 2006
Winter Games, which will be awarded in June, the IOC is likely to
ban all future visits beyond those of its site evaluation
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the responsibility of the IOC to have this over with, and
we will do what is necessary,'' said DeFrantz. ``We have to.''

FIDELITY FUNDS STOCKING UP ON INTERNET ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: eBay is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a sign that mainstream institutional investors are
feeling some of the effects of Internet fever, many mutual funds at
Fidelity Investments hold increasingly greater amounts of
technology stocks, including high-flying Internet shares.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy and a dearth of timely data make it tough to tell
exactly what Fidelity is buying.
</P>
<P>
   But industry watchers say the nation's largest fund firm is not
placing huge bets on the most stratospheric Internet shares, such
as eBay and Amazon.com. Rather, they say, Fidelity is betting on
top-tier Internet issues, such as America Online and Yahoo, and
putting some second-tier stocks in smaller, more aggressive funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complex-wide, they're not loading up on risky Internet
shares,'' said Jim Lowell, editor of the independent Fidelity
Investor newsletter. But he said the recent strong gains of some
Fidelity funds, including New Millennium, Fidelity Fifty, and
Capital Appreciation, were mostly due to Internet holdings and
other tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Only nine months ago the domain of a few small, high-risk funds,
Internet stocks now dot some of the biggest mutual funds around.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Fidelity's $83.6 billion Magellan, the nation's largest
mutual fund. Magellan skipper Robert Stansky doubled his stake in
tech shares last year to 25.8 percent of assets, according to a
report released Tuesday by Fidelity. In the last three months of
1997, America Online burst into Magellan's top 10 holdings as the
number-three bet. And computer industry-related stocks represented
four out of Magellan's top five picks as of the end of December _
an increase of nearly 4 percent in just two months.
</P>
<P>
   In a similiar vein, the $179 million Fidelity Fifty fund has one
fifth of its assets in Internet-related stocks, according to recent
estimates by Fidelity watcher Eric M. Kobren.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, part of the heftier place of tech and Internet shares
in Fidelity funds is due to the market's rally since October, and
not just new buying. In some cases, Fidelity has even been selling
Internet stocks. In the last quarter, it cut its complex-wide
holdings in Etrade to 2.9 million shares from 4.1 million, and
pruned its Lycos holdings to 2.7 million from 4.1 million,
according to The Carson Group, which tracks fund holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fidelity was the top institutional shareholder of Yahoo
and America Online at the end of September, the most recent data
point available, Carson said. With Internet shares growing
astronomically, it is not hard to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Internet stocks move into the mainstream and the indexes,
it forces managers to purchase them'' to match index returns, said
John Rekenthaler, research director at Morningstar Inc., the
Chicago fund tracker.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly such holdings have helped many Fidelity funds to
achieve top gains. Magellan, closed to new investors, rose 33.6
percent in 1998, beating the S&AMP;P 500 index by 5 points.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers see plenty of risk in Internet stocks, many of
which are backed by growing corporate revenues but no profits.
Should the Internet stock boom fizzle _ and not all of the popular
companies will be on top in 18 months _ fund returns could suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Internet mania may also affect ordinary investors' retirement
plans. ``The Internet invasion has been so rapid,'' Rekenthaler
said. ``A sector that was invisible last year is now showing up in
401(k)s.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web has also changed the way Fidelity does business. Last
year the firm tripled its on-line investing accounts to 3 million
and doubled the number of Web-generated new accounts.

COMMERCE CUTTING AUTO INSURANCE DISCOUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' best drivers are likely to get hit with
a double-digit increase in their auto insurance bills this year, as
companies slash the discounts off state-set rates they have offered
good drivers the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Insurance of Webster, the state's largest auto insurer
with more than a fifth of all drivers, said Tuesday it plans to cut
its discount for drivers in the best Step 9 safe-driver
classification from 15 percent to 5 percent. The discount for Step
10 drivers will fall from 4 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce move mirrors a similar announcement on Friday by
Arbella Mutual Insurance Co., the state's second-largest auto
insurer. Analysts expect other insurers to quickly follow suit,
which means good drivers will be looking at an increase of about 12
percent in their auto insurance rates this year even though state
regulators hiked the basic rate only 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if any other companies bucked this
trend,'' said Josh Kratka, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Public
Interest Research Group. ``And I'd be surprised if any discounts
remain next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappearing discounts represent a major blow for drivers,
particularly those with the cleanest records. State officials say
nearly 57 percent of the state's drivers are in the Step 9
classification, while nearly 14 percent are in the Step 10
category.
</P>
<P>
   For the typical Commerce customer in the Step 9 classification,
the increase this year will amount to about $80, or 12.5 percent.
That calculation assumes an $800 premium last year and no changes
in vehicle, insurance coverage, or Step ranking this year. It also
assumes the driver continues to receive Commerce's 6 percent
discount for members of the American Automobile Association.
</P>
<P>
   While Commerce is maintaining its AAA discount at 6 percent,
other insurers have already signaled their intention to scale back
the discounts they offer to members of particular groups. That
could mean rates will go up even more for customers of those
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce could still reverse itself and hike its good-driver
discount, as it did last year when Arbella topped Commerce's
initial 10 percent discount with a 14 percent offer. But most
analysts say insurers are primed this year to curb the competition
that has cut into their bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The competition began in 1995, when Commerce tried to boost its
customer base by offering a 10 percent discount off of state-set
rates to anyone who joined AAA. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. of
Boston responded by offering a 10 percent rate cut to Step 9
drivers, a discount Commerce matched. A furious round of
discounting off the state-set rates ensued, as companies flush with
profits tried to increase their market share.
</P>
<P>
   But as state regulators cut basic rates each of the last four
years, the companies complained they could no longer afford to
continue offering the discounts. The discounts were scaled back
last year in some areas, but actually increased for Step 9 drivers.
This year the discounts for Step 9 drivers appear to be shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Battista, a spokesman for Commerce, blamed his company's
decision to reduce its good-driver discounts on Insurance
Commissioner Linda Ruthardt, who increased basic auto rates by only
0.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revenues just aren't there any more to support the
discounts,'' Battista said. ``I believe you're going to find the
rest of the industry doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts, which
represents auto insurers operating in the state, Tuesday said it
planned to challenge Ruthardt's rate decision before the Supreme
Judicial Court. The bureau, which had sought a 15.5 percent
increase in basic rates this year, indicated it would challenge
sanctions Ruthardt imposed on the industry as well as the adequacy
of the rates she set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner ignored the overwhelming evidence the
industry presented,'' said Daniel Johnston, president of the
bureau, who noted basic rates today are at the same level they were
in 1988. ``In fact, this decision appears to be based on public
opinion polls rather than sound actuarial principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite insurance company complaints, Kratka of Masspirg said he
is not convinced that the industry's profits are lower today than
they were in each of the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Kratka said he feared insurers were slowly returning to the
pre-1995 era, when every company offered the same state-set
insurance rates. He urged consumers to shop around for the best
deal this year and patronize any company _ even if it's a small one
_ that offers larger discounts. He said the bigger companies may be
forced to increase their discounts if they fear losing customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing the companies are going to listen to is the
bottom line,'' Kratka said.

OBESITY DRUG CAN LEAD TO MODEST WEIGHT LOSS, STUDY FINDS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GINA KOLATA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest and longest study ever of an obesity medication
found that a new drug, orlistat, can help obese people lose modest
amounts of weight, a study being published on Wednesday says.
</P>
<P>
   While orlistat is not yet approved for marketing, its maker,
Hoffmann-La Roche of Nutley, N.J., said that the Food and Drug
Administration had sent the company a letter saying the drug could
be approved if it sent the agency additional safety information. On
Tuesday, the company submitted that data, said Dr. Jonathan
Hauptman, the director of metabolic research at Hoffmann-La Roche.
</P>
<P>
   The study, paid for by Hoffmann-La Roche and published Wednesday
in the Journal of the American Medical Association, involved 892
healthy, but obese, adults, mostly women, who were studied at 18
medical centers across the country. Their average weight at the
start of the study was about 220 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   After one year, those who were randomly assigned to take
orlistat and follow a weight loss diet lost an average of 19.3
pounds while those assigned to take a dummy pill and follow the
weight loss diet lost about 12.8 pounds. That meant, Hauptman said,
that the weight loss with orlistat was 50 percent greater than with
placebo. Others pointed out that the difference was about 6 1/2
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the second year of the study, the orlistat group was divided,
with half the participants randomly assigned to continue taking the
drug and to follow a weight maintenance diet and the others
randomly assigned to take a placebo and follow the weight
maintenance diet. Those who took the drug regained an average of 7
pounds while those who took a placebo regained 12.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the study participants dropped out before the two years
were up.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Heymsfield of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center in
New York, who was the lead author of the study, said its advantage
was that the study was so large and so prolonged, asking not just
whether people could lose weight over a period of weeks or months
but over years. ``This study is the largest and longest of an
obesity drug ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orlistat, whose brand name is Xenical, blocks an enzyme that is
needed to digest fat. The fat in the food a person eats then
accumulates in the intestines and is excreted, undigested. That
mechanism of action causes the drug's main side effect, one that
Dr. David Williamson of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention described as ``embarrassing or inconvenient, to say the
least.'' Most people who take orlistat complain of intestinal gas
and bloating, and loose, smelly and oily stools.
</P>
<P>
   The larger concern about orlistat, however, is that it is not a
blockbuster drug, as even its champions admit. The average weight
loss it elicits is minimal. After all, said Dr. Jules Hirsch, an
obesity expert at Rockefeller University in New York, the
difference in weight lost between obese people taking orlistat and
those taking a placebo was fewer than seven pounds. ``Esthetically,
they won't even know they lost the weight,'' Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Heymsfield acknowledged: ``It's not a magic bullet.'' But, he
said, the people taking orlistat had other benefits that might have
made them healthier by reducing their risk of heart disease. Their
blood pressure was about a point lower than that of the group
taking placebos; their cholesterol levels averaged 201 compared to
195 in the placebo group, and their blood sugar levels were about 2
percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   And, Heymsfield said, even the disagreeable gastrointestinal
side effects might be helpful. People who eat a fatty meal and then
suffer the orlistat-induced consequences might think twice about
indulging again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Antabuse of weight control,'' Heymsfield said,
referring to the drug prescribed for alcoholics that makes them ill
if they drink alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Bouchard, an obesity expert at Laval University in
Quebec City, said that orlistat is valuable because obesity is such
an uncompromising medical problem with virtually no drugs in
doctors' arsenals. Orlistat, he said, ``would give physicians some
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to make people reach an ideal weight,'' said
Hauptman of Hoffmann-La Roche. Instead, he said, it is to help
people ``reach a more biologically acceptable weight,'' one where
they are healthier.
</P>
<P>
   But medical experts called in by the Food and Drug
Administration were divided over orlistat's value. The FDA usually
follows its experts' advice but is not required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In March, an advisory committee to the agency split 5-5 on the
question of whether the drug should be marketed. Hirsch, a member
of that committee who voted against approving the drug, said that
he considered the weight loss minimal and the improvements in heart
disease risk factors so small that it was impossible to say that
the drug would lead to improved health. Moreover, even if people
took the drug religiously, they would start to gain back their lost
weight after a year, he noted. Given what he saw as minuscule
benefits, Hirsch worried about possibly ephemeral hints of risks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the data Hoffmann-La Roche presented to the FDA
last year, pooled from several studies, including the current one
and looking at 7,000 people, showed that 10 women taking orlistat
developed breast cancer but just one taking placebos got the
disease. The company argued that there was no biological reason why
orlistat would cause breast cancer, but the FDA asked for a
detailed analysis of the question.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis, Hauptman said, was provided in the company's
response to the FDA Tuesday. He said it showed that some of the
women were diagnosed with breast cancer within six months of
starting to take orlistat _ too soon for the drug to have caused
the cancers. Other women already had evidence of breast cancer on
mammograms when they entered the study. The company's analysis,
Hauptman said, ``supports our conclusion that there is no increased
risk.'' In the study published Wednesday, the women who took
orlistat had the same incidence of breast cancer as those who took
a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   But Williamson, who wrote an editorial accompanying the orlistat
article, asked whether the drug was needed. He worried about its
safety when ``tens of thousands or even millions of people start
taking this drug.'' The company's studies, he added, were not
designed to look at breast cancer risk and he, for one, was not
satisfied that the question had been answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk-benefit ratio for this drug is incomplete,''
Williamson said. ``We usually don't like to buy things if we don't
know what they will deliver, and we don't know what this drug will
deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``someone has to pay for these drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies ordinarily announce a drug's price when it is
approved for marketing, and Hoffmann-La Roche has not said what
orlistat will cost if it is sold in the United States. But Valerie
Suga, a company spokeswoman, said that orlistat, which was approved
for sale in most of Europe at the end of July, costs about $116 a
month there.

STEELE PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO IMPEDING STARR PROBE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Va.)  (See related stories: IMPEACH, IMPEACH-CLINTON, IMPEACH-STEELE) 
(bl) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ As President Clinton's lawyers opened his
defense before the Senate on Tuesday, a peripheral figure in the
impeachment drama pleaded not guilty in federal court here to
charges she interfered with the independent counsel's investigation
of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not guilty,'' declared Julie Hiatt Steele, whose
lawyer charged that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr had brought
the case in Virginia solely to avoid a decision in the District of
Columbia, where a similar case brought by his office was thrown out
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office charged Ms. Steele earlier this month with three
counts of obstructing justice and one count of making false
statements when she cast doubt on accusations that Clinton once
groped a friend of hers, Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele's lawyer, Nancy Luque, told Judge Claude Hilton that
the case really belonged in the District of Columbia and that she
would wage a legal battle to have it moved there.
</P>
<P>
   In charging that Starr brought the indictment in Virginia in
order to avoid the federal court in the District, Ms. Luque was
apparently referring to the tax fraud case against Webster Hubbell,
a longtime Arkansas friend of Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton. Judge James Robertson threw out that case last July,
declaring in a stern ruling that the Hubbell tax investigation had
far exceeded Starr's mandate and amounted to a fishing expedition.
Starr is appealing that decision.
</P>
<P>
   David Barger, a prosecutor from the Office of Independent
Counsel, did not respond in court to Ms. Luque's charge and
declined to comment after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Ms. Steele involves an affidavit and statements
she made about her knowledge of whether Clinton made an unwanted
sexual advance to Ms. Willey in the Oval Office in 1993. Ms.
Willey, who was a White House volunteer at the time, has claimed
that Clinton grabbed her intimately when they were alone briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele initially told a reporter for Newsweek magazine that
Ms. Willey told her of the incident just after she said it
occurred. But Ms. Steele then recanted that account and gave an
affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit denying that
Ms. Willey had ever told her of the incident. Ms. Steele said later
that she had claimed knowledge of the incident only as a favor to
Ms. Willey, who had asked her to lie to confirm the account she had
given to the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied that he had ever made a sexual advance to Ms.
Willey, both in his grand jury testimony and in his deposition in
the Jones case, and described her as a discredited person.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Steele is a peripheral figure to the investigation
of the president, her refusal to back up Ms. Willey's story was
apparently a major factor in Starr's decision not to include
information about Ms. Willey in his impeachment report to the
House. Moreover, Starr is continuing to investigate whether people
friendly to Clinton sought to influence Ms. Willey to change her
story to be more favorable to the president.
</P>
<P>
   To Starr's critics, his prosecution of Ms. Steele demonstrates
his lack of proportion and how far he will go to attack anyone who
gets in his way. One of the counts of obstructing justice includes
an appearance that Ms. Steele made on the CNN television talk show
``Larry King Live,'' where she again disputed Ms. Willey's account.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having Ms. Steele testify before the grand jury
on two occasions, the independent counsel also had the grand jury
take testimony from her daughter and brother. Ms. Steele, a
52-year-old single mother from Richmond, has said Starr's
investigators raised pointed questions about the legality of her
adoption of an East European child in an effort to intimidate her.
Starr has denied that any such activity took place.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luque has charged that the timing of the case was designed
to coincide with the impeachment trial. Charles Bakaly, a spokesman
for Starr, dismissed those claims, saying the indictment was
brought as soon as it was ready. Hilton set a trial date of March
30.

THE SPEECH CLINTON DIDN'T MAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - He spoke of the state of the union, boasted of its
strength, offered his annual assortment of tiny measures. For a man
so obsessed with the sweep of history, Bill Clinton passed on a
grand chance Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He could have delivered America's first State of the Presidency
address.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been more fitting than the speech Clinton chose to
give, more statesmanlike, more significant. With a few hundred
frank words, our first Tabloid President could have restored some
of what he has leeched from his office. It is high time. It is not
so hard to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of the 106th
Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans:
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand before you tonight with a heavy heart, a heart
weighted down by a confession too long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pains me to say this, but the truth must come out, however
painful. The truth is more dear than any man's feelings, or any
man's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, I lied to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lied on national television about my relationship with
Monica Lewinsky. I played semantical games and shaded the truth
during testimony given under oath. I lied in ways that have damaged
and diminished this nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans, as I have said before, I am sorry. I
regret my actions and my failure to address them. Tonight I intend
to confront these lies head on, for a simple reason: The state of
the union is irrevocably linked to the state of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union is strong, too often despite me. The presidency is
weak, too much because of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in America, and not so long ago, citizens looked to their
ultimate leader as a point of pride, an example. In times demanding
great deeds, presidents did great things. I studied them in school,
hoped to emulate them, had that coveted opportunity in my grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see now that I failed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``I let my personal appetites negate my public
responsibilities. I let my fear of embarrassment push me to engage
in deception. I broke faith with the American public, and allowed
what I thought were private acts sully the White House, that most
sacred public place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did all this on your time, in your building. It is no wonder
that my office _ your office, America's office _ is now the object
of jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be able to believe our President, my fellow
Americans. His words should carry authority. They should not ring
hollow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, in 1995, I stood in this same hall and urged Democrats
and Republican leaders alike to strive harder, work closer.
</P>
<P>
   `` `For we are the keepers of the sacred trust,' I said that
night, `and we must be faithful to it in this new and very
demanding era.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I shattered that trust. I was unfaithful in every sense of the
word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of that I intend to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of you in this country believe that I have been
persecuted by a group of rank partisans. I believe that, too. I
believe that the impeachment process has been a sham, a political
charade.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how true that is, remember one thing: The wrongs of
Congress do not right my wrongs, nor will their wrongs undo the
damage I have caused. Only I can do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so I will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk away hoping for a new American dawn, full of truth and
honor, free of stains and lies. I want the presidency, our highest
office, to be strong in deed and word, to raise our union, to
inspire it, not hold it back. Thank you. God bless you. And God
bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   You heard the speech Bill Clinton gave instead: The new American
dawn went unmentioned. He never acknowledged the sunset of the
American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he gave one more speech, on one more night, with one
more set of promises.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small moment full of small vows from the smallest of
presidents. &QL;

CLINTON DEFENSE GETS OFF TO PROTRACTED START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think the broadcast networks devoted more time to White
House counsel Charles Ruff's defense of President Clinton Tuesday
than they did to the arguments last week of the Republican House
``managers,'' you're right.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: Ruff talked longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting more time because he's taking more time,'' said
ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. ``That's the God's-honest truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks had committed to identical levels of coverage for
the opening statements of both sides during Clinton's impeachment
trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, compared to Clinton's GOP antagonists, Ruff required an
hour more of airtime to deliver his opening statement Tuesday. ``In
both cases, we carried the opening statements in which each side
laid out their case,'' said CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius. ``Ruff
did go longer.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, and NBC all broadcast Ruff's appearance live Tuesday,
as did all-news cable networks CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, Fox News
Channel, and New England Cable News. Today, however, ABC and CBS do
not plan live coverage, though they will break into regular
programming if news warrants it, and will also offer their local
affiliates an alternate feed of coverage. NBC's plans were not
clear as of Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   While the broadcast networks did not reap sizable viewer gains
from last week's impeachment proceedings, as many soap-opera buffs
tuned out once their programs were preempted, the White House
scandal continued to be a ratings bonanza for the all-news cable
networks.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, CNN drew 1.5 million households during the first
day of the Senate impeachment trial last Thursday, an increase of
132 percent over its usual audience. MSNBC was watched by an
average of 304,000 households, an increase of 158 percent, while
Fox News Channel drew 276,000 households, up 153 percent.

UPCOMING VOTES A MOVE TO EASE BRAZIL'S BUDGET DEFICIT, CALM
INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
   (See related BRAZIL-MOOD) 
(dal) 
 By LARRY ROHTER  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ The battle to prop up the nation's currency
has already been lost in a costly confrontation with international
markets. Now, in an attempt to preserve what remains of its
economic program the Brazilian government is trying to pass
legislation intended to reduce a huge budget deficit and calm
investors.
</P>
<P>
   A series of crucial votes in the Brazilian Congress during the
next few weeks are expected to determine quickly whether that
endeavor is also doomed. ``Never have the options been so stark, so
blunt,'' the country's leading news magazine, Veja, warns in this
week's issue. ``If the deficits are not dried up, the country will
not be viable.''
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial of the measures is a sweeping reform of
the social security system that the two houses of the Brazilian
Congress have already rejected a combined total of four times, most
recently in December. But no less important, as foreign investors
and lenders have made clear, is a proposal that would swell the
government's coffers by increasing and prolonging an existing tax
on financial transactions like checks.
</P>
<P>
   As had been predicted, the Senate on Tuesday decisively approved
the increase in the financial transactions levy, by a 64-to-12
vote. Senators had already done so earlier in the month by
virtually the same margin, but because the proposal would result in
an amendment to the constitution, the 81-member body was required
to confirm its earlier decision.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by that action and other signs that stability may be
returning after two weeks of financial turmoil, the Brazilian stock
market on Tuesday rose 3.75 percent in heavy trading. The exchange
rate for the real, the national currency, remained almost unchanged
over Monday, at 1.55 to the dollar, compared to 1.21 to the dollar
a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of the tax measure in the lower chamber, where it
is expected to come to a vote next week, is much less certain.
There the government has had less success in getting what it wants
when it wants it, and must cobble together from a fractious
five-party coalition not just a simple majority but more than 60
percent of the 513 members, or 308 deputies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's problem is not the opposition,'' said
Alexandre Barros, a political analyst here. ``It is allies who
don't vote with the government'' or who fail to show up when
crucial votes are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the financial transactions tax for three more years is
considered one of the most important elements in enabling Brazil to
comply with the agreement it signed in November with the
International Monetary Fund. If approved, the measure would nearly
double the existing levy, from 0.2 percent to 0.38 percent, and
increase government revenues by as much as $10 billion this year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Congress' previous unwillingness to approve changes in
social security that would require retirees to make payments to the
system, government leaders think that they have a better chance
this time. After much negotiation, the proposal has been amended to
exempt both those who are over 70 and those whose income is less
than $400 a month, thereby placing most of the financial burden on
a relatively small number of former government employees who enjoy
pensions of as much as $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and his besieged economic
team are eager, if not desperate, to get both bills passed, along
with a 1999 budget that still is being debated, before the end of
the month. The term of the current Congress expires then, and the
new Congress that takes office on Feb. 1 is expected to be
distracted for several weeks with organizational issues, including
who will get what seat on what committee, and the annual recess for
Carnival, which this year ends on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are unforgiving on certain matters, even if their
judgment is not always rational, and this government has had to
learn that the hard way,'' a Latin American diplomat with long
experience in Brazil said here Monday. ``Because the government has
already had problems with these bills, any further delay is going
to be interpreted by stock and money exchanges as a sign of
continued weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the nation last week, Cardoso said that prompt
action on the fiscal reform measures was essential if Brazil is to
restore its credibility. He estimated that 70 percent of the
measures needed for Brazil to be fully in compliance with the IMF
accord are now in place, and urged the legislators to finish the
job quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than ever, combating the deficit is fundamental'' if
Brazil is to ``overcome the instability we are living through,''
Cardoso said. ``I'm counting on Congress for that.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the magnitude of the crisis seems to have
strengthened Cardoso's hand with lawmakers and made passage of the
remaining bills more likely. As the Senate majority leader, Antonio
Carlos Magalhaes, put it in an interview Tuesday, legislators
finally realized that ``the whole world is watching'' and that
Brazil's reputation is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a matter of days, the climate in Congress became highly
favorable to passage of several major bills of interest to the
government,'' said Walder de Goes, director of the Brazilian
Institute of Political Studies, a political consulting firm here.
``There is a generalized perception that things will most probably
worsen if the necessary fiscal adjustments are not adopted in the
very near future.''

`THE MILKY WAY': AS LIFE GOES ON, OR NOT
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes are at end of review) 
(dal) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life in an Arab village in Galilee and the tensions of military
rule by Israel in 1964 are transmitted with insight and skill in
``The Milky Way,'' and understandably so.
</P>
<P>
   This atmospheric and sharply acted subtitled Arab-language film,
at Anthology Film Archives, is directed by Ali Nassar, the film's
co-writer, who was brought up in such a community. On the surface,
life goes on. Men board trucks to go off to work. A shepherd tends
flocks of goats. A smith pounds at his anvil. The village fool
capers with the children. The pretty schoolteacher holds class.
Young men concern themselves with romance.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface, there are other stories. Someone has been
forging work permits. The Israeli military governor (Yussef Abu
Warda) wants to know who, and his troops have little patience with
the Arabs. The mukhtar (Makram Khoury) who rules the village would
like to help the occupiers, although he has problems at home, among
them a wastrel son with a cruel streak. And some of the villagers,
now adults, remain traumatized by the bloodshed and death they
experienced as children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Milky Way'' takes its title from that ancient question of
who is responsible for events; is it the stars that determine fate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problems are our doing, not the stars','' says Mahmmud
(Muhammad Bakri), the craggy smith who is Nassar's protagonist. A
decent man who is hopeful of marriage and is a brother in all but
blood to the traumatized town fool, Mabruq (Suheil Haddad), Mahmmud
is fated to be drawn inescapably into a web created out of his
protectiveness toward Mabruq, his romance, the jealousy of the
mukhtar's son and his knowledge of the source of the forged work
permits.
</P>
<P>
   Bakri and Haddad are captivating performers who command the
screen and enlist sympathy in a film that maintains a simultaneous
awareness of mankind's yearning for peace and friendship and the
simple pleasures of life and the harsh, bloody reality of an
imperfect world.
</P>
<P>

BUSH REACHES OUT TO `ARMIES OF CONSERVATISM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Playing on his ability to bridge partisan
divides while giving no hint of greater ambition, Texas Governor
George W. Bush began a second term Tuesday with an inaugural
address that touched on the themes of Lyndon Johnson's Great
Society as well as the Republican family values embraced by his own
father, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old governor, who is expected to seek the GOP
presidential nomination on a platform of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' continued his effort to win over erstwhile
Democratic constituencies by calling on ``the armies of compassion
. . . to love, to nurture, to mentor, to help, and thus to offer
hope to those who have none.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's lines were consistent with the ``war on poverty''
rhetoric of Johnson, whose presidential library is within walking
distance of the Texas state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in his next breath, Bush spoke of traditional Republican
values that regard certain ``moral judgments'' as essential. ``For
our children to have the kind of life we want for them,'' Bush
said, ``they must learn to say yes to responsibility, yes to
family, yes to honesty and work, and no to drugs, no to violence,
no to promiscuity or having babies out of wedlock.''
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural celebration, featuring a jet flyover, a cannonade,
and a Texas barbecue for 15,000 spectators on the south lawn of the
state capitol, served as a sharp counterpoint to events in
Washington, where Congress prepared to hear President Clinton's
State of the Union address even as the Senate struggled through
another day of his impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who won reelection with overwhelming numbers last year, is
not expected to reveal his national plans until a 140-day
legislative session is completed this spring. He was a critic of
Clinton's character well before the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal
broke and has long harbored a desire to avenge his father's defeat
at the hands of Clinton in 1992. But he has said repeatedly that he
is withholding a decision on the presidential campaign, and made it
clear he will not run unless his wife, Laura, and their 17-year-old
twin daughters approve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't met one 17-year-old child who is eager to get
dragged through the national spotlight,'' Bush said earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the air at the Texas capitol was that of a presidential
warm-up, two years and one day from the next inauguration in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush and his wife, Barbara, were present. Though the
Texas governor's younger brother, Jeb, the new governor of Florida,
was not on hand, Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci had a
front-row seat.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate Republican, who has been a friend of George W. Bush
since working for his father's first presidential campaign in 1979,
was the only out-of-state governor to attend Tuesday's
inauguration. Cellucci said he hoped Bush will run for president,
but added, ``It's his decision, and one he and his whole family
will have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush does enter the 2000 race, Cellucci said, ``I'll be with
him all the way, in New Hampshire, in Massachusetts, wherever. The
Republican Party should look to a governor like him, someone who
gets things done by appealing to a broad spectrum of citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic legislators in Texas who attended the ceremony
also sang of Bush's bipartisan appeal and vowed to support him in a
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Gibson, a six-term legislator who is now a senior vice
president for Houston Industries, a giant Texas utility, said Bush
had mastered the art of ``connecting with people at every level,''
especially in a legislature where the Republicans now control the
Senate by only one vote while the Democrats command the House by a
mere six votes. ``The guy develops relationships on a personal
level,'' said Gibson, who described himself as a conservative
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schieffer, president of the Texas Rangers, a three-term
Democratic legislator and Bush's former business partner, called
the governor ``a great politician because he's not a politician.
He's very affable and likes people.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer said he expected Bush to become a presidential
candidate. ``But part of me wouldn't be surprised if he didn't,''
Schieffer said. ``He's seen the heartaches that goes with being
president, what it does to a family. I guess he'll go for it, but I
don't think he'll consider his life a failure if he doesn't.''

BOSTON MAYOR ON THE WRONG STAGE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino took the stage of the
Huntington Theater Tuesday night for an annual spoof of a
Shakespearean comedy, playing the role of a mayor trying to host
the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same moment, Menino's real-life rival was playing on
a larger stage.
</P>
<P>
   Wellington E. Webb, mayor of Denver, Boston's leading competitor
to host the 2000 Democratic convention, was sitting with Hillary
Rodham Clinton in the House chamber as President Clinton delivered
his State of the Union speech. Webb basked in the national
spotlight as the president cited Denver as an urban model for the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Boston, Menino grumbled to aides about Webb's free
publicity to hawk his city in the critical days and weeks leading
to the selection of one of three finalists _ Los Angeles, Denver,
or Boston _ as the convention host.
</P>
<P>
   Menino, who insists that Boston is the best showcase for the
urban successes of the Clinton-Gore era, bristled at the contrast
between his evening and Webb's.
</P>
<P>
   While Webb was racking up points in the nation's capitol, Menino
was cavorting with men in tights at the Huntington. The mayor and
local luminaries of academia, banking, and the media stood in for
the regular players in a ``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' an annual
performance to build support for the Huntington's educational
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In Menino's cameo, he is welcomed to Athens by Duke Theseus and
his wife, Hippolyta. But Menino mistakes them for the DNC site
committee. There's a joke about the Big Dig commencing in ancient
Athens, and Menino gets to make a crack about the Patriots.
(Meanwhile, Denver's team is heading to the Super Bowl.)
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of several hundred people watched Menino's performance.
</P>
<P>
   And Webb? His audience was counted in the tens of millions.

CLINTON DEFENSE GETS OFF TO PROTRACTED START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you think the broadcast networks devoted more time to White
House counsel Charles Ruff's defense of President Clinton Tuesday
than they did to the arguments last week of the Republican House
``managers,'' you're right.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: Ruff talked longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting more time because he's taking more time,'' said
ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. ``That's the God's-honest truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks had committed to identical levels of coverage for
the opening statements of both sides during Clinton's impeachment
trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, compared to Clinton's GOP antagonists, Ruff required an
hour more of airtime to deliver his opening statement Tuesday. ``In
both cases, we carried the opening statements in which each side
laid out their case,'' said CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius. ``Ruff
did go longer.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, and NBC all broadcast Ruff's appearance live Tuesday,
as did all-news cable networks CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, Fox News
Channel, and New England Cable News. Today, however, ABC and CBS do
not plan live coverage, though they will break into regular
programming if news warrants it, and will also offer their local
affiliates an alternate feed of coverage. NBC's plans were not
clear as of Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   While the broadcast networks did not reap sizable viewer gains
from last week's impeachment proceedings, as many soap-opera buffs
tuned out once their programs were preempted, the White House
scandal continued to be a ratings bonanza for the all-news cable
networks.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, CNN drew 1.5 million households during the first
day of the Senate impeachment trial last Thursday, an increase of
132 percent over its usual audience. MSNBC was watched by an
average of 304,000 households, an increase of 158 percent, while
Fox News Channel drew 276,000 households, up 153 percent.

RUFF'S APPROACH JUST RIGHT, LEGAL OBSERVERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This was not the way it was supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts inside and outside the White House had predicted that
President Clinton's defenders probably would not dispute the facts
underlying the impeachment charges lodged against him. To do that,
the prognosticators said, would amount to inviting live testimony _
because that's how disagreements are resolved in any court
proceeding _ and everyone agreed that calling witnesses was the
last thing Clinton's lawyers wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   Yet legal analysts Tuesday praised the president's lead
attorney, Charles Ruff, even though he mounted a frontal assault on
the facts as they have been presented by the independent counsel
and the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a giant today,'' said Ira Reiner, a former
district attorney in Los Angeles, in remarks typical of most
attorneys and legal scholars interviewed after Ruff's opening
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Johnson, a prominent defense lawyer in Boston, said he
not only found Ruff to be ``persuasive'' but also enjoyed watching
him outline the defense case.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason for their glowing assessment clearly was the White
House counsel's style: concise, compelling, and subtly forceful. It
was an engaging approach that seemed aimed at winning over GOP
moderates who might have been alienated by a more aggressive tack,
the legal specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   They added that Ruff appeared to aim at the same audience with
his arguments of why the allegations against Clinton, even if true,
don't warrant his removal from office. By forcefully asserting that
impeachment was designed only for instances of gross presidential
malfeasance, according to those interviewed, Ruff sought to raise
the bar for Republicans who might be wavering over the severity of
Clinton's actions or over the intent of the words ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be casting to the center,'' said John Henry
Hingson 3d, an Oregon attorney and past president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``And the way that he did
it, I think he's got a very good chance of hooking a trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's decision to confront the facts of the case, as laid out
by Clinton's accusers, also drew plaudits for its careful attention
to detail and strong presentation. At the same time, some analysts
said it represented a calculated risk or even a mistake in tactics,
since it effectively opened the door to the calling of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Democratic lawmakers, who believe only a
surprise can now precipitate the president's ouster, have
consistently maintained that further testimony would yield no new
information while prolonging the trial. GOP critics, hoping some
revelation might come out to bolster their position, have been
equally insistent on the need for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   By offering alternative explanations for pivotal points _ for
example, that Clinton orchestrated a job hunt for Monica S.
Lewinsky and lied repeatedly about his affair with her _ Ruff
provided explicit disagreements that senators can cite as needing
resolution through live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dangerous thing to do ... because witnesses are
dangerous for everybody, but especially for Clinton,'' said F.
Dennis Saylor, a Boston attorney who was chief of staff at the
Justice Department's criminal division during the Bush
administration. Saylor, who praised Ruff's overall performance as
``terrific lawyering,'' nevertheless said the president's counsel
also may have hurt his cause if he angered GOP senators by deriding
the methods and motives of the independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, and of the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he believed Ruff made a ``serious tactical and
substantive mistake'' by attacking data that has been so
extensively investigated. ``I think many in the Senate will resent
the president's lawyers denying allegations which clearly can be
inferred to be true by the record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the analysts interviewed, while agreeing that
unpredictable testimony could present a problem for the defense,
said Ruff had more to gain than lose with his approach because
momentum for witnesses appeared unstoppable regardless of what he
said Tuesday. ``So I think he took the bull by the horns on the
witness issue and shoved it right back'' at Clinton's detractors,
said Gerald Lefcourt, a prominent defense attorney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lefcourt said Ruff did that by detailing what the three
principal players _ Lewinsky, Clinton's friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr.
and presidential secretary Betty Currie _ had already said under
oath in the past; maintaining that they would offer nothing new in
the future; and implying that the result would be to hurt the
prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph diGenova, a former prosecutor in Washington and staunch
critic of the president, agreed. Asserting that Ruff had ``done as
well as you could do ... with a client who lied,'' diGenova said
the White House apparently decided ``to play the big casino'' by
risking the calling of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that's what they really want,'' he said,
adding that Ruff's intent in laying out past testimony evidently
was to ``put fear in the hearts of those who would call
witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   All of those interviewed Tuesday were also called last week to
assess the presentation of the House prosecutors. With the
exception of diGenova, who indicated that both sides had performed
equally well, the analysts said the Republican lawmakers _ while
solid and convincing _ weren't as effective as Ruff, considered by
some to be one of the best litigators in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bloom, a professor at Boston College Law School, and
others said Ruff's brevity and flare for strong language, combined
with his unassuming manner, contrasted favorably with the styles of
the House managers. He said Ruff's emotional closing statement was
particularly strong.
</P>
<P>
   None of that was to say that minds were changed or that the
outcome of the trial was altered, Bloom said. But, he continued,
``At least in terms of reaching his listeners, he just did the
better job.''

INTEL BUYS 10 PERCENT STAKE IN PICTURETEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PictureTel Corp. is moving to put Intel inside its
videoconferencing products.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmaker Intel Corp. will pay $30.5 million for a 10 percent
stake in PictureTel, and the two companies will work together to
develop videoconferencing products based on Intel's Pentium line of
microprocessors and sold with PictureTel's brand name.
</P>
<P>
   It's a major strategy shift for PictureTel. The Andover, Mass.
company's videoconferencing hardware has been based on custom-made
processor chips. But chief executive officer Bruce Bond says it's
time for a change. ``It makes sense for us to start moving to
common processor architecture and less using (of) specialized
digital signal processing chips,'' Bond said. In the process,
PictureTel hopes to reduce its costs and broaden the market for
videoconferencing.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel is always on the
lookout for new markets for its processors _ preferably its most
powerful and expensive chips with the highest profit margins. ``The
only application that really requires this level of bandwidth for
the individual customer is video,'' said Bond.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, PictureTel will take over exclusive
worldwide marketing rights for several videoconferencing products
now sold by Intel. In the past, Intel had hoped to ignite the
market with its own products. But now, according to Michael
Witteman , Intel's director of videoconferencing product
development, the company would rather focus on creating the
underlying technologies. ``What we're moving onto is really
becoming the building block supplier for this industry,'' said
Witteman.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader , a videoconferencing analyst for H.C. Wainwright &AMP;
Co. in Boston, said the deal gives Intel a good way to get out of
the videoconferencing business directly, while remaining a
significant player. But he warned that the arrangement could cause
long-term problems for PictureTel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk for Picturetel is that Intel has its own agenda,''
Ader said. Intel could develop next-generation PCs with the
Intel-Picturetel technology built in. Such a PC would be ready for
videoconferencing right out of the box. ``Where does that leave
Picturetel in terms of its products?'' mused Ader. ``The uniqueness
of its products goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel stock Tuesday rose 5/16 to $10 a share and Intel
shares rose 4 to $139 3/8, both on the Nasdaq exchange.

BUSH BEGINS SECOND TERM WITH PRAISE FOR CULTURAL DIVERSITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trim) 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Seeking to reach out to all Texans _ and,
perhaps, all Americans _ Gov. George W. Bush began his second term
Tuesday with praise for cultural diversity and ``armies of
compassion'' that will march Texas into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   He also took a hard stance on moral values, insisting that
people and their political leaders ``must be willing to draw a
clear line between right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   With National Guard cannons booming a 19-gun salute, four jets
flying over the state Capitol and the sun breaking through a cloudy
sky only minutes before the start of the outdoor inaugural
ceremony, Bush, 52, became the first Texas governor sworn into a
second consecutive four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Perry, a former state representative from Haskell County
and former state agriculture commissioner, also took office as
Texas' first Republican lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, 48, would become the next governor if Bush runs for and
wins the presidency next year. Although he publicly insists he
hasn't decide whether to seek the White House, Bush is widely
viewed as the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the several thousand people who attended the inaugural
ceremony indicated they were there to hear and catch a glimpse of
the man who may be the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is expected to announce his intentions this spring,
avoided the subject in an inaugural address that featured some of
his favorite themes: education, personal responsibility and
reaching out to minority Texans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our diversity gives Texas new life, new energy, new blood, and
we should not fear but welcome it,'' Bush said in English. He
repeated the line in Spanish and drew applause for both versions.
</P>
<P>
   The governor _ who, according to some estimates, won almost half
of the Hispanic vote in his November landslide re-election _
adopted a bilingual inaugural theme, ``Together We Can _ Juntos
Podemos.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor warned against a ``trend in this country to put
people into boxes. Texans do not belong in little ethnic and racial
boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are such boxes all over the world,'' he said, ``in
places with names like Kosovo, Bosnia, Rwanda, and they are human
tragedies. As we head into the 21st century, we should have one big
box: American.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many inaugural speeches, Bush's address dealt with general
themes. It didn't outline specific legislative proposals. He will
discuss those in more detail in a ``state of the state'' speech to
lawmakers next week.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did remind the crowd that he opposes social
promotion in the public schools and said that Texas children ``must
be challenged to be the very best students they can be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First things first. Every child must learn to read,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Phyllis Hunter, the Houston Independent School
District's reading director, who refers to reading as ``the new
civil right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said children must also be educated ``in the values of a
civil society. We must teach them that there are right choices in
life and wrong choices in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think it's inappropriate to make moral judgments
anymore. Not me,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because for our children to have the kind of life we want for
them, they must learn to say yes to responsibility, yes to family,
yes to honesty and work ... and no to drugs, no to violence, no to
promiscuity or having babies out-of-wedlock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clear lines'' that are drawn between right and wrong by
families, neighbors and spiritual leaders, he added, also ``must be
supported by political leaders, public schools and our public
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't mention the long-running sex scandal involving
President Clinton or Clinton's impeachment trial, which was
unfolding in Washington as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor's message, which drew applause, painted a sharp
contrast to Washington and was likely welcomed by the religious and
social conservatives whose support is important in Republican
presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also touched on his theme of ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must rally the armies of compassion that are in every
community of this great state. We must encourage them to love, to
nurture, to mentor, to help and thus to offer hope to those who
have none,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perry joined Bush in calling for educational improvements,
``starting with reading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once our basic education, criminal justice, infrastructure and
human service priorities are met, we should give the people of
Texas some of their money back in the form of tax cuts,'' Perry
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new lieutenant governor also paid tribute to his
predecessor, Democrat Bob Bullock, who on Tuesday ended a public
service career that began more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the best way to express our love and gratitude is to
simply say, `God Bless Bob Bullock,''' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock and his wife, Jan, attended the inaugural ceremony,
which was held on a specially constructed stage, decorated in red,
white and blue, on the south steps of the Capitol. Bullock sat next
to the governor's parents, former President and Mrs. George Bush.
Several other members of the governor's family also attended. His
brother, Jeb Bush, the new governor of Florida, however, did not.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Phillips administered the
oath of office to the governor and the lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight as Bush, Perry and platform guests walked
from the Capitol for the ceremony under an arch of sabers raised by
the white-uniformed Ross Volunteers of Texas A&AMP;M University. Police
sharpshooters stood on the roofs of nearby office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred legislators, financial contributors and other
invited guests sat in folding chairs near the stage. But other
spectators had to stand behind a temporary, white picket fence
erected on the Capitol lawn. The closest vantage point behind that
fence was about 50 yards from the stage. And a huge photographers'
platform also blocked part of the crowd's view.
</P>
<P>
   Special guests included Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci,
Mexican Ambassador Jesus Reyes-Heroles and the governors of several
Mexican states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Perry began their day with a prayer service at Austin's
First United Methodist Church, across the street from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   After the inaugural ceremony, Texans were served barbecue under
two huge tents on the Capitol lawn, and, later Tuesday afternoon,
there was in inaugural parade on Congress Avenue in downtown
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Perry made the rounds at four inaugural balls Tuesday
night.

 &HT;    At Home acquisition of Excite announced; stocks soar
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At Home Corp. has struck an agreement to buy Excite in
a $6.7 billion purchase that would combine an Internet service
provider with a company offering content on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising announcement sent the stock of Excite and other
Internet stocks soaring, outdoing the price of America Online's
recently ballyhooed purchase of Netscape while sparking
expectations of still more mergers to come.
</P>
<P>
   The huge deal underscores the high-stakes now taken for granted
in the jostling for position among companies doing business on the
Internet _ especially those hoping to capitalize on or create the
high-speed capabilities of ``broadband'' technology. Multi-billion
values are now placed on companies with modest revenues that have
yet to report a profit. Excite's stock value before Tuesday's
announcement was $3.4 billion _ inflated by traditional,
pre-Internet measures, and yet barely half of what At Home is
willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are predicting that the combined company could have
revenue of $2 billion within three year, which just under half
coming from subscriptions paid for At Home's growing service. But
the numbers so far are just a shadow of those projections.
</P>
<P>
   At Home reported a $9.7 million loss on revenues of about $14
during the third fiscal quarter of last year. Excite lost $6.8
million on $44 million in revenue during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have offices next door to each other in
Redwood City, Cal. But the price of the deal and the splash it made
seemed due to the potential power of their combination to exploit
the Internet. Despite the vast increase in its use, the Net remains
a tiny part of the nation's $6 trillion economy. But the companies
_ and investors _ are betting that the economy is truly shifting to
the Net and those in position to offer connections or content will
profit accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Together, At Home and Excite will offer both.
</P>
<P>
   For At Home, the deal offers a chance to link with millions of
computer users, the very audience likely to care about the
high-speed connections AtHome can offer.
</P>
<P>
   At Home now has only about 330,000 subscribers for its
high-speed cable service. By contrast, Excite's site now draws a
daily average of 50 million page views, according to Jefferies &AMP;
Co. analyst Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Excite has compiled a range of services that include a network
of free sites, e-mail and stock quotes _ giving users a chance to
customize the offerings. For Excite, the deal with At Home can be
route to the capital needed for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But the connections reach farther than the two companies whose
names are on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Among At Home's minority investors is Cox Communications, which
is majority-owned by Cox Enterprises, owner of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. At Home is majority-owned by
Tele-Communications Inc., which has agreed to be purchased by AT&AMP;T.
Benefits of the Excite deal therefore may flow directly to AT&AMP;T,
which has been scrambling to find a way to directly connect to
consumers, avoiding the local phone companies and the access fees
they charge.
</P>
<P>
   The pending purchase of TCI is meant to give AT&AMP;T high-speed
access to millions of homes, a plan dependent on billions of
dollars in upgrades to cable lines. Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T is making deals
with other cable companies to fill in the gaps where TCI does not
offer service. In Georgia, for example, TCI has virtually no
presence.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T sees the direct connection to the home as potentially
the most lucrative of all.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong said Tuesday that At Home can
be his conduit for providing a variety of services for data and
voice. AT&AMP;T already has agreements with Excite, Lycos and others
for marketing its phone services via the Net.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's pending purchase of Netscape, another
combination of access and content, is currently valued at more than
$6 billion. With the At Home-Excite deal came the expectation of
other big-ticket mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the agreement sent shivers of excitement through
Wall Street where interest in Internet stocks already approached a
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Excite leaped a stunning $42.50 a share to close at $110, and
many other Net-related stocks were carried along in the euphoria.
Lycos closed at $112.9375 a share, up $25.0625. Yahoo Inc. rose $6
a share to $323. Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises was up $7.50
to $101.50 a share. CNET was up $26.75 a share to close at $99.75.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T climbed $7.125 to 91.375.

 &HT;    Avado downsizes plans for expansion for Don Pablo's, Canyon Cafe
eateries
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Avado Brands Inc., owner of Don Pablo's Mexican
Kitchens and Canyon Cafes, said Tuesday it is scaling back the
number of restaurants it plans to open over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company said it expects to take a $2.9
million charge for the fourth quarter. Avado said it will release
its earnings next month. Avado shares closed Tuesday at $9.56 1/4,
down 12 1/2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The Madison-based company, formerly known as Apple South, said
the modifications are the result of a review of development plans
by newly appointed management teams at Don Pablo's and Canyon Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Avado will open 175 restaurants over the next three years,
instead of the expected 200, according to spokeswoman Dianne Lively
Yost. For this year, the revised plans call for 15 new Don Pablo's,
instead of 30; and one new Canyon Cafe, instead of eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to grow just for the sake of growing,'' Yost
said. ``We want to grow smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also expects to close as many as five
underperforming restaurants in 1999. Yost declined to identify the
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Avado, once the largest franchisee of Applebee's restaurants,
underwent several management changes last year. A year earlier, it
announced it was selling off its biggest and most profitable
division, Applebee's Neighborhood Grill &AMP; Bar.
</P>
<P>
   The company planned an aggressive push with its core brands _
Don Pablo's, Canyon Cafe, Hops Restaurants Bar &AMP; Brewery and
McCormick's &AMP; Schmick's seafood dinner houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point in time there was a little pie-in-the-sky
mentality,'' said Craig T. Weichmann, an analyst with Morgan Keegan
&AMP; Co. in Memphis. ``Now, there's a more seasoned approach to
business. Basically, the message is let's get lean and mean
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Avado said the $2.9 million charge for the fourth quarter
includes expenses related primarily to the closing of the
Applebee's deals.

 &HT;    CCE sales effort makes losses worse
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises paid the price for its efforts
to boost sales, posting a larger fourth-quarter loss it attributed
primarily to increased capital spending on trucks, vending machines
and coolers.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based beverage bottler lost $34 million, or 9 cents
a diluted share, compared with a loss of $19 million, or 5 cents a
diluted share, in the previous fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $3.24 billion from $3.05 billion,
a 6.3 percent increase, primarily because of growth through
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The results matched Wall Street estimates, based on a survey by
First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were prepared for the wider fourth-quarter loss after
CCE's July announcement that it would spend $5 billion over the
next 3 1/2 years seeding its territories to increase per-capita
soft drink sales. The plan _ which involves adding equipment,
people and infrastructure _ crimped 1998 earnings and is expected
to cut into 1999 results.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, CCE reported net income of $141 million, or 35
cents per diluted share. That compares with $169 million, or 43
cents per diluted share, in the previous 12 months. Revenue rose 19
percent, to $13.41 billion from $11.28 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company is expected to earn 30 cents in all of 1999, which
would be 5 cents shy of the 1998 showing, according to the
consensus estimate of analysts reporting to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   The company and analysts, however, say CCE's long-range planning
will reap higher earnings in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable cash operating profit _ a key performance measure in
the bottling industry that's calculated based on earnings before
interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization _ rose 15 percent in
the fourth quarter and 10 percent for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   Henry A. Schimberg, president and chief executive, said the
company expects to increase cash operating profit growth to 12
percent this year, as volume and revenue are bolstered by capital
spending and infrastructure investments from previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Those investments included more than $2 billion spent in 1998 to
buy a dozen U.S. bottling operations, including seven bottlers
acquired for about $900 million in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. beverage analyst Douglas M. Lane said CCE's
fourth-quarter comparable cash operating profit and 7 percent North
American volume gains persuaded him to keep a long-term ``buy''
rating on the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evidence that the recent acceleration in capital spending
is beginning to pay off,'' he said. ``CCE takes over a territory
and invests a lot of capital in it with infrastructure, fleet and
feet on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   CCE accounts for more than 65 percent of Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
Co.'s volume in North America, and is the sole licensed bottler for
the company's products in Belgium, Great Britain, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands and most of France. Coca-Cola owns a 42 percent stake
in CCE.
</P>
<P>
   CCE's stock closed at $35.81 1/4, down 18 3/4 cents, while
shares of Coca-Cola Co. fell 68 3/4 cents to $64.12 1/2. Coca-Cola
is expected to report fourth-quarter results next week.

 &HT;    Online shopper is major topic at retail federation convention
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Baby boomers and Generation X-ers can take a breather
from the spotlight. As marketing icons go, the online shopper is
taking over as one of the most scrutinized groups in retail.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet was a constant topic of discussion at the National
Retail Federation's annual mega-convention here this week, a
meeting typically reserved for working on the brick-and-mortar side
of the business.
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers faced a tough fight against the troop of
consultants and technology experts giddy on the popularity of
online shopping during the holiday season. The debate seemed to
reach a peak Tuesday, when accounting and consulting giant Ernst &AMP;
Young released a report asserting two-thirds of retailers will sell
online this year, up from the 12 percent in 1997. The survey
represents responses from 1,360 consumers, 41 retailers and 74
manufacturers polled in September.
</P>
<P>
   Web sales currently generate about 1 percent of total retail
sales. But by fiscal 2001 online sales could represent an average
of 9 percent of a retailer's total sales, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The most optimistic estimates of potential online sales
represent just a sliver of the $2.6 trillion retail market. A more
powerful promise of the Internet's power is how shoppers use it as
a research tool, according to the Ernst &AMP; Young report. While 38
percent of households in the survey purchased something online,
more than half used the Internet to research a product they bought
later in a store or by catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really important for companies to avoid judging the
success of their online presence simply in terms of sales generated
through their Web sites,'' said Stephanie Shern, vice chairman of
Ernst &AMP; Young. The survey found fewer than half of retailers' Web
sites were profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best analogy of what's happening right now is a land grab.
It's like what happens when a retailer opens a store 40 or 50 miles
outside of a town knowing that the growth is headed that way,''
said David Bolotsky, vice president of Goldman Sachs. ''Any time
you open a store, you expect to lose money in the first year.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular goods bought online _ computer products, books,
CDs _ all have something in common, according to the report. For
one, they all require some thought on the behalf of the consumer,
as opposed to impulse buys. About 42 percent of shoppers already
know what brand or company they want to buy from before they go
online, Ernst &AMP; Young says.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 82 percent of shoppers said brand names would sway a
decision to buy online, according to the survey. This is good news
for apparel retailers, particularly department stores just
beginning their online ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand is a bridge of confidence between the customer and
the retailer in an online experience,'' said Bob Schwartz, Internet
manager for Nordstrom, known for its loyal customer base. The same
applies to the national brand of Macy's, which is doing business in
50 states through its Web site even though 29 of those states don't
have Macy's stores. ``This is a powerful channel to reach customers
outside our market, and in particular a younger customer,'' said
Kent Anderson, president of Macys.com.
</P>
<P>
   At least one retailing giant tried to temper the Internet
fervor. Home Depot Chairman Bernard Marcus, who received a lifetime
achievement award Tuesday from the federation, warned his
colleagues not to forget the simpler rules of retailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of focus on (the Internet) at this conference,
and I think we're in danger of making a tragic error,'' Marcus told
a group of retailing executives. ``Customers are turned off by
indifference, rudeness and a lack of knowledge in retail today, and
more focus needs to be spent on this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not rushing into online sales; we're going to ease into
it,'' he said. ``In our business, people like to kick the tires.''

 &HT;    At Home acquisition of Excite announced; stocks soar
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At Home Corp. has struck an agreement to buy Excite in
a $6.7 billion purchase that would combine an Internet service
provider with a company offering content on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising announcement sent the stock of Excite and other
Internet stocks soaring, outdoing the price of America Online's
recently ballyhooed purchase of Netscape while sparking
expectations of still more mergers to come.
</P>
<P>
   The huge deal underscores the high-stakes now taken for granted
in the jostling for position among companies doing business on the
Internet _ especially those hoping to capitalize on or create the
high-speed capabilities of ``broadband'' technology. Multi-billion
values are now placed on companies with modest revenues that have
yet to report a profit. Excite's stock value before Tuesday's
announcement was $3.4 billion _ inflated by traditional,
pre-Internet measures, and yet barely half of what At Home is
willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are predicting that the combined company could have
revenue of $2 billion within three year, which just under half
coming from subscriptions paid for At Home's growing service. But
the numbers so far are just a shadow of those projections.
</P>
<P>
   At Home reported a $9.7 million loss on revenues of about $14
during the third fiscal quarter of last year. Excite lost $6.8
million on $44 million in revenue during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have offices next door to each other in
Redwood City, Cal. But the price of the deal and the splash it made
seemed due to the potential power of their combination to exploit
the Internet. Despite the vast increase in its use, the Net remains
a tiny part of the nation's $6 trillion economy. But the companies
_ and investors _ are betting that the economy is truly shifting to
the Net and those in position to offer connections or content will
profit accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Together, At Home and Excite will offer both.
</P>
<P>
   For At Home, the deal offers a chance to link with millions of
computer users, the very audience likely to care about the
high-speed connections AtHome can offer.
</P>
<P>
   At Home now has only about 330,000 subscribers for its
high-speed cable service. By contrast, Excite's site now draws a
daily average of 50 million page views, according to Jefferies &AMP;
Co. analyst Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Excite has compiled a range of services that include a network
of free sites, e-mail and stock quotes _ giving users a chance to
customize the offerings. For Excite, the deal with At Home can be
route to the capital needed for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But the connections reach farther than the two companies whose
names are on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Among At Home's minority investors is Cox Communications, which
is majority-owned by Cox Enterprises, owner of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. At Home is majority-owned by
Tele-Communications Inc., which has agreed to be purchased by AT&AMP;T.
Benefits of the Excite deal therefore may flow directly to AT&AMP;T,
which has been scrambling to find a way to directly connect to
consumers, avoiding the local phone companies and the access fees
they charge.
</P>
<P>
   The pending purchase of TCI is meant to give AT&AMP;T high-speed
access to millions of homes, a plan dependent on billions of
dollars in upgrades to cable lines. Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T is making deals
with other cable companies to fill in the gaps where TCI does not
offer service. In Georgia, for example, TCI has virtually no
presence.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T sees the direct connection to the home as potentially
the most lucrative of all.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong said Tuesday that At Home can
be his conduit for providing a variety of services for data and
voice. AT&AMP;T already has agreements with Excite, Lycos and others
for marketing its phone services via the Net.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's pending purchase of Netscape, another
combination of access and content, is currently valued at more than
$6 billion. With the At Home-Excite deal came the expectation of
other big-ticket mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the agreement sent shivers of excitement through
Wall Street where interest in Internet stocks already approached a
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Excite leaped a stunning $42.50 a share to close at $110, and
many other Net-related stocks were carried along in the euphoria.
Lycos closed at $112.9375 a share, up $25.0625. Yahoo Inc. rose $6
a share to $323. Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises was up $7.50
to $101.50 a share. CNET was up $26.75 a share to close at $99.75.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T climbed $7.125 to 91.375.

 &HT;    Southern leaves dividends unaltered
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co., which has raised dividends for each of
the last six years, left dividends unchanged Tuesday as the company
reported a $52 million loss for the fourth quarter, mostly due to
writedowns from disappointing South American investments.
</P>
<P>
   A.W. Dahlberg, chairman, president and chief executive, said the
intent of a new dividend policy is to reduce the company's payout
ratio over time to retain cash for new investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing the company gives our shareholders a better total
return,'' Dahlberg said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Southern reported writedowns for investments
in Chile and Argentina, as well as a settlement over financing for
a North Georgia hydroelectric plant, forced a net loss for the
fourth quarter of 8 cents a share. The results compare with a gain
of $195 million, 28 cents a share, for the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's earnings from operations, excluding the one-time
charges, were $178 million, or 25 cents a share. That was a 19
percent drop from year-ago results of $220 million, 32 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
   The results fell short of analysts' expectations. Analysts
surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected 1998 fourth quarter
earnings of 29 cents a share, excluding the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Southern said most of the earnings drop was due to
milder-than-normal weather that resulted in a 5 percent decline in
total U.S. energy sales during the quarter ended Dec. 31. Revenue
for the fourth quarter was $2.6 billion, down from $3.2 billion for
the year-ago period. Southern attributed the decline to an
accounting change that shifts revenue from its growing wholesale
energy trading business to another accounting category.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12-month period, Southern reported net income of $977
million, $1.40 a share, compared with $972 million, or $1.42 a
share, for 1997. Revenue for 1998 was $11.4 billion, compared with
$12.6 billion for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Southern said its new dividend policy is part of a ``new growth
strategy that focuses on total shareholder return.''
</P>
<P>
   The company raised its dividend from $1.02 a share to $1.07 in
1986. Then, it held steady for five years during cost accounting
for construction of Plant Vogtle, the nuclear plant near Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, there was an increase to $1.10. Annual increases since
brought it to $1.34 last year. On Tuesday, Southern announced a
quarterly dividend of 33 1/2 cents, or $1.34 a share annually, the
same as last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg, in a telephone interview, noted Southern is ``not
reducing the dividend at all.'' But he said Southern's board
normally reviews dividends every January. ``Next year is next
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders will have to make a choice on Southern's stock as
the payout ratio is gradually reduced, Dahlberg said. Some may
decide to sell; others may decide to retain or buy the stock
``because total return should go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern has 249,000 shareholders of record, excluding shares
held by banks and brokerage houses, including 45,000 in Georgia.
Many shareholders are retirees who have come to depend on the
steady dividend income that comes from a traditionally predictable
utility stock.
</P>
<P>
   However, Steven Fleishman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Global
Securities, said the industry is changing as deregulation takes
hold across the country. ``The opportunities are greater but so are
the risks,'' he said. A utility can now ``try to be like a normal
company,'' he said, ``but face the risk of a normal company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view any of this as negative,'' Fleishman said of
Southern's dividend and earnings announcements. Southern's dividend
shift is in line with industry trends, Fleishman said. North
Carolina-based Duke Energy made a similar decision recently, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Fleishman is still forecasting 1999 earnings of $1.85 per share,
up from $1.40 for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Tirello, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown, said dividend
increases are ``not crucial'' to utilities like Southern as they
once were. ``Years ago, when they were building nuclear plants,
they needed to raise dividends to keep investors interested. But
they don't need that any more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's stock closed down Tuesday 56 1/4 cents at $28.06 1/4
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's onetime charges for the quarter included $200
million, or 29 cents a share, related to investments in utilities
in Chile and Argentina, and $21 million, or 3 cents a share,
related to a recent settlement with the Georgia Public Service
Commission of a 20-year-old dispute over financing of Georgia Power
Co.'s Rocky Mountain Pump Storage hydroelectric plant near Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg said Southern had now met a longtime goal of resolving
the Rocky Mountain issue.
</P>
<P>
   He said Southern is taking the writedown for the South American
utilities to reflect a decline in value since their original
purchase price. Southern first disclosed plans for the writedown on
Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Southern has put together a plan ``to dispose of these (South
American) investments,'' he said. ``There is no identified buyer,
but some interest has been expressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern had valued at $400 million its 82.3 percent stake in
Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande of Chile and 55 percent
ownership of Hidroelectrica Alicura of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The investments date to 1994 and were one of the company's first
overseas investments. Excluding the charges, Southern's income from
other unregulated businesses grew from $112 million in 1997 to $239
million last year.

 &HT;    Marriage of At Home, Excite brings speed to Netizens
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The turn-of the-century Internet has a brand new
buzzword: speed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, two Web portals, Excite and Snap, made deals that
commit them to a future of incredibly rapid access to the Internet.
But each chose a different path. Not even the sharpest Wall Street
analyst can tell you which one took the right road.
</P>
<P>
   As Internet users become more sophisticated and view the
Internet as a utility rather than a hobby, the need for speed
becomes more and more urgent. America Online, with 15 million
subscribers, rules the current dial-up Internet world, but as more
users come online looking for quick hits of information and
one-click online shopping, the 100-times-faster speeds of cable
modems or ADSL lines become more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Excite and Snap have bet their futures on this consumer need.
Two well-known Web players laying down their chips on speed may
force the industry to advance faster than has been predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Excite chose to side with cable modem technology and scored a
deal with the At Home network, the cable modem arm of cable giant
Tele-Communications Inc. Excite (http://www.excite.com) will become
a wholly owned division of At Home.
</P>
<P>
   Excite CEO George Bell, speaking on cable network CNBC, said the
acquisition will give Excite a leg up on the future of residential
Web service. Even though At Home has only 310,000 subscribers and
doesn't begin to match the reach of portals such as Yahoo! or AOL,
Excite believes it has seen the future and it is broadband.
</P>
<P>
   At Home Network Chief Executive Tom Jermoluk said the Excite
acquisition gives the combined company the marketing reach and
consumer name recognition necessary to make 1999 a ``big breakout
year.'' Excite gets millions of page views per day in the current
Web environment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Snap, a joint venture of NBC and CNet, the premier
computer news and information Web site, believes ADSL will prove to
be the high-speed winner in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced it was developing a new, free portal
service codenamed ``Snap Cyclone'' designed for higher-speed
Internet users, such as those on T-1 lines and ADSL subscribers.
Snap (http://www.snap.com) already has agreements with Bell
Atlantic, SBC Internet Services and others. Initial Snap Cyclone
e-commerce and shopping partners include iVillage Inc., Preview
Travel and Tower Records, which will use Snap Cyclone's media
platform to showcase and sell their goods and services with
high-quality video, audio, games and animation.
</P>
<P>
   CNet President Halsey Minor says the new service will let
consumers view video clips of travel destinations or video previews
of TV shows, all available over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting harder to find anyone in the industry not
considering getting into the broadband game. High-speed access via
either phone or cable providers is the way people will access the
Web in the future, although neither At Home nor Snap Cyclone is
available in metro Atlanta, nor are they available in much of the
country _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excite is a mass consumer brand, and it will definately be a
crucial marketing and promotional brand for broadband,'' says
Jupiter Communications analyst Patrick Keane. Previous Jupiter
studies estimated 78 percent of Web users will still be using
dial-up access providers until at least 2002, but Keane says deals
like these could speed up broadband deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Keane says other portals such as Yahoo! and Lycos
should think about forming a broadband alliance, Jeff Mallet,
president and chief operating officer of Yahoo!, arguably the Web's
most popular site, says Yahoo! will remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it seems that At Home has a high-speed version of the
AOL model,'' Mallet says. ``You have to come and look at their
content, and then they'll let you squeeze out through the Web. I
think that's a pretty antiquated idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the strategic call years ago that we shouldn't tie
ourselves up with one access point,'' Mallet says. ``Even if we are
not the primary access point, you can still find us. It's a better
strategy than finding an Internet service provider or a broadband
partner because you are solely relying on their success.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallet, who says Yahoo! had spoken with At Home about a possible
alliance but opted out, says that with so many portals popping up
on the horizon, Excite's decision to bank on broadband might be a
smart move.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are betting on the future, not on today.''
</P>
<P>
   While Snap is offering content and services to ADSL and
high-speed phone customers, At Home is a content provider as well
as an Internet service provider. That is, At Home subscribers can't
choose their ISP, something Mallet and MindSpring president and COO
Mike McQuary think should change.
</P>
<P>
   McQuary says the Excite acquisition may signal a strategy change
for At Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Home was looking for a content provider,'' McQuary says,
``and that means they may see themselves eventually becoming a
content provider, not necessarily an access provider. They just
spent a lot of money to shore up the content side of the house.
Their role could eventually shift from access provider to content
provider. It's not that exciting to get high-speed access if all
you get is faster e-mail. With high-speed access, the content has
to be even more compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring and other dial-up Internet providers argue that
broadband users should be able to choose their access provider the
same way they do now.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Home may be looking at their furture where ISP's have equal
access,'' McQuary says. ``There is a parallel to the cable TV
model, a company like MindSpring could be your ISP, but At Home
might be like HBO.''

 &HT;    AtHome foresees customized data
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AtHome and Excite think the future of the Internet
access has more to do with delivering information than with the
machines that deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome's plan to buy Excite for $6.7 billion in stock Tuesday is
an attempt to leverage its high-speed Internet capabilities with
Excite's start page on the Web, which can be customized, but is
geared toward users reaching the Internet by traditional, dial-up
telephone modem access.
</P>
<P>
   A philosophy for the soon-to-be-combined company is ``All bands,
all devices, all the time,'' said Dave Bagshaw, senior vice
president of AtHome's AtMedia. The companies plan to take their
different strengths and blend it with AT&AMP;T's, which will be a
majority shareholder in AtHome, once AT&AMP;T's acquisition of TCI is
complete. Bagshaw said the companies see a future in which Web
users will be able to get customized information no matter what
equipment they use, whether it is television, phone, hand-held
computer, PC or pager.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome's 310,000 subscribers view the Internet using a special
browser designed to make the most of what the company's high-speed
cable modem access allows, offering video, sound and full-motion
graphics. AtHome users have chat rooms. They can read news from the
Associated Press. What they can't do is personalize their home page
to choose the type of news they want, scores from the teams they
follow and the stocks they own. Excite's Internet gateway site can
do all that, but it's designed for lower-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is not just the start page for a PC user,'' said
Brett Bullington, executive vice president of Excite. ``We're also
trying to redefine the way an online connection can be used by a
consumer in their home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still at the very early stage of an emerging market,''
Bullington said. ``The Internet is just developing. If you add
mobility, voice and the ability to get your information, stocks,
sports scores, anywhere you want _ that's a dream that's beginning
to be realized. The data will be the value. This deal will make it
happen sooner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome has distribution deals with 16 cable companies in North
America whose cable lines pass 57.3 million homes. Partner
companies include TCI, Cablevision, Comcast and Cox Communications.
Cox Communications is a public company controlled by Atlanta-based
Cox Enterprises, which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 30, 10 million of those 57 million homes are passed
by the two-way cable required for high-speed cable modem Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome expects the remaining 47 million homes to have the option
in the next five years. AtHome competes with Road Runner, which is
being marketed by MediaOne and Time Warner cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood City, Calif.-based AtHome started operations in August
1995. It has taken a loss in each fiscal period since. As of Sept.
30, AtHome had an operating deficit of $361 million. In the three
months that ended Sept. 30, AtHome lost $9.7 million on revenues of
about $14 million. At Home is expected to show a profit in the
fourth quarter.

 &HT;    ACT trots out new charger at California showBy Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Advanced Charger Technologies used a high-profile
industry even this week to unveil what could be its first product
with major market potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Norcross, Ga.-based company trotted out its new battery
charger for wireless phones at David Coursey's Showcase '99, a
four-day, San Diego event that bills itself as a place to show off
``the best and trendiest in personal computing, the Internet,
communications and the digital home.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Charger Technologies was one of 75 companies picked to
preview cutting-edge products.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1996, Advanced Charger Technologies specializes in
technology for recharging batteries, aiming to improve battery
life. The company used the San Diego Showcase as an opportunity to
provide a look at its new battery charger, a device that will be on
the market by the second quarter of this year, according to company
spokeswoman Jody Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all wireless phones already come with chargers.
However, many phones are chronically under-powered because their
chargers are unable to bring batteries back to maximum power,
Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of power can cause phone problems, and better chargers can
cure them, she said. ``Our cell phone charger is the pinnacle of
our technology.''
</P>
<P>
   With about 65 million Americans using wireless phones _ each of
them needing a charger _ the market for chargers is potentially
huge. But to capture a significant share of that market means
displacing current technology by convincing phone companies or
manufacturers that the new charger is significantly better.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Charger Technologies says its new charger is superior _
and much quicker _ but the company does not yet have endorsements
from third parties.
</P>
<P>
   The company is unlikely to market the chargers directly to
consumers. Instead, the company hopes to find distributors of
phones who will license the technology under their own names, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1996, Advanced Charger Technologies now has about 50
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Among the co-sponsors of Showcase '99 were Upside magazine,
Intel, Microsoft, Novell and General Magic.

CLINTON COMBATS IMPEACHMENT WITH RESCUE PLAN FOR SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Speech scheduled at 9 p.m. EST, story will update)
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, delivering his State of the
Union address to a Republican-led Congress weighing his ouster,
proposed extending the solvency of Social Security for another
generation Tuesday by investing one-seventh of the system's
reserves in the stock market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan was the centerpiece of a lengthy address brimming
with fresh initiatives and rehashed proposals that he delivered to
the House and Senate just hours after White House counsel Charles
F.C. Ruff opened the president's three-day defense in the Senate
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff bluntly told the Senate: ``William Jefferson Clinton is not
guilty of the charges that have been preferred against him. ... He
must not be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered his address near the podium in the chamber of
the House of Representatives where Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill.,
presided over House proceedings on Dec. 19 that voted two articles
of impeachment against an elected chief executive for the first
time in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is accused of obstruction of justice and perjury in
connection with his efforts to conceal a sexual relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a glancing reference to his travails, telling
Congress and a nationally-televised audience that ``perhaps in the
daily press of events, in the clash of controversy, we do not see
our own time for what it truly is _ a new dawn for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appealed for lawmakers and the nation to ``put aside our
divisions'' and find ``a new hour of healing and hopefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential counselor Doug Sosnik said Clinton's ``very
ambitious agenda'' for the final two years of his presidency would
bolster the effort to combat Senate conviction on the impeachment
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good policy is in fact good politics,'' Sosnik said. ``The
American public understands that the president's agenda has ...
made a real difference in people's lives and we're going to
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had a hard time winning congressional approval for
his initiatives last year, laid out ambitious domestic priorities
for the coming year that touched upon Americans' top priorities of
education, Social Security, crime, health care and Medicare, as
identified in a nationwide survey released Monday by the Pew
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the president's proposals appeared designed to court
support from the political constituencies that supported him for
re-election in 1996 _ women, suburbanites, minorities, the elderly
and union members.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and baseball slugger Sammy Sosa
were invited to sit with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the
president's speech. Late in his speech, Clinton offered a personal
tribute to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Mrs. Clinton's work on preparations to mark the nation's
turn into the 21st century, the president said: ``I honor her _ for
leading our Millennium Project _ for all she has done for our
children _ and for her historic role in serving our nation and
advancing our ideals at home and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most far-reaching proposal was his plan to salvage the
Social Security system from the technical bankruptcy that begins to
loom in 2013, when receipts from payroll taxes and interest begin
to fall short of benefits' payments for an expanding elderly
population.
</P>
<P>
   By 2032, the Social Security system's income would enable the
federal government to pay only 75 cents of every promised dollar in
benefits. Clinton said his proposal would prolong solvency until
2055.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show Social Security second only to
education as Americans' top concern as the first of 76 million baby
boomers near retirement in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Some 44 million beneficiaries currently receive $393 billion in
payments each year under the program proposed by President Franklin
D. Roosevelt and adopted in 1935, during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to
address a remarkable new challenge _ the aging of America,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed earmarking 62 percent of the federal
government's projected $4.4 trillion budget surplus over the next
15 years for the Social Security trust fund, which under current
law must be invested in Treasury bills and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he abandoned his iron-clad opposition to investing
Social Security funds in the stock market _ and risked the ire of
organized labor _ to propose investing up to 15 percent of the
trust fund's $849 billion reserves in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton plan, up to 25 percent of the $2.7 trillion in
budget surplus funds diverted to Social Security would be invested
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   An independent, non-political, private-sector team of managers
under federal control would oversee the investment of Social
Security funds in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not call for the individual investment accounts with
Social Security contributions sought by some lawmakers. House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, reacted to
Clinton's proposal, saying: ``No, no, a thousand times no.''
</P>
<P>
   Having federal funds invested in the stock market would ``open
the doors to all kinds of mischief involving government dictates,
favoritism and cronyism,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did his proposal appear to respond to a call by GOP
congressional leaders for a detailed White House rescue plan for
Social Security by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, Clinton's top adviser on the economy, said no
more than 15 percent of Social Security reserves would be invested
in the market.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Social Security Administration, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Social Security funds would account
for barely 4 percent of the value of the stock market. Studies show
that Social Security trust funds invested in Treasury bonds yield
about 2.5 percent in income each year compared to a potential yield
of about 6 percent in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expanded on the proposal, suggesting that 15 percent of
the projected $4 trillion surplus _ about $650 billion over 15
years _ be devoted to rescuing Medicare, to prolong its financial
solvency from 2008 to 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also suggested using about $500 billion of the projected
surplus to create a ``universal savings account'' _ dubbed the
``USA account'' _ in which the federal government would match the
savings contributions of individual Americans on a sliding scale
depending upon income.
</P>
<P>
   The government's contribution would come from 11 percent of the
projected $4 trillion surplus set aside under Clinton's's proposal
to underwrite the government contribution, which might be
dollar-for-dollar for poorer Americans and only 50 cents for every
dollar of savings for middle-class Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said that Clinton's plan to earmark 89 percent of the
projected federal budget surplus until 2015 would, in effect,
prevent the kind of across-the-board tax cut proposed by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsible thing is for us to decide to save this money
for Social Security, Medicare, retirement savings, in a way that we
use this 15-year period of good times to do something
responsible,'' Sperling said. ``If people suggest that we should,
instead, just give this all away and not save it, then we'll have
that public debate.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also proposed:
</P>
<P>
   _ Overhauling $20 billion in annual federal assistance to public
school districts to improve performance by students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $1,000 tax credit to offset lost income for family members
providing long-term care for relatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $250-per-child tax credit for parents who stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 55-cents-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes to help
discourage smoking among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The addition of 50,000 police officers to the ranks of the
100,000 officers authorized under his program to federally
subsidize the police officers' first years of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, the White House domestic affairs adviser, said the
proposals were ``an agenda that we feel has a real chance to pass
this year, in this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called for stepped-up efforts to protect national
security, with a 70 percent, five year increase of $4.2 billion in
U.S.-subsidized efforts to buy or divert Russian nuclear weapons'
materials into civilian use and a $110 billion hike in U.S. defense
spending over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most dramatic proposal for national security was a
plan to double the amount of federal spending on defending the
nation against a chemical or biological weapons attack by rogue
nations, such as Iraq or Libya, or terrorist factions such as
Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks stockpiles of vaccines; development of a public health
surveillance system; and creation of a national preparedness office
to train police, firefighters and hospital workers in 120 cities to
deal with an attack.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said the
effort was ``really prudent and preventative'' in response to
potential threats.

A MARATHON MEDIA DAY: HISTORIC AND, ESPECIALLY, `SURREAL' 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: STATEOFUNION-RDP, STATEOFUNION-ASSESS,

 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Superlatives, sports metaphors and every imaginable synonym for
the word ``surreal'' jammed the airwaves on Tuesday as the
television networks jockeyed to do justice to a day described as a
``political doubleheader'' packed with events most historic, most
incredible and, yes, most surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Would President Clinton ``hit that home run'' in his State of
the Union speech? television hosts wanted to know. Would he ``hit
it out of the ballpark?'' The best defense is a good offense, one
veteran reporter noted thoughtfully, neatly commingling his
athletic and legal imagery.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ``the most important speech of his life,'' reporters
and commentators said. As for the day that encompassed both the
speech and the opening defense statement in Clinton's impeachment
trial, it was called incredible, remarkable, ``possibly the most
historic day in William Jefferson Clinton's presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So on a remarkably pleasant winter day in an unpleasant time,
the time drags on,'' Dan Rather, the CBS anchorman, said gravely
during the breather that fell between Charles Ruff's opening
statement and Clinton's speech. ``The end of this tortuous road is
nowhere in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another marathon media day commenced early with the usual
prognosticating, opining and jawing that have become the hallmark
of the yearlong coverage of President Clinton's troubles.
Anchormen, reporters and pundits were out in force as a dawn broke
over the Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   What would the President say? (Not much on impeachment, the
conventional wisdom went.) Would Republicans stand and applaud when
Clinton entered? (Yes. Out of respect for the office.) Would the
Senate vote eventually to call witnesses? (Inevitably, pundits
said. Or maybe not.)
</P>
<P>
   Experts abounded too _ former senators, former Whitewater
counsels, former impeachment counsels; Newsweek correspondents and
presidential historians; John Dean, drawing parallels to Watergate,
and Dick Morris, the former Clinton political adviser who lost his
job in his own sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there are some dangers of excessive expectations
going into this speech,'' said Jonathan Alter, a Newsweek columnist
and MSNBC analyst. He suggested there might be ``an
elephant-in-the-living-room problem.'' By opting not to mention
impeachment, Clinton might make that decision the story.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-hour cable news networks whiled away much of the morning
with man-on-the-street interviews in places like Toluca Lake,
Calif.; telephone calls from people like ``Wanda in Alabama,'' and
frenzied promos for upcoming ``special editions'' and ``special
reports'' accompanied by hypertension-inducing music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay with Fox News Channel for live coverage of the
president's defense,'' the Fox News Channel teased its viewers
(adding shortly afterward, ``But first, the deadly dangers of
skiing'').
</P>
<P>
   One CNN anchor invoked ``The Twilight Zone'' in an attempt to
convey the strangely bipolar quality of the day. But Jeff
Greenfield, the CNN reporter and news analyst, added, ``Except this
is the fourth weird State of the Union timing'' in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it kind of Surreal City in the nation's capital,''
Alter said. It was weird, it was strange, others said. ``This is an
incredible day in Washington, a bizarre day,'' said John
Siegenthaler, an MSNBC anchorman. ``You've heard all the adjectives
we've used.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 1 p.m., the adjectives abated. Every network
carried Ruff's opening statement live. Most interjected nothing,
though ABC offered a few fun facts about Ruff, put up like
subtitles on the screen: ``Fourth and final Watergate prosecutor.
Fifth and longest-serving White House counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, the networks filled the 15-minute recess with
instant analysis. The pundits, it seemed, were impressed. ``This
was a give-no-ground legal argument,'' said George Stephanopoulos,
the former Clinton adviser turned ABC analyst. ``They're going to
fight hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather used some of the time to ask two presidential historians
what ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' meant and got two different
answers. Bob Schieffer reported that a CBS reporter in the chamber
had observed that most of the Senators had been ``very, very
attentive,'' but ``a few did nod off.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ruff wrapped up, the post-mortems were even more positive.
Jeffrey Toobin, an ABC News legal analyst, called Ruff's opening
``an absolutely superb presentation. The prosecution has a lot to
answer to now.'' At least part of the prosecution's case, he said,
had been left ``in tatters.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the major networks had returned to their regular
programming. But the cable news networks went back to observing the
spin as the House managers emerged from the chamber made a beeline
for the awaiting microphones to counter Ruff's performance.

HIGHTOWER INSISTS NOTHING IMPROPER ABOUT NEW HMO JOB 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For 12 of his 16 years in the Texas House of
Representatives, Allen Hightower chaired the committee overseeing
the state's prison system. Now that he's retired, he's taking over
as chief of the health maintenance organization for inmates _ a
$120,000-a-year job in an agency he helped create.
</P>
<P>
   The Huntsville Democrat, who also was one of the chief
architects of legislation that merged adult parole and probation
programs and prisons into one superagency _ the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice _ insists there was nothing improper in taking the
new job with the Correctional Managed Health Care Program.
</P>
<P>
   State law does not prohibit legislators from taking state jobs
after leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower, 52, recalled Tuesday that he originally tried to
delete language in the bill that created the prisoner HMO six years
ago, but lacked the necessary votes. He later supported the bill
that created the Correctional Managed Health Care Program, after
language was changed to ease concerns that prison nurses and other
TDCJ employees had raised about the program and possible loss of
retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my wildest dreams had I thought about going to work
for the Managed Health Care until about two or three months ago,''
Hightower said.
</P>
<P>
   That was when he learned that James Riley, a fellow Rotarian
from Huntsville, was going to retire as director of the program,
which coordinates nearly $300 million in contracts with the
University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and Texas Tech
Health Sciences Center to provide medical care for the state's
149,000 felons.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, Hightower said, he had given serious
consideration to applying for the job as manager of TDCJ's land and
minerals management program _ a position that would have had him
working directly for the people he once oversaw as a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job as head of managed care for prisoners, he
technically is an employee of UTMB, Hightower said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a better deal for everyone perception-wise
that I not work directly for TDCJ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower said he had offers from the private sector _ one with
an investment firm and another with a construction group _ that
likely would have led to lobbying duties, and an inquiry from a
private prison company that he said held no interest for him.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower admits he has no medical expertise, but he said his
job does not require making medical decisions but ``coordinating''
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower's years in the Legislature came during some of the
most tumultuous for the prison system, as it struggled to meet the
mandates of U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice in the
long-running Ruiz prison reform lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Hightower will still be dealing with Justice,
who Thursday is scheduled to begin hearing testimony over whether
TDCJ has failed to provide constitutional levels of health care to
its prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many towns where average citizens get less care than
inmates do,'' said Hightower, who said he doubts he will be called
on to testify at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows he will be back before the Legislature this session
to testify about prisoner health care and cost-cutting efforts of
the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the Legislature is going to enjoy grilling me,'' he
said.

`X-FILES' TO GET CLOSER TO TRUTH DURING SWEEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ ``The X-Files'' will finally resolve its
pesky ``mythology'' mystery next month and then gear up for a
seventh and final season in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   In the typically ambiguous words of the show's creator and
executive producer, Chris Carter, ``Every answer has its own set of
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the Fox network issued a release a few days ago claiming
that the show's ``deepest secrets'' would be solved in a February
two-parter, well, some of that grand declaration could be
attributed to sweeps-month fever.
</P>
<P>
   But the February 7 and 14 episodes, called ``Two Fathers'' and
``One Son,'' will at least provide some long-concealed
``mythology'' answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mythology'' refers to ``X-Files'' episodes dealing with the
underlying conspiracy facing FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)
and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Namely, a government coverup of
an alien presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to understand this conspiracy after the end of
the two-parter,'' Carter said in an interview. ``But that doesn't
necessarily mean everything's wrapped up and finished. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the move to get to the ultimate answer, if you
will, about what happened to Mulder's sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Abducted by aliens, you know. Something about bees. And there's
Cigarette Smoking Man, who is quite insidious between puffs on the
poisonous weed. What's Mulder's old girlfriend, Agent Fowley,
hiding from him? What is Cassandra Spender all about?
</P>
<P>
   And why can't Carter ever put the wraps on this thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be a lot of answers,'' he said. ``A lot is
going to be explained. You'll actually understand a lot about how
Mulder didn't necessarily choose the X-files. They were kind of
chosen for him. You will learn, historically, how the X-files came
about and what Mulder's father's part was in them ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that the Cigarette Smoking Man is all but
stripped of mystery, to an extent, and I think that's going to be
interesting, for him to be so exposed in the series.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fox's jointly owned FX cable channel will pitch in, beginning
Jan. 25, by running 24 previous ``mythology'' episodes on
weeknights.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the tangiest mysteries concern the future of ``The
X-Files.'' Carter said that his stars were ``very anxious to start
doing something besides playing Mulder and Scully,'' and that next
season probably would be the last.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Carter hopes to convert his hit TV series into
periodic feature films. The first, released last year, failed to
crack the $100 million domestic box-office mark. But Carter said it
grossed $85 million in the United States and nearly $200 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a successful movie,'' he said. ``It means that we'll do
another movie. That movie will answer the question if there will be
a third movie.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Fox television network won't part with ``The X-Files''
happily, and Carter is hedging his bets. There is still a chance of
an eighth season in 2000-01, he said, and he wouldn't even rule out
the possibility of a protracted ``X-Files'' television franchise
without Duchovny and Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't not consider it,'' Carter said, ``but because I
don't have to consider it right now, I don't. Is that evasive
enough?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Replaying the themes of unity, optimism and
social responsibility that fueled his landslide re-election victory
two months ago, George W. Bush was inaugurated as governor of the
nation's second-largest state on Tuesday in a sun-warmed ceremony
on the south promenade of Texas' red granite Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 21st century will be one of great opportunity,'' he told
the crowd. ``Our economy will be strong, so long as we pursue free
markets, free trade, low taxes and limited government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's position as the presumptive front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination in 2000 _ a race he has not yet
entered _ was never mentioned during the daylong ceremonies. But
there were moments _ when he spoke of how the lessons learned in
Texas might apply to the entire country _ in which he seemed to be
reaching for this larger audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans can show America how to unite around issues that are
larger than race or party,'' Bush said in his brief address.
</P>
<P>
   The day began foggy and chill, and the dew still coated the
Capitol's south lawn as the noon ceremony approached and the
expectant crowd pushed against the white picket barricade around
the base of the inaugural stage. As the Texas A&AMP;M band struck up
``The Star Spangled Banner'' and four F-16s roared overhead, the
wind from the south lost its chill and a bright sun began to push
through the fracturing clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the platform beneath a canopy of raised swords, Bush
was joined by his wife, Laura, their twin daughters, Barbara and
Jenna, and most of the rest of his family, including his parents,
the former president and first lady, and all of his four siblings
save for Jeb, the new governor of Florida, who was represented by
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   A private morning church service began the day's ceremonies.
After the inaugural, a barbecue on the Capitol grounds perfumed the
air with the mesquite smoke of 850 briskets and 5,000 pounds of
sausage, turkey and ham. Midafternoon brought the traditional
parade up Congress Avenue, and four inaugural balls ushered in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The governor had said that his inaugural speech would be short
on legislative specifics and dwell, instead, on his vision for the
state. The spine of his message was that the economy was doing very
well, and was likely to continue to do so, but that this was not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic our children's lives will continue to improve
in material terms,'' he said. ``The risk is that their moral and
spiritual lives will not improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush urged families, communities and religious leaders to draw
``a clear line between right and wrong,'' and said it was the
responsibility of political leaders, public schools and public
institutions to support this effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government can't solve all our problems,'' he said. ``Economic
growth can't solve all our problems. In fact, we're now putting too
much hope in economics, just as we once put too much hope in
government.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult day for Democrats in Austin. For the first
time since the Civil War, the party did not have a single statewide
official to celebrate. Bush's coattails led to a Republican sweep
of the state offices in November.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Inaugurated as lieutenant governor on Tuesday was Rick Perry, a
social conservative and former agriculture commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the impeachment proceedings in Washington nor the
impending State of the Union speech by President Clinton were
referred to during the inaugural ceremony, but there were plenty of
references to the overriding importance of character and moral
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy democracy depends upon the character of its
citizens,'' Bush declared.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to the lieutenant governor to underline the message.
``George W. Bush is a man of character,'' Perry said. ``The type of
person we can point out to our children and say, we want you to
grow up to be like him.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor outlined three challenges that face Texas and said
each offered lessons for the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, Texas must assure equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas must be an open society,'' Bush said. ``We must not
become two societies, one that believes in the American dream and
one without such hope.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled a visit last year with a group of ``young tough
criminals,'' one of whom asked him whether he saw any hope for
them. ``His question reveals something crucial to the future of
Texas, as well as this country,'' Bush said. The answer, he said,
is to ``rally the armies of compassion that are in every community
of this great state.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the governor said, Texas must ``become an educated
society'' that is ``literate in the language of the 21st century''
and ready to compete. This means not only ending social promotions
and making sure all students learn to read, he said, but educating
public school students in ``the values of a civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bush said, Texas must embrace its ethnic and racial
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be proud of our various heritages,'' he said. ``We
should celebrate them in festivals, we should enjoy their
traditions in our homes, we should share them with friends. This
genuine appreciation of heritage stands in stark contrast to those
who would divide people into groups for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the governor said, he is optimistic about the new
century. He recalled a favorite quotation by an El Paso writer who
described himself as living on ``the sunrise side'' of the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we head into a new century, Texas lives on the sunrise side
of the mountain,'' Bush said. ``And I see a very good day coming.''

 &HT;    Fox, Owens on Hawks' search list
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the start of NBA training camps pushed back to at
least Thursday because of delays in signing the new labor deal, the
Hawks' agonizing search for a starting small forward apparently is
centered on two hotly pursued veterans, Rick Fox and Billy Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who played last season for the Los Angeles Lakers under
their $1 million salary cap exception, is waiting on two levels.
First, his agent, Mark Portnoy, says Fox hopes to hear from two
teams that have room under their salary cap to sign him but have
not indicated that a small forward is a priority. If neither pans
out, Fox will choose from among the Lakers, New York Knicks and
Hawks, Portnoy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the three has its strong points,'' the agent noted.
``With the Lakers, Rick knows the team, likes the city and has
finished one year of the three he needs to qualify for a Larry Bird
exception contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks are saying now that they have (Latrell) Sprewell
and Rick should go with them, because they have a chance to win a
championship. Another advantage in New York is that Rick is dating
Vanessa Williams and she lives nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Hawks, he knows he will be the starter on a team that
has a chance to win a title, and he knows that Atlanta's a very
good situation.''
</P>
<P>
   All three teams can offer Fox the new ``middle-class exception''
salary of $1.75 million, which can be extended two more years at $2
million and $2.25 million. Fox declined to play for the Hawks last
season for the $1 million exception and turned down a multiyear
offer from Cleveland to go with the Lakers, thinking that they had
a chance to play for a championship. They were swept by Utah,
however, in the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, 29, averaged 12 points, 4.4 rebounds and 3.4 assists for
the Lakers after playing six years with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, also 29, averaged 10.5 points for Sacramento, his third
team in seven years, while earning $4.225 million. He might be more
interested in signing with Seattle, but the Sonics have backed up
starter Detlef Schrempf with two other veterans _ Dale Ellis, who
has agreed to a new free agent contract, and Don MacLean, acquired
in an agreed-upon deal with New Jersey this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks general manager Pete Babcock has refused to comment on
specific outside free agents, although he has not denied his
interest in Fox and Owens.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks also have considered free agents Dennis Scott, Chris
Morris and Cedric Ceballos but have not sought any of them yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee Bucks have inquired into the physical condition of
Hawks free agent forward Christian Laettner, who tore an Achilles'
tendon in September. The Bucks could not fit Laettner under their
cap, but the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported they are looking
to move a combination of centers Andrew Lang and Earvin Johnson and
power forward Armon Gilliam. The Hawks might be able to accommodate
two of them.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, Babcock had his first face-to-face
negotiation with agent Bill Strickland, who represents free-agent
power forward Alan Henderson. The club is not believed to be in
competition with another team to bring back Henderson.

 &HT;    Falcons finding new friends
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons are experiencing the negative side to
earning a berth in the Super Bowl, as players and coaches find out
they have a lot more friends than they thought. All of them want
tickets to Super Bowl XXXIII in Miami's Pro Player Stadium, where
the Falcons (16-2) will play Denver (16-2) on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Each participating player can purchase 13 ``cheap'' tickets, at
a price of $325 each, or $4,225 total. For most players, however,
that's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   And getting hotel space is even more difficult. Each player can
reserve one room in the Hotel Sofitel ($238 per night, with a
four-night minimum) and one in the Doubletree ($155) near the
team's hotel, the Airport Hilton and Towers.
</P>
<P>
   For wide receiver Tony Martin and safety Devin Bush, who grew up
in the Miami area, lodging is not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of them, Super Bowl ticket logistics can be a horror
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been bombarded with phone calls from people wanting
tickets,'' defensive back Ronnie Bradford said. ``I heard from a
coach I played for on a seventh-grade all star team (in Denver),
Frank something. Probably right up until the whistle is blown, I'll
keep getting innundated with calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves, who has been to eight previous Super Bowls as
a player, assistant coach and head coach, knew this was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start addressing some things that most of our
guys have no clue about,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' eight-day stay in Miami, which begins Sunday, also
will be difficult on the team's support staff.
</P>
<P>
   Directory of information systems Randy Kopp left Tuesday night
to begin setting up computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a regular road trip, when equipment manager Brian Boigner
needs to worry about bringing only uniforms and standard equipment,
Boigner and his staff will have to pack all the extra practice
gear.
</P>
<P>
   And his staff will have to do laundry. In Suwanee, it translates
to seven loads of practice garb nightly in a giant machine, and
another five loads for the ``500 or 600 towels players use every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, everthing is packed into 16 huge trunks. It will take
22 trunks or so to go the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to come up with a makeshift equipment room,''
Boigner said, ``and we're going to have to share it with the
University of Miami athletic department,'' where the Falcons will
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Video director Tom Atcheson usually takes two cameras on the
road, but he will take three to Miami for practice purposes. His
staff also will take three video players, two projectors and
editing equipment that normally wouldn't make a road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll set up a monitor in Dan's suite, and in 10 rooms and a
big meeting room (in the team hotel),'' he said. ``All the teams
not in the (conference) championship games have to send one video
unit each, so a lot of equipment already will be there. If it
wasn't for that, it would be a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Ron Medlin and his staff will set up shop at the
University of Miami and in the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will split sites, and 90 percent of what we do will be at
the hotel,'' he said. ``We'll have to take all the necessary taping
supplies for a week, all the bandages, treatment supplies. The MASH
(unit) is going on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength and conditioning staff led by Al Miller and Tim
Jorgensen won't have it as tough. They'll use Miami facilities,
which are superior to those in Suwanee in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   They will, however, pack personal hand gear and gadgets, and a
slew of protein and amino acid supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, meanwhile, said that family, his agent and his
financial adviser come first.
</P>

   ``There may be a few leftovers . . . for close friends who've
stuck with me,'' he said. ``I've made some good friends in my two
years in Atlanta, but I just don't think I can accommodate
everybody.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CAN A DEAL FOR SPREWELL BEAR FRUIT?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The young player was a member of a team in the West
and, angry at his manager, the player attacked him. The 28-year-old
player slugged the 48-year-old manager, causing a triple fracture
to the manager's right cheekbone as well as back injuries related
to the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The player was traded just before the season began to a team in
New York where he signed a contract for more money than he was
making before. There was resistance and abhorrence by fans,
particularly, that such an apparently disreputable character could
join their team. The player had been hit with a felony battery
charge that carried a 15-year maximum sentence, but pleaded no
contest to a simple battery count and was given a suspended
sentence. A civil suit by the manager, Frank Lucchesi of Texas, was
settled out of court for a reported $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The player was Lenny Randle, and when he took over third base
for the Mets in 1977, he was greeted with boos at Shea Stadium. But
things soon quieted down. He played a solid third base and batted
.304 that first season and never got into an ounce of trouble in
the two seasons he was a Met. Randle's outgoing nature and generous
smile and the fact that he initially produced on the field made
people feel that a second chance had indeed been earned, and that
Randle appreciated and valued the opportunity to try again.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years later, a situation with echoes of the Lenny
Randle story has surfaced in New York. The Knicks have agreed to a
deal to obtain Latrell Sprewell in a trade with Golden State.
Sprewell has made himself notorious, the Strangler Lewis of the
NBA, after having clashed with and choked his coach with the
Warriors, P.J. Carlesimo. Sprewell has been suspended from the NBA
since that incident, in December 1997, and is now eligible to
return to action.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the Knicks do this?'' more than one fan asked. ``What
kind of an example is this to kids _ that you can choke your coach
and then sign for $8.3 million a year?''
</P>
<P>
   Because professional sports is a business, because if you pay
your debt to whomever you owe it to, you are entitled in most cases
to try again as long as you don't repeat your mistakes. As for the
children, it is a hard lesson in the way of the world _ but
remember, a man's reputation has been besmirched by his own doing,
as well as his having lost some $10 million in salary because of
the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the Knicks can do this, just as the Mets did it
nearly a quarter of a century earlier.
</P>
<P>
   They believe Sprewell can help them win.
</P>
<P>
   A difference between Sprewell and Randle is that Randle appeared
genuinely contrite _ the incident was an aberration in his career,
to be sure _ while Sprewell has exhibited suspect behavior and
attitude. He fought with teammates, last July he received a
three-month sentence of home detention after pleading no contest to
a reckless driving charge, had his $30 million suit against the NBA
and the Warriors for lost wages and damages caused by the
suspension thrown out of court, sued his agent for failing to
negotiate a salary protection clause in his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player,'' recalled Ed Kranepool, who was a Mets teammate
of Randle, ``we didn't judge Lenny on what he did, but on what he
could do for us. And he was under the microscope when he came here,
his every action. And he never took a false step. He was great to
have around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Knicks fans will be suspect in the beginning about
Sprewell, but if he plays hard and performs, they'll forgive.
They're hungry for a championship, especially now that Patrick
Ewing is in the twilight of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   For most players, the scrutiny that Sprewell will be under here
would be incentive enough to cause no trouble. But some of
Sprewell's activities since his assault _ a spate of lawsuits, for
example _ may give pause. Not in dispute, however, are his
considerable basketball skills, even after a long layoff.
</P>
<P>
   For basketball fans and fellow citizens generally, it's only
proper that Sprewell _ who has endured his prescribed punishment _
be given a chance to demonstrate that he can again be a
contributing member of society, which includes the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   If not, then there is always the alternative: the highway.
</P>
<P>
   After Lenny Randle, who nobly rebuilt his reputation, batted
only .233 in his second season here, the Mets did what might be
expected from a magnanimous sports entity. They released him.

 &HT;    Bush says `government can't solve all our problems.'
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In an inaugural speech delivered at one Capitol
and heard at many, Gov. George W. Bush on Tuesday cautioned a
national audience not to count on government or a strong economy to
provide the answers for a new century.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush said in a speech measured against the high bar of
a potential presidential campaign, future success should be based
on ``the values that make prosperity worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Government can't solve all our problems. Economic growth can't
solve all our problems,'' Bush said. ``In fact, we're now putting
too much hope in economics, just as we once put too much hope in
government. Reducing problems to economics is simply materialism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of a society should be measured in the values its
people share,'' said Bush, who will offer legislative specifics in
a state of the state speech scheduled for next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling a page from the ``compassionate conservatism'' message
that anchors his political philosophy (a phrase that probable GOP
presidential contender Lamar Alexander blasts as ``weasel words''),
Bush said people can help people more than government can help
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must rally the armies of compassion that are in every
community of this great state,'' he said. ``We must encourage them
to love, to nurture, to mentor, to help and thus to offer hope to
those who have none.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because here is the danger to Texas: If the dream is not
available to all, it diminishes the dreams of the entire society.
As we do to the least of us, we do to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of thousands on the Capitol's south side included
reporters from major media outlets in Washington, New York, Boston,
Los Angeles, London and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think it's inappropriate to make moral judgments
anymore. Not me,'' said Bush, drawing applause.
</P>
<P>
   And in case the out-of-towners on hand missed the point, new Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry, who took the oath shortly before Bush did,
hammered it home with clarity unmistakable against the backdrop of
the political soap opera being played out in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush is a man of character,'' said Perry, who would
become governor if Bush becomes president. ``The type of person we
can point out to our children and say, 'I want you to grow up to be
like him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The line drew enthusiastic applause, as did Perry's kind words
for Bob Bullock, the Democrat he replaced. Bullock, as close to a
legend as a living person can be, did not seek re-election last
year after four decades in state government.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless Bob Bullock,'' Perry said in a twist on Bullock's
familiar ``God bless Texas'' line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas will miss Bob Bullock,'' Bush said in a tribute to the
last Democrat in statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's last half-day in office included a final turn at
gaveling the Senate into session and a front-row seat on the stage
at the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of now, he's not Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock, he's
Private Citizen Bullock,'' said former aide and longtime friend
Tony Proffitt. ``I think he's enjoying that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new lieutenant governor drew on some old words for his
inaugural speech. Perry, former state agriculture commissioner,
recalled the 1899 words of Gov. C.A. Culberson who wrapped up his
term by saying the state was ``in the highest degree
satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say the same thing today,'' said Perry. ``Texas
approaches the next century on firm footing, in part, because of
we've been blessed with three great leaders (Bush, Bullock and
House Speaker Pete Laney) and a host of outstanding
citizen-legislators.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was in better position to enjoy Tuesday's
festivities than he was four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' Bush said as he and wife Laura headed into
First United Methodist Church for a pre-inaugural prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to pay attention to it this time around,'' he said,
recalling that he was too caught up in the emotion of the day to
fully savor it in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the 23-minute speech marked the highlight on a sunny
winter day when he is riding as high as any politician in America.
He won an unprecedented second consecutive four-year term on the
strength of a landslide that led a GOP sweep that left Republicans
holding every statewide elected office.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, polls show him as the frontrunner for the GOP
presidential nomination in 2000 and a favorite to win the White
House if he wants it. On Tuesday, he said he is still undecided on
the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of his Tuesday speech, Bush thanked the people who
are playing the most crucial role in his decision. He thanked wife
Laura for her ``steadfast and patient love,'' and twin daughters
Jenna and Barbara for ``their love and their sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thanked his parents, ex-President George Bush and
Barbara, who were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the governor offered a philosophy somewhat at
odds with that offered by former President Ronald Reagan, who, with
the elder Bush as his running mate, championed trickle-down
economics.
</P>
<P>
   True change comes from the other way, said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Societies are renewed from the bottom up, not the top down,''
he said, drawing applause.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the nation can learn a lot from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans can show America how to unite around issues that are
larger than race or party,'' he said. ``Texas has always been a
diverse state, but we have never fractured thanks to our commonly
held values.''
</P>
<P>
   And offering a message not always served up by Republicans, Bush
said, ``Our diversity gives Texas new life, new energy, new blood.
And we should not fear it but welcome it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those values must be perpetuated in Texas classrooms, Bush
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children must also be educated in the values of our civil
society,'' he said. ``We must teach them that there are right
choices in life and wrong choices in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who ran strong among the state's Hispanic voters, also
pitched a heavy measure of diversity. The state's varying ethnic
traditions should be celebrated and perpetuated, but, he said,
against a backdrop of the things that bring people together.
``There's a trend in this country to put people into boxes. Texans
don't believe in ethnic and racial boxes,'' he said. ``As we head
into the 21st century, we should have one big box: American.''
</P>
<P>
   One national reporter immediately chimed in with this reaction:
``There it is. The big-box president.''
</P>
<P>
   As he offered up a speech devoid of specific remarks about the
presidency, a wired America was buzzing about his possible
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am anxiously awaiting the launch of this (Bush for
president) committee and would like to ask members of this list if
they have any contacts with the Bush people,'' a Washington
graduate student said in a plea posted on an e-mail network
dedicated to Bush's potential candidacy. ``I'm a very talented and
hard worker who has dreamed of working for the Governor in 2000. If
anyone can pass along some info or advice, please e-mail me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's day started with a prayer service at a Capitol area
church with a political past. First United Methodist Church was the
scene of ex-Gov. John Connally's funeral, an event that had
Richards and former President Richard Nixon sitting next to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, at the prayer service on her inauguration day, Richards
used the time at the church to pray for Operation Desert Storm
personnel who began bombing runs that day under orders from
then-President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a peculiar completion of the cycle, the former president, who
ordered sanctions still imposed on Iraq, on Tuesday was driven past
protesters carrying a large banner that said ``Sanctions killed 15
million Iraqis. Isn't that enough?''
</P>
<P>
   Another banner near the church, this one aimed at the governor,
said ``We oppose capital punishment.'' The governor does not.

 &HT;    Union merger in the works
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The International Union of Electronic Workers,
one of the nation's largest labor unions, is considering a merger
with the United Mine Workers of America, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for each union confirmed Tuesday that merger talks are
underway. The combined union would have about 190,000 members
nationwide - 130,000 IUE members and 60,000 UMWA members. Both
unions have headquarters in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   A merger also would significantly change the labor base in
Dayton, where the IUE represents 13,500 members at five area auto
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in heavy merger talks and I hope it happens because
both unions would be much stronger,'' said Mike Bindas, president
of the IUE's District 7. ``A merger would give the IUE a presence
in states we don't have members, and it would give the mine workers
an automotive base.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gibson, spokesman for the UMWA, also confirmed the two
unions are discussing a merger. But he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a meeting next week for our executive board and we
can't comment further until then,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Fire, president of the International IUE, was unavailable for
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bindas said the IUE first approached the UMWA about a merger in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Like most major U.S. labor unions, the IUE has seen its overall
membership decline dramatically since the 1970s. Labor experts say
an IUE merger with the UMWA or another independent union would not
only bolster its membership, but increase its organizing power and
provide more financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way the IUE can truly protect its independence is by
buddying up with another independent union, so a merger like that
would make a lot of sense,'' said Sean McAlinden, a labor expert
from the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need to grow for unions is no different than companies. If
Daimler-Chrysler can do it, why not the IUE and the Mine Workers.
It's all part of the industry consolidation trend,'' McAlinden
said.
</P>
<P>
   If an agreement is reached, the unions would start with an
affiliation before entering a full merger, Bindas said.
</P>
<P>
   Bindas also confirmed that the IUE has discussed a potential
merger with the United Auto Workers and the United Steel Workers of
America. But a deal with those unions is not likely at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the UAW and USWA because they are very strong
unions. But we want to certainly try and protect our identity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Any merger involving the IUE would also impact General Motors
Corp. _ Dayton's largest private employer. The IUE represents about
11,000 of GM's 20,000 Dayton area workers at three plants in
Moraine and a plant in Kettering. The IUE also represents 2,000
hourly workers at a Dayton Chrysler Corp. plant. That compares with
the UAW, which represents about 3,400 workers at two Dayton plants.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Chrysler have both credited the IUE for their ``vision''
at the bargaining table. Unlike the UAW, the IUE has accepted
multi-tiered wage agreements in its plants as a way to protect
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   All of the IUE-represented plants in the Dayton area operate
under tiered wage deals that pay new workers as low as $7 an hour,
while veteran workers earn about $20 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It's unknown how a merger would affect those contracts and the
IUE's long-term relationship with the automakers.
</P>
<P>
   McAlinden believes the UAW would welcome the IUE as part of a
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IUE has not been real popular in Detroit with other unions
because of the recent agreements in some parts plants,'' McAlinden
said. ``But a merger with the IUE would give the UAW the ability to
control future contracts in plants they don't have right now.''

 &HT;    Barr, Hyde, other GOP members to skip addressBy Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last year, Rep. Bob Barr folded his arms in front
of him and refused to applaud when President Clinton entered the
Senate chamber to deliver his state of the the union address.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Georgia Republican went even further and joined
a handful of Republicans who skipped the speech altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is inappropriate and awkward for the President to
make this speech directly to those sitting in judgment on him, and
those presenting the case against him in the Senate,'' said Barr,
one of the prosecutors who is arguing the House's case for
impeachment before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barr said he'd watch the address from his office in the
Longworth Office Building, sipping a can of Coca-Cola, munching a
few peanuts and thinking about what the president has to say.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans also felt that the president should have
postponed the address or submitted it in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is demonstrating his lack of respect for the
Congress,'' Reps. John Shadegg (R-Ariz.) and Bob Schaffer,
(R-Colo.) wrote in a letter to their Republican brethren on
Tuesday, explaining why they would not be present. ``We will not
play a role in facilitating his disrespect.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), the chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, also missed the event, but for a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, Sam Stratman, said Hyde usually stays away
because he's not comfortable in large crowds.
</P>
<P>
   He quoted Hyde as saying he would ``leap to my feet in applause
in the comfort of my living room.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) tried to keep the no-shows
to a minimum, telling the Republican caucus that Congress has a
duty to listen to the president, despite the ``discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles (R-Okla.) said the Republican
attendance among senators would be what it has been in the past,
but he said it would most likely be a ``reluctant attendance.''

DEFENSE TEAM SAYS CLINTON DID NOT COMMIT PURJURY OR OBSTRUCT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dismissing the allegations against President
Clinton as ``errant nonsense,'' White House lawyers promised
Tuesday to prove ``beyond any doubt'' that Clinton should remain in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that
have been brought against him,'' White House counsel Charles Ruff
said in opening the president's defense at the Senate impeachment
trial. ``He didn't commit perjury. He didn't obstruct justice. He
must not be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff accused Clinton's critics of resorting to misstatements and
faulty logic in constructing a case ``out of ceiling wax and string
and spiders' webs.'' He also argued that the allegations against
Clinton do not warrant his removal even if they are true.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to defend William Clinton, the man. He, like
all of us, will find his judges elsewhere. We are here to defend
William Clinton, the president of the United States, for whom you
are the only judges,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must find not merely that removal is an acceptable option,
that we will be OK the day after you vote. You must find that it's
the only solution, that our democracy should not be made to sustain
two more years of this president's service.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff opened the case for Clinton just hours before the president
delivered his annual State of the Union address to an audience that
will include the senators who will determine his fate. The
president's lawyers alluded to the speech in arguing that Clinton's
personal flaws do not make him incapable of serving as the nation's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the American people hear the president talk to Congress
tonight, they will know the answer to the question `Neighbor, how
stands the Union?' It stands strong, vibrant, free,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in both parties praised Ruff's performance, but he did
not appear to change any minds. Republicans offered qualified
praise. Democrats were lavish in their reactions. Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, said Ruff ``blew a hole as big a barn door'' in the
prosecution case.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 13 House prosecutors assembled in the Capitol to
rebut Ruff's arguments. ``I think he's done a good job of making
the best of what is an inherently weak case,'' said Rep. Charles
Canady, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, speaking from a wheelchair that he has used since
contracting a paralyzing illness in Africa in the 1960s, attacked
the prosecution case on all fronts. He disputed the specific
allegations. He said the impeachment articles should be thrown out
on technical legal grounds. He resorted to soaring rhetoric in
discussing the constitutional standards for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   He said prosecutors repeatedly put the most sinister
interpretation possible on Clinton's efforts to hide his illicit
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In countering the central perjury charge, Ruff asserted that
Clinton was ``open, candid \Rand\S truthful'' when he was
questioned about the affair last year before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any assessment of that testimony must begin with one immutable
fact: He admitted that he had, in his words, `inappropriate
intimate contact' with Monica Lewinsky,'' Ruff said. ``No one who
was present for that testimony, has read the transcript, or watched
the videotape could come away believing anything other than that
the president and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in sexual conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   He also defended the president's assertion to the grand jury
that he told the truth in an earlier sworn statement in Paula
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit. In the sworn statement, Clinton
said that he did not have sex with Lewinsky under a definition that
included contact with certain parts of her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, to conclude that the president lied to the grand jury
about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, you must determine _
forgive me _ that he touched certain parts of her body, but for
proof you have only her oath against his oath,'' Ruff said, adding
that such a case would never go to trial in a criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ruff acknowledged that Clinton's deposition in the
Jones case was ``certainly not pretty,'' he noted that the House
rejected an impeachment article based on the Jones case. Some
lawmakers expressed concern about impeaching a president for
testimony in a civil lawsuit that was settled out of court after a
judge ruled against Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said House prosecutors tried to get around the House action
by incorporating the Jones deposition in the impeachment article
dealing with Clinton's grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have, in essence, treated these articles as empty vessels
to be filled with some witches' brew of charges considered, charges
considered and abandoned, and charges never considered at all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also ridiculed the allegation that Clinton tampered with
potential grand jury witnesses when he lied to White House aides
about the affair. In lying to aides, Clinton essentially repeated
the denial that he made to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply absurd I suggest to you, to believe that he was
somehow attempting corruptly to influence his senior staff when he
told them virtually the same thing at the same time,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   On another prosecution point, Ruff challenged assertions that
Clinton never told Lewinsky to lie because she knew that the
president expected her to deny their relationship under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very idea that the president of the United States should
face removal from office not because he told Monica Lewinsky to lie
or anything of the sort, but because he was silent and Ms.
Lewinsky, quote, `knew what that meant,' unquote, is, I suggest,
more than troubling,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyer closed with an emotional answer to Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the lead House prosecutor, who cited the
sacrifices of the soldiers on D-Day in calling for Clinton's
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was on Omaha Beach 55 years ago. He didn't fight,
and no one fought, for one side of this case or the other. He
fought, as all those did, for our country and our Constitution,''
Ruff said. ``And as long as each of us _ a manager, the president's
counsel, a senator _ does his or her constitutional duty, those who
fought for their country will be proud.''

`DRY CLEANING': THROUGH GOOD AND BAD, THE FRENCH LOVE MIOU-MIOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 24)  
 (fb) 
By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Miou-Miou has appeared in good films and bad, hits and
flops, yet for 25 years France's affection for her has not wavered.
True, being loved has been no guarantee of good screen roles or
healthy box-office returns. Yet, for an entire generation of French
moviegoers, she remains reassuringly familiar. Her very stage name,
Miou-Miou, given to her by a lover when she was barely 18, makes
her sound like the gamine next door.
</P>
<P>
   In person, it is easy to see why she is popular. Petite and
spirited, sporting a punkish haircut, a Che Guevara black beret and
tiny sunglasses that make her look far younger than her 48 years,
Miou-Miou is not one for putting on the airs and graces of a film
star. For a start, she speaks her mind. And she can be believed
when she says she likes her latest movie, Anne Fontaine's
``Nettoyage a Sec,'' or ``Dry Cleaning,'' because she is no less
willing to identify those of her films that she dislikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long time since I played such a strong part,'' she said
of ``Dry Cleaning,'' which was well received in France 15 months
ago and which opens on Feb. 5 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, a sort of sexual film noir, takes its name from the
business run by Jean-Marie Kunstler (Charles Berling) and his wife,
Nicole (Miou-Miou), in the industrial town of Belfort in eastern
France. A hard-working couple, they enjoy their jobs _ Nicole works
the counter, Jean-Marie does the pressing _ and seem resigned to
the routine of their lives. Occasionally they meet friends in a
corner bar. One night the group moves on to a nightclub to watch a
drag show in which Loic (Stanislas Merhar) and his sister, Marylin
(Mathilde Seigner) _ dressed in look-alike sparkly dresses _ do a
risque dance routine that comes close to simulated sex. Jean-Marie
and Nicole watch with a mixture of disbelief and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, when Loic brings his dress to the store to be
dry-cleaned, Nicole is disturbed to find him attractive. She and
her husband return to the nightclub, where Loic now impersonates
the pop singer Sylvie Vartan, while Marylin is dressed to look like
Johnny Hallyday. But this time the night ends in a motel, with
Nicole in Loic's arms and Jean-Marie exploring Marylin. The
Kunstlers are novices at this game _ they are surprised when Loic
asks for money _ but it is also a game that soon turns nasty. When
Marylin goes off with a boyfriend, Loic is given a job at the
dry-cleaning store and moves in with the couple. Nicole's passion
for Loic spills over, but, more darkly, Loic is convinced that
Jean-Marie also desires him. And he sets out to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Fontaine, 38, said her fascination with conventional people
whose lives unexpectedly go off the rails was awakened by, in her
words, ``a very strange couple,'' whom she met while working as a
model in a Paris fashion house some years ago. Their lives provided
the seeds for ``Dry Cleaning,'' her third feature film, which she
co-wrote with Gilles Taurand. She then placed the story in the
middle-class setting of Belfort, where, she said, ``sexual
transgressions'' would cause more disarray than in Paris, where
``nothing seems taboo these days.''
</P>
<P>
   It took time for Fontaine to find her two male leads. Several
actors were put off by the homosexual undertones of Jean-Marie's
role, while endless auditions failed to identify a Loic with the
right combination of beauty and opacity. In the end, Berling, an
established stage and screen actor, happily accepted the part of
Jean-Marie, while Merhar, a wood craftsman who was spotted by a
casting scout, was persuaded to try his hand at acting. Miou-Miou,
in contrast, was Fontaine's choice from the first moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the best popular actress of her generation,'' the
director said. ``She is very loved by the public. I also liked her
as a person, which I find important, so I didn't hesitate. She is
an exceptional actress. She likes to plunge herself in her role
before filming begins, then she adds the freshness of her nature.
When we began shooting, I had nothing to add.''
</P>
<P>
   What Miou-Miou most liked about the role was not Nicole's
obsession with a younger man _ she said she had had young lovers,
so this was no novelty _ but rather the complicitous relationship
between Nicole and her husband, who were spouses but also lovers
and best friends. Quite independently, she also found that working
in a dry-cleaning store _ both to learn the role and on location _
evoked a rush of adolescent memories of when she, too, worked with
her hands as an apprentice upholsterer by the name of Sylvette
Herry.
</P>
<P>
   Miou-Miou's own background was solidly working class: her father
was a policeman, while her mother worked nights in the now-razed
wholesale vegetable market at Les Halles. Leaving school at 16,
Miou-Miou signed on to learn a trade, but two years later, as the
May 1968 student movement blew gusts of freedom through Paris, she
concluded that surely life had more to offer than upholstering.
</P>
<P>
   One night, she and her sister, Marie-Claude, went to a variety
show in a Paris cabaret where, among others, a talented young
comedian and musician called Coluche was performing. Coluche went
on to become one of France's most popular comedians before dying in
a motorcycle crash in 1986, but at the time he was 24 and still
unknown. After the show, the two girls went to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Look, if I please either of you, tell me now so we
can save a lot of time,''' Miou-Miou recalled with a smile. ``I
thought that very funny. Two days later, I left home and went to
live with him. Then the group decided to build their own
cafe-theater called the Cafe de la Gare. It was crazy. We had no
money. We didn't know where we would sleep. We begged, we ate what
people gave us. But the Cafe de la Gare happened. I didn't want to
be an actress, but everyone did something. And it was like that
that I was asked to appear in a film. I said no, but the others
said, `We're only doing this to break into movies.' So I said
yes.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   By then, already nicknamed Miou-Miou by Coluche (the name has no
particular meaning, but it sounds affectionate in French), she was
all of 21 and within two years had appeared in six movies. But it
was with her seventh film, Bertrand Blier's wild romp ``Les
Valseuses'' (released as ``Going Places'' in the United States),
that she broke through. In a cast that included Gerard Depardieu,
Patrick Deweare (another member of the Cafe de la Gare gang and
later also Miou-Miou's lover), Jeanne Moreau and Isabelle Huppert,
Miou-Miou somehow stood out to the point that to this day it is
still remembered as  &UR; her &LR;  film.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to make movies she liked _ ``Jonas Qui Aura Vingt
Cinq Ans en l'An 2000'' (``Jonah Who Will be 25 in the Year
2000''), ``La Derobade'' (``The Life''), ``Josepha,'' ``Coup de
Foudre'' (``Entre Nous''), ``Tenue de Soiree'' (``Evening Dress''),
and ``La Lectrice'' (``The Reader'') _ and many that she prefers to
forget (like ``Germinal.'') Yet the character she created in ``Les
Valseuses'' established her image. She was popular, but also in the
sense that she was working class, had no social pretensions, was
not bourgeoise. In a recent profile, the Paris daily Liberation
said, ``She belongs to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in the 1990s, while she has appeared in a dozen movies,
``Dry Cleaning'' was her first lead role. And since ``Dry
Cleaning'' was completed 18 months ago, she has not made a movie.
But she is not alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy a certain respect,'' she said. ``People like me
because I was part of their lives. But you can't be a working-class
gamine when you're 48. The gamine bit is over. I get sent scripts,
really ridiculous scripts. I'd rather not work than do stupid
television films. I've made so many films that I don't want to see
myself on the screen. I don't want to see Huppert, Adjani,
Depardieu, others. There's a whole generation I don't want to see
any more because we haven't stopped being on the screen. I'm a bit
tired of us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most actresses past the age of 40, she laments that good
screen roles are rarely written for middle-age women. Indeed, among
French actresses of a certain age, only Catherine Deneuve, 55,
appears to be making a successful transition from symbol of beauty
to mature performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deneuve is the exception,'' Fontaine agreed. ``But Miou-Miou
cannot play a bourgeoise; she cannot play every social class. She
is a `popular' actress.''
</P>
<P>
   So Miou-Miou's answer is to turn to theater. And while the
success of ``Dry Cleaning'' in France suggested a relaunching of
her screen career, she sees it as closing a long chapter in her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad `Dry Cleaning' was the last,'' she said. ``At least
this period, almost 30 years, ends well. But I want to learn. And
in the theater I will learn. There are so many things I don't know
how to do, and I am really eager to learn again.''

 &HT;    Agents credit manhunt for bombings' absence
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrews, N.C. _ After four bombings in 19 months in Georgia and
Alabama, the bombings stopped, and the chief of a regional bombing
task force said Tuesday he believes the reason is that agents have
kept fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph bottled up in North Carolina's
mountains for a year.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly nail bombings, which investigators have said are
related, began with the Atlanta Olympics in July 1996 and ended
with the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the most extensive manhunts in recent American history
nears its one-year anniversary, Woody Enderson, the FBI special
agent in charge of the multiagency Southeast Bomb Task Force, said
authorities think the fact that there have been no more bombings
since the fatal Alabama attack means that suspect Rudolph is their
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that he is a bomber, and I feel very
strongly that if we have done nothing else in the past year but
keep him from doing another bombing, we've been successful,''
Enderson said at a news conference in Andrews. ``I have great fear
that if we leave and just back away, someone else might die, and I
don't want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 federal and state officers continue to search the
rugged mountains of the 500,000-acre Nantahala National Forest for
the former soldier and self-employed carpenter. Rudolph, 32, who
grew up exploring these mountains, is said by friends and family to
be an expert outdoorsman.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said authorities think he may be hiding in a bunker,
abandoned mine or cave. In addition, he said, a number of
burglaries of mountain cabins and sightings of unidentified persons
by residents in recent months lead authorities to believe Rudolph
is still in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know an awful lot about Eric Rudolph from friends and
associates. From going into great detail about his background, we
know he feels very comfortable in this area,'' Enderson said.
``Everything we know about him leads us to believe that he will not
leave this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph apparently fled into the wilderness the day after the
Birmingham attack once he realized authorities were on his trail. A
gray Nissan pickup truck registered to Rudolph was seen near the
clinic in Birmingham shortly after the attack. That information led
agents to his rented mobile home near Murphy, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph surfaced briefly in July to obtain food from a friend
and again disappeared into mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said agents believe the food is now running low and he
will soon make a move to obtain more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Birmingham and Olympic bombings, Rudolph is
charged with the 1997 bombings of a Sandy Springs abortion clinic
and an Atlanta lesbian nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham attack killed an off-duty police officer working
as a security guard at the clinic and seriously wounded a nurse.
The Centennial Olympic Park explosion killed one person and injured
111.

BUMPERS, FORMER ARKANSAS SENATOR, TO GIVE CLOSING ARGUMENT FOR
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: IMPEACH-CLINTON, IMPEACH-STEELE) 
(fe) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dale Bumpers, a former Democratic senator from
Arkansas and political ally of Bill Clinton, will defend his
longtime friend in a closing argument in the president's
impeachment trial, the White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers asked Bumpers to join the White House
defense team to exploit both his rapport with Senators, especially
Democrats, and his renowned oratorical skills.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers had considered George Mitchell, a Maine
Democrat and former Senate majority leader, for the role. But
Senate Democrats said they warned that Mitchell did not enjoy the
same relations with Republicans as the amiable Bumpers, who retired
this month after 24 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a respected former senator, he brings to the defense of the
president a strong institutional perspective and a keen sense of
the constitutional and national interests at stake,'' said James
Kennedy, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's lawyers opened their rebuttal on Tuesday, the
House Republican managers were privately scaling back a plan to ask
the Senate to invite the president to testify. And Sen. Trent Lott,
the majority leader, cautioned that witnesses were not a foregone
conclusion, despite assertions from Democrats to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bumpers was settling into his chair at the defense table
in the well of the Senate on Tuesday, Senate Democratic leaders
rejected a White House plan to have some Democrats on the House
Judiciary Committee give a first-hand account of the partisanship
that gripped the House impeachment proceedings. The 13 House
prosecutors are all Republicans on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who zealously guards Senate
traditions, voiced concerns at a party caucus Tuesday morning, and
later in a statement, that the proposal would set a bad precedent.
Coming from Byrd, the criticism was enough to kill the idea.
</P>
<P>
   That the White House is reaching out to congressional Democrats
to help make their case underscores the president's keen interest
in keeping all 45 Senate Democrats united against the two
impeachment charges: perjury and obstruction of justice. It takes
67 senators to remove a president from office, so at least 12
Democrats would have to defect to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bumpers, who is now director of the Center for
Defense Information, a military policy organization here, referred
all calls to the White House until Thursday, when Bumpers will make
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers's former colleagues praised the White House's decision
to recruit the 73-year-old iconoclast who, like Clinton, is a
policy aficionado with a razor tongue.
</P>
<P>
   A few Republicans poked fun at Bumpers's legendary
loquaciousness. ``Now you're really talking about delaying the
trial,'' quipped Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House hopes senators will listen a tad closer to a
former colleague than one of the White House lawyers, they may be
right. ``He was an excellent trial lawyer, he's experienced in the
ways of the Senate, and he's someone who knows Bill Clinton maybe
better than any of the rest of us,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important for the president, Bumpers's soaring
rhetoric complements the tightly reasoned arguments expected from
the White House counsels and matches the House Republican
prosecutors' eloquence flourish for flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Charles Ruff, you have a brilliant legal mind who analyzes
things very methodically and effectively,'' said Sen. Richard
Bryan, D-Nev. ``But the House managers had theater, and they gave
an oratorical presentation that reached a rhetorical height. Dale
Bumpers can match and exceed virtually any member in the
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ruff finished the first of three days of White House defense,
the House prosecutors were privately backing away from a plan to
ask the Senate to request that Clinton testify at his own trial.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on Saturday after their closing arguments, several
of the prosecutors expressed concern that they would anger
sympathetic senators if they insisted the Senate invite Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The managers are now debating whether to send the Senate a
letter that merely expresses their interest in cross-examining
Clinton if the Senate, on its own, decides to invite him. Right
now, that seems very unlikely, senators said.
</P>
<P>
   While the momentum to call a small number of witnesses prompted
Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, to say on Monday it
appeared ``inevitable'' that the Senate would depose some witneses,
Lott, the majority leader, voiced less certainty on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know what witnesses might be requested by both
sides,'' Lott told reporters. ``I want to know who they are, what
they might testify to, what they need to clarify.''
</P>
<P>
   Under rules that the Senate adopted, after the opening
arguments, senators will vote whether to dismiss the case and
whether to depose witnesses and admit new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he is ``contemplating'' pushing a
motion on the floor that would follow the motion to dismiss and the
motion to depose, probably if both motions failed. Kerry said he
has been talking to Daschle and the Senate legal counsel about the
proposal in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's motion would basically call for an up-or-down vote on
the two impeachment counts. If it passed by a simple majority, the
Senate would move immediately to the ultimate vote on conviction or
removal.

   LOS ANGELES _ Prime-time television is routinely criticized for
having very few shows about black characters, and relatively few
nonwhite actors even in supporting roles. The one network with six
black family sitcoms, WB, groups four on the same night in what
detractors call WB's Thursday ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   At a semiannual television critics convention here, the networks
have been trotting out producers and actors to be interviewed, some
of them from established shows and some from new shows for
midseason. Including WB, UPN, CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox, the black
actors or producers from prime-time series who appeared onstage
over two and a half weeks could be counted on two hands.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday brought a striking contrast. It was PBS's turn to
present programs, and almost the entire day featured black actors,
writers, directors, producers, musicians, a poet and even newspaper
journalists (representing a documentary on the black press). By the
end of its second day, PBS had put the spotlight on 18 programs, 10
of them by or about African-Americans or Africans (Nelson Mandela).
At one session, the filmmaker Spike Lee was asked about the one
midseason network show about blacks, Fox's foam-animation comedy,
``The PJ's,'' featuring the voice of Eddie Murphy. ``I kind of
scratch my head why Eddie Murphy's doing this because it shows no
love at all for black people,'' Lee said. ``I'm not saying we're
above being made fun of, but it's really hateful toward black
people.'' (A spokesman for Murphy said he had no comment.) Lee was
part of a panel discussing a PBS series in February called ``I'll
Make Me a World: A Century of African-American Art.''
</P>
<P>
   The programs presented by PBS ranged from a ``Kennedy Center
Presents'' tribute to Muddy Waters (Jan. 27) to a ``Frontline''
profile of Paul Robeson (Feb. 24) to ``Forgotten Fires,'' a
documentary about 1994 church burnings in South Carolina (April 29)
to a ``Great Performances'' evening of Duke Ellington music (May
12) and several segments to be shown in June in the 26-part series
``People's Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Quattrone, PBS's programming chief, said the scheduling
had been deliberate ``so that people can see that this is a
continuing effort'' threaded throughout the calendar and through
different genres of programming and including other ethnic groups.
For example, she has commissioned a second series of
``Foto-Novelas,'' half-hour dramas created from the Latin American
pulp-novel tradition of mixing surreal fantasy with everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, PBS had a ``Masterpiece Theater'' session on a Dickens
drama (``Great Expectations'') and a new ``Mystery!'' to present,
as well as a new preschool show about exotic animals called
``Zoboomafoo'' from the creators of ``Kratts' Creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quattrone says she sees scattered efforts by commercial
broadcasters to include more ethnic diversity in prime time. Scott
Sassa, the new entertainment chief executive for NBC, said greater
diversity was one of his goals.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quattrone said: ``But our point is that this is a major
showpiece of what we're doing. It's one of our fundamentals.''

   Sawyer-Gibson Ratings
</P>
<P>
   ABC built it differently, and the audience came to see what was
different, at least for one morning.
</P>
<P>
   The star power pairing of Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson did
drive up the ratings for ABC's troubled ``Good Morning, America.''
On Monday the first foray of the temporary morning anchor team
pushed its rating up 34 percent from its average for the fourth
quarter of last year. It was not enough for it to seriously
challenge the lead of the dominant morning program, NBC's ``Today''
program, but the new anchor team did at least allow ABC to open up
a gap between ``Good Morning, America'' and CBS's morning program.
</P>
<P>
   That was important for ABC because ``Good Morning, America''
reached a nadir two weeks ago, when it finished in last place.
``CBS This Morning'' embarrassed ABC by finishing in second place
that week, ahead of ``Good Morning, America'' for the first time in
22 years.
</P>
<P>
   National Nielsen ratings for the Sawyer-Gibson debut showed a
3.9 rating, up from the 2.9 the show scored in the fourth quarter
of 1998. ``Today'' had a 5 rating, while CBS has a 2.6 rating.
(Each rating point represents 994,000 homes.)

   A Sense of Theater
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For years Jac Venza has dreamed of bringing real
drama back to television. Not the sort of drama seen in prime-time
series like ``E.R.'' and not television movies. Real stage drama,
the kind Channel 13 in New York used to present to the PBS system
under the name ``American Playhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally Venza, executive producer in charge of all performance
programming for Thirteen/WNET, got his wish. PBS announced its
support on Monday for ``Stage on Screen,'' a series that under his
creative aegis will film stage productions for television. The
first project is Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman drama ``Twilight:
Los Angeles, 1992,'' based on events and people from the Los
Angeles riots after the first Rodney King trial. Another
possibility is the play ``Wit,'' now Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Venza said his goal was to finish six to eight productions for
the 1999-2000 season and to present the first in September or
October. He also plans to mine the PBS archive and revive ``two or
three or four'' classic stage productions from the past, ones that
few modern viewers are likely to have seen.

   For Children Only
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Next month Nickelodeon will begin a new digital
broadcast channel filled with educational programs for preschoolers
in partnership with Children's Television Workshop. The channel,
Noggin, will face a rival from Children's Television Workshop's
other partner, PBS, which on Monday announced plans to start a
24-hour children's channel in the fall. While Children's Television
Workshop still makes new episodes of ``Sesame Street'' for PBS, and
will for the next five years, the episodes revert to it after two
years on the public network and will then be seen only on Noggin.
</P>
<P>
   PBS Kids Channel, the digital network's name, will be offered by
about 16 PBS stations by the end of 1999 that have converted to
digital transmission. But only viewers who have bought digital
television sets or set-top box converters will be able to receive
those digital transmissions, and that means probably only a few
million homes by year's end.

 &HT;    Superintendent mum on plans to take Dallas job
 &HT;    (ATTENTION Ohio, Texas eds.)
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton Superintendent James A. Williams will not
say if he would take a job as the head of Dallas schools.
</P>
<P>
   But he confirmed Tuesday he had been contacted about the job by
a search consultant and had participated in a tele-conference
interview with Dallas school officials.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is one of four semi-finalists seeking to become Dallas
school superintendent, said John Dodd, Dallas school board vice
president. Dodd said he would support Williams as a finalist.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member Dallas board met Tuesday night to pick finalists
for the job of superintendent over the 160,000-student district.
The job pays at least $150,000 and the superintendent oversees a $1
billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is 54 and who has been with the district since
1986, now earns about $112,482.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said the field of candidates narrowed from five to four
when Jerry D. Weast, a superintendent in North Carolina, withdrew
from the race.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining candidates are: Williams, Carrol Thomas,
superintendent for Beaumont (Texas) schools; Don McAdams, a Houston
management consultant and former college president; and Anthony
Trujillo, who last month was fired as superintendent of Ysleta
(Texas) schools.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd was impressed by Williams' effort to convert five Dayton
schools to charter schools and by his ``strong'' financial
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about this particular gentlemen and his
resume and the great success stories he has to say about Dayton,''
Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' public schools are now run by an interim superintendent
who took over in 1997 after former Superintendent Yvonne Gonzalez,
46, resigned and was convicted of embezzling district money.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd said the district is ``in disarray'' and in need of a
strategic plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need someone who wants to spend time in the schools and
make principals better principals and make teachers better,'' Dodd
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams longevity in Dayton also impressed Dodd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been able to deal with crisis situations....and still
keep his head,'' Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   Finalists will visit Dallas this week and next for an interview
with the board and to meet community members. An on-site visit to
the finalists' hometowns will follow, Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Boyd, Dayton school board vice president, said he has no
problem with Williams' advancing in his career. But he said ``we
have a district to run'' so he needs to know Williams' intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Jean Booker wants Williams at the helm in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally want him to stay for the sake of the district and
our children,'' she said.
</P>

ADVERTISING: JORDAN MCGRATH CASE AGREES TO SELL, JOINING HAVAS AND
EURO RSCG
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill.)   (fb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ And the major independent agencies continue to
dwindle down to a precious few, to quote a snippet of ``September
Song'': Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners in New York agreed on
Tuesday to be bought by Havas Advertising in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Havas, the world's seventh-largest agency company, with billings
estimated at $7.7 billion, already owns several American agencies
under the banner of its Euro RSCG Worldwide network. These include
Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG in New York and
Euro RSCG Tatham in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Havas is acquiring Jordan McGrath in a cash transaction that
includes payments to the owner-managers based on the agency's
future performance.
</P>
<P>
   Though a purchase price was not disclosed, most agencies have
recently been sold for amounts about equal to their annual revenue.
Jordan McGrath had revenue of $59 million in 1997, according to the
trade publication Advertising Age. The agency, which specializes in
handling toy, health care and packaged-goods brands, has estimated
billings of $600 million from such blue-chip clients as Hasbro
Inc., Novartis AG, Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the Procter &AMP; Gamble Company
and SmithKline Beecham PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup of independent shops along Madison Avenue has been
rapidly shrinking as agencies determine they must grow larger to
meet the needs of their growing clients. That is particularly true
for such shops as Jordan McGrath that are without offices outside
the United States and often have to pass international assignments
on to bigger agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable names that recently relinquished their
independence include Arnold Communications, bought by Snyder
Communications; Hal Riney &AMP; Partners and Evans Group, bought by
Publicis SA; Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos and Carmichael
Lynch, acquired by the Interpublic Group of Companies, and Abbott
Mead Vickers PLC, absorbed by Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting a lot of calls over the years'' from giant
agency companies, said Patrick J. McGrath, the chairman and chief
executive at Jordan McGrath. ``This one was interesting because it
filled in what we were missing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Euro RSCG will give us everything we need in terms of
plused-up resources,'' he added. ``We'll now have global reach,
enhanced health care expertise and media-buying expertise. That
gives us an improved situation for new business as well as taking
care of clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan McGrath has been known for ``nameonics,'' a style of
advertising that advocates using brand names as the focus of
campaign themes to build memorability: ``Zestfully clean'' for Zest
soap, ``Renuzit doozit!'' for Renuzit air freshener, ``Quaker Oats.
It's the right thing to do,'' all those ``Theragrams'' delivered
for Theragram vitamins, and the ``Dragnet'' theme reworked as
``Tum-ta-tum-Tums'' for Tums.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan McGrath will become an autonomous unit of Euro RSCG under
the name Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners/Euro RSCG. Members of the
executive committee have signed contracts that will ``keep us here
for a considerable period of time,'' McGrath said. In addition to
McGrath, 64, they are Stephen Badenhop, 51, president, who was
identified in 1997 as McGrath's heir apparent; Steve Farella, 43,
integrated communications director; Tom Finneran, 49, chief
financial officer, and Ilon Specht, 49, executive creative
director.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan McGrath will be overseen by Bob Schmetterer, chairman and
chief executive at Euro RSCG in New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is big for us because scale is really an issue, no
question about it,'' Schmetterer said. ``This puts our operations
in the U.S. into the top 10,'' with combined billings estimated at
$3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Equally significant, he added, were ``the strategic moves''
related to the acquisition, especially the Jordan McGrath
experience in handling consumer health care brands such as
Gaviscon, Nasalcrom, Nicoderm, Nicorette, Progaine, Rogaine,
Tagamet, Triaminic and Tums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've identified health care as one of the three most
important categories for the new century,'' along with
telecommunications and technology, Schmetterer said. Jordan McGrath
complements the Euro RSCG health care agencies, he added, handling
ads aimed at health care professionals; they include Lally
McFarland &AMP; Pantello/Euro RSCG in New York and Toronto and Robert
A. Becker/Euro RSCG in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Schmetterer played down the significance of Jordan McGrath's
sharing Procter &AMP; Gamble as a client with Tatham Euro RSCG;
Advertising Age, in an article this week, described the deal as
``largely a marriage of convenience'' driven by ``pressure to
strengthen their global networks'' as P&AMP;G reorganizes to emphasize
worldwide brand sales.
</P>
<P>
   Both agencies lost United States assignments last year when P&AMP;G
consolidated brands globally; Euro RCSG lost the Vidal Sassoon hair
care line to the Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago, and Jordan McGrath
lost Safeguard soap to Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York, a unit of
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``While this gives us a bigger foothold with P&AMP;G domestically,
if there had been no P&AMP;G business at Jordan, this still would have
happened,'' Schmetterer said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan McGrath traces its roots to Case &AMP; Krone, which was
founded in 1969. Other names under which the agency has operated
include Case &AMP; McGrath; Jordan, Case, Taylor &AMP; McGrath, and Jordan,
Manning, Case, Taylor &AMP; McGrath. In addition to McGrath, who was
one of four initial employees, Gene Case is still at the agency,
serving as a creative director on the Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn and
SmithKline accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its name, the agency ``has been approached over the
years by everybody,'' said Abe Jones, managing director at Admedia
Partners in New York, which represented Jordan McGrath in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference this time is that Euro RSCG represents a major
commitment to the health care category,'' he added, ``and gives the
agency international geographic coverage. Those strategic benefits
were far more important than the money.''
</P>
<P>
   In trading on Tuesday in Paris, shares of Havas closed up three
euros, or 1.96 percent, to 156 euros. For those who may be
wondering, the ``Euro'' in Euro RSCG came before the introduction
of the euro as the European currency.

NASDAQ ECLIPSES RISE IN BROADER MARKETS WITH NEW HIGH
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A further advance in Internet and telecommunications
shares helped push stock markets higher on Tuesday, even as
analysts expressed fear about hefty valuations.
</P>
<P>
   The rally in Internet and telecommunications stocks, fueled by
the At Home Corp.'s deal to buy Excite Inc. in a deal valued at
$6.7 billion and Vodaphone Group PLC's $59.7 billion planned
acquisition of Airtouch Communications Inc., helped to push the
NASDAQ composite index to a new high. It closed above 2,400 for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was moderate, at 787
million shares. But 1.1 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   Other market averages, which bobbed for much of the session,
rallied late and closed higher.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by big gains in AT&AMP;T and IBM, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 14.67, or two-tenths of a percent, to 9,355.22. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 8.74, or seven-tenths of a
percent, to 1,252. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization
companies did even better, rising 3.84, or nine-tenths of a
percent, to 430.89.
</P>
<P>
   But those gains were eclipsed by the NASDAQ composite, which
jumped 59.97, or 2.5 percent, to 2,408.17. And Thestreet.com's
index of 20 Internet companies rose 43.92, or 8.7 percent, to
548.29.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger and acquisition news in the technology sector led
the day,'' said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``And the news provided a tremendous amount of
support for the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts and traders said stocks were very richly
priced, and due for a correction. Bad news from important foreign
markets like Brazil or China could pound stocks, they said. And
they said they are wary about what the Federal Reserve chairman,
Alan Greenspan, might say about the stock market when he testifies
before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has become such an economic driver that he has to
say something,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at
Legg Mason in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Worries about Brazil eased a bit on Tuesday, as the Brazilian
Senate approved an important part of the Government's austerity
package. For the day, Brazil's Bovespa stock index gained 3.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the merger announcements, expectations that Microsoft's
profits for the quarter ended Dec. 31 would meet or exceed
expectations were also an important part of Tuesday's overall
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 5~, to 155|. After the close of trading, the
world's leading software company reported that it earned 73 cents a
share during the period, 20 percent more than the highest estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the most venerable names in American capitalism _ AT&AMP;T,
IBM and General Motors _ were the Dow's biggest gainers. Gains in
those stocks offset weakness among bank shares.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T jumped 7 1/8, to 91 3/8. It will take control of At Home
when its acquisition of TeleCommunications Inc. is completed. TCI
is At Home's largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   IBM gained 7 5/16, to 192 1/4, a record. General Motors rose 4
11/6, to 88.
</P>
<P>
   Dow losers included American Express, which dropped 3 7/8, to
100 1/2, J.P. Morgan, which shed 2 7/8, to 105 15/16, and Minnesota
Mining &AMP; Manufacturing, which lost 1 13/16, to 72 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   At Home's announcement that it would pay 1.04 shares for each
share of Excite, the second biggest Internet directory company,
caused a surge in the price of Excite and other Internet stocks.
Excite leaped 42{, to 110, a 57 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos Inc., the third-biggest directory, gained 22], to 110\.

COMMENTARY: INHERIT THE WIND  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill McCollum lecturing about geni- &UR; till &LR; -ia didn't get the
heart racing. James Sensenbrenner's drone could be bottled as a
sedative. Hence our latest ``trial of the century'' opened to
thumbs-down reviews: ``Deadly!'' _ Washington Post. ``A lawyerly
thud!'' _ Cox News Service. ``Snoozathon!'' _ Philadelphia
Inquirer. Not even ``Meet Joe Black'' fared this badly, and its
leading character was Death.
</P>
<P>
   But don't abandon hope yet. Tuesday a shrewd Charles Ruff cast
himself as Perry Mason (and Asa Hutchinson as Hamilton Burger).
Soon to come are live witnesses. Sure, some seers say that will
never happen _ just as impeachment and a trial weren't supposed to
happen, remember? _ but we know now that what the Republican
majority wants, it gets. And once those witnesses arrive, opening
the Senate's door to the truly unpredictable, we might even find
ourselves with a contender for ``trial of the century'' at last.
</P>
<P>
   Which trial has deserved that honor until now? Harry K. Thaw's
1907 trial for murdering Stanford White? Leopold and Loeb? The
Lindbergh kidnapping? The Rosenbergs? The Chicago Seven? O.J? In a
riveting book, ``Summer for the Gods,'' which won last year's
Pulitzer Prize in History, Edward J. Larson argues that only the
1925 Scopes trial, about the teaching of evolution, ``fully lives
up to its billing by continuing to echo through the century.''
Though Larson was writing pre-Monica _ and was referring to such
echoes as the continuing fight over religion in public schools _
Monicagate has now not only ratified his view but has led us to a
plausible potential Scopes II.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded in the battle between Clarence Darrow and William
Jennings Bryan was a debate over values _ a culture war that pitted
modernists against fundamentalists. This is roughly how the
religious right of our day, impeachment's most dogged proponents,
defines the debate now; it's what Tom DeLay means when he sees the
battle as that of ``relativism versus absolute truth.'' And it's
this culture war that remains the main event. Whether the lame-duck
Bill Clinton is acquitted or convicted, his fate is as secondary to
the dynamic of his trial as the preordained conviction of John
Scopes, the biology teacher who challenged state and biblical law,
was to his own media circus.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the facts of Scopes' crime and the verdict of the
Dayton, Tenn., jury were known from Day One of his trial, so we now
know the facts about Clinton's crimes and his jury's likely
verdict. That's why the key witnesses we need to hear are not just
Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie and Linda Tripp _ entertaining as
they doubtless would be in the well of the Senate _ but the
generals in the larger battle, whom we can only hope will be called
too. As Darrow, the defense lawyer, cross-examined Bryan, the chief
prosecutor, in a surprise move to exhume the heart of his case, so
a member of the Clinton defense team must go after Kenneth Starr or
Henry Hyde in a trial that by definition is less about
jurisprudence than political theater. Let the prosecution
cross-examine Clinton in fair exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The results may not be as dramatic as ``Inherit the Wind'' _
which, as Larson documents, is a wildly fictionalized account of
the Scopes trial anyway. But they may illuminate the driving issues
in the conflict that consumes us. In his concluding statement on
Saturday, Hyde crystallized that conflict best when he said it
could be OK for a president to ``shade the truth'' for ``a
compelling, demanding, public purpose,'' but not ``under oath, for
a private pleasure.'' This moral code is the precise opposite of
that held by Clinton's defenders, who find public truth-shading
about, say, Iran-Contra more reprehensible than Bible-sworn lying
in a courtroom about sex.
</P>
<P>
   This conflict is far more germane to the case than Vernon
Jordan's contacts with Revlon. If we assume that Clinton is guilty
of every charge, the still-unresolved question of the proper
punishment for his crimes depends entirely on whether one sees the
world through the president's relativist eyes or Hyde's fixed lens
of absolute truth. That debate is nothing if not the direct
descendant of the culture war fought by the slick, cynical Darrow
and the pious, grandiloquent Bryan, and unless their successors
have it out as they did, it's hard to imagine how our own aspiring
sequel to the trial of the century can end.

HUSSEIN RETURNS HOME AFTER CANCER TREATMENT IN U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ A gaunt-looking King Hussein returned home to
Jordan on Tuesday to rain-swept celebrations and muted speculation
that the 63-year-old monarch may soon name one of his sons as
successor to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Having piloted his own plane home, the king alighted and stopped
to pray on the tarmac before being greeted by hundreds of diplomats
and dignitaries. Among them, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who
wished him a speedy recovery following six months of cancer
treatment for non-Hodgkins lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The king said again that he is now free of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Jordanians, rain whipping their faces,
lined the streets of Amman to get a glimpse of the king, who stood
through the sunroof of a white Mercedes limousine and waved to the
crowds as he made his way from the Marka airport to the Baab
al-Salaam palace.
</P>
<P>
   But while the celebrations went on, some Jordanians worried that
recent signals from the king may mean that he is planning to
side-line his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, and install one of his
five sons as his successor instead.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a statement issued from the royal court failed to
mention the Crown Prince or to dispel rumors that the question of
succession had not been decided.
</P>
<P>
   After he landed Tuesday, the king didn't quell the concern.
Instead, he told Jordanians that it was time ``to review, to see
what needs to be done to consolidate the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Jordanian analysts read the statement to mean that the king
is having second thoughts about passing the crown to Hassan, whom
he named as Regent in 1965, because it likely would mean that
Hussein's own descendants would never sit on the throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely some changes in the works,'' said Radwan
Abdullah, a Jordanian political consultant affiliated with Middle
East Consulting, Research and Analysis, a think-tank based in
Orlando, Fla. ``The question is what kind of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a move could upset the Middle East's most enduring monarchy
_ and one that has been a close U.S. ally and Israel's staunchest
Arab friend.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, palace matters are the prerogative of the king and a
taboo subject for everyone else. As yet, no one knows what
Hussein's silence on the subject means, but plenty of people are
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something on everyone's mind,'' said Abdullah.
``Jordanians don't want any changes. They are worried about
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Jordanians know no leader other than King Hussein, a
descendant of the family of the Prophet Mohammed who has ruled the
desert kingdom with a combination of benevolence and brutality
since 1952.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch supporter of peace with Israel, the king has often
helped to boost the troubled Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, most
notably in October, when he left his sick-bed to help nudge the two
sides toward signing the latest peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Such abilities helped him at home to solidify support for an
increasingly unpopular peace treaty with Israel. Abroad, they have
won him respect as a seasoned peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordanians do know something about Crown Prince Hassan, an
affable, Oxford-educated intellectual who has advised the king and
guided Jordan's economy for more than three decades. During the
king's recent prolonged absence for chemotherapy, Hassan, 51, took
the helm of government and was praised for his ability.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't know is much about King Hussein's sons. Palace
watchers say that if the king does name a new successor, the most
likely candidate is Prince Hamseh, the king's 18-year-old son by
his fourth wife, Queen Noor, the U.S.-born Lisa Hallaby.
</P>
<P>
   The first signal that this youngest prince might become king one
day came when Hussein sent him a birthday letter and mentioned that
he, Hussein, was already king at Hamseh's age. Of the five sons,
only Hamseh was at his father's bedside during most of the king's
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The other possibility is Prince Abdallah, King Hussein's eldest
son and an army general in charge of the Royal Guards, elite units
of paratroopers and special forces, who has a reputation for charm
and bravado that older Jordanians say remind them of the king when
he was in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian analysts say the problem with both is that their
policies _ and their dexterity at steering a country that is often
caught between conflicting Western and Arab interests _ is not yet
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know anything about them,'' said a Jordanian
political commentator, who asked not to be named. ``We know that
Hamseh speaks good Arabic, that he memorized the Koran. We know
that Abdullah is any army man. Otherwise, they are unknown
quantities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, King Hussein may leave the question up to his
family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Hussein was first diagnosed with cancer, he
suggested creating a Hashemite council responsible for electing his
successor _ either his brother or one of his sons. After intense
lobbying by Prince Hassan, the idea was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the idea has resurfaced. So has a compromise: Prince Hassan
would take the helm next, but the dynasty would then revert back to
one of Hussein's sons _ rather than one of Hassan's _ after
Hassan's dies.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, most Jordanians say they want the monarchy to
continue, regardless of which prince takes the helm.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, groups of young men, some dressed in traditional
Bedouin garb, chanted slogans, danced the debka, and slaughtered
sheep and camels on sidewalks to celebrate King Hussein's safe
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us feel more secure,'' said Ma'moun Ajarma, a
27-year-old teacher who traveled 100 miles to see the king arrive.
``Psychologically, people feel better with the king here.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Crown Prince Hassan?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good too,'' said Ajarma. ``The monarchy is good for
Jordan.''

BRITISH AEROSPACE DEAL UPSETS EUROPEAN ARMS INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Aerospace PLC announced a $9.5 billion stock
deal for the Marconi Electronics Systems unit of the General
Electric Co. PLC Tuesday, creating a British colossus that will be
one of the world's biggest military contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans may end months of speculation about the potential
creation of a pan-European military company to challenge the
American giants.
</P>
<P>
   British Aerospace will pay 0.42 share in the merged company for
each share of General Electric, which is not related to General
Electric of the United States, costing it 5.77 billion pounds, or
$9.5 billion. It will also assume 1.55 billion pounds, or $2.5
billion, in debt. Stockholders of General Electric will own 37.6
percent of the merged company and retain their shares in the
smaller General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to be approved by British
regulators, creates a company that will make everything from
submarines to warplanes to avionics and will be the third-largest
military contractor behind the Boeing Co. and the Lockheed Martin
Corp. British Aerospace said that some jobs would be lost in the
joint work force of 99,500 worldwide and that it would save $453
million annually after three years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sent the shares of both companies lower because of
concern that British Aerospace paid as much as 30 percent too much
to outbid a rival suitor, Thomson-CSF of France. Shares of British
Aerospace fell 68 pence, or 13.8 percent, to 425.5 pence, and
General Electric fell 31 pence, or 5.4 percent, to 546.5.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement left French and German defense companies
dwarfed and in a sour mood, calling the emergence of New British
Aerospace, as the merged company would be known, hostile to broader
European aspirations. The new company is valued at $25.6 billion
with combined annual sales of more than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in Continental Europe also had a bleak view of the
deal, which runs counter to the avowed intention of British and
other European leaders to foster closer military cooperation based
on joint weapons procurement as defense budgets are pared back in
the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG, which only last
month was thought close to a cross-border merger with British
Aerospace, said a deal with the expanded British company seemed
impossible. The company said in a statement that it would
``evaluate its other European and trans-Atlantic options.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts took the statement as a show of pique, but the
company insisted that it was serious about its intention to look
for partners elswhere in Europe. Compared with the new British
company, continental European defense contractors look outmatched.
France's Aerospatiale, Germany's DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and
Italy's Finmeccanica SpA all have sales of about $9 billion _
slightly less than half of New British Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   German executives insist that DaimlerChrysler Aerospace will
pursue other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already had contacts with other companies,'' Christian
Poppe, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman, said in a telephone interview,
without elaborating. ``This is not just a hot reaction.'' The
remarks nonetheless reflected DaimlerChrysler's annoyance at being
forced into a situation where it could only negotiate with New
British Aerospace as an underdog. Previously it had sought a merger
of equals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe does not consist only of DaimlerChrysler and British
Aerospace,'' one German military industry executive said, speaking
on the condition of anonymity. ``There is a part of Europe now that
is in splendid isolation _ and the other part is the Continent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said DaimlerChrysler Aerospace saw a possible fit
with the Northrop Grumman Corp. in the United States or with other
European companies. But both those options carry political freight,
and DaimlerChrysler made no comment on its likely partners.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also raised new uncertainties about plans to remodel
the Airbus Industrie civilian airline consortium into a more
conventional company. British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler are
members of the consortium along with Aerospatiale of France and
Casa of Spain. But the reorganization of the consortium has been
bogged down in arguments, the most recent over French objections to
last month's talk of a British Aerospace-DaimlerChrysler Aerospace
merger. Now, though, British Aerospace's snub of DaimlerChrysler
could further strain the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite German and French anger at Tuesday's British merger,
John Dowdy, a partner in the London office of McKinsey &AMP; Co., who
specializes in military issues, and others said the post-Cold War
dynamics of the European defense industry left European companies
few alternatives but to consolidate. ``What drives this is
overcapacity,'' Dowdy said. ``Since the end of the Cold War,
defense budgets have declined in all countries. And there is just a
whole lot more capacity than the market will support.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's deal, he said, was ``not the beginning of the end''
for the broader European defense industry, but ``the end of the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Avery, an analyst at Paribas Capital Markets, said
Tuesday's deal was ``the most doable deal in a glacial process''
but that it did not represent the end of a broader consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the view of British executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in this deal that stops us proceeding with the
European aerospace and defense company structure we've been talking
about,'' said John Weston, the chief executive of British
Aerospace. The company's chairman, Sir Richard H. Evans, added:
``The reality is that Europe can actually afford only one major
aerospace entity. We absolutely have to move European consolidation
forward.''

SAMARITAN RESCUES BOY, DIES UNDER THE ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAUNTON, Mass. _ The terrible tableaux of cracked ice, desperate
screams, and flailing arms of a young boy in frigid water touched
something instinctive in Richard Silvia.
</P>
<P>
   So he did what instinct told him _ and jumped in.
</P>
<P>
   He'd done it before, rescuing his younger brother after he'd
fallen through the ice during a boyhood pickup hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I was the lightest, I used to go out on the thin ice
to get the pucks,'' a grief-sticken John Silvia explained Tuesday.
But unlike that long-ago hockey mishap, his brother could not save
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something he would do,'' said Geraldine Silvia, whose
39-year-old son, a mental health attendant at Taunton State
Hospital, drowned Monday in the icy waters of First Pond after
plunging to the rescue of a teenager who survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did this for a living,'' she said. ``He took care of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, relatives left flowers to mark the spot where rescue
workers labored unsuccessfully to resuscitate Silvia. And they
recalled a gentle man who didn't hesitate to risk his life to save
another.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, 14-year-old Kevin Vargas and a friend were
playing on the ice when Vargas tumbled into the numbing water. As
Vargas's playmate ran for help, Silvia _ hiking from work via
railroad tracks bordering the pond _ moved quickly to rescue the
boy.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped into the 8- to 10-feet-deep waters and pushed the boy
toward safety. Then, authorities said, he disappeared, trapped
beneath a sheet of ice.
</P>
<P>
   John Silvia said his brother went onto the ice with a stick,
trying to rescue Vargas, but was pulled in. He got the boy out onto
the ice, then slipped beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers arrived within minutes. Taunton Fire Capt. Ron
Nastri said Vargas was desperately trying to cling to those trying
to save him, kicking one and poking another in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kid was definitely trying to grab on to anyone who could
help him,'' Nastri said, noting that crews used plastic sleds with
wide runners to displace the weight of the emergency crews on the
thin ice. But they didn't realize that Silvia was in serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got there the man was already under,'' Nastri said.
``We weren't immediately aware that (Silvia) was there for about 1
or 2 minutes until (Vargas') mother told us. And we weren't exactly
aware of where he went down. That's the tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   It took rescuers and divers more than half an hour to find
Silvia's body.
</P>
<P>
   As details of his icy plunge crackled across a police scanner in
Silvia's mother's apartment nearby, his brother John made a fateful
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her this man was dead,'' said John Silvia.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he learned that the rescuer had been his older
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Silvia's relatives said he was walking to his mother's home
Monday after his shift at Taunton State Hospital as a when he heard
the cries from a pond behind an industrial building known as the
Brickyard.
</P>
<P>
   John Silvia said he wasn't surprised at the actions of his
brother, a 5-foot-5, 162-pound athlete who rode a 10-speed bicycle
nearly every day and had been a star linebacker for Taunton High
School's football team.
</P>
<P>
   As John Silvia talked, his crying 6-year-old son sought comfort.
Richard Silvia was the boy's godfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved someone who fell through the ice. . . . He was a
hero,'' John Silvia told his son. His brother ``was here for his
Baptism. . . . We were hoping he was going to be here for a lot
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Silvia said he went to his mother's apartment about 3
p.m. Monday because he was worried about his brother who was not
feeling well. At the time of the rescue, Richard Silvia had no
identification on him; a police officer noticed that the drowned
man had a lion's tatoo on his chest, and Silvia's family was asked
to come to identify him.
</P>
<P>
   John Silvia said his brother normally kept his identification on
his bicycle because his job required him to carry a large
collection of keys in his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   At her daughter's house, his mother struggled Tuesday to cope
with her grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a son who tried to save someone's life,'' Geraldine
Silvia said. ``He tried . . . at least he tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Described by his family as quiet and kind, Richard Silvia had
been divorced for about five years. They said he liked animals,
especially Zack, his black Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   His brother said Richard's work was an example of the way he
lived his life, and the way he cared for his patients at Taunton
State Hospital. In that such a job, Richard Silvia said, ``you have
to be caring and giving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind-natured,'' his brother said. If it had been a
puppy on the ice, ``he would have done the same thing.''

TEXAS GOVERNOR SWORN IN AMID SPECULATION HE WILL SEEK PRESIDENCY IN
2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a history-making ceremony that brought
thousands to a sun-drenched state capital, Gov. George W. Bush
launched his second term on Tuesday, calling for racial healing and
``prosperity with a moral and spiritual center.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Texas governor sworn in to back-to-back four-year
terms, Bush said in his inaugural address that he was humbled by
his overwhelming re-election victory, which brought with it a GOP
sweep of all statewide offices and perhaps the seeds of his own
White House run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He made no overt mention of national politics, but the themes
Bush echoed _ limited government, diversity and economic prosperity
with a moral twist _ were obviously intended for mass appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dream for Texas should be based not just on prosperity,
but the values that make prosperity worthwhile,'' Bush said.
``We're now putting too much hope in economics just as we once put
too much hope in government. Reducing problems to economics is
simple materialism.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, a heavy fog lifted just as the inauguration began
on the south steps of the pink granite Capitol. Rick Perry kicked
off the double swearing-in, becoming the first Republican
lieutenant governor in Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   On hand to watch Perry take the oath was his predecessor, Bob
Bullock, who gave no speech, but did perform one final act as
lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the inauguration began, and with little fanfare, the
veteran of state government gaveled the Texas Senate to order for
the last time, encouraging members to focus their energies on the
future of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A beaming Perry, surrounded by his wife, Anita, and their two
children, Sydney and Griffin, acknowledged Bullock in his speech.
Speaking to the man who made ``God Bless Texas'' a mainstay of
political speeches, Perry said simply: ``God Bless Bob Bullock.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry also paid tribute to two ``heroes'' _ his father, North
Texas farmer Ray Perry, and former President Bush, who received a
sustained standing ovation. The former president stood briefly and
waved to the crowd that snaked toward Congress Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Perry stressed the need for bipartisan cooperation ``because
Texas matters most.'' He also outlined a few of the top priorities
for his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once our basic education, criminal justice, infrastructure and
human service priorities are met, we should give the people of
Texas some of their money back in the form of tax cuts,'' Perry
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Perry's speech, Bush took the oath of office, then thanked
his parents (''the best mother and dad a person could ever have''),
his wife Laura (''for her steadfast and patient love''), and his
twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, (''for their love and their
sacrifice'').
</P>
<P>
   Bush avoided the nitty gritty of his legislative agenda,
stressing instead the importance of moral character, the need for
more volunteerism and the danger of dividing society along racial
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a trend in this country to put people into boxes,''
Bush said. ``There are such boxes all over the world, in places
like Kosovo, Bosnia, Rwanda; and they are human tragedies. As we
head into the 21st century, we should have one big box: American.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, himself a millionaire, criticized a society that measures
success in terms of wealth, saying ``the strength of a society
should be measured in the values its people share.''
</P>
<P>
   He also warned that children who are not taught appropriate
values will pay by making poor choices later in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For our children to have the kind of life we want for them,
they must learn to say yes to responsibility, yes to family, yes to
honesty and hard work, and no to drugs, no to violence, no to
promiscuity or having babies out of wedlock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong choices cause harm, headaches and poverty,'' Bush added.
``We must be willing to draw a clear line between right and
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the speculation about Bush's presidential ambitions, a
larger-than-usual media contingent was on hand, as were a few
political celebrities, including several Mexican governors, Mexican
ambassador Jesus Reyes-Heroles, and Massachusetts Gov. Paul
Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Bush family friend, Cellucci said he and many other
Republicans are hoping the Texas governor runs for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans I talk to are real hopeful that he's going to
run for president,'' Cellucci said. ``He can a attract a broad
spectrum of support. That's what the Republican Party needs in
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the political glitterati, thousands of spectators jammed
the Capitol grounds to hear Bush and Perry speak and then catch an
inaugural parade that included marching bands, a National Guard
tank and drill teams.
</P>
<P>
   For a mere $3, they also got to literally sample part of
inaugural history _ a Texas barbecue featuring 850 briskets, 2,000
pounds of sausage, 2,000 pounds of turkey breast, 1,000 pounds of
ham and 150 gallons of sauce.
</P>
<P>
   For those willing to shell out more, between $40 and $50, four
inaugural balls collectively featured Johnny Dee and the Rocket
88's, Robert Earl Keen and Emilio, among other Texas and Tejano
entertainers. The governor and first lady were to make an
appearance at all four balls.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Kim Brimer, R-Arlington, could hardly contain his
excitement at the national attention Bush brought to the
inauguration, which he said made past swearings-in seem puny.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big. I think with all the national networks, it's
different,'' said Brimer, acknowledging that this year's
legislative session would be different too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take care of the agenda here and let (Bush)
loose,'' Brimer said. ``It's a good session for him to step out on
the national scene.''

REPUBLICANS OFFER PLANS ON TAX CUTS AND SOCIAL SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash., Okla., Colo., Tenn., Ariz., Texas, Del.)  (See related stories: STATEOFUNION-RDP, STATEOFUNION-ASSESS,

 By ALISON MITCHELL and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans sought Tuesday to dispel the image of a
Congress consumed by impeachment and put forward an agenda that
calls for a 10 percent across-the-board cut in income-tax rates and
pledges to engage President Clinton on assuring the long-term
solvency of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal for a sweeping income tax reduction was
made by Senate Republicans in a morning news conference and
amplified by Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., in the televised
Republican response to the State of the Union.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate coordination on tax cuts showed a new unity
on the part of Republicans in the two chambers, who feuded bitterly
over tax reduction last year. The proposal sets up a sharp
ideological collision between Republican tax-cutting objectives and
Clinton's call to allocate budget surpluses over the next 15 years
to Social Security, Medicare and increased domestic and military
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans should not have to wait 15 years for a tax cut,''
said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who heads the Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Republicans in the House and Senate on Tuesday also
immediately criticized Clinton's call for the federal government to
invest some of the retirement benefits in the stock market. They
prefer giving Americans private accounts to manage themselves. ``If
you thought a government takeover of health care was bad,'' said
Rep. Bill Archer, the chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, ``just wait until the government becomes an owner of
America's private-sector companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who is influential on Social Security
issues, said ``This plan is going nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day that saw lawmakers ricochet from the impeachment trial
in the Senate to the president's State of the Union message before
a joint session of Congress in the House, Republicans as much as
Clinton sought to downplay the impeachment struggle for a day.
</P>
<P>
   By putting forward Reps. Dunn and Steve Largent, R-Okla., to
deliver the televised Republican response to the president, they
also tried to give a fresher and more diverse look to congressional
Republicans, who had so long seemed to be defined by just one
person, Newt Gingrich. The two had stressed their fresh faces as
selling points in House leadership races late last year, which they
both lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the advanced text of the Republican response, neither House
member ever mentioned impeachment outright, but Ms. Dunn tried to
defuse the issue immediately and remove it from center
stage.``These are disturbing and controversial times in our
nation's capital, she said. ``A couple of weeks ago I heard a
network anchor say, `The capital is in chaos.' Another proclaimed
we were in the midst of a constitutional crisis. Ladies and
gentlemen, our country is not in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted, ``There are no tanks in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Then picking her words delicately, she said, ``No matter what
the outcome of the the president's situation, life in America will
go on. Our lives will continue to be filled with practical matters,
not constitutional ones.''
</P>
<P>
   She called for an array of tax cuts to satisfy every Republican
constituency, beginning with the 10 percent reduction in tax rates.
``That is the down-payment on a simpler, fairer, flatter tax
system,'' she said. She also advocated an end to the so-called
marriage penalty, which charges some couples more in taxes than
they would pay if they were single, and a reduction in the
inheritance tax, which she called the ``death tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans did not spell out how much revenue the
government would lose under their proposal. By some estimates, such
a tax reduction would amount to $700 billion over a decade. Under
their plan, each income marginal tax rate would fall. The 15
percent rate would drop to 13.5 percent, for example, while the
highest rate of 39.6 percent would fall to 35.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tax proposal, a married couple with two children
earning $75,000 a year would see their tax payment fall to $9,277
from $10,308, for a net tax savings of $1,031, according to the
Senate Finance Committee. In the example, the couple does not
itemize its taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders sought to counterpose such a sweeping tax
rate reduction against Clinton's on call for specific tax credits
for needs such as child care and displaced workers. Earlier
Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott called such selective
tax relief ``the old Washington solution: Take it from the worker,
bring it to Washington, Washington takes the parts it wants. And
then return it back to the people in a way that we tell them that
they can have a tax credit.''
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, Ms. Dunn challenged Clinton to send forward
legislation immediately. But she criticized his proposal as
``giving government more control of your retirement income.'' She
promoted instead a Republican proposal for Americans to have
individual accounts which they choose how to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Largent's half of the televised response stressed issues of
concern to the Republicans' conservative base. ``First, we must
preserve the notion that true liberty and freedom come from God and
are His blessing on this land and that freedom reigns only as we
act responsibly toward God each other and his creation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Clinton for proposing an increase in military
spending and asked him to embrace a Republican proposal for a
national missile defense system. Republicans seemed to be acting in
concert on these military issues, just as on tax cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans on Tuesday introduced a measure they called
the ''soldier's bill of rights'' to increase the rates of monthly
basic pay for members of the armed services by 4.8 percent
effective in the year 2000 and providing subsequent indexing
slightly above inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Largent also turned to an issue that is paramount for social
conservatives, saying ''protecting individual liberty also means
protecting the unborn.'' He called for an end to a form of abortion
that abortion opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.'' Clinton
has vetoed legislation that would ban the practice in which a fetus
is partially extracted and its skull collapsed in the birth canal.
The Senate failed to override his veto last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another major policy battle was shaping up on education, an
issue both parties said would be a priority this year. Republicans
criticized Clinton's newest proposals as ones that would strengthen
the federal role in education policy. ``We will focus on local
school districts,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn. ``We will focus
on local school systems. We will focus on state control.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans on Tuesday night did not stick to the script
and minimize impeachment. Two conservative Republicans, Reps. John
Shadegg of Arizona and Bob Schaffer of Colorado, sent a letter to
colleagues saying they would boycott the president's speech.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter they said that if Clinton had respect for
Congress, he would defer his address until his impeachment trial is
over. By proceeding, they said, ``he also clearly intends to gain
political advantage and demean the significance of the impeachment
proceeding now going forward in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   They added: ``We will not play a role in facilitating his
disrespect.''

PRACTICING OFFENSE AS THE BEST DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his impeachment trial, Bill Clinton's lawyer
spoke softly, gently. In his State of the Union address to the
Congress, the president spoke forcefully, boldly.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, he has cast his lot with the Democrats in a
process that has been bitterly partisan. In the speech, he poached
ideas from the Republicans in the hopes he can salvage a bipartisan
policy agenda from the rubble of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate chamber, temporarily transformed into a hushed
courtroom, he was on the defensive. In the House chamber, setting
for the president's annual message and a raucus rite of democracy,
he was on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   With the American political crisis about to enter its second
year, the depths of the divisions in the nation, the difficulty of
the political and legal questions it faces and the immense
complexity of the man at the center of it all were painted in sharp
relief.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary, exhausting day of argument and oratory, the
president's legal team was setting forth the case for his survival
in the next few weeks even as the president himself was setting out
a roadmap for political cooperation that would affect Americans in
the year 2075.
</P>
<P>
   Here was, to be sure, one of the memorable moments of the tawdry
12 months that have set Americans against Washington: an impeached
president struggling for his political life standing before the
very politicians who will determine his destiny and blithely
speaking of the bright morning of the new century, sketching the
new world they would make together.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the president's survival strategy was indistinguishable
from his policy strategy. He should continue as president, as his
lawyer, Charles F.C. Ruff, argued in the afternoon, in part because
his policies are popular and successful. Hours later, Clinton
sought to demonstrate that he could still be president, even if
impeached, even if threatened by removal, even if his moral
authority was undermined.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the simple but defiant act of
delivering his annual message blared an unmistakable message of its
own: Clinton would govern even if his opponents insisted he
couldn't, he would survive even if his rivals argued he was doomed,
he would look forward even if his detractors picked through the
muck of the past.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second year in a row, the president went over the
heads of the nation's leaders to speak to its people, putting aside
the base language of a capital consumed with scandal and reaching
for the lofty rhetorical heights of national ambition. ``This is
our moment,'' the president said. ``Let us lift our eyes as one
nation, and from the mountaintop of this American century, look
ahead to the next one _ asking God's blessing on our endeavors and
our beloved country.''
</P>
<P>
   His style was classic Clinton, forged in three decades of a
political life that, in Little Rock as in Washington, has been full
of threats and tumult. His formula: Stick with his own kind, the
Democrats, in the elemental issues of high emotion, but sidle to
the center and embrace the ideas of his rivals, the Republicans, in
policy questions.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that formula that has allowed him to persevere, but
it is also the formula that has inflamed both his allies and his
opponents. On the day that his lawyer was trying to persuade
stubborn Republicans that the president had committed no crime and
should not be removed from office, the president used that very
same office to propose one of the chestnuts of Republican policy:
private investment of Social Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   There was enough of the Republican idea in the proposal to
inflame the old accusations of political larceny that followed the
president's offensive to balance the budget (a staple of GOP
platforms), overhaul welfare (the mantra of Republican governors)
and increase defense spending (a reliable GOP position since the
Nixon administration).
</P>
<P>
   But like many of the ideas the president has borrowed from the
Republicans over the years, its resemblance to the GOP plan was
only surface deep. The Republicans want private citizens to be able
to invest some of their Social Security taxes in the private
sector, creating their own retirement portfolios.Clinton would
ivest a portion of the Social Security surplus in the private
sector, linking the fate of the signature new deal program to the
caprices of the modern markets.
</P>
<P>
   In private briefings, White House officials described the
president's agenda as the boldest one since 1993, when he proposed
an overhaul of the nation's health-care system, which accounts for
one-seventh of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   This time he offers his most audacious notion: After a year of
revelations about intimate relations with an intern, legalistic
distinctions about the definitions of ``sex'' and ``is'' and
efforts to block an independent counsel and impeachment itself,
Bill Clinton is still president, and probably will be a year from
now, when he is to deliver his last State of the Union Address.

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First, his lawyers argued that the president, an
invisible presence in the well of the Senate courtroom, should not
be removed from office for anything he has done.
</P>
<P>
   Then the president himself, towering above the assembled three
branches of government in the House chamber, presented the case for
his continuance in office based on what he has yet to do.
</P>
<P>
   In a looking-glass day in which the president's regretted past
and his hoped-for future were juxtaposed with stunning clarity, the
nation watched and listened on Tuesday night as the president's
glaring personal weaknesses and manifest political strengths were
on near-simultaneous display.
</P>
<P>
   In an advance text of the president's speech, released by the
White House, Clinton did not once utter the word ``impeachment,''
or make any obvious reference to the deeds that have put him on
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton made a forceful argument against conviction in
a lengthy State of the Union message that detailed an ambitious and
activist agenda for what he prays will be his remaining 730 days in
office. Thirty-nine times he exhorted his congressional audience it
``must'' or ``should'' tackle some urgent problem, and every time,
he did, the implication was obvious; they had more important
business than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser politician or a more timid soul than Bill Clinton might
have balked at facing his accusers from the House and his jurors
from the Senate at a moment of political peril greater than that
faced by any president for many years. But Clinton seems to thrive
on such adversity, and by most early reckonings, he turned in a
masterly performance that managed to make 535 unimpeached members
of Congress look somehow small by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House counsel, had
told the Senate jury in a two-hour presentation that Clinton stood
accused of a ``witches' brew'' of charges that, even if true, do
not warrant his removal from office. He entered a plea of not
guilty on behalf of the president and called on the Senate to
acquit him and return to the nation's business.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was careful to make no mention of his impeachment
trial, Ruff did not shy from using the State of the Union address
to buttress his argument for retaining Clinton in office.
</P>
<P>
   He said that however distasteful senators might find Clinton's
personal behavior, it did not pose such a threat to the union that
the only remedy was his removal.
</P>
<P>
   And in his peroration, Ruff said: ``When the American people
hear the president talk to Congress tonight, they will know the
answer to the question `Neighbor, how stands the Union?' It stands
strong, vibrant, free.'' Clinton has his priorities straight, Ruff
seemed to be telling the Senate, and so should you.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the grand stage of the House chamber, left his legal
fate to his lawyers and his jury. He argued for political
redemption through motion _ on Social Security, on health care, on
education, on military preparedness. He warned against complacency
and tried to summon the Congress and the nation to act at a time of
unparalleled peace and plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Brinkley, a presidential scholar at the University of
New Orleans, said that the State of the Union address has been
Clinton's most effective soapbox, a means he has mastered to reach
millions of Americans without the filter of the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a stage performance of Clinton at his best,'' Brinkley
said. ``We watch in wonderment this flawed, failed president who
has so much talent, so much intelligence, but whose Achilles heel
has been so destructive for him.''
</P>
<P>
   This was no ordinary speech, and the Senate is no ordinary jury.
An impeachment trial is by nature political, and Clinton's
strongest card through a year of investigation and revelation has
been his continued popularity with the public. Opinion polls taken
before the speech show that 70 percent of the public approves of
the job Clinton is doing and a large majority of the electorate
believes the nation is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the State of the Union fell at another time of trauma
for the president, coming less than a week after his relationship
with Monica S. Lewinsky was first disclosed. That speech, built
around a promise to ``save Social Security first'' before spending
the federal budget surplus, was a hit with the public and helped to
salvage a foundering presidency.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Clinton again used a vow on Social Security as the
centerpiece of his address, using an issue that has proven a winner
for him to make the case that Republicans have abdicated their
governing responsibilities in their zeal to get him.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., saw a common thread running through
the day's legal argument and the evening's rhetorical display.
``More than most State of the Union addresses, he was talking
directly to what has been the primary source of strength for him
throughout this process, and that is the American majority,'' Levin
said. ``And I think they'll feel indeed he's right _ there's other
important work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the public was Clinton's chief target, his immediate
audience included a House of Representatives that voted by narrow
majorities to impeach him on counts of perjury and obstruction of
justice. And it is possible that a majority of senators will vote
to remove him from office, although the two-thirds majority
required by the Constitution seems most unlikely. That arithmetic
comforts Clinton and provided the foundation for his ambitious
catalogue of policy prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's subtext was something much deeper than a
policy agenda for the last two years he expects to serve. He was
beginning to build a case for his historical rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The speech contained the customary recitation of the
administration's past progress and its promises for the future. But
the message, Brinkley argued, was much broader and was aimed at
those who will judge the Clinton presidency in decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that Bill Clinton, starting with the State of the
Union, will be spending the rest of his life seeking political
vindication and this was the opening salvo,'' Brinkley said.
``Whatever happens in the Senate trial, Clinton will spend his
whole life figuratively trying to scrub that scarlet `I' off his
chest and rewriting the first chapter of his political biography.''

 &HT;    President's defense opens with scathing rebuke of charges
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House opened its defense of President
Clinton in the Senate Tuesday with an unambiguous claim of
Clinton's innocence and a sharp attack on House Republican
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that
have been preferred against him. He did not commit perjury. He did
not commit obstruction of justice. He must not be removed from
office,'' White House Counsel Charles Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Shedding the contrition that has accompanied Clinton's defense
until now, Ruff labeled the two impeachment articles ``a witches'
brew'' of charges built on ``shifting sand castles of
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff held center stage in the crowded Senate chamber on an
extraordinary day in Washington, a few hours before Clinton strode
down the center aisle across the Capitol and delivered the State of
the Union address in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair-bound and, at times, speaking so softly that some
senators had trouble hearing him, Ruff was the lead-off defender on
the first of three days the Senate has set aside for Clinton's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to defend William Clinton, the man,'' Ruff
said. ``He, like all of us, will find his judges elsewhere. We are
here to defend William Clinton, the president of the United States.
. . . You are free to criticize him, to find his personal conduct
distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``But ask whether this is the moment when, for the first time in
our history, the actions of a president have so put at risk the
government the framers created that there is only one solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing argument, set for Thursday, will fall to former
Democratic Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, a political mentor of the
president and a spellbinding speaker popular among his Senate
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   A White House proposal to add Democratic members of the House
Judiciary Committee to the defense team collapsed Tuesday when some
senior Democratic seniors, including Sen. Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, objected.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, the last of the Watergate special prosecutors and a former
U.S. attorney in Washington, offered a matter-of-fact overview of
Clinton's defense that stretched 2 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have before you is nothing more than a rush to
judgment,'' Ruff said. He attempted to undermine major aspects of
the prosecution's case, beginning with efforts to use the Paula
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright ruled in April that
Jones did not make a case of harassment against Clinton, even if
everything she alleged in her lawsuit were true, Ruff pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, Wright specifically excluded from
consideration the president's relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff called the impeachment counts vague and argued that each of
the two articles improperly lumped together several charges. The
House Republicans ``have in essence treated these articles like
empty vessels to be filled with some witches' brew'' of charges, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to answer the prosecutors' contention that Clinton
should be held to the same or a higher standard than three
impeached federal judges the Senate convicted of perjury in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A higher standard is expected of federal judges than of any
other civil officer of the United States'' because judges hold
lifetime appointments, Ruff said, quoting then-Rep. Gerald Ford on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In his overview, Ruff signaled that White House lawyers will
take an aggressive position on the facts of the case, dispelling
any notion that they would simply try to assert that Clinton's
actions don't rise to the level of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Often referring to what he called ``prosecutorial
fudge-making,'' Ruff pinpointed several instances where House
prosecutors cited the most damaging testimony about the president
while ignoring or leaving out evidence that contradicted their
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating Clinton's grand jury testimony that he had
``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Lewinsky, Ruff said it was
plain that Clinton admitted having sexual contact with her. House
prosecutors quibbled, he argued, only with Clinton's testimony that
the contact was on ``certain occasions,'' while Lewinsky said they
met 11 times.
</P>
<P>
   On the claim of whether Clinton ordered his secretary, Betty
Currie, to retrieve gifts from Lewinsky _ central to the
obstruction of justice charge _ Ruff noted that both Clinton and
Currie testified that the president never discussed retrieving the
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no evidence that that discussion ever
occurred,'' Ruff said. He also noted that Lewinsky repeatedly
testified that Currie showed up at her Watergate apartment at about
2 p.m. to pick up the gifts. A phone call from Currie to Lewinsky
that afternoon, which prosecutors maintain proves Currie initiated
the gift retrieval, occurred at 3:32 p.m. _ an hour and a half
after Lewinsky testified that Currie actually picked up the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this timing fit with the rest of the testimony?'' Ruff
said. ``No, it does not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff also disputed the House prosecutors' claim that Clinton
confidant Vernon Jordan intensified his efforts to secure Lewinsky
a job in New York after she became a potential witness in the Jones
sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors claimed last week that Jordan met with
Lewinsky on Dec. 11, 1997, the day the federal judge in the Jones
case ruled that testimony from Lewinsky would be relevant to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff cited a chronology, however, that showed the judge made her
ruling by conference call late in the evening of Dec. 11_ after
Jordan had met with Lewinsky and at a time when Jordan was on a
plane to Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does any of you think that you need to look Mr. Jordan in the
eye and hear his tone of voice to understand that the prosecutors
have got it wrong?'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   While part of Ruff's job was to persuade the Senate that it does
not need to hear from witnesses, at least two Republicans emerged
from the afternoon session crediting Ruff with making plain the
need for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he made a case, if anybody did, for calling Lewinsky
and Currie,'' Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska said. And Sen. Susan
Collins of Maine said she wants Jordan to testify.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors praised Ruff's presentation but disputed his
``spin'' on the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ruff is a very able and articulate advocate for the
president,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.). ``I think he
put the president's behavior in the best spin possible. The facts
and the law are against him.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most of the trial and impeachment proceedings, reaction
was split along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) said Ruff ``blew a hole as big as a
barn door'' in the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very powerful and very factual,'' said Sen. Barbara
Mikulski (D-Md.). ``I like the fact that he addressed facts, rather
than rhetoric and oratory.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were more circumspect, saying the White House has
two more days to try to rebut the charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.) said Ruff's account of the events
of Dec. 11, 1997, crucial to the allegation that Jordan helped
Lewinsky find a job in return for her silence, ``raised some
questions that now need to be answered.''
</P>
<P>
   More Democrats conceded it is likely the Senate will vote next
week to subpoena witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will change how people feel about this,''
said Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.). ``All that it will do is extend
the trial, change no one's mind and not be good for the long-term
interests of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans also have not abandoned efforts to find a
bipartisan way to end the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said several senators had explored whether they could
convict Clinton, but allow him to remain in office. The
Constitution would not permit it, he added.

CURB ON EMBRYO RESEARCH DOES NOT COVER STEM CELLS, AGENCY RULES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wis., Ark.)  (bl) 
By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federally financed researchers will soon be able to work on
human embryonic stem cells, the source cells from which the embryo
develops, as a result of a ruling Tuesday by the Department of
Health and Human Services that a congressional ban on human embryo
research does not apply to the cells.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was hailed as ``an accurate interpretation of bad
law,'' by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and
denounced by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops as a
loophole that ``violates the spirit of current law.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the department's Office of General Counsel said
that because the cells by themselves do not have the capacity to
develop into a human being, they cannot be considered embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Human embryonic stem cells, isolated for the first time in
November, are capable of developing into any of the body's cell
types and thus have great potential for repairing any damaged
tissue, such as failing heart muscles or the type of brain cells
lost in Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The many biological researchers who receive their funds from the
federal government have been unable to study human embryonic stem
cells because of a congressional ban, originating in the House,
that has been attached every year since 1995 to bills authorizing
spending for the National Institutes of Health, the principal
supporter of biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
   The ban states that no federal funds may be used for ``research
in which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or
knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death greater than that
allowed for research on fetuses in utero.'' In a statement issued
in November, Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., said human embryonic stem
cells should not be excluded from the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The embryonic stem cells described in November by Dr. James
Thomson of the University of Wisconsin were derived in from human
embryos created in surplus amounts in a fertility clinic. Deriving
the cells is legal, provided it is not done with federal funds. Dr.
Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health, said
it would still be illegal for researchers to use federal funds to
derive their own stem cells in this way. But they can now use
federal funds to work on the cells Thomson has already obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of doing amazingly interesting science is really
quite wonderful,'' Varmus said. But research cannot begin, he said,
until the NIH has drawn up guidelines to ensure that researchers do
not do prohibited research, such as generating new embryos
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who in December called for speedy
issuance of the ruling, said the decision would move researchers
closer to finding cures for many diseases. ``The government should
not issue blanket bans on medical research,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the circumstance that federally-supported scientists can now
conduct research on cells that they cannot legally derive was
seized upon by Richard Doerflinger, associate director for policy
development at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. ``They
will destroy the embryos with private funds and experiment on the
tissue with public funds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doerflinger believes that the medical benefits expected from
stem cell research could be obtained with embryonic stem cells
derived from spontaneously aborted fetuses. A pocket of embryonic
stem cells, known as embryonic germline cells, is preserved in the
fetus as a source to generate egg or sperm cells. One of the two
lines of embryonic stem cells announced last November was developed
by Dr. John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University, who obtained the
cells from aborted fetuses, but they were induced abortions, not
spontaneous ones.
</P>
<P>
   Doerflinger said that Gearhart's type of human embryonic stem
cells would be acceptable had they been obtained from spontaneously
aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement he said, ``The Clinton administration now
seeks to do indirectly what Congress has forbidden it do to
directly: Provide federal support for research in which human
embryos are created and destroyed.''

ANALYSIS: NATO THREAT TO MILOSEVIC FACES ENORMOUS OBSTACLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related KOSOVO) 
(JT) 
 By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ NATO warned the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic,
on Tuesday to stop an offensive in Kosovo or face possible air
strikes, but the alliance faces enormous obstacles to ever carrying
out such a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's commander, traveled to
Belgrade to deliver the warning, senior NATO officials in Brussels
conceded that Western policy was in disarray, now complicated by
the deployment in Kosovo of hundreds of unarmed international
monitors who would have to be removed before any bombing.
</P>
<P>
   This potential problem was evident from the moment Richard
Holbrooke negotiated a flimsy, largely oral accord last October
that briefly stopped the fighting in Kosovo without setting any
basis for a political agreement between the Serbian-dominated
Yugoslav government and ethnic Albanian insurgents in Kosovo.
Kosovo's Albanian majority has chafed at being part of Serbia since
Milosevic revoked the region's autonomy in 1989. Because the ethnic
Albanian rebels are seeking independence from Serbia, Milosevic has
considered the fighting in the province an internal matter.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement called for the deployment of 2,000 monitors under
the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. In effect, the 700 who have arrived in Kosovo are now
potential hostages, much like the U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia
between 1992 and 1995 whose presence long made NATO air threats
look hollow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to get the monitors out before we could do
anything,'' a NATO official said. ``For that, we'd have to increase
the size of our extraction force in Macedonia. All that takes time,
as Milosevic well knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced by these difficulties, NATO appears inclined to look for a
face-saving compromise with Milosevic if he is ready to step back
from the brink once again. The Serbian leader, whose 11 years in
power have coincided with wave after wave of Balkan violence, would
have to take several steps.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that Milosevic would have to rescind the
expulsion of William Walker, an American diplomat who heads the
monitoring effort known as the Kosovo Verification Mission, order
Yugoslav army troops back to their barracks in compliance with the
October accord, and allow international forensic examination of the
bodies of 45 ethnic Albanians found last week near the Kosovo
village of Racak.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has made a habit over the last decade of using
ruthless violence and then reining in his forces as Western threats
grow. He has thus spared the heartland of Serbia any destruction
while states around him were devastated.
</P>
<P>
   In this light, it is not unlikely that he will seek to calm the
situation once more and that NATO will accept renewed assurances of
good will.
</P>
<P>
   But if Milosevic is defiant, or if the United States and its
allies choose not to believe him, the pressure on the West to bring
greater coherence to its Kosovo policy will rapidly increase.
</P>
<P>
   There are several problems in securing such coherence. The first
is the tenuous, and potentially compromising, situation of the
monitors whom the Clinton administration likes to call
``verifiers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO official said, ``It's pretty clear after the
expulsion order to Walker that Milosevic wants the OSCE people
there as potential hostages, but not to do their jobs.'' Walker was
ordered out after he saw the bodies in Racak and responded with
emotion, calling the mass killing a crime against humanity carried
out by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The second difficulty is that although Joschka Fischer, the
German foreign minister, said on Tuesday that the expulsion of
Walker ``cannot be accepted,'' and Jacques Chirac, the French
president, said that the Racak massacre would lead France to
reconsider its Kosovo policy, European support for the use of NATO
force is muted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NATO officials said that several European countries
would insist that the alliance agree anew on a mandate to bomb
Kosovo. France and Germany were unhappy with the mandate the
alliance gave itself last October because it was not backed by a
clear resolution from the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The American view, however, appears to be that the October
mandate is still valid, and its threat could be made real again as
soon as aircraft are once again deployed in Italy and on aircraft
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The third problem is that the alliance has found no way of
stemming the flow of arms and money to the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the main guerrilla force fighting for independence. Ethnic
Albanians account for about 90 percent of the population of the
southeastern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has NATO found any way, after the wide-ranging Yugoslav
violence, of convincing the ethnic Albanian people of Kosovo that
their demands could be met by a political settlement rather than
through force.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, any cease-fire or truce is going to be tenuous as long
as Albanian fighters regard it as essentially meaningless. But
because Western powers allowed Milosevic to go so far in his
campaign of violence last summer, it is now arduous to convince any
Albanians of the usefulness of moderation, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the deepest quandary facing NATO is that, whatever
course it adopts _ patience, bombing, even the deployment of ground
troops _ it will not get very far without convincing ideas for a
political settlement. The most it may achieve is what was obtained
with such fanfare by the United States last October, a cease-fire
inclined at any moment to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We desperately need new ideas for a political solution,'' a
NATO official said. ``Otherwise we may be making grand statements
about peace in Europe at our 50th anniversary summit in Washington
in April while blood flows in Kosovo. But the fact is all momentum
for bringing the sides into talks has evaporated.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a year of trying to reduce the political
voltage running through Social Security and months of maneuvering
over who would put a proposal on the table first, President Clinton
stepped up on Tuesday with the outlines of a plan and was promptly
clobbered.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans attacked the plan both for its reliance on
government investment in the stock market and for its broader
message that growing federal budget surpluses should be allocated
to pressing needs other than tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan, which would keep intact Social Security's basic
structure and its guaranteed benefit payment, is clearly an opening
bid in what could still end up as a serious bipartisan effort to
insure the retirement system's long-term financial health.
</P>
<P>
   It has elements likely to have substantial appeal, including a
proposal for new savings accounts under which the government would
match a portion of the money that low- and middle-income workers
put aside for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it left many questions unanswered. The president's plan
would extend the solvency of Social Security from 2032 only to
2055, rather than to 2075, as the retirement system's accounting
rules require. Clinton did not address whether he would support tax
increases or benefit cuts to close the remaining gap or how he
would pay for other proposals he made on Tuesday to help elderly
women on Social Security or remove the earnings restrictions that
discourage many retirees from working. And he did not say what
would happen if the projected surpluses never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clearly an opening move from the left, not from the
center, as many Republicans had hoped. The plan Clinton set out
Tuesday night _ dedicating the bulk of the surplus to Social
Security, seeking higher returns for the system through government
investment, rejecting the idea of mandatory individual investment
accounts _ was precisely what liberal Democrats have been
advocating.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been asking the president to come forward with a
framework, and this is a very balanced effort,'' said Rep. Charles
Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton specifically ruled out the kinds of mandatory individual
investment accounts, financed out of payroll taxes paid by workers
and their employers, that nearly all Republicans and a few
Democrats have been pushing as the basis for a more market-oriented
Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   And the president's proposal that the government itself instead
invest $700 billion in the market in the next decade and a half was
immediately deemed unacceptable by Republicans and by big
corporations uncomfortable with the notion of having the government
as a shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   They said the government should under no circumstances own a
stake, even indirectly, in any company. As a shareholder, they
said, the federal government would be unable to resist the
temptation to use its clout for partisan or political ends in the
private sector, especially in industries like tobacco that are
constantly involved in public policy disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government-controlled investment in markets is contrary to
free enterprise, and it will open the doors to all kinds of
mischief involving government dictates, favoritism and cronyism,''
said Rep. Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the investment by the government
would be modest relative to the total size of the stock market _
almost 5 percent of the market's total value, less than half of
what state and local governments invest through their pensions
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said, the investments could be limited to index
funds that track overall market performance rather than having the
government engage in active buying and selling of individual
stocks. And the investing could be done through an independent
agency that would hire fund managers through competitive bidding
and would be insulated from political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said stocks would never exceed 15 percent
of Social Security's reserves, leaving the system far less exposed
to the risk of market downturns than pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   The plan assumes that the stock market investments would yield
an annual return of 6.75 percent, equivalent to the historical
average from 1959 to 1996 (the White House did not include the last
two years because of the market's extraordinary rise). That return
would be 3.8 percentage points higher than the average for Treasury
bonds, which is where Social Security's reserves are invested now.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal for voluntary retirement savings accounts,
which would be financed by $500 billion of the surplus over 15
years, was not technically part of his Social Security package. But
it signaled to Republicans that the White House is aware of their
desire, reiterated on Tuesday, to make certain that individual
investment accounts are a part of any deal.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the accounts is to give incentives to low- and
middle-income workers to save and invest more. They would work much
like 401(k) accounts, with the government matching deposits by each
individual based on income.
</P>
<P>
   Although they said they had not worked out the details,
administration officials said they envisioned a plan under which a
worker earning $40,000 would get a $100 grant to start an account
and then could deposit up to $600 a year. At that income level,
they said, the government might match 50 cents on every dollar
deposited, or up to $300 in a year.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the year, the worker would have $1,000 in the
account _ $400 of it from the government.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and most complex aspect of the White House plan is
its proposal to use $2 trillion of the surplus in the next decade
and a half to bolster Social Security by reducing the national
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have long argued that reducing the national debt
would reduce interest rates, stimulate investment and spur faster
economic growth, proposals to pay down the debt, which currently
totals about $5.5 trillion, of which $3.8 trillion is held by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the economic merits of debt reduction _ and they
are difficult for politicians to explain in a pithy way, especially
when it comes to Social Security _ paying down the debt has limited
political appeal because there are no immediate winners, compared
with, say, tax cuts.

FORMER SEN. BUMPERS TO AID CLINTON DEFENSE TEAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House abandoned plans Tuesday to have
House Democrats participate in the impeachment defense of President
Clinton after Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., raised strong
objections, saying it would ``set an unwise precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the senators, who are serving as both judge and jurors in
the impeachment trial, will hear from former Sen. Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark, who will try to persuade his old colleagues not to remove
Clinton from office based on the charges of perjury and obstruction
of justice filed by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers, known for his oratorical skills and straightforward
approach to legislating, opted not to run for re-election last
November. He is expected to participate in closing arguments for
Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, his former colleagues on the Republican side
seemed open to the idea of having Bumpers join the Clinton defense
team, although the announcement did take them by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why they want him there,'' said Sen. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, ``He's an extremely effective speaker, and he
obviously knows his former colleagues. They probably think he can
present an effective case. It's not a bad idea on their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, wondered if the addition of
Bumpers was appropriate under the rules of impeachment. But he said
the Senate is ``committed to seeing that the president gets a fair
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes that to give the president a fair trial ... then
it must be done,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to add Bumpers was part of a White House strategy
that was at first intended to include Democratic House members as
well. The House members were supposed to argue that partisan
politics played a role in the Republican-controlled chamber's
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But that part of the plan was killed when Byrd _ a strict
interpreter of the Constitution and Senate rules _ objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have reservations about the participation in this
impeachment trial by any current House members _ Democratic or
Republican _ who have not been officially designated as
participants by the House of Representatives,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a resolution along party lines earlier this
month appointing 13 Republicans led by Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde of Illinois to serve as the House managers, or
prosecution team, in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the committee had asked that they be allowed to
participate, not as prosecutors but as opponents of impeachment to
make the argument that censure might be a more appropriate
punishment than removing Clinton from office. But their request was
rejected by Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee member Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said it
was the ``Senate prerogative'' not to allow House Democrats to
appear. But she said Democrats who voted against impeachment
deserve to be heard in the Senate trial just as much as those who
voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Five House Democrats sided with the Republican majority to vote
for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were at least 200-plus who voted against the articles of
impeachment and I believe those voices are certainly worth
hearing,'' said Jackson Lee, who has attended every day of the
impeachment trial so far.
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to name the House Democrats it was
considering naming to its defense team. Congressional aides,
however, indicated that Reps. Tom Barrett of Wisconsin, Rick
Boucher of Virginia and John Conyers of Michigan had been
approached about making presentations.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters that
House Democrats could have provided senators with ``some valuable
insight into how we got to this point.'' He said their
presentations would have focused on how the impeachment proceedings
were carried out ``in a very partisan way and in a way that was not
fair to the president.'' &QL;

AN ACCOMPANIST STEPS TO THE FORE
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, Jan. 24) 
(David Mermelstein writes about music for The New Criterion)  
(dal) 
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a lecture before a recent lieder recital in Los
Angeles, Graham Johnson made a case for balkanizing Schubert, after
a fashion. Johnson, a piano accompanist, scholar and teacher based
in London, suggested that the six songs Schubert wrote to texts by
Heine included in the posthumous song cycle ``Schwanengesang'' be
split off and viewed as a free-standing work. The idea is vintage
Johnson, unconventional yet compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, during a talk to students at the University of
California, Irvine, Johnson suggested that Heine be seen in an
altogether new light, as a 19th-century Jackie Mason. He cited the
poet's quick wit, persecution complex and pent-up anger. It was an
iconoclastic but thought-provoking perspective, in a way
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at the Juilliard School, Johnson begins a series of
five master classes for singers and accompanists focusing on German
song. It is unfortunate that the classes are not open to the
public, for the 48-year-old Johnson has an engaging teaching
method, which marries wit with erudition.
</P>
<P>
   His attractive, intelligent pianism is another strength, and his
knowledge of song literature is vast. In any given program he is
likely to be more familiar with the songs than the singer is. His
discography as an accompanist is huge. (He has never recorded solo
repertory.) He made his first studio album in 1978, and he reckons
that his catalog numbers between 75 and 80 disks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson has accompanied such outstanding vocalists as
Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Peter Pears, Victoria de los Angeles and
Jessye Norman, his most celebrated musical relationship is with
Hyperion, a small, critically acclaimed English record label. He
made his first Hyperion disk, ``Voices of the Night,'' an album of
Schumann and Brahms lieder, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known project is Hyperion's vaunted Schubert Edition,
which began in 1987 and is expected to be completed next year. It
will comprise 37 CD's and include every known song of Schubert,
some 700 items in all. About 40 singers are attached to the
endeavor, all accompanied by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the project came abruptly, according to Ted
Perry, the founder and managing director of Hyperion. ``It was a
bold idea mooted by Graham over dinner in a Japanese restaurant and
sealed with a drink,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   What could not have been foreseen then, or even in the early
years of the venture, was its future value as a comprehensive
resource of late-20th-century Schubert interpretation. Intended to
feature only English vocalists, the project expanded to embrace
artists from the Continent and America as well.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, three generations of singers have left their mark
on Johnson's vast opus, including Janet Baker, Elly Ameling, Peter
Schreier, Brigitte Fassbaender, Lucia Popp, Thomas Allen, Felicity
Lott, Thomas Hampson, Christine Schafer, Ian Bostridge and Matthias
Goerne. Even the great baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau has been
peripherally involved, as a reader on Bostridge's ``Schone
Mullerin'' CD: a nice linkage, for Fischer-Dieskau recorded nearly
all of Schubert's songs three decades ago with the esteemed
accompanist Gerald Moore, one of Johnson's teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson likes to think of Schubert as a Shakespearean character,
meaning that the composer's works embrace a broad spectrum of
emotions and invite a wide variety of interpretations. ``Schubert
doesn't belong to any one person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to a father who played piano and
saxophone, Johnson received early training in music. ``My dad was
highly musical and my mother highly neurotic, so I'm both musical
and neurotic,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   He became an avid record collector as a young man and developed
a love for song. He was obsessed by poetry and literature and had
an interest in acting, he said, but his parents, fearing that he
would meet ``undesirable people,'' put a stop to his budding stage
career. In 1967, at 17, he journeyed to the Royal Academy of Music
in London for serious study. He wasn't cut out for a solo career,
he said, ``because that requires a narcissistic level of
self-absorption I don't have.'' Instead, he gravitated toward
chamber music and the song literature, which he found ``much more
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, the complexity of vocal music proved irresistible.
``Songs don't have one creator,'' he explained. ``They have two.
You have a melding of biographical contexts, and it's the
combination of experience that makes a song.''
</P>
<P>
   The great song composers of the 19th and 20th centuries, he
notes, were all pianists and often accompanists. Except for Carl
Loewe and Samuel Barber, none of them sang. ``When I saw Britten
play Schubert, he became Schubert,'' Johnson said. ``It was an act
of transubstantiation. The greatest thing that can be said to me
is, `You play like the composer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also happens to like singers. ``They're more lively and
controversial than violinists,'' he said, even though he considers
singers often less skilled as absolute musicians. ``They're selling
themselves, not an instrument.'' Of the singers he has actually
heard perform, his favorite remains Pears, whom he calls ``the
greatest artist I've ever heard live, and the greatest musical
influence of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing to be an accompanist, Johnson has faced his share of
prejudice, often encountering the canard that only failed soloists
play for singers. He has a quick retort: ``There has never been a
Wunderkind accompanist in the history of music. Why do you think
that is? Well, how are you going to trust them? The art of the
accompanist is a mature one and takes a whole range of
people-skills that aren't apparent in someone who is 16 or 17. We
develop late.''
</P>
<P>
   Those people-skills are something Johnson has in abundance, and
as a public speaker, he is immediately appealing and often funny.
In 1978, he narrated a 13-part radio program on Poulenc for the
BBC, and he has since been the host for a television series on the
songs of Liszt and given innumerable lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Hyler, a vocal coach and pianist on the faculty of the
University of California, Irvine, recalls that Johnson instantly
accepted her spontaneous invitation to address a class in 1981.
``He came in and gave this off-the-cuff talk,'' she said, ``but it
was so eloquent that it sounded as if he'd been giving it all his
life.'' Ms. Hyler and the accompanist she calls ``a real
Renaissance man'' became friends, and Johnson has returned twice to
Irvine. In July, he is to make his fourth visit to the campus,
giving lectures on Goethe, English song and recital programming.
</P>
<P>
   The role of teacher is one Johnson relishes, and his frequent
travels have taken him to such diverse centers of musical learning
as the Guildhall School in London and the Eastman School in
Rochester. He considers all accompanists ``repositories of
knowledge'' with a sacred duty to pass down accumulated wisdom, he
said, and regards lecturing as ``almost indivisible'' from his
concert work.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is also active as a writer. His book ``The Spanish Song
Companion'' is a basic text, and this year Oxford University Press
will publish ``A French Song Companion,'' including 160 composer
portraits by Johnson as well as 700 song translations by Richard
Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   An even greater achievement may be Johnson's booklet notes for
Hyperion. On page after page, he brings a performer's insight, a
scholar's meticulousness and a connoisseur's enthusiasm to songs by
both German and French composers. So exhaustive are his efforts
that Hyperion had to design a new jewel box just to accommodate the
bulging booklets.
</P>
<P>
   Having an affection for something and making it a mission are
not necessarily the same thing. But life and art seem fused for a
true believer like Johnson, who contends that things of value
emerge only when high standards are maintained. ``If you perceive
that the public won't want something, then they won't,'' he said of
his efforts. ``It's really a question of the idea of uplift versus
downgrading people's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has faith in what he does and what he is training others
to do, but he considers singers and accompanists mere conduits in
the grand scheme. Their job is to put before the public the best
work of others, he said. ``The composers are the important ones.
The singers may seem more significant for a brief moment, but they
go. It's the music that remains.''

 &HT;    Power could be in jeopardy with new lieutenant governor
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now that he's formally in office, Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry is expected to take his first big step soon as he announces
Senate committee assignments and chairmanships.
</P>
<P>
   Solid choices for key chairmanships would give Perry a leg up as
he continues to assume leadership of the 31-member body. But a
mistake _ or a perceived slight _ could put the freshman lieutenant
governor at odds with powerful Senate veterans.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Capitol insiders are taking a special interest in the
relationship between Perry and Waco Republican David Sibley, who's
considered one of the brightest and most powerful members of the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Much speculation has swirled around the Perry-Sibley
relationship. The two say they have no problems, but many believe
the relationship is cool at best. Many have speculated that Sibley
may be stripped of his powerful chairmanship or given a committee
with lesser responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Sibley has been chairman of the Senate Economic
Development Committee. Among other things, the panel has dealt with
deregulation of the state's telephone and electricity industries.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1997 session, Sibley headed a special interim
committee that researched deregulation of electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But if talk around the Capitol holds true, Sibley and Perry have
yet to see eye-to-eye, and Sibley's chairmanship and power could be
in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where it's coming from,'' Sibley said of the
talk.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley said he has had several meetings with Perry and believes
he has a good relationship with the new lieutenant governor. If
there is tension between the two, Sibley said he doesn't know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows (the committee assignments they will get),''
Sibley said. ``If every other senator was saying, 'He's told me
this, and he's told me that,' I'd be saying, 'I have a real
problem.' That's not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, who had a close relationship with former Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock, said every lieutenant governor has the right to surround
himself with those he trusts. For his part, Sibley believes he's
among Perry's trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fine,'' Sullivan said of Perry and Sibley. ``All of
this will be sorted out soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ken Armbrister, D-Victoria, said some of the confusion
about Perry's relationship with Sibley might have come from
suggestions that a special committee again be assigned the job of
reviewing electric deregulation bills. Sibley is expected to unveil
such a bill Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If an electric deregulation committee is formed, Sibley would
probably head it, Armbrister said. But some political observers
have said the job could go to Perry friend Sen. Troy Fraser,
R-Horseshoe Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, who sat on Sibley's interim deregulation committee, has
said he knows nothing about committee assignments and will take
whatever role he is given.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley said if he is out as chairman, he will be upset but not
angry. But any strain between Sibley and Perry would probably
affect everyone in the close-knit Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, fourth-term Speaker Pete Laney is expected to
announce committee assignments late next week. Laney faces fewer
potential missteps but must replace seven chairmen who did not seek
re-election to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Key among those is the role of chairman of the Calendars
Committee, which decides the order and timing of bills to be
considered by the full House. A bad decision from the Calendars
Committee can put legislative proposals in deep peril.

MICROSOFT'S 75% EARNINGS GAIN IN SECOND QUARTER FAR EXCEEDS
PROJECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST)

 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Strong shipments of personal computers strengthened
the second-quarter financial results of Microsoft Corp., which on
Tuesday reported a 75 percent gain in earnings that far exceeded
the most optimistic Wall Street projections.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the leading maker of personal computer software
remained cautious in their outlook going forward, citing concerns
about the uncertainty of corporate spending on solutions to the
Year 2000 computer clock problem, as well as the continued
financial crises in many markets.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reported results after the stock market had closed. In
anticipation of a strong quarter, Microsoft shares gained $5.875 to
close at $155.625, in NASDAQ trading. The good news sent Microsoft
shares up further in after-hours trading, where they traded as high
as $163.25.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Microsoft's financial performance eclipsed worries
about the effects of the Department of Justice's antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was classic Microsoft: blow the numbers out and then tell
everybody why you won't do it again this quarter,'' said Rick
Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. ``The second half of
calendar 1999 they didn't say anything about because they really
don't know,'' he said. ``That's the tougher call.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have grown accustomed to Microsoft's pattern of greatly
exceeding their quarterly estimates, only to have the company's
executives paint a sobering outlook based on perceived threats to
its continued prosperity. Those executives attributed the second
quarter's strong performance to what was for some people an
unexpected surge in personal computer sales, which in turn drove
sales of the Windows 98 and Windows NT operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports of the death of the PC turned out to be greatly
exaggerated,'' Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer,
said in a conference call with securities analysts. He noted that
last October, when many industry observers predicted a slowdown,
Microsoft, rather than painting its usual gloom, forecast strong
growth. ``However, results also spiked due in part to demand caused
by year 2000 concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain guarded about growth in 1999,'' Maffei said. In the
third quarter, he said, it seems likely that revenue will decline
by at least $300 million from the second quarter. Although
Microsoft's operating earnings will be up 25 percent year over
year, and analysts' current estimates are two or three cents short,
Maffei said earnings will be down compared to the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his guidance,'' Sherlund said. ``Whether we want to
follow it is another question. They certainly are steering the
Street toward slower growth.''
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Microsoft reported earnings of
$1.98 billion, or 73 cents per diluted share, up 75 percent from
$1.13 billion, or 42 cents a share, in the comparable period a year
ago. Revenues rose 38 percent to $4.94 billion, over the $3.59
billion reported in the second quarter of fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Microsoft to earn 59 cents a share,
according to First Call.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unearned revenue, the portion of sales Microsoft sets aside to
reflect the long-term deployment of many of its products, grew to
$3.37 billion, up from $3.13 billion in the first fiscal quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On a cautionary note, Maffei said conditions in Asia, Latin
America and Russia remain tough, and the company does not see a
timely end to the strife in those markets. ``We're talking about a
whole segment of the globe,'' he said. ``It's a strange situation.
The developing countries are growing slowest, while the mature
markets, like the U.S., are growing fastest,'' he said. ``Obviously
it can't continue, but we don't see how it will end.''

   Bergman Reconsiders
</P>
<P>
   Ingmar Bergman, who said recently that ``only an irresistible
combination of play and actors could make me reconsider my
retirement,'' has reconsidered. Plans call for Bergman, 80, whose
credits include some 50 films and 100 plays, to direct Strindberg's
``Ghost Sonata'' for presentation around the turn of the century at
the Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm. Performers are to include
Erland Josephson, a longtime Bergman favorite. ``Troloesa,'' a film
written by Bergman and directed by Liv Ullmann, is to be released
next year.

   Jan. 22 is the anniversary of the birth of George Balanchine in
1904, and the New York City Ballet will celebrate him with a world
premiere. The work, ``Walton Cello Concerto,'' to be performed at 8
p.m. at the New York State Theater on a program with dances by
Jerome Robbins and Balanchine, was created by Peter Martins, the
company's ballet master in chief. Set to the music of William
Walton, it features Alexandra Ansanelli, Miranda Weese and Damian
Woetzel.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Redux
</P>
<P>
   To many, the brief, tumultuous life of Diana, Princess of Wales,
seemed the stuff of opera. Now plans call for that life to be the
subject of a chamber opera, written for the 950th anniversary of
the city of Nuremberg, Germany. The opera, ``A Lady Di-es,'' is
being written by the composer Stefan Hippe and the author Gerhard
Falkner. It was commissioned by the municipal theater and is to
receive its premiere in March 2000. The work calls for 20 musicians
and six singers, three men and three women. The figure of the
princess never appears, but her life is related by the female
voices.
</P>
<P>
   The Skewer
</P>
<P>
   From his pen came the Republican elephant, the Democratic donkey
and the Tammany tiger. He was the foremost political cartoonist of
his day. Thomas Nast (1840-1902) was a Bavarian immigrant who
embarked at 15 on a career as an artist with Leslie's Illustrated
Magazine. He covered Garibaldi's campaign for The New York
Illustrated News and the Civil War for Harper's Weekly, where for
25 years he pilloried political corruption and cowardice, upheld
patriotism and equality, and illuminated the chasm between rich and
poor. Beginning on Jan. 23, , his gifts as an illustrator and the
impact of his work will be the subject of ``The Political Pen of
Thomas Nast,'' an exhibition through March 14 at the Brandywine
River Museum in Chadds Ford, Pa.

`THE CAPTAIN'S TIGER': EXCESS BAGGAGE ON A RITE OF PASSAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review) 
(dal) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the final scene of ``The Captain's Tiger,'' the
playwright Athol Fugard, portraying himself as a young man on a
tramp steamer in the South Pacific, stands at the edge of the stage
and disgustedly tosses the pages of his unfinished novel into the
audience. We have become his ocean, the receivers of his discarded
words, and for a moment, one's inclination may be to gather up the
sheets of paper and try to hand them back to him, if not for his
sake, then for two characters who share the stage with him
throughout this genteel and deeply personal new play, which opened
Tuesday night at the Manhattan Theater Club.
</P>
<P>
   One of the characters, with the unfortunate name of Donkeyman,
is a burly, illiterate Kenyan, a black man who, in the course of a
long sea voyage, is transfixed by Fugard _ here called the Author _
and his devotion to putting a story on paper. The African, played
by Tony Todd, is cut to the quick by the young man's heartless act:
is this not a cruel education in the wounding properties of the
written word? The other is a fixture of the Author's mind, his
mother, Betty, as an unmarried 20-year-old _ the heroine of the
novel he has destroyed. In the person of the actress Felicity
Jones, she too watches the manuscript disintegrate, along with her
son's solemn vow to tell her story.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-year-old Fugard, who has performed in several of his own
plays, among them ``Valley Song'' and the sublime ``Road to
Mecca,'' says that while he will continue to write, ``The Captain's
Tiger'' will be his final acting job on a stage. It's fitting that
his last performance takes him back to the aborted first novel that
denotes an embarcation point of sorts for his career in letters.
Subsequent treks, literarily speaking, would prove more fruitful,
even if persistently turbulent and sometimes even dangerous. Such
was to be the fate of a South African playwright who would gain
fame chronicling the heart-piercingly human toll of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue, then, of Fugard's very presence, ``The Captain's
Tiger'' is a notable event, even if the play itself is a bit of a
letdown. It founders in the effort to achieve the kind of narrative
force and effortless grace of Fugard's earlier plays. For a
seagoing tale, it's a rather stagnant enterprise, choked off in the
thin atmosphere of pretty words and worthiness. ``My job as a
writer is to make reality dramatic,'' Fugard says at one point, and
you're liable to spend much of this intermissionless
one-hour-and-45-minute play waiting for him to make good on the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Fugard has subtitled the play ``A Memoir for the Stage,'' and
that sounds right; under the languid direction of the playwright
and Susan Hilferty, ``The Captain's Tiger'' never quite sheds its
literary guise. Lovely passages abound that elucidate a writer's
interior struggles, as in the scenes in which Fugard duels with his
imaginary mother for control of her story, a battle at once
Freudian and Pirandellian. And the climactic scene when the Author
casts off his novel, the moment in which he realizes the domestic
bliss he conspires to create for his mother is an untenable
fiction, is an authoritative completion of this early leg of a
young man's journey. The moment has shock value, too: a slight
murmur rose from the spectators as the manuscript rustled to the
floor of the Theater Club's intimate Stage 2.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis here is on slight. In its depiction of the
20-year-old Fugard, filled with the optimism and arrogance of
youth, and in his relationship with a black man for whom he has
affection and condescending thoughts, ``The Captain's Tiger''
contains echoes of an earlier autobiographical work, ``Master
Harold ... and the Boys,'' the 1982 play about a white South
African teen-ager and the black men who work in his mother's cafe,
considered by many to be Fugard's masterpiece. The tidy new play,
comparative in length, is clearly reflective of both South Africa's
altered political circumstances and of a mature thinker's greater
capacity for forgiveness. But it doesn't thrive in the previous
play's big shadow. Its concerns seem as private and discrete as the
other's were far-reaching and shattering.
</P>
<P>
   With the ringing of a ship's bell, Fugard sets off on his
adventure. He's our Gower and our Pericles, serving as both elder
narrator and younger hero of the story of his shipping out in the
early 1950s as a lowly aide on the bridge _ the captain's tiger, in
nautical parlance. The journey across the Indian Ocean to the South
Seas is to free his imagination, the usual rite of passage, he
believes, for a true novelist: ``Melville, Conrad, Faulkner, Twain,
Hemingway _ they all did it: cut loose.''
</P>
<P>
   On the steamer he is befriended by Donkeyman, a term for a mate
working the engine room, who takes Fugard under his wing,
introducing him to the rituals of a sailor's life, including a
sexual initiation with a prostitute in one of the many ports of
call. But while the Author becomes a significant factor in the life
of Donkeyman, who despite a primitive grasp of English is
spellbound by Fugard and his novel, the Kenyan is never really more
than agreeable company for the younger man. Fugard's character is
much more committed to the task of conjuring his mother as a
beautiful young woman, a fantasy figure with whom he converses
throughout the play, one 20-year-old to another. The whiff of a
forbidden intimacy lingers.
</P>
<P>
   The three sides of the triangle established, Fugard gives
himself an arduous challenge: dramatizing the act of novel writing.
The loud, slow ticking of a clock always seems to pound in one's
head when a writer begins to write about writing, and never more so
than when writing for the stage. As malevolent plot devices go, a
sneering villain is always preferable to, say, writer's block. And
though Fugard finds useful counterpoints in the mother figure's and
Donkeyman's attitudes toward him and his work _ his rejection of
the novel is a kind of spitting in the face of the Donkeyman,
another echo of ``Master Harold'' _ the issues he explores might be
digested more appreciatively by readers than by viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Todd and Ms. Jones are mild presences here; neither makes the
ebullient impact of, for instance, Lisa Gay Hamilton in ``Valley
Song,'' although neither of their characters is quite the life
force Ms. Hamilton represented in Fugard's last play, staged at the
Manhattan Theater Club three seasons ago. In the front-and-center
role, Fugard is mellow, if not particularly compelling; his best
performance remains his film work as Jan Christiaan Smuts, the
South African officer who matched wits with Ben Kingsley in
``Gandhi.'' Cast against moral type, he delivered a portrayal in
ironic layers, a complexity that eludes him on the tiring voyage of
``The Captain's Tiger,'' an excursion that takes a lot longer than
is absolutely necessary.

DUNNE, LARGENT RESPOND TO CLINTON WITH TALK OF TAX CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to show that Republicans are ``not the
enemy,'' Reps. Jennifer Dunn and Steve Largent smiled, chatted, and
told the nation about their families.
</P>
<P>
   But they also honed in on specific policy differences between
their vision and that of President Clinton. Minutes after Clinton
declared his opposition to major tax cuts Tuesday night, Dunn
proposed a 10 percent across-the-board cut in the nation's tax
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, a Bellevue resident, and Largent, a former Seattle Seahawk
who now represents part of Oklahoma, were given 15 minutes to
deliver the official response to President Clinton's State of the
Union address. Dunn and Largent were chosen after each cited
communication skills in their unsuccessful bids last fall to oust
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The pair talked of issues _ Dunn spoke of the importance of
reforming Social Security and cutting taxes and Largent spoke of
education and national security _ in an attempt to reassure the
public that Congress can still legislate even while conducting an
impeachment trial of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are disturbing and controversial times in our nation's
capital,'' Dunn said. But ``our country is not in crisis. There are
no tanks in the streets. ... No matter what the outcome of the
president's situation, life in America will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, a longtime advocate of tax cuts, cited the story of Robert
and Shirley Allan of North Bend, who were prevented from filing a
joint return when the IRS falsely declared that Shirley was dead.
Saying that the tax system is out of touch with the needs of
American families, Dunn called not only for the across-the-board
tax cut, but also for a reduction of estate taxes, and elimination
of the so-called marriage penalty, in which some married couples
filing jointly pay higher taxes than if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the president for not offering a specific plan to
reform Social Security, Dunn proposed allowing Americans ``to
invest some of their Social Security dollars in personal retirement
accounts.'' She did not endorse any of a variety of proposals
floated by members of Congress, each of which would allow workers
to invest some portion of their future retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   Largent, who is popular with Christian conservatives, went
further than Dunn in appealing to the party's right wing. He called
for abolishing the current tax code, building a new missile defense
system for the United States and upholding ``the sanctity of life
amidst the tragedies of abortion, euthanasia, and assisted
suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent alluded to Clinton's troubles, calling for
``reconciliation'' in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn and Largent also tried to bring a more personal touch to
their speeches _ Dunn talked of being a divorced mother of two
sons, while Largent spoke of growing up in a broken family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a single mother since my boys were little _ 6 and
8,'' Dunn said. ``My life in those days was taken up with making
ends meet, trying to get to two soccer games at the same time on
two different fields, worrying about dropping the boys off early at
school in order to get to work on time. I know how that knot in the
pit of your stomach feels. I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent made a similar effort to connect with Americans, saying
``Prior to 1994, my wife and I were not political. We were like
most families _raising four kids, hustling from one school or
sports event to another, our car littered by fast-food wrappers and
French fries.''
</P>
<P>
   They delivered their speeches from a balcony in the Cannon House
Office Building with the Capitol dome illuminated behind them. The
pair had wanted to do the speech from the foot of the Lincoln
Memorial, but decided the risk of inclement weather was too great.
</P>
<P>
   They relied on Michael Deaver, a former adviser to President
Reagan, for advice about how to sit, what to wear. But the content
of the speech was largely under their own control.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before the speech what she wanted people to conclude from
her remarks, Dunn said ``They should take a second look _ we're not
the enemy, we're really their friends. We're normal people _ we're
just two people, and we want to open the door to others.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans' ravenous appetite for stocks helped brokerage firms
recover from their autumn faint, but Wall Street is still not
generating profits the way it did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Bear Stearns Cos., and Paine Webber Group
reported profits for the final quarter of 1998 that fell short of
levels a year ago but beat predictions by market analysts. The
Charles Schwab Corp., the discount broker that has embraced the
Internet more than most of its rivals, posted record profits for
the fourth quarter and for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' love affair with stocks, which powered the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Index to a 20 percent gain in the fourth quarter, fueled
a recovery in earnings for the big brokerage houses. All recorded
new high-water marks in the amount of money they manage for clients
and earned hefty income processing stock transactions. But most
continue to suffer from weak bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative sentiment of September and October was not borne
out by the facts,'' said Michael Holland, a money manager for
Holland &AMP; Co. and an investor in brokerage firms. ``The banking
business was hurt, but most of the businesses have now swung back
and people are pleasantly surprised by the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, Schwab and Paine Webber all had sharp rises in what
they consider to be their holy grail: assets under management. Such
funds earn steady fees for the brokerage houses. The amount of
money that Merrill manages on behalf of clients surpassed the
half-trillion dollar mark in the quarter, led by increases in money
it has gathered in Japan and Europe. Paine Webber and Schwab also
had big gains.
</P>
<P>
   But the year overall was still a tough one for Merrill. Long
considered the largest, most diversified and most international of
the big Wall Street firms, Merrill saw its profits from operations
fall 20 percent for the year, a weaker performance than its top
rivals Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. The
collapse in bond markets worldwide after Russia defaulted on its
debt in August hit Merrill especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said it earned $359 million, or 86 cents a share, down
23 percent from $469 million, or $1.15 a share, in the same period
of 1997. The results beat analysts' expectations of 69 cents a
share. For the year, Merrill said profit from operations fell 20
percent to $1.6 billion. Including charges taken for job cuts in
the third quarter and other one-time adjustments, the company
earned $1.3 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a heavy bump in the third quarter, but we repositioned
ourselves and had real improvement in the fourth quarter,'' said E.
Stanley O'Neal, Merrill's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill's profits make for an unflattering comparison with
Morgan Stanley. Morgan has a similar line of businesses, but posted
record earnings for the fourth quarter and for the year. It lost
less money than Merrill did in the bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have responded to the diverging performance numbers,
with Morgan's stock price posting a more robust recovery from fall
lows than Merrill's. Until recently the two stocks traded at
roughly the same price. But Morgan finished Tuesday at $84.875 and
Merrill closed at $71.125, down $1.25 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have rotated from Merrill to Morgan based on the
perceived earnings power in a downturn,'' said Sallie Krawcheck, a
brokerage industry analyst at Sanford C. Berstein.
</P>
<P>
   Bond market troubles that pushed Merrill into the red in the
third quarter also held back into performance in the fourth.
Trading revenue for the period was $211 million for the quarter, a
66 percent decline from 1997 levels, with declines in junk bonds
and mortgage-backed securities more than offsetting a rise in
equity trading. The investment banking business also softened for
the quarter, with slower underwriting of junk bonds and stocks
countering higher fees from advising companies on mergers and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill's strongest area was asset management. Fees from
managing assets grew by almost a third to $1.05 billion.
Commissions on stock broking gained 9 percent from year-ago levels
to hit $1.42 billion, with Merrill maintaining its leadership on
Wall Street in both those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber saw a more modest decline in its fourth-quarter
performance, with net income dropping 7.6 percent to $100.4
million, or 63 cents a share, beating a 55-cents-a-share forecast.
For the full year, Paine Webber earned a record $433.6 million, or
$2.72 a share, compared with $415.4 million, or $2.56 a share, in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   As at Merrill, commissions from stock trading and fees from
asset management were the biggest growth areas in the quarter.
Commissions rose 7 percent and asset-management fees grew 21
percent. But investment banking lagged, with fees in that part of
the business dropping 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns, which has the largest stock and bond processing
business in the United States, saw its fiscal second-quarter profit
fall a less-than-expected 15 percent as gains in commission and
trading income made up for a steep drop in investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-biggest American securities firm by capital said net
income for the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to $135.9 million,
or 88 cents a basic share, from $160.2 million, or $1.11, a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The only brokerage firm to report unmitigated good results was
Schwab, which has no investment banking business to drag down the
rapid rise in retail investing. Schwab earned $106.4 million in the
fourth quarter, or 26 cents a share, beating 23 cents a share
estimates. That is nearly a 70 percent increase in earnings for the
period. For the year, Schwab earned $348.5 million, an improvement
of 29 percent over 1997.

   WASHINGTON _ The flu felled a few of them; others didn't want to
make the long trip here, since the House won't be back in session
again until February.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the congressmen absent from the State of the Union
speech on Tuesday night were actually boycotting it, protesting
that President Clinton, currently on trial in the Senate, was
forging ahead with his address as if this were any other year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most conspicuous absence was that of Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., who insisted it was not a political act. The chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee and one of 13 impeachment managers
in the Senate trial, Hyde said before leaving the Capitol on
Tuesday night that his decision was attributable to a bad back that
made it difficult for him to rise up and down in tribute, as most
audience members do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with a political statement and everything
to do with advancing age,'' said Hyde, 74. He added that he would
try to ``leap to my feet in applause in the comfort of my living
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one takes formal attendance, several Republican
politicians said beforehand that they would not attend because they
felt that the president should have postponed the address until his
trial was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is demonstrating his lack of respect for the
Congress,'' Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., and Bob Schaffer, R-Colo.,
wrote in a letter to Republican colleagues that explained why the
two congressmen were skipping the speech. ``We will not play a role
in facilitating his disrespect.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., another of the House impeachment managers,
joined their dissent, saying in a statement that it was
``inappropriate and awkward for the president to make this speech
directly to those sitting in judgment of him and those presenting
the case against him in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said that a few other Republican lawmakers
who were missing Tuesday night were also thought to be staging a
protest, but that it was impossible to determine who and how many,
because some absent Republicans were sick and others were avoiding
a long trip for a single engagement. After Tuesday night, the House
is not in session again until Feb. 2, which is an unusually long
break for this time of year.

COMING SOON: A DEVICE TO ROUTE COMMUNICATIONS ON SINGLE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a challenge to makers of traditional communications gear,
Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of Internet equipment, says it
is close to introducing a device that will allow communications
carriers to route voice, video and data traffic on a single system,
and at a fraction of current costs.
</P>
<P>
   The device, which Cisco calls a virtual switch controller, is
based on Internet technology and is meant to augment or replace
existing communications switches made by companies including
Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada and Ericsson AB of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Lucent Technologies Inc., invigorated by its recent
$20 billion deal to acquire Ascend Communications Inc., that Cisco
has identified as its main competition. And it is Lucent, North
America's No. 1 maker of traditional switching gear, that is the
main target of Cisco's new product; Cisco said Tuesday that the
virtual switch controller would give it inroads into an $8 billion
chunk of Lucent's business.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the business of companies like Lucent and Northern
Telecom is based on equipment that uses circuit-switch technology,
which gives each voice conversation its own communications lane.
Some communications experts believe that circuit-switch technology
will eventually be replaced by systems that can perform more
efficiently by breaking down communications into small pieces.
Those pieces, known as packets, can then share a common
communications pipeline, only to be reassembled into intelligible
messages at their destination. By agreeing to buy Ascend, Cisco's
closest competitor in the data communications market, Lucent took a
big step to beef up its Internet-based offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real significance is that circuit-switching is a very
limited technology and a proprietary technology,'' Donald J.
Listwin, a Cisco executive vice president who manages the company's
relationship with big communications carriers, said Tuesday in an
interview. ``This allows us to move voice over onto high-speed data
infrastructures and it's opening it up to offer competition and
innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   When phone companies that use switches from companies like
Lucent or Northern Telecom want to add new services, such as call
forwarding or Caller ID, they must often purchase that software
from the company that made the switch. Cisco says its new product,
which it intends to formally announce by the end of the quarter,
will incorporate open standards that allow carriers to buy new
software from a variety of vendors.
</P>
<P>
   All that, Cisco says, will come at a price as little as 10
percent of that charged by its older competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cisco will have to overcome the traditional providers'
deep pockets, deep reputation for reliability and deep
relationships with big communications carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of service providers, overall the thing
that's really driving them is quality of service,'' said Daniel C.
Stanzione, the president of Lucent's Bell Laboratories unit,
speaking generally about Lucent's strategic outlook. ``They want to
be able to offer reliability beyond what you currently see in
Internet switching.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanzione added that with Ascend under its belt, Lucent intended
to keep up with new technical standards and to set new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our own very very strong developments in new switching
technologies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some communications behemoths have already thrown in with
Cisco. Marty Kaplan, the chief technology officer at the Sprint
Corp., the No. 3 long-distance carrier, said Tuesday that Sprint
intended to deploy Cisco's virtual switch controller as soon as
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very efficient play that allows carriers to converge
all of their services on a single platform,'' Kaplan said, using
communications jargon for a integrated suite of technologies. ``It
would allow voice traffic over a data structure at a high degree of
reliability and at a lower cost.''

BOEING ANNOUNCES ORDERS, SELLS COMMERCIAL HELICOPTER BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. Tuesday announced eight new orders
worth about $345 million from a Central American airline for its
next generation 737-700, and also said it has sold the commercial
helicopter business that it acquired in the 1997 merger with
McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   By divesting itself of the business unit located in Mesa, Ariz.,
Boeing has said it will be better able to focus on the more
profitable military helicopters it builds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, MD Helicopters Holding Inc., an indirect
subsidiary of RDM, will buy Boeing's MD-500, MD-600N and MD
Explorer series of helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   RMD is a European-based industrial group with aerospace
activities. The company designs and builds diesel-electric
submarines and builds and repairs ships, manufactures and overhauls
military vehicles, and produces defense and aerospace products,
including landing gear and transmissions for aircraft and
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   It is a subcontractor to Boeing for landing gear and fuselage
assemblies for Boeing's Apache helicopters, which are built in
Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   No sales price was disclosed. Boeing's commercial helicopter
business has a book valve of about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sale must be approval by the Federal Trade Commission and is
expected to be completed by mid-February. The FTC previously
blocked Boeing's planned sale of the helicopter business to Bell.
</P>
<P>
   MD Helicopters said it would operate from existing Boeing
facilities at Mesa's Falcon Field Airport and will offer jobs to
Boeing employees who work on the same product lines. Eventually, MD
Helicopters plans to construct new local facilities. Boeing will
provide technical and engineering support under contract to MD
Helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   About 350 people work on the programs.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is part of a major consolidation of various operations
gained not only from the merger with McDonnell Douglas, but from
Boeing's acquisition in December 1996 of Rockwell International's
defense and space business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to continuing the legacy of the entire family
of McDonnell Douglas commercial helicopters,'' said Joep van den
Nieuwenhuyzen, chairman and chief executive officer of RDM.
</P>
<P>
   He added that RDM expects to announce orders for new sales at
the annual meeting of the Helicopter Association International in
Dallas next month.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said it delivered 36 helicopters from its commercial
product lines in 1998, up from 30 delivered in 1997. Last year's
deliveries included the first eight of 45 MD 600Ns sought by the
U.S. Border Patrol and the first four MD Explorers in its advanced
902 configuration. These aircraft were delivered to customers in
Japan and the United Kingdom. Boeing took orders for 22 helicopters
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   MD Helicopters will assume responsibility for delivery of
aircraft currently on order.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing tried to sell the MD-500 and MD-600 line to
Bell Helicopter Textron, but that sale was blocked by the Federal
Trade Commission out of customer concern that the helicopters might
be phased out. Many law enforcement agencies use the MD-500 and
MD-600 series because they have what's called NOTAR (for no tail
rotor) technology that makes them much more quiet than conventional
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine Explorer line was not included in the proposed
sale to Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will retain ownership of NOTAR technology, but MD
Helicopters will have a license to use the technology on existing
and future aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the AH-64 Apache, which is built in Mesa,
Boeing's military helicopters include the RAH-66 Comanche, CH-47
Chinook and V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, all built near Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   While Boeing sheds its light helicopter business where sales
have been weak, the company continues to see strong sales of its
next generation 737 jetliner built in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   COPA Airlines of Panama Tuesday announced an order for eight
737-700 aircraft, and said it would lease four more.
</P>
<P>
   A sale price for the order was not announced, but at the list
price for 737-700s the order is worth about $345 million.
</P>
<P>
   Deliveries of the planes are to begin in April.
</P>
<P>
   COPA plans to use the 126-passenger planes on nonstop routes
within Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted that COPA, an all-Boeing operator, is the
first airline in Central America to order the 737-700. We welcome
COPA to the growing list of Next-Generation 737 customers,'' said
Seddik Belyamani, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Group executive vice
president of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America's fleet continues to become increasingly Boeing.
We're confident these airplanes will contribute to COPA's long-term
profitable growth and reinforce its position as a market leader.''

 AT HOME TO BUY EXCITE for $7.5 BILLION IN STOCK  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a landmark merger aiming to finally deliver on the promise of
the Internet, the At Home Corp., a high-speed Internet access
provider, Tuesday said it will acquire the Excite Inc. search
engine company, for $7.5 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between the two Redwood City, Calif. companies _ the
largest Internet merger so far _ joins a provider of high-speed
communications known as ``broadband'' with a leading provider of
content on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   At Home provides Internet access through cable wires to more
than 330,000 subscribers in North America, providing Internet
access that is much faster than traditional phone lines. Excite,
which began by offering technology to search the Web, has since
become a leading gateway to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The At Home-Excite announcement came on the same day that NBC
Corp. said it would offer a new version of its Snap on-line
directory service for people who already have broadband
connections. And just last week, America Online Inc. and Bell
Atlantic Corp. said they will jointly market high-speed data
connections for consumers on the East Coast. That agreement will
help AOL market services it will gain after it completes its
purchase of Netscape Communications Corp., a merger valued at $4.2
billion when it was announced in November.
</P>
<P>
   These announcements come amid an unprecedented boom in the value
of Internet stocks, fueled by expectations that lucrative new forms
of electronic commerce are just around the corner. But the vast
majority of users still lack the wiring needed to take advantage of
long-promised offerings like video-on demand.
</P>
<P>
   Now analysts say deals like At Home's purchase of Excite may
finally indicate that the wiring may soon be in place to deliver
useful content. ``All of these broadband players have learned that
it's not enough just to have connections, they have to have
something to offer,'' said Patrick Keane, senior analyst at Jupiter
Communications LLC in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, on-line content providers like Excite lack the
funds to build out high-speed connections themselves. But combined
with access providers, they may demonstrate a potent mix of
infrastructure and programming like that of braodcast television
networks, Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Hurd, partner at Mercer Management Consulting in
Lexington, Mass. said he expects to see more such agreements
linking access and content. ``When customers come on the Internet
through a high-speed physical interface, they have to have
somewhere worthwhile to go,'' Hurd said.
</P>
<P>
   At Home will exchange 1.04 of its shares for each of Excite's
62.5 million shares, including options and warrants. Based on At
Home's closing price Tuesday of $115.375, the deal would value
Excite at $7.5 billion _ up from the announced price tag of $6.7
billion, based on Friday's close. Excite shares Tuesday jumped 47
1/2 to $110.
</P>
<P>
   At Home Corp. was formed in in 1995 by a consortium of
cable-television companies aiming to provide subscribers with the
cable modems needed to tap the Internet through existing cable
wires. These connections allow users to flash through Web pages as
quickly as server computers can deliver them, and make it easier to
ship video packets as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, At Home shareholder Cablevision Systems Corp.
plans to roll out At Home services in Braintree, Mass. this summer.
A competitor, the MediaOne Group based in Englewood, Colo., already
claims about 40,000 subscribers in the Northeastern U.S. for its
own high-speed service, developed with the Time Warner Inc.'s cable
system.
</P>
<P>
   Given their superior fiber-optic wires, many had expected the
cable-TV companies by now would control an even larger share of the
market for Internet access. But to compete, many traditional
Internet service providers, using regular phone lines, aligned
themselves with the specialized content companies, known as
``portals,'' offering Web pages tailored to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   To pitch its slower-speed dial-up connections to the Internet
for instance, AT&AMP;T Corp. struck alliances with portals like Excite,
Yahoo Inc., Infoseek Corp. and Lycos Inc. That strategy came full
circle Tuesday because At Home's controlling owner,
Tele-Communications Inc. is also in the process of being purchased
by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Janet Stone said the company would continue it
marketing agreements with Excite's search-engine competitors. But
Stone also pointed to comments by AT&AMP;T chief executive C. Michael
Armstrong that made it clear the At Home-Excite combination fits
AT&AMP;T's broader strategy of creating ``a new era of open choice and
capability for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, AT&AMP;T and At Home gain a valuable franchise in Excite,
which in December was the sixth-most popular service on the World
Wide Web, according to the MediaMetrix service in New York. That
firm found that about 30 percent of Web users visited Excite at
least once that month, even more than the popular Netscape and just
behind Lycos, Yahoo and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these services rely on advertising for the bulk of their
revenue but are beginning to offer more new services to draw more
loyal audiences, who might eventually pay to visit.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's upgraded Snap service, known as ``Cyclone,'' for instance,
will offer video clips and high-fidelity music.
</P>
<P>
   With Excite now off the market, on-line analysts also speculated
that Waltham-based Lycos might also be sold soon. Such talk drove
up Lycos shares $25 1/16 to $112 15/16 in Nasdaq trading Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Horsfall, Lycos vice-president of marketing said the company
is discussing alliances but said there are no plans to sell it
outright. With its brand name and plenty of cash on its books, he
said, ``I just don't think we're in a hurry to give up what we
think is the vibrant opportunity of the Web in exchange for a
short-term equity play.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Horsfall called the At Home-Excite deal ``very
speculative'' because it relies on the success of a single Internet
access provider just as other cable TV and telephone companies
launch broadband Internet services of their own.

WEIR(D) FITS THE BILL FOR KABC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  This is the second in an annual four-part series on the best
and worst of Los Angeles' sports media. Today: The TV
sportscasters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ Even new KABC Channel 7 sportscaster Bill Weir admits
it's a career decision that's kind of weird.
</P>
<P>
   Weir left sports-crazy Chicago to do the same thing in Los
Angeles which _ you gotta admit it _ isn't the easiest market for
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they see it in Chicago,'' said Weir, a self-admitted
wisenheimer, ``is it's like going to the Amish Country to do
technology reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many who gravitate to Hollywoodland, they have ulterior
motives.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Pepperdine grad, who auditioned to replace
former ESPN-er Craig Kilborn as the host of ``The Daily Show'' on
Comedy Central and as an off-beat reporter for ABC's ``Good Morning
America,'' left the Windy City for Southern California four months
ago because he has a plan.
</P>
<P>
   He just can't tell you about it. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement with ABC to develop his own comedy/talk show is
what eventually lured Weir out West and allowed the station to let
go of both Todd Donoho and Rick Lozano last September.
</P>
<P>
   In a somewhat awkward transition, neither Donoho nor Lozano's
contract was renewed after long runs at the station. Weir stepped
in for Donoho in midstream as host of ``Monday Night Live!'' and
has been readjusting to the California winter _ and sportscast
content _ ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chicago, it was easy _ Cubs, Bulls, Blackhawks,'' said
Weir, born in Milwaukee and basically a Midwestern kid until he was
attracted to Malibu for his college education. ``Here, I've still
got to ask the producer, `Can we lead the sportscast with
highlights from the Trojans' basketball game? We can't? OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Pepperdine with degrees in both journalism and
creative writing and did an internship with KNBC Channel 4's Fred
Roggin, which should set off the alarms right there. Weir's
intention was to end up as the smartly dressed smart-aleck TV
sportscaster that he's become today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that was the best way to goof off for a living,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Except on the way to achieving that goal, he got a taste of
ad-lib comedy and hasn't been able to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   After stops in Austin, Minn., and Green Bay, Wis., he went to
WGN in Chicago as the No. 3 sportscaster and became part of a
popular and irreverent three-hour morning newscast, much like
KTLA's ``Morning News'' show. He'd be the ad-lib guy with the mic
who'd go out to O'Hare Airport and try to start a touch football
game in the middle of a terminal.
</P>
<P>
   While other job offers were coming in, the KABC opportunity came
open, although he said he had no plans to take it. Until the
development deal was worked in.
</P>
<P>
   So if it appears he's trying out new material on the 4, 5 and 11
o'clock news during his three-minute crammed-in sports segments, he
probably is. This is a guy likely to watch ``Larry Sanders'' over
Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think this city fits my style because sports isn't life
and death here,'' said Weir. ``People see it for the entertainment
value that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone's going to get his ``South Park'' humor,
a problem someone like Keith Olbermann had at KTLA and KCBS until
he took his act nationally.
</P>
<P>
   A perceived gay-bashing reference to a clip Weir had about a guy
who set himself on fire and dived into a pool _ ``Here's a flaming
high-diver, and it has nothing to do with Greg Louganis,'' Weir
said over the tape _ caught him more flack that he expected.
</P>
<P>
   But taken out of the context of the broadcast, it looks worse on
paper than on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think in L.A. they wouldn't be as sensitive to whatever
you throw out there, but some are,'' said Weir. ``I guess it's a
way to find the instant focus group to see who's watching. People
who get it will get it, and one out of 10 will call to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be loose and unpredictable. If they know you're just
going to come out and do the scores, they have no incentive to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   So go figure taste.

BROWSERS AND BORDERS ARE ARGUED AT THE MICROSOFT TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
  (See related MICROSOFT-EARNINGS) (fb) 
 By STEVE LOHR  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the Microsoft antitrust trial, the government
spent most of Tuesday attacking the company's central defense _
that its Internet browsing software is a seamless feature of its
Windows operating system and not a stand-alone product. The
government is trying to prove that the browser and operating system
are two products, illegally bundled together mainly to stifle
competition.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft Corp.
face an uphill struggle to confirm that allegation. In a related
case, a federal appeals court ruled last June that Microsoft had
virtually unlimited freedom to include anything it wanted in its
products. The decision pointedly noted the ``undesirability of
having courts oversee product design.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current trial, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S.
District Court is not necessarily bound by the appeals court
ruling. But it does suggest that the government must make some very
convincing arguments to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department,
spent hours on Tuesday trying to show that Microsoft's position on
the issue was contradicted by the company's own internal documents
and by common sense. Using other products as examples to illustrate
his point, Boies insisted that it was possible to do what Microsoft
says is nearly impossible _ draw a boundary line in software code,
separating one product from another.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Boies said, could do the same thing with its popular
word-processing program, Word, as it did with its Internet Explorer
browser. ``But the mere fact that two programs share some software
code _ and a company can make it difficult to disentangle that
code'' _ by no means proved that they were a single product, Boise
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boies directed question after question at Microsoft's first
witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist who is the dean of
the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department lawyer noted that even Michael Dertouzos,
the director of MIT's Computer Science Laboratory _ who was
initially on Microsoft's witness list but was later dropped _ had
testified in a deposition that he considered the browser an
application program, separate from the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee held his ground, however, cautioning the court
against immersing itself too deeply in software code. ``One thing
this industry teaches is that the borders between products vary
over time as technology advances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he explained that he did not give ``any
particular weight'' to the testimony from expert witnesses that the
browser and operating system were separate products. ``Testimony as
to the way things are,'' Schmalensee said, should not be binding in
determining ``guidelines that are going to affect the evolution of
this industry'' _ a nod to the expectation that whatever the
verdict for Microsoft, the case will have a far-reaching effect on
the nation's high-technology economy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government argues that Microsoft's decisions to bundle its
browser with Windows and to place contract restrictions on personal
computer makers add up to anticompetitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing that line, Boies asked Schmalensee if Microsoft had
bundled its browser with Windows in part to increase the
distribution of its browser. ``It certainly had that effect,'' the
witness replied.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Boies asked if one purpose for the bundling was to make it
more difficult for a Microsoft rival, the Netscape Communications
Corp., to distribute its browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Schmalensee replied, ``but that would have happened
anyway. Competition would have plausibly raised Netscape's
distribution costs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition on the merits can raise rivals' costs,'' he added,
``but that says nothing about anticompetitive effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The MIT business school dean insisted that the government had
not shown any current harm to consumers from Microsoft's decision
to fold browsing software into its operating system and to give the
browser away. And in determining whether business practices are
legitimate competition or anticompetitive predation, Schmalensee
emphasized that ``the touchstone has to be ultimate impact on
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft's practices effectively
limited Netscape's access to mainstream channels of distribution
where most people obtain their browsing software _ from computer
makers who load it onto new PC's and from Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that harms consumers because it deprives them of choice,''
Boies said on Tuesday on the courthouse steps.

HOUSTON MAYOR VOWS TO RAISE CITY'S INTERNATIONAL IMAGE

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mayor Lee Brown pledged Tuesday to continue trying to
raise the city's international profile by leading trade delegations
to Asia and Africa, pursuing the 2012 Summer Olympics and
transforming Houston's airports into a global center for trade.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's former drug czar said in his State of the City
address that the airports' recently begun $1.4 billion expansion
would rival the deepening of the Houston Ship Channel in terms of
economic importance to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our airport system will be among the best in the world for air
cargo and passengers,'' Brown said at the George R. Brown
Convention Center in downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant, in part, because of the new nonstop air
service secured by Continental Airlines from Houston to Tokyo and
Sao Paulo (Brazil). The economic impact of these new services will
bring several hundred million dollars into the Houston economy each
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drop in oil prices, Brown pronounced the city's
economy healthy and poised to continue growing well into the 21st
century, largely due to the increasing diversification of industry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the signs of economic vitality, he cited a 15 percent
increase in single-family home construction here in 1998 and a 70
percent jump in construction inside the 610 Loop since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, 56,400 jobs were created locally and
Houston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau bookings increased 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Almost $2 billion in new projects are being planned, under
construction or completed, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not be long before I can walk downtown and people will
come up to me and say, `Mr. Mayor, we're from San Antonio and we
came to spend the weekend in Houston.'''
</P>
<P>
   The line drew applause from the audience, as did Brown's pledges
to put a downtown basketball/hockey arena on the ballot and
continue efforts to bring professional football back to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that Houston is financially sound, he said, adding
that general fund reserves have increased by almost $23 million. He
later conceded that the city's sales tax receipts had fallen below
budget projections, but said property tax revenues had increased.
</P>
<P>
   Brown made a number of general pledges for his second year in
office, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Increased funding for the arts. Brown has said he would like
Houston to become a destination for the arts. The current city
budget includes $6 million for the arts, $1 million more than the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Transportation 2000, a master plan for the city's
transportation for the next decade. Brown promised the plan during
his 1997 campaign, but has yet to unveil it publicly. ``Rail must
be a part of that system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ More funding for after-school programs, which Brown calls a
crime prevention initiative. City Council approved more than
$900,000 worth of after-school programs last year. Brown said he
also hopes to get state and federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   _ A leadership summit on diversity, to be convened in September
in cooperation with the National Conference for Community and
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's remarks drew their biggest applause when he
introduced six area students who achieved perfect 1600 scores on
their Scholastic Assessment Tests as an example of what young
people can accomplish. The students received a standing ovation.

   WASHINGTON _ Insisting that President Clinton ``must not be
removed from office,'' White House counsel Charles Ruff opened the
president's defense against impeachment charges on Tuesday with
sweeping denials of the accusations against Clinton and stinging
attacks on the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's arguments ranged from the facts of the case to the laws
Clinton is alleged to have broken to the constitutional
ramifications. His tone was sometimes matter-of-fact, sometimes
laced with irony, and at the end charged with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that
have been preferred against him,'' the counsel said in a bare-bones
opening, which he repeated later in a concise, vigorous
presentation. ``He did not commit perjury. He did not obstruct
justice. He must not be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   After rebutting the charges in the two articles of impeachment
in some detail, Ruff told the 100 senators sitting in judgment of
the president that they must be sure ``beyond a reasonable doubt''
to find him guilty. Even then, he added, they must ask themselves
before voting to convict whether Clinton's conduct has brought the
nation for the first time ever to ``the horrific moment in our
history when our union can be preserved only by taking the step
that the framers saw as a last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign in Ruff's 90-minute speech of the contrition
that has marked some White House responses to the president's
sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, which underlies the
impeachment debate. But neither did he attempt to justify his
client's behavior. He said he was ``not here to defend William
Clinton the man,'' and added in an aside that some of Clinton's
answers to questions about Ms. Lewinsky were ``certainly not
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the House managers, who spelled out their charges over
three days last week, Ruff was scornful and sometimes patronizing,
like a law professor lecturing inattentive students. One of their
key arguments, he said, was made of ``sealing wax and strings and
spider's webs,'' not facts or logic. Their case, he said, was built
on ``shifting sand castles of speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was deferential to the senators, as if to play upon
senators' inherent disdain for what many of them view as an unruly
lower house.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have before you,'' he said, ``is the product of
nothing more than a rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff replied directly to the lead prosecutor, Rep. Henry J.
Hyde, R-Ill., in the emotional high point of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Hyde had invoked the heroism of American fighting
men who had died on battlefields from Bunker Hill to Normandy in
his florid wrap-up speech. Ruff, who has used a wheelchair since he
contracted a mysterious polio-like virus while teaching in Liberia
from 1963 to 1965, said he had ``no personal experience with war''
and never knew quite how to respond to courtroom adversaries who
called up ``images of patriots over the centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knew one thing, he said: His father ``was on Omaha Beach
55 years ago.'' As a deeper hush enveloped the silent chamber, and
his voice broke, Ruff continued: ``If you want to know how he would
feel if he were here today, he didn't fight, no one fought, for one
side of this case or the other. He fought as all those did for our
country and our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   According to officials in the counsel's office, Ruff's father,
Carl N. Ruff, had been an infantryman who had taken part in D-day,
June 6, 1944. He died at 84 last April and is buried at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's arguments were aimed squarely at those the House managers
had made last week, and he met each one head-on. One that had
impressed some legal experts was the Republicans' contention that
since the Senate had in recent years removed judges from office for
perjury, they could not set a lower standard for presidents. Quite
the contrary, Ruff declared; judges are appointed for life, and can
be removed only through impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a president is on trial, the balance is very different,''
the counsel insisted, because voters can oust presidents at the
ballot box. ``Here you are asked, in effect, to overturn the will
of the electorate, to overturn the results of an election held two
years ago in which the American people selected the head of one of
the three coordinate branches of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff did not contend, as some defenders of Clinton have done,
that presidents can be indicted and convicted only for official
acts. He said he could conceive of private offenses that would be
impeachable, but he argued that the offenses, private or public,
must be those that ``subvert our system of government'' or cause
other kinds of deep damage to the commonweal.
</P>
<P>
   At the constitutional convention of 1787, he told the senators,
George Mason of Virginia proposed on Dec. 8 that the word
``maladministration'' be added to bribery and treason among the
impeachable offenses. But James Madison of Virginia and Gouverneur
Morris of New York objected that the word was too vague and would
mean in practice that a president sat at the pleasure of the
Senate, he said, so it was dropped and replaced by the phrase
``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' which has been the subject of
dispute ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff judged the impeachment articles ``constitutionally
defective'' _ at another point he said they were ``infected with a
constitutional infirmity'' _ because they were loosely drawn. They
bundled together multiple alleged offenses, he said, which was
unfair because it opened the door to some senators finding guilt on
one charge and others on other charges. That might add up to the
two-third needed to remove Clinton from office, even though
two-thirds of the senators did not consider him guilty of any one
violation.
</P>
<P>
   He also complained that the managers had imputed offenses to
Clinton in connection with his testimony in the Paula Corbin Jones
sexual harassment suit, which led to the uncovering of the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, even though the House
had defeated an impeachment article charging him with perjury in
that case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have treated these articles as empty vessels'' to be
filled with whatever accusations the managers chose to make, Ruff
said. He asserted that ``the managers cannot be allowed to rely on
what the Judiciary Committee thought were false statements
encompassed in a rejected Article II to flesh out the
unconstitutionally nonspecific charges of Article I.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ruff himself spoke at some length on several pivotal points.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of whether Clinton lied when he denied that he had
touched Ms. Lewinsky's breasts and genitalia _ Ruff called them
``certain parts of her body'' _ the counsel said this: ``For proof
you have only her oath against his oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the managers, said
much the same thing: ``If you believe the testimony of Monica
Lewinsky, you can't believe the president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum told the senators that if they had doubts about Ms.
Lewinsky's credibility, they should ``bring her in here and let us
examine her face to face, so you can judge her credibility for
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, who said he opposed calling witnesses, hit particularly
hard at two instances of what he called ``fudge'' by the
prosecutors, almost but not quite calling them liars or cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   One involved the hiding by Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, of
presents given by him to Ms. Lewinsky. The Republicans have long
suspected that Clinton had told Ms. Currie to go and pick them up,
and that Ms. Currie had called Ms. Lewinsky on her cell phone to
arrange it. They cited Ms. Currie's cell phone record, which showed
such a call at 3:32 p. m. on Dec. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The hiding of the presents is an element in the charge of
obstruction of justice. But there were problems, Ruff said, with
this ``epiphany.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he argued, the call had lasted a minute or less,
not enough time, he said, to arrange a meeting. More important, he
said, Ms. Lewinsky had three times testified that the pickup took
place at 2 p.m. on the 28th _ in other words, before the call in
which it was purportedly arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of the obstruction count involves the efforts of
Vernon Jordan, the Washington lawyer who is Clinton's close friend,
to get Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York. The Republicans have
suggested that that was done to buy her silence. Last week, Rep.
Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a manager, had said that the search only
began in earnest once Clinton and Jordan learned in early December
that Ms. Lewinsky was to testify in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruff showed logs indicating that Jordan met with Ms.
Lewinsky from 1:15 p.m. 1:45 p.m. on Dec. 11, after making two
calls to prospective employers that morning. Then Jordan took a
plane to Amsterdam, the counsel said, boarding a United Air Lines
flight at 5:55 p.m. at Dulles International Airport in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan Webber Wright, presiding in the Jones case, told
lawyers of her decision to permit Ms. Lewinsky's testimony towards
the end of a conference call that same day, Ruff said. But the
court's records showed that it began at 6:33 p.m and ended at 7:45
p.m., well after Jordan's flight was airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff was the only person to speak Tuesday, but three other
defense lawyers are to make the case in more detail Wednesday and
Thursday, along with former Sen. Dale Bumpers, who comes from
Clinton's home state, Arkansas.

NEW GLOBAL TRADE TALKS AMONG CLINTON'S FOREIGN GOALS
</HEADLINE>

(bl) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton called Tuesday night for a new
round of global trade negotiations later this year that would,
aides said, help promote the export of U.S. agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union message, Clinton called for broader
trade ties specifically with Central America and Africa, and said
that new international trade talks should seek to ``expand export
of services, of manufactured goods and, most of all, farm
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the president said that the administration hoped to
begin the new round of global trade talks in November, when world
trade ministers gather in Washington for a meeting of the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The new talks would come 13 years after the start of the last
major round of global free-trade negotiations, the so-called
Uruguay Round, which resulted in overall tariff cuts around the
world of more than a third. The WTO was created as a result of the
Uruguay Round.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement offering additional details on the president's
proposals, the White House said that the new trade negotiations
could ``create important new opportunities for America's
world-class farmers and ranchers, manufacturers and service
providers to increase sales in foreign markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, it said, also hoped to use the negotiations to
promote ``a more open and accountable WTO system.'' The
Geneva-based organization is often criticized by U.S. lawmakers and
economists of having infringed on U.S. sovereignty, and of having
failed to treat the United States fairly in trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The president suggested that a new trade fight was brewing with
Japan over the dramatic growth in Japanese steel exports to the
United States, a result of the collapse of the market for steel in
much of the rest of Asia over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must enforce out trade laws when imports unlawfully flood
our nation,'' Clinton said. ``I have already informed the
government of Japan that if that nation's sudden surge of steel
import is not reversed, America will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   While the president's speech dealt primarily with
domestic-policy issues, it also called for new U.S. initiatives to
end labor abuses overseas, especially when they involve children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work with the International Labor Organization on a
new initiative to lift up labor standards around the world and we
will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban
abusive child labor everywhere in the world,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the White House planned to seek an additional $40
million in the next budget for programs in developing nations to
help them establish a code of labor rights and programs for
unemployment insurance and pensions. They said the president would
seek $10 million for a separate program to improve access to
education for children now employed in workplaces that are
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he also sought to step up programs intended to help
Russia, Ukraine and other nations of the former Soviet Union
safeguard nuclear materials to keep them out of the hands of
terrorists and rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent brutal crackdown on democracy activists in
China, the president called for continued close dialogue between
Washington and Beijing. ``I say again to the American people: It is
important not to isolate China,'' he said. ``The more we bring
China into the world, the more the world will bring change and
freedom to China.''

NEW YORK LIFE TO RETAIN CORPORATE STRUCTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Life Insurance Co. will announce on
Wednesday that unlike several other industry leaders it has decided
not to change its corporate structure to enable it to issue
publicly traded shares.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the company, a mutual insurance concern formally
owned by its policyholders, had been debating the structure of the
company since this summer, when the New York Legislature rejected a
hybrid corporate form. New York Life had advocated the hybrid,
which would have permitted the sale of stock while the company
remained under the technical control of policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   The other leading advocate of the hybrid structure, the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., announced in November that it was
converting to public ownership so Bill Werfelman, a New York Life
spokesman, said the company ``felt it was important to let people
know what we were going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said they believed one reason for the decision
not to go public was that New York Life _ which, by some
calculations, has been reporting below industry returns on capital
_ was concerned it might be taken over or be forced by investors to
reorganize. Under the hybrid structure, a takeover would have been
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that a powerful, strong company like New
York Life with the cash flow it has, its market position and
distribution system would be a very interesting candidate for a
company that might want to have a strong position in the life
industry,'' said Sy Sternberg, New York Life's chief executive, in
an interview Tuesday from San Francisco where his board was
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the main reasons he recommended to the board that
the company's structure remain unchanged, and won its unanimous
endorsement in a vote Monday morning, was that he believes in the
mutual concept. That allows policyholders to receive dividends that
reduce the cost of their coverage and have a stake in the company.
He also believes that New York Life has enough cash _ at least $3
billion _ to carry out its acquisition plans.
</P>
<P>
   Other big mutual insurers that are shifting to public ownership
besides Metropolitan _ Prudential Insurance Co. and John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance, for example _ have said they are doing so to
have shares that they can use to buy other companies, thus gaining
market share and economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sternberg spoke of ``an intangible value'' in mutual
ownership, many in the insurance business say there seems to be
little practical distinction these days for policyholders between
mutual and shareholder companies. Because of competitive pressures,
they say, prices for coverage are very similar.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the industry consider it inevitable that mutual
companies shift to public ownership. And some analysts said they
believed Sternberg might simply be postponing such a change to give
himself breathing room to increase New York Life's returns, which
would lead to a higher stock price should it go public, and provide
protection against unwanted changes.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg said the company would periodically reconsider going
public, but said he had ``not concluded that eventually'' it must
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Duff &AMP; Phelps in Chicago said that New York Life had been
reporting returns below the 5.9 percent average of all mutual life
insurers. Sternberg said his company's returns had been slightly
above average. But they were still well below Duff &AMP; Phelps'
calculation of an average return of 12.5 percent for publicly held
life insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your return on capital is mediocre, it makes no sense to
convert to a shareholder-based ownership because it opens you up to
the possibility that someone will come in and buy up your stock at
a depressed price and force management changes,'' said Cathy
Seifert, an analyst for the equity research group at Standard &AMP;
Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Another prospect, she said, is that an efficient competitor
would buy the company outright, sensing a bargain in the low stock
price and expecting to transfer the efficiency of his company to
the one being acquired.
</P>
<P>
   None of the recently converted mutual companies have been taken
over. But the field of potential buyers may increase sharply.
Sternberg noted that Congress was once again considering the
elimination of Depression-era restrictions that would permit ``a
bank, a securities firm or one of the larger global companies'' to
buy an insurance company.

CLINTON LAWYER BEGINS POINT-BY-POINT DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief White House lawyer delivered a biting
rebuttal Tuesday in President Clinton's impeachment trial,
assailing the House case against the president as a ``rush to
judgment'' that was built on ``baseless'' assertions and ``shifting
sand castles of speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the near certainty of a protracted trial with witnesses,
the White House counsel, Charles F.C. Ruff, launched Clinton's
defense with a point-by-point attack on the two articles of
impeachment and the chain of events that catapulted the president's
sexual affair with Monica S. Lewinsky to the brink of a
constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a court anywhere, highest to lowest, that would
hesitate, if they were confronted with an indictment written like
these articles, to throw it out,'' Ruff said in a soft voice that
belied his message.
</P>
<P>
   With many senators straining to hear him, Ruff argued that the
13 Republicans who are presenting the House case had ``treated
these articles as empty vessels to be filled with some witches'
brew'' of flawed, discarded and ``never considered'' allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ruff's dramatic opening apparently failed to sway the
Republican-controlled Senate, which is poised, in two votes next
week, to defeat a motion to dismiss the charges and to approve a
House request to extend the trial with potential witnesses,
including Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several key swing senators in opposite parties staked
out positions Tuesday that dramatically increased the probability
of a protracted trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the House has made its threshold case,'' said
Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat who is up for reelection in
2000 and has been highly critical of the Clinton sex scandal. ``If
there was a motion to dismiss today, I would vote `no.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic leaders previously had claimed their members
were united against prolonging the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Maine Senator Susan M. Collins, a moderate Republican
who previously had deferred a decision on extending the trial, said
for the first time that she supports the House plan to call
witnesses. She cited several discrepancies that Ruff highlighted in
his 2 1/2-hour opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he made an excellent case for witnesses,'' Collins
said. ``In fact, I'm beginning to wonder whether the White House
wants witnesses. That occurred to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the developments, Senator John F. Kerry said he plans to
try to stave off a lengthy trial by filing a motion to force a
speedy vote on the articles of impeachment. Clinton is charged with
lying to a federal grand jury and obstructing justice to try to
cover up his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he hopes to force the vote next week after the House
takes up the motions for dismissal and witnesses. He called Ruff's
opening ``a very good beginning of dispelling'' the need for
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy remained among the most adamant foes
of calling witnesses, which he has said could prolong the
impeachment saga for weeks, if not months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the president has very strong arguments in his
defense,'' Kennedy said. ``The case for calling witnesses continues
to be very unpersuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   But with momentum growing for a longer trial, the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott, scheduled a meeting for Wednesday with
a small group of Republican members to develop guidelines for
calling witnesses and possibly inviting Clinton to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats declined Lott's request to participate in the talks,
saying they violate a bipartisan agreement to delay the witness
question until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, speaking from his wheelchair, appealed to the Senate to
avoid ``the very partisan way'' the impeachment proceedings
unfolded in the House, which impeached Clinton along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, 58, has used a wheelchair since he contracted a paralyzing
disease in the 1960s while teaching law in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   In a move aimed at preserving a measure of bipartisanship, the
White House Tuesday abandoned a plan to bolster its defense team
with several Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee.
The group would have included Representative John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan, the panel's highest ranking Democrat, who was one of
Clinton's most outspoken defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the White House backed off after Senator Robert C.
Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, protested that the addition of the
House Democrats would violate Senate protocal and offend some
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have concerns that such participation might set an unwise
precedent,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the House Democrats, Clinton's defense team will
continue its three-day opening Wednesday, with White House lawyers
Gregory B. Craig and Cheryl Mills delivering a more detailed
rebuttal of the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's private lawyer, David E. Kendall, will continue the
rebuttal Thursday, leading to a closing argument by former Senator
Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat who is a close ally of Clinton
but is widely respected in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bumpers, who delivered many stirring speeches in the Senate
before he retired last year, is expected to provide a dramatic
flourish in defending Clinton against the impeachment charges, even
while acknowledging the president's wrongdiong in the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruff spared little emotion in launching the defense.
Countering the lead GOP manager, Representative Henry H. Hyde, who
concluded the House case on Saturday by calling on the Senate to
convict Clinton to keep faith with the nation's war dead, Ruff
noted that his father fought at Ohama Beach on D-Day in World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't fight _ no one fought _ for one side of this case or
the other,'' Ruff said, his voice quivering. ``He fought as all
those did, for our country, our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ruff focused mostly on the circumstances that led from
Clinton's initial liaison with Lewinsky in 1995 to a criminal
investigation in 1998 by the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr,
and ultimately, to the impeachment charges last month.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation was triggered by Linda R. Tripp, a former
friend of Lewinsky, who gave the independent counsel secretly
recorded conversations with Lewinsky that allegedly provided
evidence that Clinton had conspired to thwart a sexual harassment
lawsuit filed by Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said Starr permitted the ``ubiquitous'' Tripp to play an
``oddly multifaceted role'' in aiding both the Jones lawyers and
Starr's investigators in apparent violation of legal ethics.
</P>
<P>
   In his most direct hit on the House case, Ruff produced
telephone records and court documents to counter a key element of
the obstruction charge: that Clinton's friend, Vernon E. Jordan
Jr., immediately stepped up a search for Lewinsky's ``dream'' job
in New York on the day a judge in the Jones case ruled that
Lewinsky could be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said the records showed that Jordan was on a flight to
Holland at the time and could not have learned about the decision
until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a mistake on the part of the prosecution,'' Kerry
said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior House manager, Representative F. James Sensenbrenner
Jr. of Wisconsin, said Tuesday that the House team ``will have to
look at that evidence further,'' although he defended the
underlying allegation that Clinton and Jordan helped Lewinsky find
a job to keep her from turning against the president in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Republican who is
considered a key swing vote in the proceedings, described Ruff's
presentation as ``excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he raised some questions about the evidence,''
Jeffords said. ``On the other hand, there were areas of the
evidence that were not cleared up.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bipartisan schedule, senators will spend Friday and
Saturday asking questions of Clinton's lawyers and the House
managers. Many senators said Tuesday they have lists of 10 or more
questions, which they will give to the presiding officer, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, to pose to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will continue next Monday with debate over the motions
to dismiss the charges and call witnesses. The closed-door debate
is expected to spill into Tuesday, with votes that day or
Wednesday.

NATO GENERALS MAKE NO HEADWAY WITH DEFIANT YUGOSLAV LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-ASSESS) 
(pr) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two NATO generals who flew to Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
to face down the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, on the
issue of violence in Kosovo province, failed to win any of the
concessions they were seeking, Clinton administration officials
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Milosevic's continuing defiance of a cease-fire in
Kosovo, administration officials said on Tuesday that they did not
favor immediate air attacks on Serbia but that they are aware that
NATO's credibility is being put on the line by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they would be working to forge a
consensus in NATO in the coming days, but it remained unclear how
the Administration proposed to bring Milosevic into line.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark and his German colleague,
Gen. Klaus Neumann, met Milosevic for more than seven hours before
leaving Yugoslavia to return to Brussels. They were dispatched by
NATO to demand that the Yugoslav leader, whose forces killed more
than 40 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo last Friday, identify those
responsible for the mass killings and reduce the number of troops
in Kosovo to levels that were agreed on previously.
</P>
<P>
   They demanded that the Serbian government revoke the order
expelling William Walker, the senior U.S. diplomat who runs the
international monitoring mission in Kosovo, and that Serbian
officials allow the chief prosecutor for the war crimes tribunal in
the Hague, Louise Arbour, to enter Kosovo to investigate the
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with the generals, Milosevic extended by 24 hours
the 48-hour expulsion order issued on Monday against Walker.
</P>
<P>
   After the two generals briefed administration officials about
their meeting on Tuesday, the State Department spokesman, James
Rubin, said, `Initial reports are not encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been consulting with
the Administration's special envoy to the Balkans, Richard
Holbrooke, on how to proceed with Milosevic. Holbrooke, who was the
broker of the cease-fire agreement with the Yugoslav leader last
fall, is working from his New York apartment, keeping abreast of
events in Serbia hour by hour.
</P>
<P>
   While the talks went on in Belgrade, the fighting continued in
the village of Racak, where the bodies were found on Friday. One
police officer was reported killed and two wounded in the fighting
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his session with the generals, Milosevic insisted that his
troops were reacting to provocations by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
a Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night the state-run media in Belgrade issued a
statement quoting Milosevic as saying, ``The fight against
terrorists could not be described as an attack on civilians, and
our army and police are acting wholly in line with the law and the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made a brief mention of Kosovo in his State of
the Union address Tuesday night, saying that the administration was
working with its NATO allies to halt the repression by the Serbian
government and to give the people of Kosovo the ``self-government
they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has long held that he was justified in ordering
military action in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, where an ethnic
Albanian guerrilla movement backed by the majority Albanian
population is seeking independence.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Clinton administration nor its NATO allies support
independence of Kosovo but favor a form of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the 700 unarmed international monitors, many of them
retired police officers and soldiers dressed in civilian clothes,
are taking extra security precautions since the massacre and the
shooting last Friday of two monitors, who escaped serious injury.
They have been told by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is overseeing their operations, to
ride in two-vehicle convoys. The new security arrangements severely
curtail the effectiveness of the monitors by reducing the area of
Kosovo that they can cover.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the security restrictions, the monitors were
frustrated by what they could accomplish. Last Friday, when Serbian
forces entered Racak, troops blocked the monitors from driving into
the village. They were able to enter only after the killing was
over.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the monitors also complicates the issue of
airstrikes. Because of fears they would be taken hostage as
bargaining chips, the monitors would have to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   At an emergency meeting called on the Kosovo crisis on Sunday,
the NATO ambassadors showed no interest in reactivating an order
authorizing airstrikes against Serbia, a NATO diplomat said. ``They
didn't want to touch it,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an order authorizing strikes was in place last fall after a
unanimous vote by the 16 NATO members but was suspended when
Milosevic agreed to a cease-fire and unarmed international monitors
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear exactly how the 16 NATO ambassadors who are
scheduled to hear a report from the generals at a meeting in
Brussels on Wednesday would react to the stand-off in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that the NATO ambassadors will take little
action after hearing the generals but will wait to see what two
more visitors due to visit Milosevic on Wednesday can accomplish,
Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The current chairman of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation, Knut Vollebaek, and a Russia's first deputy foreign
minister, Aleksandr Avdeyev, are scheduled to reiterate to
Milosevic that he must withdraw his order to expel Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was told to leave Kosovo by Milosevic's regime after the
diplomat blamed Serbian forces for the massacre of the Albanian
civilians in Racak.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government kept up its barrage of angry words against Walker
on Tuesday, saying that ``Walker's presence will contribute to the
increase of terrorist acts'' by the Kosovo Liberation Army and that
the ``goal of his departure is to put an end to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Milosevic took a dislike to Walker, resenting his
frankness, officials in Belgrade said. The government emphasized
its hostility to Walker by refusing a request from the OSCE to
allow an elite commando unit from Poland to protect Walker as he
moved around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has been in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, since the
expulsion order.

`DILBERT': CORPORATE SAVIOR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 24)  
 (af)  
 By ANDY MEISLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CULVER CITY, Calif. _ At one point during the last year, a UPN
executive summoned the creative talent behind ``Dilbert,'' a
much-awaited animated comedy series then rushing toward its January
premiere date (Monday at 8 p.m.). He had an important announcement
to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us that as far as television is concerned, all focus
group research is misleading,'' recalls Scott Adams, creator of the
``Dilbert'' comic strip and co-executive producer of the series.
``And then he said, `Not only is focus group data misleading; we
have data to show us it's misleading.'''
</P>
<P>
   And the first order of business of that meeting?
</P>
<P>
   ``To give us the results of the focus group testing on our
series,'' says Adams, 41, leaning back in his chair at the series'
production office.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles contentedly. Adams is a connoisseur of the indignities
and absurdities of the modern business world, an expertise fully on
display in the doings of the ur-nerd Dilbert, a cubicle-dwelling
nonentity who slaves for a nameless, heartless and comically
clueless company.
</P>
<P>
   For close to 10 years he has mined this mother lode to make his
newspaper strip one of the most popular in the world and himself a
wealthy man. A former corporate middle manager, he is now, in a
delicious turnabout, under no compunction whatsoever to respond to
any conformist instincts or market-research-generated
``creativity'' of his show's corporate parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this show we're specifically not trying to be like anything
else,'' Adams says. ``I want everybody who watches this to say: `I
couldn't have seen that story anywhere else. And the way they told
it doesn't remind me of anything else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if anyone in this process is afraid of corporate
downsizing, it is UPN. The struggling four-year-old broadcaster is
widely seen to be on the verge of eradication after a string of
hitless seasons and notable public relations fiascoes, like last
season's ``Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a very short-lived
alleged Civil War satire.
</P>
<P>
   For public consumption, network officials grit their teeth and
deny it, but it is widely believed in the industry that the success
or failure of ``Dilbert'' will be a definitive marker of UPN's life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Adams is feeling any undue pressure. ``I think the
truth of it is that UPN has some really financially stable backers,
and they have deep pockets,'' Adams says coolly. ``I think their
business model allows them to be in business for a long time, if
they choose to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be of some solace inside the head office that the main
characters in ``Dilbert'' the series are nearly identical to their
counterparts in the popular newspaper strip and drawn almost
identically.
</P>
<P>
   There is Dilbert, of course (with the voice of Daniel Stern),
whose unfashionably upcurled necktie and literally mouthless face
indicate his station in life perfectly. Dilbert's nominal pet,
Dogbert (the ``Late Night With David Letterman'' graduate Chris
Elliott), is his master's total opposite, a cynical and
triumphantly omnipotent corporate schemer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pointy-Haired Boss (Larry Miller, a sitcom veteran) is an
amoral dim bulb superbly suited to his role as ruthless
``motivator.'' Dilbert's co-worker Wally (Gordon Hunt, the director
and actor, and Helen Hunt's father) is an almost perfectly
egg-shaped drone, and his colleague Alice (Kathy Griffin of
``Suddenly Susan'') a bitter, sadly misunderstood pioneering
feminist and malcontent.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the area of plot lines and subject matter, however,
that the series will cross into mostly uncharted territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a freeing kind of experience, doing the show,'' says
Adams. ``There are things you can do on TV that you can't do in a
newspaper. There's a whole level of greater artistic freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``These days, whenever I think of an idea I go through
this calculation: If it's something you can present really quickly,
it's a daily. If it takes a little more explaining, it's a Sunday
strip. And if even that's not enough, it's a TV show.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Charles, the sitcom writer and producer (``Seinfeld,''
``Mad About You'') and ``Dilbert's'' executive producer, says:
``What `Dilbert' is really about is a logical man who's looking for
logic in an illogical world. I saw that as soon as I first saw the
strip. And I saw the potential immediately. I could see that he was
looking to say something deeper and more epic.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I first met Scott, I said to him: `What I see is an
entire universe, this microcosm that's the office. It's the entire
universe, and we can go in any direction. We can discuss any
theories and philosophies that are on our mind. It's like opening
the door entering a Gothic cathedral.' And I think when I said that
I got Scott excited.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   That excitement seems to be reflected in the first 13 episodes.
They cover subject matter like evolution, quantum mechanics (``We
have an episode where Dilbert's company produces a product that has
to be recalled because one of the side effects it creates is a
giant black hole,'' says Charles), cyberkarma (Charles: ``Dilbert
loses his knack for technology and, through a series of Rube
Goldbergian twist and turns, knocks a satellite off its course and
plunges the world into darkness'') and the value of charity.
</P>
<P>
   Charity?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. This problem bothers me personally,'' says Adams. ``What
it is is the impossibility of being good _ and also comfortable.
You can either be good or you can be comfortable. Now, most people
choose to `solve' the problem by giving 10 percent of their income
or some other number they feel comfortable with. But if there are
people literally dying because they don't give 15 percent, are they
good? They're not even a little better. So, by any measure charity
and logic can't live together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not immune to this problem,'' he says seriously. ``I
don't give 100 percent. So I'm evil. The only thing that's
different is that I walk through every day of my life thinking,
`I'm a little bit evil.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Idiosyncratic as they are, Adams' philosophical ruminations,
which lie behind much of the humor in his strip, have struck a
chord with the public. At last count, ``Dilbert'' appeared in more
than 1,900 newspapers, and several humor books and collections of
his cartoon strips have spent time on the best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Adams is now a homeowner in Blackhawk, Calif., a famously
affluent community east of San Francisco. Reared in upstate New
York, he graduated from Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y., moved to
the San Francisco Bay Area, got a job with a local bank and earned
his MBA at the University of California at Berkeley at night. A few
years later he moved to the telephone giant Pacific Bell, manning a
cubicle at the company's mammoth headquarters ``campus'' and
working mainly in a quasi-engineering capacity on computer and
Internet projects.
</P>
<P>
   He first drew the strip to help pass the time at boring staff
meetings. After reading a how-to book on newspaper cartooning, he
submitted his strip to several newspaper syndicates. One syndicate
editor wrote back suggesting he take art lessons. Another wrote
back offering him a contract. He kept his day job, for inspiration
more than anything else, drawing his strip in the morning and
commuting to work at Pacific Bell, until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the start, says Adams, he began receiving inquiries
and propositions from the vague direction of Hollywood. In 1997 he
considered an offer from 20th Century Fox Television serious enough
to accept; the result was a live-action version of ``Dilbert'' that
reached the pilot stage, was deemed deficient by all concerned and
was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he signed a contract with Columbia Tri-Star
Television, which matched him up with Charles. The project was bid
on by several networks, with the beleaguered UPN ultimately
submitting the winning bid. ``I guess, like Dilbert,'' says Dean
Valentine, UPN's president, ``Scott and Larry have an affection for
the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, affection with a safety net. Charles, whose
livelihood is certainly not hanging in the balance, is working on
several other projects.
</P>
<P>
   As for Adams, he notes that if the series fails, it probably
won't have any effect on the strip. ``Things that make it in
newspapers last 40 years,'' he says. ``The half-life of a cartoon
strip doesn't conform to anything else in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``Of course, we're talking at a point in time when
everything is upside. If we talk again in six months, I'll either
be on the cover of all the magazines as the newest, latest hit or
I'll be on a different project.''

PRACTICING OFFENSE AS THE BEST DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Based on advance copy of address.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, his lawyer
spoke softly, gently. In his State of the Union address to the
Congress, the president was expected to speak forcefully, boldly.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, he has cast his lot with the Democrats in a
process that has been bitterly partisan. In the speech, he poached
ideas from the Republicans in the hopes he can salvage a bipartisan
policy agenda from the rubble of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate chamber, temporarily transformed into a hushed
courtroom, he was on the defensive. In the House chamber, setting
for the president's annual message and a raucous rite of democracy,
he was on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   With the American political crisis about to enter its second
year, the depths of the divisions in the nation, the difficulty of
the political and legal questions it faces, and the immense
complexity of the man at the center of it all were painted in sharp
relief.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary, exhausting day of argument and oratory, the
president's legal team was setting forth the case for his survival
in the next few weeks even as the president himself was sketching
out a roadmap for political cooperation that would affect Americans
in the year 2075.
</P>
<P>
   Here was, to be sure, one of the memorable moments of the tawdry
12 months that have set Americans against Washington: an impeached
president struggling for his political life standing before the
very politicians who will determine his destiny and blithely
speaking of the bright morning of the new century, sketching the
new world they would make together.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the president's survival strategy was indistinguishable
from his policy strategy. He should continue as president, as his
lawyer, Charles F.C. Ruff, argued in the afternoon, in part because
his policies are popular and successful. Hours later, Clinton
sought to demonstrate that he could still be president, even if
impeached, even if threatened by removal, even if his moral
authority was undermined.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the simple but defiant act of
delivering his annual message blared an unmistakable message of its
own: Clinton would govern even if his opponents insisted he
couldn't, he would survive even if his rivals argued he was doomed,
he would look forward even if his detractors picked through the
muck of the past.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second year in a row, the president went over the
heads of the nation's leaders to speak to its people, putting aside
the base language of a capital consumed with scandal and reaching
for the lofty rhetorical heights of national ambition. ``This is
our moment,'' the president was expected to say. ``Let us lift our
eyes as one nation, and from the mountaintop of this American
century, look ahead to the next one _ asking God's blessing on our
endeavors and our beloved country.''
</P>
<P>
   The style was classic Clinton, forged in three decades of a
political life that, in Little Rock, Ark., as in Washington, has
been full of threats and tumult. The formula: Stick with his own
kind, the Democrats, in the elemental issues of high emotion, but
sidle to the center and embrace the ideas of his rivals, the
Republicans, in policy questions.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that formula that has allowed him to persevere, but
it is also the formula that has inflamed both his allies and his
opponents. On the day that his lawyer was trying to persuade
stubborn Republicans that the president had committed no crime and
should not be removed from office, the president used that very
same office to propose one of the chestnuts of Republican policy:
private investment of Social Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   There was enough of the Republican idea in the proposal to
inflame the old accusations of political larceny that followed the
president's offensive to balance the budget (a staple of GOP
platforms), overhaul welfare (the mantra of Republican governors),
and increase defense spending (a reliable GOP position since the
Nixon administration).
</P>
<P>
   But like many of the ideas the president has borrowed from the
Republicans over the years, its resemblance to the GOP plan was
only surface deep. The Republicans want private citizens to be able
to invest some of their Social Security taxes in the private
sector, creating their own retirement portfolios. Clinton would
invest a portion of the Social Security surplus in the private
sector, linking the fate of the signature new deal program to the
caprices of the modern markets.
</P>
<P>
   In private briefings, White House officials described the
president's agenda as the boldest one since 1993, when he proposed
an overhaul of the nation's health-care system, which accounts for
one-seventh of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   This time he offers his most audacious notion: After a year of
revelations about intimate relations with an intern, legalistic
distinctions about the definitions of ``sex'' and ``is,'' and
efforts to block an independent counsel and impeachment itself,
Bill Clinton is still president, and probably will be a year from
now, when he is to deliver his last State of the Union Address.

COMMENTARY: SEX AND BALANCES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Our newspaper banned the phrase ``split screen'' in
stories about the surreal day with the president's impeachment
defense bumping up against his State of the Union speech.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, I forgot, the editors also banned ``surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   These words have been used so often with this president that
they have lost all meaning.
</P>
<P>
   But the editors didn't ban the phrase ``split personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since Joanne Woodward vamped it up as Eve and Sally Field
atomized as Sybil has America been treated to such an entertaining
display of schiziness.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about the president's dual _ and dueling _
personalities. The good Bill who promotes solid American values
like V-chips and targeting deadbeat dads, and the bad Bill who
cavorts with interns and lies about it. Saturday Night Bill and
Sunday Morning Clinton, as Saturday Night Dick Morris puts it.
</P>
<P>
   But now the dichotomy has reached an absurd level with
Impeachment Bill and State of the Union Clinton. The president and
his doppelgaenger were side by side in Congress Tuesday, but did
not acknowledge each other's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has detached himself from the mess he caused, without
even a trace of irony. President Out-of-Control has suddenly turned
into President In-Control.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day the House managers unveiled their case of high
crimes against Impeachment Bill, State of the Union Clinton
unveiled a new crime-fighting program surrounded by police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House euphemistically dubs it ``compartmentalizing,''
and The New York Observer wrote about compartmentalization chic
among boomers juggling busy schedules.
</P>
<P>
   All this prattling about compartmentalization has got to stop.
This therapeutic alibi is a little too convenient. We are all
complicated people whose brains are divided and dispersed. Isn't
there something a little creepy about the way the president has
turned denial into a psychological ideal? He has achieved the
ultimate triangulation, separating himself from himself, and
defining himself against the image of himself painted by the House
managers who would oust him. The man is his own hypotenuse.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Impeachment Bill last week, State of the Union
Clinton treated his trial as an out-of-body experience: ``The
important thing for me is to spend as little time thinking about
that as possible and as much time working on the issues we're here
to discuss as possible. They have their job to do in the Senate and
I have mine and I intend to do it.'' (Sex and balances, you might
say.)
</P>
<P>
   In his speech last night, State of the Union Clinton once again
gave the people what they wanted. He seized the initiative on key
policies by offering a proposal on Social Security, a plan to
improve the nation's schools and a program to move more people off
welfare to work. He reminded Americans why they want him on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his usual cliffhanger: Would he hold himself
together? Would he bring it off? Would the stock market plummet?
Would Hillary move to New York? Is it just me, or is this plot line
getting stale?
</P>
<P>
   The president's ability to wall himself off from himself and
give masterful performances under incredible pressure gains him
admiration even from his foes, but finally his tour de force is a
tour de farce.
</P>
<P>
   There is something deeply troubling about the president's
inability to be one thing or to view himself whole. He refuses to
be seen except in pieces, giving unprecedented political and
spiritual meaning to the term ``separation of powers.''
</P>
<P>
   He has raised his personality disorder to a management style.
His aides and lawyers, who were in a state of denial for seven
months about Monica Lewinsky caused by the president's callous
denial, routinely talk about his presidency in Sybilesque terms.
</P>
<P>
   So we appear to be a nation of enablers, encouraging the
president to persist in his duality. When we look at him, we like
seeing double. A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll taken on the eve of the
speech showed Clinton with an impressive 69 percent job approval
rating, but a record low 24 percent view him as honest and
trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has delivered on the promise of his 1992 campaign.
We got two for the price of one.

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What's the difference between being rich and being
poor? asks a joke currently making the rounds on Wall Street.
Answer: About 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   These days, huge sums of money are made and lost on Wall Street
at unforgiving speeds. Lately, mostly lost. Many of the financial
service industry's biggest players, battered by global economic
turmoil and rapid-fire market shifts, have reported dismal earnings
for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But not Chase Manhattan. Amid the wreckage of a volatile year
that included the near-collapse of one of the country's most
esteemed hedge funds, the ouster or replacement of several
well-regarded banking executives and a broad retreat from
speculative markets overseas, Chase still raked in gobs of money.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Chase posted operating earnings of $4.02 billion for
1998, up 4.4 percent from $3.85 billion a year earlier. By
comparison, J.P. Morgan, a banking company with a storied
reputation for financial acumen, had operating earnings of only $1
billion in 1998, down 32 percent from $1.47 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Chase's performance is all the more remarkable for having
occurred in a year that tripped up other financial goliaths,
including Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs. It has
proved to be a bank adept at corraling _ at least for the time
being _ the bogyman haunting all of Wall Street: risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of risk management, not risk
avoidance,'' said Marc J. Shapiro, Chase's vice chairman for
finance and risk management. ``We have to take risks to make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``people in this organization have been through
some pretty tough times over the last 10 or 15 years, and nobody
wants to go back there.''
</P>
<P>
   While most investment and commercial banks pay lip service to
the notion of avoiding financial pratfalls by trying to assess the
risks they take, Chase appears to have done a more thorough job of
actually practicing what it preaches. Risk management is as much an
art as a science, of course, and Chase, the third-largest bank in
the country after Citigroup and BankAmerica, also benefits from the
insulation granted by its sheer size.
</P>
<P>
   For banks venturing into risky trading, size is perhaps the
ultimate safeguard, simply because no model ever anticipates every
potential catastrophe, a point driven home by the near meltdown of
Long Term Capital Management, the hedge fund once operated by some
of the smartest people in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Chase was better prepared than its global rivals to ride out the
chaos that gripped financial markets after Russia's economy
collapsed last summer _ in large part because it learned some
important lessons from trading losses it suffered about a year
earlier in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   When Chase lost about $100 million in Latin American trading in
1997, the bank had what it believed were adequate safeguards to
prevent heavy damage from errant trades or loans. The bank's risk
models were also constructed so that losses would not exceed $500
million when markets went unexpectedly haywire. But the 1997
trading debacle confronted the bank with actually losing as much as
$500 million _ a disquieting prospect that Chase's senior
management worked overtime to figure out how to avoid repeating.
</P>
<P>
   The bank scaled back its outer limit for acceptable losses to
$250 million and overhauled the way it thought about risk. Earlier,
the bank had believed that financial blowups were relatively
isolated from one another, so that economic problems in South
Korea, for example, would not affect its positions in Latin
America. That, of course, proved to be wrong, as the rest of the
world learned the last 18 months as financial cataclysms that began
in Southeast Asia leap-frogged around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Chase began ``stress-testing'' its entire trading and loan
portfolio in late 1997 to analyze how well those portfolios would
perform in unforeseen market downturns. This meant devising plots
that recreated disasters that had already occurred, like the 1987
stock market crash, disasters that might occur, like a sudden
downturn in oil prices, and other similar events. The bank's risk
managers then analyzed their impact on Chase.
</P>
<P>
   Chase now runs eight to 10 of these scenarios against the bank's
250,000 trading positions each month, also relying on the gut
instincts and experience of managers and traders to decide where
any soft spots might lurk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose money in adverse markets, you don't lose it on a
broad portfolio position,'' said Leslie Daniels Webster, head of
risk management for Chase's trading operation. ``It's only about 11
percent of the trades that are potentially difficult. That allows
us to triage our risk very effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   To get traders and loan officers to accept the new regime, Chase
also implemented an incentive package that essentially reduces
compensation if greater risks don't deliver greater returns. The
end result was a more conservative risk profile.
</P>
<P>
   So even though Chase executives were as surprised as anybody
else when Russia's currency collapsed in late August, the changes
they made helped steel the bank for the ordeal. While not
anticipating Russia as the trigger, they had already prepared a
model in which investors rushed into bonds from stocks. That left
the bank well positioned to take advantage of the ensuing panic,
despite taking a charge of $200 million largely related to Russia
and being dangerously exposed to Long Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I said to people at the time was that this was like
a final exam and everything we had been preparing for was being
tested,'' Shapiro, the vice chairman for risk, said. ``I think
where most people run into trouble is that if their natural
business doesn't give them an acceptable level of profitability,
then they're going to take risks to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Chase clearly benefited from strong foreign exchange
trading in October and the absence of a sizable equity operation
that might have suffered when stock prices plummeted and
underwriting of new shares dried up in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts remain skeptical about how much superior risk
management practices had guided Chase's performance, noting that
Morgan Stanley also turned in a bravura performance last year
without trumpeting its risk managment skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never know how much of this was purely better risk
management and how much was dumb luck,'' said Raphael Soifer, an
analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. ``Chase and Morgan Stanley
exercised good management judgment in allowing traders to scale
back before things got bad last summer. But even Morgan Stanley
admitted it wasn't risk management but just good management that
got them through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say that risk management played a crucial role in
Chase's performance last year but that the bank's size and business
mix also helped distinguish it from competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that their basic risk management skills were
vindicated here because of the quality of the stress-testing,''
said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``But risk
management is not the only explanation for their performance. I
think the mix of their businesses is equally important, and I think
they've advanced to a point where their business is less volatile
than many of their peers in banking and on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this represents a remarkable turnaround from less than a
decade ago, when most analysts had pegged Japanese banks as titans
poised to rule the financial world. Among American banks, J.P.
Morgan and Bankers Trust were regarded as the banks of the future
for their early forays into investment banking. Traditional banks
like Chase were mired in soured loans, dismissed as has-beens.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most Japanese banks are struggling for survival. J.P.
Morgan's record has been subpar. And Bankers Trust agreed to be
sold in 1998 after years of problems. In that regard, Chase's
performance is as much a measure of how much international banking
has changed in recent years as it is of how much Chase has evolved
as an institution.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps mindful of Chase's past lending problems, one senior
executive privately worried that it was ``hubris'' for the bank to
be extolling its risk managment virtues at a time when there was
still great uncertainty abroad, particularly in Brazil and the rest
of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro and other executives also acknowledged that it was
easier to stress-test trading positions because they were kept on
the books for shorter periods, whereas loans have much longer life
spans and are thus more worrisome for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to the late 1980s, when Chase mostly extended
credit to the governments of other countries, much of which went
bad, loans and other assets are now primarily made to more
creditworthy private companies in those same regions. Problem loans
in the '80s were longer-term, too. Today a far greater percentage
of Chase's emerging market assets are short term.
</P>
<P>
   While helping shelter Chase, the danger in an abundance of
short-term lending and trading is the hair-trigger mentality among
banks and other investors that can exaggerate market panics when
even faint alarms are raised about the financial positions of
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Chase is the creation of two large mergers in the 1990s _ the
marriage of Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical Bank and then the
takeover of Chase by Chemical. In the late 1980s the exposure of
all three banks in Latin America reached $26 billion, far in excess
of their combined $11.5 billion in capital. The bank's total Latin
American exposure is about $11 billion against a capital of $22
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some outside observers share Chase's confidence about its
exposure to Latin America's difficulties. While Standard &AMP; Poor's,
a major ratings agency, last week revised its outlook to negative
for Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, BankBoston and several other large
international banks with a lot of loans at risk in Brazil elsewhere
in Latin America, it conspicuously left Chase off that list, citing
the bank's ``conservative'' lending policies.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative indeed, agreed Chase executives, displaying a
confidence that comes with having successfully dodged last year's
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have significantly insulated the firm from dramatic changes
and surprises,'' said Robert S. Strong, head of risk management for
Chase's lending operation. ``We really don't keep the powder around
to blow ourselves up.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Falcons Notebook: Tight security for practices
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUWANEE, Ga. _ There was a very different look at Falcons
headquarters Tuesday. The place was nearly barren as players
enjoyed an off day _ a stark contrast to Monday, when hundreds of
fans milled about seeking autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody will be back today, as preparations begin in earnest
for Super Bowl XXXIII Jan. 31 in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It will look a lot different today, too, when it will seem like
a fortress.
</P>
<P>
   Practice has been closed to the public since training camp
ended, but when the Falcons (16-2) practice today, Thursday and
Friday, it will be closed for the first time this season to the
media as well.
</P>
<P>
   With so many reporters in Suwanee, coach Dan Reeves and his
staff are concerned reports about their practice plans might leak
out.
</P>
<P>
   Also, security personnel will multiply at least threefold, and
fans are likely to find it difficult, or even impossible, to get
autographs as Reeves seeks to reduce distractions.
</P>
<P>
   After practices the next three days, the team will be off
Saturday before leaving for Miami mid-afternoon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There was something else different on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A large sign taped to the side of the building read, ``Dan
Reeves for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, receptionist Gail Warren answered the phone, ``NFC
Champion Atlanta Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I say that, people laugh,'' said Warren, who had
the George S. Halas NFC Championship trophy sitting on her desk.
``The players can't even remember what it is they wanted to ask
when I say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity
</P>
<P>
   There's been plenty made of the fact just four Falcons _
linebacker Cornelius Bennett, free safety Eugene Robinson, wide
receiver Tony Martin, and cornerback Randy Fuller _ have played in
previous Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcon staff has plenty of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves played in two with the Dallas Cowboys, was an assistant
with Dallas for three others and was head coach of the Broncos for
three more.
</P>
<P>
   He joins Bill Parcells (Giants, Patriots) as the only head
coaches to lead two teams to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He, Mike Ditka, Sam Wyche and Tom Flores are the only four men
to play in, be an assistant in, and be a head coach in Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has not been kind to Reeves in Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   He was offensive coordinator for the Cowboys when they lost
35-31 to Pittsburgh in 1979 in Miami's Orange Bowl. He also was an
assistant when Dallas lost 21-17 to Pittsburgh in '76 in the Orange
Bowl, and was a player in the Cowboys' 16-13 loss to the Colts in
Super Bowl V in '71 in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen Falcon assistants, front-office personnel and scouts
have Super Bowl experience.
</P>
<P>
   Scout Boyd Dowler was a receiver on the Green Bay teams that won
the first two Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Remember us?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will be the ``home team'' in the Super Bowl, meaning
they'll wear their black jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   A memo from the league office, however, reminded them they would
be wearing their red jerseys. The Falcons replaced their red
jerseys with black in 1990, celebrating the 25th anniversary of the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden stars
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, several Falcon players have become hits with the
media, and NFL Films crews are roaming about gathering footage.
Most of it will be used for a commemorative videotape about the
Super Bowl winner. One crew was supposed to be at wide receiver
Terance Mathis' house Tuesday filming a segment about him and
Martin. . . . Martin, who grew up in Miami, will be the feature
subject on a local broadcast the week of the game, with footage of
him throwing a football in the yard where he grew up. . . . Martin
played in the NFL's last Super Bowl in Miami, when he had five
catches for 62 yards and a touchdown for the Chargers when San
Francisco won 49-26 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will practice at the University of Miami in Coral
Gables, about 25 miles south of Pro Player Stadium, and quarter at
the Airport Hilton and Marriott. The Broncos will practice at the
Dolphins' facility in Davie, about 12 miles northeast of Pro
Player. All practices will be closed, although one pool reporter
will be allowed at each. Security will make it virtually impossible
for fans to get close to the hotels or practice facilities. . . .
Backup quarterback Steve DeBerg, who prior to his comeback this
season had last played four games with the Dolphins in 1993,
turned, 45 Tuesday. He is the oldest player in the NFL. . . .
Running back Harold Green will turn 31 next Friday in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, Regis and Kathie Lee
</P>
<P>
   Although his wife went into labor Monday night, quarterback
Chris Chandler made his scheduled appearance on the ``Regis and
Kathie Lee'' show in New York Tuesday morning. ``(Diane) was up all
night with contractions; it's our third girl,'' Chandler told Regis
Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford. ``After this, I'm on the next
flight home.'' Chandler also discussed Reeves' recent open-heart
surgery. ``It was a shocking surprise. During those games without
him, we realized how much we missed Dan.'' Chandler said the team's
first trip to the Super Bowl was for fans who have been ``suffering
in silence all these years. They deserve this.'' Chandler then went
outside the show's Columbus Avenue studios with Philbin and Gifford
to toss the pigskin to Philbin. Philbin, who bragged that he'd
never failed to catch a ball from an NFL guest, fumbled two
attempts before catching the third. Chandler's first toss hit a car
attempting to park on the street.

FINNISH IOC MEMBER RESIGNS OVER SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Utah, Calif.) (fb) 
By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pirjo Haeggman of Finland, one of the first women selected to
the International Olympic Committee, on Tuesday became the first
IOC member to resign over fallout from the Salt Lake City
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Haeggman's resignation came on the deadline for 13 members of
the IOC to explain their actions regarding lavish gifts, favors and
services that they or family members received from the Salt Lake
Olympic bid committee for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC, has said that as
many as nine IOC members may be asked to resign this weekend at a
meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, or face expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Haeggman, 47, who competed in three Olympics as a sprinter and
finished fourth in the 400 meters at the 1976 Summer Games in
Montreal, had been linked both to the Salt Lake City scandal and to
Toronto's unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics, which were
awarded to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported last week that Haeggman's former
husband, Bjarne, had worked briefly for the Salt Lake bid committee
in conducting an environmental study. Bjarne Haeggman also worked
for the Ontario provincial natural resources ministry from January
1989 until September 1990, at the behest of the Toronto bid
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Henderson, who headed the Toronto bid, told reporters in
Canada on Monday that the committee had paid rent for Bjarne and
Pirjo Haeggman in Sault St. Marie, Ontario, but that the money was
to be repaid to the bid committee, and was not a gift or an
untoward effort to sway an IOC member's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's editions of The Toronto Globe and Mail, Henderson
said he had cleared the rent arrangement with Samaranch and that
``it was all open and above board.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois Carrard, executive director of the IOC, said Tuesday in
an interview with The Times that Samaranch had ``absolutely no
recollection'' of such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was said to be traveling home from Australia and could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Haeggman and Flor Isava-Fonseca of Venezuela became the
first two women selected as members of the IOC, which had
traditionally been a bastion of white, aristocratic men. Haeggman
denied knowing that her husband received payments from the Salt
Lake City bid committee or that their rent had been paid by the
Toronto bid committee. She said that she had been ``rash and
perhaps naive in my trust of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles, the first female vice president
of the IOC, said on Tuesday that Haegmann's resignation ``makes me
sad, but she took the honorable route as an Olympian.''
</P>
<P>
   Haeggman becomes the second IOC member to resign during a
scandal. Robert Helmick stepped down in 1991 as an IOC member and
as president of the U.S. Olympic Committee amid allegations of a
conflict of interest in representing clients connected to the
Olympics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview on Tuesday, Helmick reiterated his call for
Samaranch to resign in the wake of Henderson's comments and news
reports that Samaranch had received expensive guns from the Salt
Lake City bid committee and a samurai sword from the Nagano, Japan,
bid committee when it was seeking the 1998 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has said that he is routinely sent gifts in his role
as IOC president and that he placed them in the IOC Museum in
Lausanne, or in storage. He said that he was not held to a $150
limit on gifts, as are other IOC members, because he does not vote
on bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch symbolizes an extravagant IOC life style of private
jets and hotel suites. ``The IOC has nothing to do about sport; it
has all to do with first-class life,'' Helmick said. ``Once an IOC
member gets used to this, they become dependent on it and on the
person who provides it _ the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmick said he disagreed with those who believe that cultural
differences could largely explain the willingness of IOC members
and their families to take cash payments, tuition aid, free medical
care and other lavish gifts from the Salt Lake City bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of the Olympic Games is supposed to increase
virtue and raise you to a higher standard,'' Helmick said. ``We
have this mix of cultures, but we shouldn't take the lowest
standard. The first person who should be an example is the
president. But when the president breaks the rules and arrogantly
says they don't apply to him, it's not setting a higher standard
for these different cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has said that he will not resign. DeFrantz and Carrard
have come to his defense, pointing out that Samaranch has brought
financial solvency to the Olympic movement, has brought
professionalism to the Games, and has increased opportunities for
women and athletes from developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz said it was ``absolutely unreasonable'' to call for
Samaranch's resignation. She said she thought that he had done an
``excellent'' job and that for years he had been asking for
evidence of wrongdoing by IOC members in the bidding process, only
to be presented with innuendo instead of fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the facts now, we're acting quickly, the way it ought
to be,'' DeFrantz said. ``You can't act on rumor.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it was ``rather sad'' for Helmick to be calling for
Samaranch's resignation, adding: ``I don't quite know why he's in a
position to call for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrard said Samaranch used private jets only when necessary and
that he never requested hotel suites but felt it would be rude to
turn down hospitality offered by others.
</P>
<P>
   David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co., one of a dozen worldwide Olympic sponsors, said that
Samaranch should be given the benefit of the doubt, especially
because he appointed Dick Pound, an influential IOC member from
Montreal, to head the committee's investigation of Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had not appointed Dick Pound, who sponsors and
advertisers respect most, I wouldn't be surprised to see half the
sponsors gone,'' D'Alessandro said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro called for the IOC to set up an independent body to
scrutinize ethics and conflict-of-interest cases. He termed as
``ridiculous'' recent remarks made by Dick Ebersol, the president
of NBC Sports, that the value of Olympic competition had not been
affected by the Salt Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the public and the news media have faith in the IOC's
system of monitoring corruption allegations, ``one by one sponsors
will peel off and advertisers will greatly devalue NBC's rights,''
D'Alessandro said. NBC has agreed to pay $3.5 billion to televise
all five Winter and Summer Games between 2000 and 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC will deliver the audience, but negative public vibes will
cause advertisers not to shy away, but to run away,'' D'Alessandro
said. ``The tumbling effect in the sporting world would be
dramatic. If sponsors don't stay and advertisers drop away and the
cost of advertising drops precipitously, then NBC is in the awkward
position of having to turn around and perhaps not want to pay as
much to the IOC as it originally promised, because the product
they're buying no longer has the same glow.'' &QL;

 A Sneak Peek at WR Hambrecht's Plans to Offer IPOs Via the Net  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
It's a fascinating time for Bay Area investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   The titans who built empires on the Barbary Coast are at it
again. Montgomery Securities founder Thom Weisel has announced his
intention to build Montgomery II. Robertson Stephens co-founder
Sandy Robertson is a key player in E-Trade's plans to underwrite
securities. And now Bill Hambrecht plans to revolutionize initial
public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like watching a movie for the second time. You just
might see some things you missed the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   For his encore, Hambrecht is seemingly trying to take a higher
road with his new venture than he did with the investment bank he
left behind, Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   The financier's new firm, WR Hambrecht, is aiming to take
companies public without going through the usual institutional
channels. Namely, he plans to issue IPOs via the Internet, hoping
to create a freer market in which to offer new securities.
</P>
<P>
   But where he takes the high road is with his research
department. Hambrecht indicates on his secured Web site that he
intends to build a sell-side research group that will more
stringently honor the separation of church and state. (Sell-side
analysts provide research that their brokerages use to sell stocks
to their clients. Critics are concerned that the lines between
underwriting and research at investment banks have become
alarmingly blurred.)
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht has declined requests to be interviewed, saying
through representatives that he plans to formally unveil his
venture in the next several weeks. However, fund managers, venture
capitalists and other investors say they have been contacted by
Hambrecht's marketing agents to sell them on his rather Left Coast
concept of issuing equities over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And what they are hearing is that Hambrecht is hatching a Web
site that will conduct initial public offerings using a system
similar to the way Treasury bonds are issued. Such a system is
called a ``Dutch auction,'' in which the price of a security is
gradually lowered until it meets a responsive bid and is sold. The
Web site would feature real-time prices for the offerings.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET20 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  This approach would be a radical departure from the predetermined
pricing system currently used by underwriters. What's more, it's
different than the two-sided, or double-auction system, used by the
stock exchanges whereby buyers and sellers bid.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Hambrecht is first and foremost a venture capitalist
at heart who has thought outside of the box for much of his career.
</P>
<P>
   His calling has been to marry capital with fresh, intriguing
ideas. For example, when frustrated by the inefficiency of the
airline industry, he supported deregulation by investing in
People's Express _ an iconoclastic airline that revolutionized
commercial flying.
</P>
<P>
   So, when someone like Hambrecht makes rumblings about changing
the way investment banks approach equity research, it's worth
noting. And according to WR Hambrecht's Web site, the firm seems to
recognize that financial analysts at investment firms have become
too involved in the marketing of securities underwritten by the
investment banking side of their companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more investment banking research becomes
available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish the
good from the bad. Many of the opinions presented by traditional
investment banking analysts are influenced by their firm's need to
generate and support transactional business and to drive trading
volume. In the process, this research often loses its objectivity,
its systemic approach and its thoughtfulness,'' the site states.
</P>
<P>
   ``(WR Hambrecht) has set out to correct this by going back to
the basics. We have created a methodology that we believe gets to
the key issues that must be understood in order to make good
long-term investments,'' the site states.
</P>
<P>
   The Web page goes on to explain that the firm's methodology will
be founded on, among other things, ``unique, market sector
overviews'' using outside independent market research firms. The
firm also points out that it plans to use peer group analysis that
uses corporate executives' rankings of competing companies.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET20 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Without much detail, the Web site says WR Hambrecht will focus on
three areas of underwriting at the outset: branded consumer
products, enterprise software and Internet software and services.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Hambrecht's much-awaited sequel
will do justice to the original.

 Business Groups Adapt Lobbying Strategy  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
With one party controlling Sacramento for the first time in 16
years and a pro-labor legislative agenda looming, business groups
are honing their defense strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The California Chamber of Commerce and brethren organizations
hope that Governor Gray Davis, a self-described moderate and
pragmatist, will be true to his word and govern from the center,
``propelled not by ideology, but by common sense.'' But they are
nervous that his declared ``era of higher expectations'' could mean
less for business.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the Democrats from legislating higher wages and benefits
or more regulations, business groups say they will argue that such
moves could kill or seriously wound the Golden State's golden
goose.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber ``will be emphasizing that a strong economy is
essential to the well-being of programs that voters have said are
important to them, such as education,'' said Allan Zaremberg,
president of the state chamber, which has 11,000 members,
two-thirds of them with 50 or fewer employees. ``We cannot afford
to let the `job killer' proposals defeated or vetoed in recent
years become law.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate its point, the chamber notes that in the early
1990s, California's economy was in the dumps and that the budget
for K-12 education reached a low of $14.9 billion. With the recent
economic rebound, the state has regained all 700,000 jobs lost in
the latest recession and created another 895,000 jobs. Meanwhile,
the education budget has jumped to $23.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference last week in Sacramento, the California
chamber outlined its agenda for the state. It echoed the
mom-and-apple-pie issues that the new governor and many legislators
favor: making schools more effective and accountable, increasing
the state's water supply and investing in infrastructure and
transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
   To finance all this, business groups argue that the government
should not tinker with recently passed workers' compensation
reform, regulatory streamlining and tax incentives, or impose new
burdens on business.
</P>
<P>
   To protect what it has already won and keep from losing on a
host of proposed issues, ``we need to change our lobbying style,''
said Jeanne Cain, vice president of government affairs for the
California Chamber. ``We can no longer assume there will be a veto
at the end of the road,'' as was the case with former Republican
Governor Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Zaremberg said the chamber may whittle its 2-year-old ``job
killer'' list of bad bills to fewer than 50 a year. It also is
prepared to spend more time educating elected officials on key
issues and plans to hire independent experts from University of
California and Cal State universities to make their arguments more
persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups are taking a similar approach. ``We're looking at a
fairly modest agenda,'' said Gavin McHugh, senior vice president of
the California Manufacturers Association. He agrees that Wilson and
his predecessor, Governor George Deukmejian, both provided ``a
reliable backstop for business.'' But he remains optimistic because
Davis is a centrist who is accessible and interested in protecting
California jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Martyn Hopper, state director of the National Federation of
Independent Business, which has 34,000 California members, shares
McHugh's hopes. But he feels that ``small business is under attack;
it looks like a mostly organized labor agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some key issues that business organizations say are on
the front burner this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Minimum wage &LR; . The California chamber and most other business
groups oppose efforts to raise the minimum wage, which already is
60 cents per hour higher in California than the $5.15 federal
minimum wage. They also oppose mandating a statewide ``living
wage'' as Oakland, San Jose and Los Angeles already have done on
the local level by setting wages ranging from $8.50 to $10.75
without benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson vetoed minimum-wage bills last year, but they are likely
to be reintroduced with strong support from labor groups. Critics
contend that increased payroll costs will be passed on to
consumers, make California less competitive, cause many businesses
to cut hours or cancel business expansion plans, or even cause
firms to leave the state.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Overtime &LR; . Last January, the state aligned California's
overtime statute with every other state but Hawaii by requiring
overtime pay for all time over 40 hours in a single work week.
Legislation is being proposed to once again count overtime as
anything over eight hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents like the chamber's Zaremberg argue that the eight-hour
limit would financially penalize employers who try to accommodate
flexible schedules for workers, many of whom prefer working four
10-hour days and having three days off. It also would make it
difficult to retain national companies or get new national
companies to build facilities here.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; ``Fringe'' benefits &LR; . In recent years, business has
successfully blocked legislation ordering small businesses to
provide sick leave, &UR;  &LR; severance pay, pro-rated pay for part-time
workers, paid time off for jury duty and expanded leave under the
California Family Rights Act. Several mandated fringe-benefit
proposals passed in the latest legislative session but vetoed by
the governor are likely to be reintroduced. Business groups argue
that state-imposed benefit requirements will penalize business and
cost jobs.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Health care reform &LR; . The California Chamber endorses current
voluntary employer-provided health coverage and enhanced
cost-containment measures. It also endorses tort reform and
establishing outside panels of experts to review decisions by
health plans to help prevent problems and malpractice suits. The
National Federation of Independent Business argues that the way to
extend health benefits is to expand tax deductions for medical
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Tort reform &LR; . The chamber wants to cap punitive damage awards,
eliminate lifetime pay awards in employment litigation, base
recovery of damages in financial lawsuits on proportionate
liability, limit recovery for third-party lawsuits against insurers
and impose limits on medical malpractice payments. It also supports
greater use of alternative dispute resolution.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Independent contractors. &LR;  The chamber supports legislation
that makes state law conform with recent changes in federal law and
gives greater flexibility in hiring independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Tax reform &LR; . National Federation of Independent Business
endorses several tax cut proposals, including eliminating or
reducing the annual corporate franchise tax and the $45-a-year,
home-based-worker fee. The California Manufacturers Association
proposes letting businesses that appeal tax assessments post a bond
rather than pay the full amount in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Hazardous-waste cleanup &LR; . Rather than reinstate the 17-year
program known as state ``Superfund,'' the chamber endorses an
approach to cleanup decisions that is based on risk and supports
the idea of ``proportional'' liability rather than going after the
deep pockets.

 Microsoft's Earnings Top Expectations  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista

</P>
<P>
   Boosted by strong increased demand for personal computers,
Microsoft Corp.'s income rose 74 percent to $1.98 billion for the
second quarter, easily beating Wall Street estimates, the company
said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But the world's largest software maker also cautioned that the
rush to squash the Year 2000 bug will likely slow Microsoft's
earnings growth for the remainder of fiscal year 1999.
Third-quarter revenues could be down by $300 million alone, said
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels like the best of times, but do the worst of times
lie ahead?'' Maffei told analysts during a conference call. ``I'm
expecting a much slower growth rate, perhaps in the mid-teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reported revenues for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1998,
of $4.94 billion, a 38 percent increase from the $3.59 billion
posted for the same period the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share of 73 cents for the quarter topped the 59
cents per share estimate from analysts surveyed by First Call. Net
income was $1.13 billion, or 42 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   A 25 percent worldwide increase in shipments of PCs by
manufacturers during the quarter boosted revenue from licensing of
Microsoft products included in those machines, Maffei said.
Microsoft makes the operating systems _ Windows 98, Windows NT
Server and Windows NT workstation _ that run more than 88 percent
of all new computers sold.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft said that increase was largely due to corporations
using up their technology budgets to buy new desktop computers
before the end of the year. The company warned that this year more
technology spending will go toward warding off the Year 2000
computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been the last time they can spend on desktops,''
Maffei said. ``One of the things we fear is that with the desktop
lockdown, our peak has already come and gone.''
</P>
<P>
   However, analyst Richard G. Sherlund of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. said
Microsoft frequently downplays future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was classic Microsoft to say they had a great quarter but
then say it's not going to continue,'' Sherlund said. ``This was
clearly a terrific, terrific quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherlund also was encouraged by Microsoft's gain in enterprise
software, noting that sales of Windows NT products accounted for 22
percent of overall revenues, up from 18 percent in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In related news, networking firm 3Com Corp. announced an
alliance with Microsoft to develop new Windows networking products
that will carry voice, video and data traffic over a single line.
</P>
<P>
   By summer, Santa Clara's 3Com will open a new 25,000-square-foot
development center near Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters to
develop the new products.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MICROSOF (5820 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  3Com, like rivals Cisco Systems and Lucent Technologies, wants to
sell more equipment to telephone companies and large businesses
that want to combine voice and data on the same network.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings were announced after the market closed. Microsoft
closed at $155.63, up $5.88, a 52-week high. The shares rose
another 3.6 percent in after-market trading, to $161.38, on Reuters
Instinet.

 Some Hints On Getting Bank Loans  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Do you have any hints on how to get a bank loan? I have
a computer peripherals startup with about $100,000 in annual
revenues, but it has yet to break even and I am about maxed out on
my credit card debt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Companies that are the neediest often have the hardest
time convincing banks to lend them money.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that banks have a phobia about taking
risks. Venture capital and other equity investors who have a stake
in the future profitability of a business may be happy making money
on only seven out of 10 investments. By contrast, banks make money
charging fees and interest and need to be repaid 99.5 percent of
the time, according to Mark Horn, senior vice president of Silicon
Valley Bank's emerging technologies division.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many lenders insist that business customers have a
proven track record of repaying debts and three years of tax
returns and financial statements before they will extend them
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley Bank is a bit different. About half of its 600 or
so ``early-stage'' business clients have neither revenues nor a
product, according to Horn. But that does not mean the bank extends
an open hand any more than its competitors do.
</P>
<P>
   For a bank to take you seriously, be prepared to first present a
well-conceived business plan that discusses your product, what
market and need it addresses, the competition, your management and
background and a set of financial projections, including income
statement, balance sheet and cash-flow statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't dwell on the better mousetrap theory and how great your
product or service is,'' advises Horn. ``The real question is not
whether your product is faster, cheaper, better, newer but who
wants it and is interested in paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you can say how neat your product is, but you
will have a much better chance of nabbing a loan if you can show
how other manufacturers, strategic partners and/or retailers are
interested, too.
</P>
<P>
   Banks usually want guarantees that you can pay back your loan.
As collateral, you can pledge your bank deposits or other financial
assets, business plant and equipment, the equity in your home or
other personal assets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, banks will often loan up to 70 percent or 80
percent of the value of ``qualified accounts receivable,'' which
usually means outstanding bills less than 90 days due.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks, including Silicon Valley, also consider the
``intellectual property'' of the company seeking a loan. That means
not just patents or copyrights but intangible factors like an
ex-chairman of a high-tech company who sits on your board, a
prominent angel investor or a company that wants to license your
technology.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GROW20 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Rather than simply walking into a bank, talk to business
colleagues, your lawyer, accountant and other connections about
what banks they recommend. Check out ones that are recommended and
reportedly helpful in good and bad times.
</P>
<P>
   Banks also are likely to give you a better reception if you are
referred by a current client.
</P>
<P>
   Besides banks, the U.S. Small Business Administration is a font
of loan information and financing. You also might contact local
organizations such as Bay Area Regional Technology Alliance, Bay
Area Small Business Development Corp. and California Economic
Development Lending Initiative.

</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you recommend ways to cut down on the expense of dealing
with attorneys and preparing all the paperwork needed to run a
business?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're willing to do some reading, there are plenty of
books and software programs on running a small business. For about
$30, you can buy legal software that might be more useful than the
10 minutes of attorney time you might be able to get for the same
price.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, legal software programs can provide
background information and standard forms that should save you a
lot of time and money before you have an attorney review your plans
or documents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the major vendors are Kiplinger's Small Business
Attorney ($29.95), Quicken Business Law Partner ($29.95), Nolo
Press' Small Business Legal Pro ($79.95) and E-Z Legal Software
($17.99).
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's Small Business Attorney, developed by the Block
Financial and Kiplinger organizations ( &LR; www.blocksoft.com &LR; ),
provides 81 contract and document forms. These include job
applications, nondisclosure and executive employment agreements,
request for credit reports, sale and purchase of goods, powers of
attorney and real estate forms. Better yet, the documents can be
customized and printed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the software provides 4,000 legal definitions,
discussion of topics from intellectual property to sexual
harassment to workers' compensation, and a 26-chapter guide to
starting, financing and running a business. ``We provide a tool to
get educated and generate documents,'' said Kevin Leek, the
attorney who developed the software for Kiplinger. ``However, since
laws change and there are differences in some states, we recommend
that you have your documents and decisions reviewed by an
attorney.'`
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Legal Pro CD-ROM from Berkeley's Nolo Press
( &LR; www.nolo.com &LR; ) is more expensive than some other products. It
includes, though, more than 150 small-business documents such as
marketing worksheets, sample letters and IRS forms and the text of
six Nolo self-help books.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken Business Law Partner ( &LR; www.parsonstech.com &LR; ) offers more
than 100 legal documents, government forms and worksheets from real
estate forms and business agreements to requests for credit and
consumer reports. The software also interviews you about your
situation and advises which documents might best suit your needs.

 BofA's Profits Fall 4.8%  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The new BankAmerica reported a 4.8 percent drop in fourth-quarter
operating earnings yesterday as it recorded more losses from its
relationship with D.E. Shaw, the New York investment firm that
managed a speculative bond portfolio for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the North Carolina bank, which bought San
Francisco's BankAmerica in September and took its name, said it
expects to cut 23,000 jobs in the next few years through
acquisition-related layoffs, normal turnover and sales of business
units.
</P>
<P>
   That's slightly higher than the 10 percent staff cut chief
executive Hugh McColl estimated in a meeting with Chronicle
reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   BofA, the nation's second-largest bank, said it posted operating
earnings of $1.6 billion (91 cents a diluted share), for the three
months ended in December. That was down from the two banks'
combined earnings of $1.68 billion (94 cents) for the comparable
1997 period.
</P>
<P>
   BofA's operating profit was slightly below analysts' average
forecast of 93 cents a share, according to First Call Corp. The
bank's shares fell 56 cents to $64 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter result included a $441 million charge for
severance payments and other costs associated with combining the
old BofA and NationsBank, as the North Carolina bank was previously
known. Including the charge, net income was $1.16 billion (67
cents).
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, the bank posted a pretax loss of $201
million from Shaw, on top of the $372 million loss recorded in the
September quarter. The latest losses reflected further drops in the
value of securities in the Shaw portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Overall in the quarter, declines in BofA's securities,
investment banking and trading operations offset the solid
performance of consumer and commercial banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cut behind the noise, the core banking business
continued to do very well with strong gains in loans and
deposits,'' said Joseph Morford, an analyst with the San Francisco
brokerage Van Kasper &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The old BofA lent Shaw $1.4 billion, which was built into a $20
billion bond portfolio through additional borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw made bets that prices of different types of bonds would
converge over time, using complicated computer programs to identify
securities poised to move. The portfolio took massive losses when
bond prices moved opposite to the way computers had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In October, BofA bought the Shaw portfolio to avoid a fire sale
of the securities on the open market. Since then, the bank has sold
$13 billion worth of Shaw's bonds and combined the rest with its
own securities portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, Shaw is behind them,'' Morford said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wells Fargo, the largest bank based in the West,
yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $194 million (12
cents a diluted share), compared with a profit of $650 million for
the 1997 fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The latest result included $1.2 billion in charges due to
Norwest Corp.'s purchase of San Francisco's Wells Fargo, which was
completed in November. Norwest moved its headquarters to San
Francisco and kept the Wells Fargo name after the acquisition took
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also recorded a special $320 million loan-loss
provision for its Puerto Rico finance company, which had problems
collecting loans following a hurricane on the Caribbean island last
year.

 AtHome, Excite Have Plenty in Common  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Next-door neighbors AtHome and Excite have been eyeing each other
for months as Internet partners. Yesterday, they consummated their
flirtation.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome, which offers high-speed Internet access over cable
lines, agreed to buy Excite Inc., one of the Web's most popular
destinations, in a $6.7 billion stock swap that is the largest
Internet acquisition ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Redwood City companies have much in common: Separated by a
50-foot-wide plaza featuring a man-made water fountain
affectionately called the ``scummy pond,'' both were initially
backed by venture-capital powerhouse Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP;
Byers. They share the same building architect and go-go cultures,
and both are locked in battle with America Online and Yahoo for
consumers and online revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Each company features a spiral slide for employees to use
instead of stairs, and workers from both companies play basketball,
volleyball and hockey at the shared paved courts behind their
buildings. Executives from each company jokingly called their
mega-merger ``Operation Pond.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies share more than just the same block. They share a
common business vision, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We are merging with Excite not only for what they have
achieved, but what we become together _ the new media network for
the 21st century,'' said Milo Medin, AtHome's founder and chief
technology officer. ``We will give consumers access to the
information they want, when they want it, whether they are using a
PC, TV or any other communications device.''
</P>
<P>
   AtHome clearly benefits most from the blockbuster deal, which
eclipses America Online's $4.2 billion acquisition of Netscape
Communications in November. AtHome will dramatically boost its
customer base of 330,000 subscribers by gaining access to Excite's
20 million members and content-rich Web site and tools.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this year, AtHome plans to offer an online news service
with Excite's user-friendly interface to anyone with an
Internet-connected device _ be it TV, pager or handheld organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Excite, meanwhile, gains a form of electronic distribution it
could only dream of: access to an estimated 65 million American
homes installed with the cable wiring capable of receiving AtHome's
ultra-fast service. The speedy service could prove a boon to
delivering video and text content to consumers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all-access all the time for consumers and advertisers,''
said Excite founder Joe Kraus, who stands to reap more than $45
million from the deal. ``We have talked to a number of companies
over the years, but none has the complementary business operations
of AtHome. Both of these companies are focused on winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally significant, Excite picks up the deep-pocketed financial
backing it needs to compete with archrivals in the market for
portals, all-in-one Web sites that offer information, online
shopping, search engines and e-mail. Among its competitors,
Infoseek is partially owned by the Walt Disney Co., Netscape's
merger with AOL is expected to be finalized next month, and CNet's
Snap has the backing of NBC. Yesterday, CNet and NBC said they
would create the first Internet portal service aimed at users with
high-speed modem connections.
</P>
<P>
   Excite and AtHome officials said the combined company will be
called AtHome Network, and George Bell, Excite's chief executive,
will become an AtHome board member and take an executive position
in the merged company. AtHome will issue 1.04 of its shares for
each share of Excite.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of ATHOME20 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The transaction, which is expected to close in about three
months, has been approved by the directors of both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Excite reportedly had been in talks with various larger
potential partners since the AOL-Netscape merger announcement,
called off talks with Yahoo last weekend, according to the Wall
Street Journal. Sources said Excite also discussed potential
buyouts with Microsoft Corp. and AT&AMP;T Corp. (AT&AMP;T is already set to
buy AtHome's largest shareholder, cable giant Tele-Communications
Inc. TCI owns a 40 percent stake in AtHome but has 70 percent of
the votes on the board.)
</P>
<P>
   AtHome, which reportedly pursued other potential takeover
targets including Internet search engine Lycos, said it expects to
add significantly to its employee base. &UR;  &LR; The company is in the
process of expanding operations in a new building complex across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   News of AtHome's acquisition of Excite sent both stocks surging.
Excite stock skyrocketed $42.50, to $110. AtHome shares rose
$13.38, to $115.38.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the market's reaction, some observers questioned the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a peculiar combination,'' said analyst Phil Sirlin, of
Schroder &AMP; Co. in New York. ``A portal is like an endcap (display)
at a supermarket. It makes you walk past, in a virtual sense, a
certain set of vendors on your way to a particular shopping center,
like Excite. On the other hand, AtHome's cable service provides a
good roadway to all of the shopping centers, including Excite,
Yahoo and others.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Horsfall, vice president of marketing at rival Lycos, said
Excite had burned through millions in cash over the past few years
and made the deal to ``ease a lot of financial pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of ATHOME20 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  What Internet media company executives do agree on, however, is
the fevered pitch with which broadcast, entertainment and
technology concerns are showing in online firms. A dozen companies,
including CBS and Time, may be eyeing Lycos for a possible
takeover, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The AtHome-Excite ``deal helps the portal industry,'' Horsfall
said. ``It illustrates the sense of urgency of larger companies
looking for partnerships in the Internet space.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: JAMAICA TO SEND OUT TROOPS; TOURISM UP SLIGHTLY;
WORRIES IN UTAH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Fla.)  (Also moving in `t' category) 
(dal) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAMAICA TO SEND OUT TROOPS
</P>
<P>
   With its tourist industry battered by fear of crime and by
visitor complaints of harassment, Jamaica is trying to decide when
to deploy troops to its tourist resorts and whether they will be in
uniform or plainclothes. The move is backed by the Jamaica Hotel
and Motel Association, which was previously lukewarm toward the
idea. The change comes as occupancy rates have fallen after several
well-publicized crimes against tourists.
</P>
<P>
   While Jamaican officials say that crime against visitors has
fallen in the last couple of years, harassment is so widespread,
especially in cruise ports, that Prime Minister Percival J.
Patterson described the situation last year as the single biggest
problem facing the tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   Four cruise lines threatened to pull out of Montego Bay two
years ago, and one line, Celebrity, did pull out its Mercury ship.
Still, merchants say that this year fewer than half the passengers
on cruise ships in Ocho Rios are staying aboard rather than coming
ashore.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is an industry that is Jamaica's biggest money maker by
far. In 1997, the island drew 1.9 million visitors, whose spending
accounted for 45 percent of Jamaica's foreign exchange, almost 14
percent of its gross domestic product and one in every four jobs.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the industry, Jamaica raised fines last year for
harassing tourists: the penalty for a first-time offense is about
$2,700, up from $27, and repeat offenses draw fines of about
$4,100, also up from $27. But, judging from last week's decision to
deploy troops, the harsher penalties have apparently had little
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The date of the deployment has not been determined, a
spokeswoman for the Jamaica Tourist Board said on Tuesday, largely
because the tourism and security ministries have not yet resolved
whether the soldiers will patrol in uniform or plainclothes, or
whether they will patrol at all resorts simultaneously. The U.S.
State Department, meantime, recently updated a year-old advisory
warning visitors to Jamaica to exercise caution.
</P>
<P>
   1998: A SO-SO YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Final statistics for 1998 travel and tourism will not be
compiled for months, but the numbers are expected to surpass those
for 1997, if just barely. While the number of cruise passengers is
likely to top the 5.05 million who sailed in 1997, several other
major tourist industries slumped last year.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at theme parks, for example, fell almost 2 million in
1998 principally because of bad weather, while visits to such
popular national parks as Grand Canyon in Arizona and Yosemite in
California were also down significantly. Unusually warm weather
toward the end of the year ruined the plans of tens of thousands of
skiers, and lowered hotel occupancy rates in Orlando and elsewhere
in central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The bad economic news from Asia, especially Japan, also hurt
attendance at theme parks in California and Florida, while dealing
a hammer blow to Hawaiian tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Japanese visitors to Las Vegas probably reached a
record in 1998, but would perhaps would have been even higher if
the yen had remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   A FEW WORRIES IN UTAH
</P>
<P>
   The scandal over reports of bribery involving the 2002 Winter
Olympics in Salt Lake City is creating concern that the expected
50,000 additional visitors a day might not show up, either out of
disgust with the process used to land the Olympics or because
diminished sponsorship might result in fewer events surrounding the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Any significant drop in visitors would affect hotels,
restaurants and much else, including the State of Utah, which had
projected an extra $19 million in tax revenues. And a decline in
foreign visitors would be especially painful, since Utah has been
expecting them to spend generously as well as spread the word back
home about the state's many scenic charms.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the Utah Travel Council has said that calls to
its information line have more than doubled since the scandal
emerged. More worrisome, for the time being at least, is the
below-average snowfall over much of the state that has led to a
disappointing ski season so far.

visitor complaints of harassment, Jamaica is trying to decide when
to deploy troops to its tourist resorts and whether they will be in
uniform or plainclothes. The move is backed by the Jamaica Hotel
and Motel Association, which was previously lukewarm toward the
idea. The change comes as occupancy rates have fallen after several
well-publicized crimes against tourists.
</P>
<P>
   While Jamaican officials say that crime against visitors has
fallen in the last couple of years, harassment is so widespread,
especially in cruise ports, that Prime Minister Percival J.
Patterson described the situation last year as the single biggest
problem facing the tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
   Four cruise lines threatened to pull out of Montego Bay two
years ago, and one line, Celebrity, did pull out its Mercury ship.
Still, merchants say that this year fewer than half the passengers
on cruise ships in Ocho Rios are staying aboard rather than coming
ashore.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is an industry that is Jamaica's biggest money maker by
far. In 1997, the island drew 1.9 million visitors, whose spending
accounted for 45 percent of Jamaica's foreign exchange, almost 14
percent of its gross domestic product and one in every four jobs.
</P>
<P>
   To protect the industry, Jamaica raised fines last year for
harassing tourists: the penalty for a first-time offense is about
$2,700, up from $27, and repeat offenses draw fines of about
$4,100, also up from $27. But, judging from last week's decision to
deploy troops, the harsher penalties have apparently had little
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The date of the deployment has not been determined, a
spokeswoman for the Jamaica Tourist Board said on Tuesday, largely
because the tourism and security ministries have not yet resolved
whether the soldiers will patrol in uniform or plainclothes, or
whether they will patrol at all resorts simultaneously. The U.S.
State Department, meantime, recently updated a year-old advisory
warning visitors to Jamaica to exercise caution.
</P>
<P>
   1998: A SO-SO YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Final statistics for 1998 travel and tourism will not be
compiled for months, but the numbers are expected to surpass those
for 1997, if just barely. While the number of cruise passengers is
likely to top the 5.05 million who sailed in 1997, several other
major tourist industries slumped last year.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at theme parks, for example, fell almost 2 million in
1998 principally because of bad weather, while visits to such
popular national parks as Grand Canyon in Arizona and Yosemite in
California were also down significantly. Unusually warm weather
toward the end of the year ruined the plans of tens of thousands of
skiers, and lowered hotel occupancy rates in Orlando and elsewhere
in central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The bad economic news from Asia, especially Japan, also hurt
attendance at theme parks in California and Florida, while dealing
a hammer blow to Hawaiian tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Japanese visitors to Las Vegas probably reached a
record in 1998, but would perhaps would have been even higher if
the yen had remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   A FEW WORRIES IN UTAH
</P>
<P>
   The scandal over reports of bribery involving the 2002 Winter
Olympics in Salt Lake City is creating concern that the expected
50,000 additional visitors a day might not show up, either out of
disgust with the process used to land the Olympics or because
diminished sponsorship might result in fewer events surrounding the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Any significant drop in visitors would affect hotels,
restaurants and much else, including the State of Utah, which had
projected an extra $19 million in tax revenues. And a decline in
foreign visitors would be especially painful, since Utah has been
expecting them to spend generously as well as spread the word back
home about the state's many scenic charms.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the Utah Travel Council has said that calls to
its information line have more than doubled since the scandal
emerged. More worrisome, for the time being at least, is the
below-average snowfall over much of the state that has led to a
disappointing ski season so far.

 &HT;    Excite, At Home deal far-reaching
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS to $14 MILLION in 5th graf.)
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At Home Corp. has struck an agreement to buy Excite in
a $6.7 billion purchase that would combine an Internet service
provider with a company offering content on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising announcement sent the stock of Excite and other
Internet stocks soaring, outdoing the price of America Online's
recently ballyhooed purchase of Netscape while sparking
expectations of still more mergers to come.
</P>
<P>
   The huge deal underscores the high stakes now taken for granted
in the jostling for position among companies doing business on the
Internet _ especially those hoping to capitalize on or create the
high-speed capabilities of ``broadband'' technology.
Multibillion-dollar values are now placed on companies with modest
revenues that have yet to report a profit. Excite's stock value
before Tuesday's announcement was $3.4 billion _ inflated by
traditional, pre-Internet measures, and yet barely half of what At
Home is willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are predicting the combined company could have revenue
of $2 billion within three years, with just under half coming from
subscriptions paid for At Home's growing service. But the numbers
so far are just a shadow of those projections.
</P>
<P>
   At Home reported a $9.7 million loss on revenues of about $14
million during the third fiscal quarter of last year. Excite lost
$6.8 million on $44 million in revenue during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have offices next door to each other in
Redwood City, Calif. But the price of the deal and the splash it
made seemed due to the potential power of their combination to
exploit the Internet. Despite the vast increase in its use, the Net
remains a tiny part of the nation's $6 trillion economy. But the
companies _ and investors _ are betting the economy is truly
shifting to the Net and those in position to offer connections or
content will profit accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Together, At Home and Excite will offer both.
</P>
<P>
   For At Home, the deal offers a chance to link with millions of
computer users, the very audience likely to care about the
high-speed connections At Home can offer.
</P>
<P>
   At Home now has only about 310,000 subscribers for its
high-speed cable service. By contrast, Excite's site now draws a
daily average of 50 million page views, according to Jefferies &AMP;
Co. analyst Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Excite has compiled a range of services that include a network
of free sites, e-mail and stock quotes _ giving users a chance to
customize the offerings. For Excite, the deal with At Home can be
the route to the capital needed for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But the connections reach farther than the two companies whose
names are on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Among At Home's minority investors is Cox Communications, which
is majority-owned by Cox Enterprises, owner of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. At Home is majority-owned by
Tele-Communications Inc., which has agreed to be purchased by AT&AMP;T.
Benefits of the Excite deal therefore may flow directly to AT&AMP;T,
which has been scrambling to find a way to directly connect to
consumers, avoiding the local phone companies and the access fees
they charge.
</P>
<P>
   The pending purchase of TCI is meant to give AT&AMP;T high-speed
access to millions of homes, a plan dependent on billions of
dollars in upgrades to cable lines. Meanwhile, AT&AMP;T is making deals
with other cable companies to fill in the gaps where TCI does not
offer service. In Georgia, for example, TCI has virtually no
presence.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T sees the direct connection to the home as potentially
the most lucrative of all.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong said Tuesday that At Home can
be his conduit for providing a variety of services for data and
voice. AT&AMP;T already has agreements with Excite, Lycos and others
for marketing its phone services via the Net.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's pending purchase of Netscape, another
combination of access and content, is currently valued at more than
$6 billion. With the At Home-Excite deal came the expectation of
other big-ticket mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the agreement sent shivers of excitement through
Wall Street where interest in Internet stocks already approached a
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Excite leaped a stunning $42.50 a share to close at $110, and
many other Net-related stocks were carried along in the euphoria.
Lycos closed at $112.93 3/4 a share, up $25.06 1/4. Yahoo! Inc.
rose $6 a share to $323. Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises was
up $7.50 to $101.50 a share. CNet was up $26.75 a share to close at
$99.75.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T climbed $7.12 1/2 to $91.37 1/2.

FRANCES GODOWSKY, 92, LAST OF THE GERSHWIN SIBLINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frances Godowsky, a prolific painter and sometime
singer better known as George and Ira's little sister, Frankie
Gershwin, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 and
the last of the Gershwin siblings.
</P>
<P>
   In a family where talent abounded, Mrs. Godowsky and her
slightly older brother, Arthur, inherited their share of the
Gershwin genes, but when one older brother is one of the century's
most acclaimed composers and another is among its most lionized
lyricists, it is hard to measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mrs. Godowsky didn't have her moments. An accomplished
dancer who toured at 11 in a children's musical, ``Daintyland,''
she never let George and Ira forget that when they were grateful
for $15 paychecks from Tin Pan Alley, she was the family's first
big breadwinner _ never mind that most of her $40 weekly salary
went to pay expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan on Dec. 26, 1906, 10
years to the day after her oldest brother, Ira, Mrs. Godowsky had a
peripatetic childhood as her father, Morris, a man with an eclectic
personnel file, repeatedly moved the family to be near his latest
job. (Ira once calculated that between 1900 and 1917 the family
lived in 28 apartments, 25 in Manhattan and three in Brooklyn.)
</P>
<P>
   Although she sang in a couple of Broadway shows in the late
1920s, by the time the family moved into the house on West 103d
Street made famous in the 1945 biographical movie, ``Rhapsody in
Blue,'' Mrs. Godowsky seemed resigned to tailoring her career to
her older brothers'.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently summoned to George's lair on the fifth floor, she was
often the first to sing Gershwin songs that would later be Broadway
hits, and when George was in rehearsal for ``Lady Be Good,''
brother and sister would try out steps he had learned from the
show's star, Fred Astaire.
</P>
<P>
   Although her husky voice was small by stage standards of the
day, George, who loved her interpretations of his sometimes
complicated music, particularly the way she kept the rhythm going,
made her his personal chanteuse, and the two entertained at
countless flapper-era parties in New York and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Mrs. Godowsky was glad enough to accept the benefits of
being his beloved little sister.
</P>
<P>
   In one episode in early 1928, Mrs. Godowsky, who was dating a
boring doctor at the time, begged George to let her tag along on a
European trip he and Ira were planning.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she returned six months later, Mrs. Godowsky had so
wowed Cole Porter at a party Elsa Maxwell gave in Paris that he
designed a show for her at the storied nightclub Les Ambassadeurs,
where she sang Gershwin tunes with George as her accompanist.
</P>
<P>
   The limited engagement drew her a flood of professional offers,
but George insisted she return with the rest of the party.
</P>
<P>
   By then she had fallen in love with one of George's poker
cronies, Leopold Godowsky Jr., the son of the celebrated Austrian
pianist.
</P>
<P>
   They married in 1930 and settled in Rochester, N.Y., where
Godowsky helped invent Kodachrome, the acclaimed slide film.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Godowsky, who had been her brother George's tryout singer,
played a similar role for her husband, posing in bright red beret
and bottle-green dress as a photographic test subject.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after George's death in 1937, the couple moved to Westport,
Conn., where Mrs. Godowsky, who had begun sculpturing in Rochester,
hit her own artistic stride. She took up painting and turned out
hundreds of well-received oils and acrylics.
</P>
<P>
   The success of her painting helped soften the blow when the
movie ``Rhapsody in Blue'' came out in 1945 and excised her and
Arthur from the Gershwin family. Arthur died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Although painting remained her main artistic outlet, in her
later years Mrs. Godowsky re-emerged as a singer. Her 1975 album,
``Frances Sings for George and Ira,'' won wide acclaim, and after a
granddaughter suggested she get vocal training, she began a
long-deferred professional career, singing Gershwin tunes at the
Lambs Club and elsewhere until two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Godowsky, whose husband and brother Ira both died in 1983,
is survived by a son, Leopold III, of Manhattan; three daughters,
Alexis Gershwin, of Beverly Hills, Calif.; Georgia Keidan, of
Chappaqua, N.Y.; and Nadia Natali, of Ojai, Calif.; and eight
grandchildren.

UNLV GAMBLES ON ROBINSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG SPOON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barely a month into his new job as head football coach at UNLV,
John Robinson learned first-hand how the folks in Las Vegas define
the term ``rebuilding.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials, who previously allocated $18 million for the
renovation of Sam Boyd Stadium, gathered with Robinson and local
media last week to say goodbye to the old press box. But instead of
simply dismantling it, they blew it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we do things in Vegas,'' said UNLV publicist
Mark Wallington, referring to the city's practice of imploding
outdated hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who admitted to watching ``a few small charges'' go
off, said the story probably was exaggerated. UNLV administrators
are gambling that their hopes for Robinson are not.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 63, was hired Dec. 3 to take over a team that has lost
16 consecutive games. Fired a year earlier after an unimpressive
second stint at USC, Robinson was dabbling in broadcasting and
enjoying time with his wife, Linda, when the Rebels called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some other agendas, and I wasn't sure what I was going
to do,'' Robinson said in a phone interview. ``They came asking me
about it and they were pretty aggressive. The school president
(Carol C. Harter) pretty much convinced me they wanted to make some
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what kind of changes, Robinson isn't exactly sure. Win some
games, no doubt. The specifics? That's what they're paying him for
-- $350,000 a year for the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been genuinely impressed by coach Robinson's enthusiasm
about the task at hand,'' said UNLV athletic director Charles
Cavagnaro. It is now up to Robinson to convert that enthusiasm into
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what changes they want to make,'' Robinson
said. ``Basically, they said, `You give us the vision and we'll
follow it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous for us to make lofty predictions, but UNLV
football will be on the move. We are going to be second to none and
we're going to recruit the best players possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of previous head coaches in the 31-year history of the
UNLV football program includes few recognizable names. Former
Pasadena City College coach Harvey Hyde coached there from 1982-85
and was followed by former Cal Poly Pomona assistant Wayne Nunnely
from 1986-89. Ron Meyer, who later coached the New England
Patriots, coached UNLV from 1973-75. Robinson's predecessor, Jeff
Horton, was 13-44 from 1994-98, including 0-11 last season before
he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   But as Robinson and USC fans learned the past few years, it is
not enough simply to bring in a name coach who has won big before.
Robinson, 104-35-4 lifetime as a college coach, led the Trojans to
a 9-2-1 record and a Rose Bowl victory in his third year back in
1995, but 6-6 and 6-5 seasons and two years without a bowl
appearance led to his dismissal after the 1997 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   UNLV has little in the way of returning impact players. Running
back James Wofford, who rushed for 816 yards and 5 touchdowns, is
back. So is leading receiver Len Ware and standout defensive back
Randy Black. But the only quarterback returning is sophomore Chris
Hayward, who attempted only 37 passes as the No. 3 QB last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson must take this group and blend it with newcomers well
enough to make improvements in a new conference. UNLV will play
next season in the Mountain West Conference, which includes Air
Force, Utah and BYU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the weak link in the conference, but we're not going to
stay there,'' Robinson promised.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in school history, UNLV has funded the
maximum 85 football scholarships allowed by the NCAA. Robinson had
19 scholarships available and has received 10 oral commitments so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are two quarterbacks who may see playing time
quickly. They are Jason Vaughn (6-4, 205), a transfer from Middle
Georgia Junior College who will participate in spring drills; and
Ryan Hanson (6-2, 210), who passed for 3,082 yards and 31
touchdowns at Los Alamitos High School.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has also received a commitment from one of Nevada's top
prep prospects, quarterback and defensive back Lawrence Turner of
Cheyenne High. All-state JC offensive lineman Greg Hulett (6-3,
290) of Los Angeles Valley College recently committed, as did wide
receiver Nate Turner (6-2, 205) of Compton College.
</P>
<P>
   All have major college potential, but Robinson realizes the
athlete he lures to Vegas usually has not performed at the same
level as those he has targeted in the past. Still, he is setting
his sights high with a few more holes to fill before the Feb. 3
signing date.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recruited here, but they recruited at a low level,''
Robinson said about previous recruiting efforts. ``I don't want to
talk negative about the old group (of coaches), but they kind of
recruited the leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can compare us to Arizona State, when they recruit against
USC and UCLA. They end up with guys you thought had no reason to go
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson still won't discuss details of the bitter end at USC,
but admits a fresh beginning was better for all in the long run. At
UNLV, as he did when he first returned to USC, he has the dream and
believes he has the backing from administrators. The proof,
however, will lie in the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think coach Robinson would have come to join us if he
didn't believe the commitment was there at the top,'' Harter said.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, will the commitment on the football field be
enough to make a difference?

STARKS PRACTICES IN KNICK T-SHIRT, BUT DOOR IS OPEN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ A sweat-soaked Patrick Ewing flopped a towel
over his shoulder and began to leave the gym without a word. He
bellowed the familiar, ``No, not today,'' as he hurried past the
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Something stopped him, though. Something made him turn around
and poke his head back in the door. On second thought, he had
something to say about the boyish shooting guard with the
off-kilter release, about the mischievous friend who made him laugh
for almost 10 years, about the wild-eyed player who walked with the
excited bounce of Pooh's buddy Tigger every time he approached the
scorer's table.
</P>
<P>
   He'll miss all that. And so Ewing stopped, turned and talked
about the Knicks' pending plans for sending away John Starks. No
deals can be completed until the collective bargaining agreement is
completed, but according to several executives in the National
Basketball Association, the Knicks have agreed to trade Chris Mills
and Starks, a sixth man with mass appeal, to the Golden State
Warriors for a player with a bad-boy image, Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's my friend,'' Ewing said after an informal team workout
at SUNY-Purchase. ``We've been together a long time. Naturally, I
don't want to see him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks was still clinging to hope that he wasn't gone just yet.
Perhaps more convinced that the news was true, Mills did not show
up, but Starks came dressed and ready for a workout in a Knick
T-shirt. He was just another teammate running the floor in a
scrimmage. There were whispers, but very little was said to him
concerning the trade the Knicks agreed to in principle on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not done, yet,'' Starks said, referring to the window of
time before camp opens and deals can be made official. ``And it's
not for certain that I'll be at Golden State.''
</P>
<P>
   He could wind up elsewhere, via another trade, possibly in
Miami. There was speculation that Heat Coach Pat Riley was plotting
to reunite with Starks by working out a deal to sign Brent Barry
and trade him to the Warriors for Starks _ if Barry does not sign
with Chicago first. It was Riley who believed in Starks' ability to
catch fire and win games when he coached the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks can complete the trade when the lockout officially
ends, the only holdover from the team Riley guided to the 1994 NBA
finals will be Ewing. The center's former sidekick, the player who
seemed so New York, glowing and flickering on the court like neon
in Times Square, will be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does happen, I just appreciate all the support from the
fans,'' Starks said. ``The people here have been good to me. I
don't have any regrets except for one. And that's Game 7 when I
wasn't able to perform the way I'm capable of performing. And I
couldn't bring a championship to this city, which is so deserving
of one. That's the only thing I'll regret, that one game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks could regret this trade if Sprewell commits a false
step. It's win or else for team officials relying on a player with
a selfish label and volatile past, one that includes the choking of
his coach, P.J. Carlesimo. Yet, his image did not unsettle the
Knicks. A secret face-to-face session between team officials and
Sprewell recently confirmed his fitness after his nearly 14-month
absence from basketball.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-guard lineup, team officials believe Sprewell will
exhibit the form he showed as a former All-Star and will blend in
with Ewing, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson. But there is concern
that Houston, who began to emerge as a leader last year, will be
inhibited by Sprewell's presence. There is also uneasiness over how
Sprewell's personality will fit in with the team's chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Knicks who spoke Tuesday voiced a discouraging word
about Sprewell for either his on-court of off-the-court behavior.
Most agreed that he was an athletic 6-foot-5-inch vulture on
defense and playmaker on offense and should put his past problems
behind him. Marcus Camby, who could be displaced as a starter upon
Sprewell's pending arrival, said he could accept coming off the
bench behind Sprewell or power forward Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not coming in here looking to shine or looking to take
somebody's spotlight,'' Camby said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Starks, answering questions about his departure, would not
raise doubts about Sprewell's talent. ``I'm not going to sit here
and belittle him,'' Starks said, ``and say that if this was to
happen that he wouldn't make the Knicks a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was so sure. The Heat, which dropped out of the
running for Sprewell Sunday night, did not seem too crestfallen to
discover the Knicks had won the bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not etched in stone that he's going to turn that team
around,'' Heat forward P.J. Brown told Miami reporters. ``It's a
whole lot different in the Eastern Conference than it is in the
West.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an entirely different Knicks team now. More athletes, more
speed. But with Charles Oakley gone, has toughness been sacrificed?
And has character been lost? Starks filled that role.
</P>
<P>
   One person especially interested in how the Knicks' latest move
is going to play out was point guard Charlie Ward. If he re-signs
with the Knicks, he will have so many scorers, so many people to
please.  &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON PROPOSES INVESTING BUDGET SURPLUS TO HELP 'SENIOR BOOM'
 &HT;    With UNION.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton urged Congress Tuesday night to
tackle the problems of next century's ``senior boom'' by investing
most of the projected federal budget surplus in Social Security and
Medicare and bolstering long-term care.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the number of elderly Americans will double in the
next three decades as the baby boomers retire, Clinton used his
State of the Union address to call for changes to ``begin to meet
our generation's historic responsibility to establish true security
for 21st century seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is
not to make drastic cuts in benefits, not to raise payroll taxes,
and not to drain resources from Social Security in the name of
saving it,'' he said. ``Instead, I propose we make the historic
decision to invest the surplus to save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would use about 60 percent of the projected $4.4
trillion surplus over the next 15 years _ about $2.7 trillion _ to
bolster Social Security. Part of that money, for the first time,
would be invested by the government in the private sector, much
like states invest their employee pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Another 15 percent of the surplus would be used to shore up
Medicare, and 11 percent would be used for personal 401(k)-style
pension accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed a $1,000 tax credit for the elderly,
ailing or disabled and the families who care for them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans praised Clinton for emphasizing Social Security, but
criticized him for not offering a more specific proposal. House and
Senate leaders have reserved the first bill number in each chamber
for Clinton's Social Security legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In the GOP rebuttal to the president's address, Reps. Jennifer
Dunn, R-Wash., and Steve Largent, R-Okla., said they were
interested in Clinton's ``ideas on how to spend the surplus.
Unfortunately, the president still hasn't given us his plan to save
Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing his call from last year, Clinton challenged Congress to
fence off the surplus to save Social Security before using it for
other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew
what it would take to save Social Security,'' he said. ``Again I
say, we should not spend any of it _ not any of it _ until after
Social Security is truly saved. First things first.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless changes are made, the Social Security trust fund's
reserves will be depleted by 2032, when payroll taxes will only
cover three-fourths of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton predicted his proposal would preserve Social Security
until 2055 and called for a bipartisan reform effort to preserve it
until 2075.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare proposal envision spending about $700 billion over
the next 15 years to shore up the hospital trust fund, which is
scheduled to be depleted by 2008. Clinton suggested his plan would
prolong the fund until 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the bipartisan congressional commission _ which is
expected to offer Medicare reforms by March 1 _ to use some of the
surplus money to provide a prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to keep elderly widows out of poverty, Clinton
proposed altering the current Social Security formula to increase
their benefits to about three-fourths the level for a couple.
Currently, widows' benefits are about 50 to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The president's suggestion that between 20 percent to 25 percent
of the surplus money used for Social Security be invested in the
private sector drew harsh criticism from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton suggested that both parties devise a method for
investing the money using a ``broad-based neutral approach managed
by the private sector,'' Republicans bristled at the prospect of
government involvement in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No. A thousand times no,'' said House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. ``If you thought a
government takeover of health care was bad, just wait until the
government becomes an owner of America's private sector companies.
Government-controlled investments in markets is contrary to free
enterprise and it will open the doors to all kinds of mischief
involving government dictates, favoritism and cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the trust fund's security is established, Clinton proposed
using 11 percent of the surplus _ about $500 billion over 15 years
_ to give workers individual investment accounts which he called
``universal savings accounts,'' or USA accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The government would give each worker an equal amount _ yet to
be determined _ and would match a portion of each dollar that an
individual voluntarily contributed to the pension account. The
amount of the government match would vary, with larger portions
going to low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Social Security plan combined competing elements of
various reform proposals by calling for both government and
personal investment of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, legislative director for AARP, called Clinton's
plan ``very positive. ...I think most Americans will see this as a
relatively painless way to go, compared to some other ideas that
have been out there like raising the retirement age and raising
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry J. Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution _
who with former Congressional Budget Office director Robert D.
Reischauer proposed a plan that featured the government investing a
portion of the surplus in the private market _ called Clinton's
proposal ``long overdue. ...It will help the economy grow and
improve the condition of the Social Security trust fund. That
strikes me as good news.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Tanner, director of the Cato Project on Social
Security Privatization _ a leading advocate of personal investment
accounts to replace the current system _ said Clinton ``labored
mightily and brought forth a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of this proposal do nothing to reform Social
Security and the other third is a bad idea,'' Tanner said.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing government investments _ even if controlled by a
quasi-independent board _ would amount to ``back-door socialism,''
he said.

 &HT;    Price's suicide shocks east Texas community
 &HT;    By Jason Lyons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Royce Chadwick has felt the grief of losing
more than 100 times in his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those losses, even by the slimmest of margins or on
the largest of stages, even remotely compares to the degree of
heartache Chadwick and the rest of the Stephen F. Austin Ladyjacks
basketball family feels as they mourn the death of one of their
legends.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Price's apparent suicide early Monday morning shocked
the East Texas community and women's basketball followers around
the nation to their roots.
</P>
<P>
   The Ladyjacks returned to practice on Tuesday in preparation for
Thursday's game against Lamar in Beaumont. And even though that
game would otherwise seem important when considering SFA lost two
home games last week, it took everything the team could muster to
maintain some semblance of focus and normality on a dark day in
program history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most tragic thing I have ever experienced as a
teacher of young people,'' a teary-eyed Chadwick said after
practice on Tuesday. ``Though I know it's true, I still don't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick, wearing the white tennis shoes that Price gave him
when she signed with Adidas last fall, echoed the sentiments of his
coaching staff and players when he said Price never showed any
signs that she was depressed or capable of committing such an act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in a state of shock and disbelief,'' Chadwick said.
``If you'd list 25 girls who you said were going to do something
like this, and Katrina was on the list, she'd be the last one I'd
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just so senseless. She had so much going for her, and
she was the sweetest person to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Gail Striegler, who like Chadwick began her
stint at SFA during Price's freshman season in 1994-95, said her
impact on the university and the Nacogdoches community stretched
much further than her on-court accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking a lot about how much she did for this
community,'' Striegler said while occasionally tossing in an
anecdotal story. ``Everybody wanted the Ladyjacks represented at
their functions, and they all wanted KP. Whether it was a speaking
engagement or an appearance at an elementary school, Katrina never
hesitated to donate her time and do whatever people wanted her to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Striegler said she spotted Price signing autographs while
attending last Saturday's SFA-Northwestern State game. She said
Price, a former member of the American Basketball League's
Philadelphia Rage, maintained loose ties with the current players
since returning to Nacogdoches after the league folded in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hung out with some of the players at Hall 20 and would
occasionally go out to dinner with some of them,'' Striegler said.
``She would come to the office and seek our advice on what to do
about graduate school, where to stay and even a job she could find
while she was here.''
</P>
<P>
   Striegler said Price's voiced intentions were to complete nine
hours of graduate courses at SFA this spring, possibly attain a job
with a local school and work out and train for a WNBA tryout in a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   The Ladyjacks coaching staff was faced with the tough task of
informing many of the current players of the tragedy on Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible not to be emotional when you have to break
news like that to kids,'' Striegler said. ``The best we could do
was hug them and reassure them that everything was going to be
okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Chadwick, ``We assembled the team within about an hour and
a half, and we told each individual one-on-one as they came in
about what happened. We basically broke girls' hearts, one after
the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick also had the even tougher assignment of calling a few
of Price's sisters with the horrifying news.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you gave me 27 national championships and 56 All-Americans
in my career, I'd give them right back if it would mean not having
to make those phone calls,'' Chadwick said.

EXCITE AND AT HOME CONFIRM $6.7 BILLION INTERNET MERGER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One company was started in the proverbial Silicon Valley garage.
The other began as a play by some of the nation's biggest cable
television interests. Tuesday, they joined forces in the race to
capture Internet users and the dollars they are increasingly
spending on line, and investors appeared to endorse the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The deal brought together Excite Inc., which has evolved from a
simple search engine into the Internet's sixth most heavily
trafficked site, and the At Home Corp., a high-speed Internet
service aimed at cable television subscribers, in what the two
companies described as a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, which involved issuing 1.04 shares in At Home
for each share of Excite, was valued at $6.7 billion, making it the
largest in the recent spate of consolidations among Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal valued Excite at $106.27 a share, or a 57 percent
premium over its closing price on Friday. In raising the stakes
that high, At Home is hoping that it will be able to exploit
Excite's position as one of the leading Internet destinations to
attract subscribers to its own service.
</P>
<P>
   And Wall Street seemed to share that vision Tuesday. At Home
ended trading at $115.375, up $13.375, while Excite closed at $110,
up $42.50.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the deal heralded another round of consolidation
that would leave just a few major companies controlling both access
to the Internet and the most heavily used content.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day we're going to have an oligopoly
structure in terms of Internet media and access,'' said Alan
Braverman, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. ``In my mind one
of the survivors will be the At Home camp, and this makes it all
the more likely.''
</P>
<P>
   At Home's major shareholder, cable giant Tele-Communications
Inc., is being acquired by AT&AMP;T Corp., which also markets Internet
access through AT&AMP;T Worldnet. If the Excite deal goes through, the
combined company's main competitor on the Internet front will be
America Online, which in turn has announced plans to acquire
Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The At Home-Excite deal also sets the stage for the battle
shaping up around high-speed Internet access. About two million
households will have high-speed connections by 2000, through either
telephone lines or television cables, according to Forrester
Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the largest Internet service provider with 15
million subscribers, last week announced a deal with Bell Atlantic
Corp. to provide high-speed access to some of its subscribers
starting this summer. And this week Snap, an Internet company
part-owned by NBC, said it would offer a new service that takes
advantage of the ability to provide higher-quality video and audio
programming over high-speed connections to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At Home has forged partnerships with cable providers that it
says will eventually enable it to provide high-speed Internet
access to 60 million homes. But largely because cable providers
have been slow to make necessary upgrades to their systems, the At
Home service is available to only 10 million homes, and only
330,000 have signed up for it. Cable modems attached to home
computers operate at speeds 10 to 30 times faster than the
telephone modems that most of the nation's 28 million Internet
households rely on.
</P>
<P>
   A key piece of the merger plan is to use Excite's current
Internet presence to promote At Home's service. In November,
according to the Internet measuring service Media Metrix, Excite
had 14.2 million visitors to its site. About 20 million people have
used Excite's My Excite feature to create a service that provides
them with individualized information on favorite sports teams,
stocks and news. Many of them have given the company permission to
e-mail them material that might be of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take what we know about these people and intuit their
income levels and imputed demographic profile and whether they are
likely to want to sign up for broadband,'' George Bell, chief
executive of Excite, said. ``That's a powerful method of
cross-promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   At Home plans to use Excite's customer database to recruit
advertisers as well. Last year, Excite acquired Matchlogic, an
advertising tracking firm, and it has been developing a plan to
adapt its services to cable television, where a service provider
like At Home knows far more about its customers _ including their
addresses _ than most Web sites do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the hidden gem of the whole deal is how we'll be able
to implement their targeting and database technology to deliver
advertising to the individual user,'' said At Home's chief
executive, Tom Jermoluk.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the story of the deal reflects the struggle for
control over the Internet by unknown startups and established media
companies and the dizzying pace of the industry's evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Excite, started in 1994 by a group of Stanford graduates in a
garage and originally called Architext, was financed by the
high-profile venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers.
In April 1996, the company went public, marketing itself as a
search engine. Mutating with the market, it then turned itself into
a so-called portal site, offering not only search capabilities but
news, weather, stock quotes, free e-mail accounts and, of course,
advertising. Although Excite's stock price has appreciated by
almost 600 percent since its initial public offering, the company
lost $39.6 million on income of $100 million in the September 1998
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At Home, though also backed by Kleiner Perkins, has very
different origins. It was an effort by major cable companies _
Tele-Communications, Cox and Comcast _ to devise a high-bandwidth
Web service and programming intended to be a selling point for
cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are located next door to each other in Redwood City,
Calif., with roughly the same number of employees and the same
interior designer. Each company has a curvy red slide that
employees may use to go from the third to the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that separates us is a fountain,'' Jermoluk
said. ``And we're having a party there today.''

 &HT;    Basketball star's death under investigation
 &HT;    By Robbie Goodrich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Nacogdoches police are continuing their
investigation into the death of former Stephen F. Austin student
and star Ladyjack Katrina Price while Ms. Price's family is trying
to cope with its loss.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price, who graduated from SFA last May, died Monday morning
from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The
incident occurred at the residence she shared with her sister, Lucy
Price, in the Chevy Chase apartment complex at 1710 E. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Police received a call over 911 telephone lines shortly before 7
a.m. Monday from neighbors who reported hearing some kind of
disturbance coming from the Price apartment. According to an
Associated Press report, Nacogdoches police Sgt. Paul Peterson told
AP reporters Lucy had awakened to find her sister with a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears she was frantically trying to talk Katrina out of
it,'' Peterson told the AP. Peterson said there was less than a
minute between two 911 calls in connection with the incident, the
second of which allegedly came from Lucy, who was reporting the
shooting. The younger Price, who attends SFA, is not a suspect,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police had little additional information to offer Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still gathering evidence, contacting people and taking
statements,'' Nacogdoches Police Lt. Ralph Ervin said. ``We're also
waiting on the results of the autopsy and other lab tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Shead, one of her eight sisters, told the Associated
Press a despondent Ms. Price called her family shortly before the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``She talked to one sister about six yesterday morning,'' Ms.
Shead, 40, said. ``She just said she was deeply depressed, and we
offered to come and visit with her and help her. But an hour after
she hung up, it happened. We had no idea she was this depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price never told her family what was depressing her, Ms.
Shead said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice of the Peace Mike Worsham was called to the scene to
perform the death inquest, and he ordered an autopsy, said
Peterson, who added Lucy Price was the only other person in the
apartment when the incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned as to whether Katrina Price left a note or notes
for her family, friends, former teammates or coaches, Ervin said
``there's nothing I can say about that at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're trying to talk to anyone who might have been
in contact with her in the hours or days that led up to the
incident,'' he said. ``We're trying to find out what was going on
in her life and maybe establish a mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   Police told the family that Price left a note, the AP reported,
but Ms. Shead said she has not seen it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her career in the ABL was cut short, but she seemed to be OK
with it,'' Ms. Shead told the Associated Press from her home in
Kilgore, where the family gathered to prepare for Price's funeral.
``She was just looking forward to working this spring at one of the
schools in Nacogdoches and going overseas in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shead said her sister was working with her agent on a deal
with a European basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she had so many mountains to climb, with us losing
both of our parents,'' Ms. Shead said. The women's father died a
year ago and their mother died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not busy playing basketball anymore, and I think she
had some time to think about everything that had happened to her.
We just didn't know something like this was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about who owned the weapon used, Ervin said,
``we're trying to determine that and have no answers at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price played at SFA from 1994 to 1998 where she was the
university's all-time leading scorer. She received her bachelor's
degree last May and began a professional career as a first-round
selection of the Long Beach Stingrays in the American Basketball
League. She went to the Philadelphia Rage after the Stingrays
folded last fall. The ABL filed for bankruptcy in December, and Ms.
Price returned to SFA where she had enrolled in graduate studies
this semester.
</P>
<P>
   Police and SFA officials said they were contacted on Tuesday by
news agencies from throughout the country who were interested in
following up on the story of Ms. Price's death and any developments
in the investigation.

 &HT;    Basketball star's death under investigation
 &HT;    By Robbie Goodrich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Nacogdoches police are continuing their
investigation into the death of former Stephen F. Austin student
and star Ladyjack Katrina Price while Ms. Price's family is trying
to cope with its loss.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price, who graduated from SFA last May, died Monday morning
from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The
incident occurred at the residence she shared with her sister, Lucy
Price, in the Chevy Chase apartment complex at 1710 E. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Police received a call over 911 telephone lines shortly before 7
a.m. Monday from neighbors who reported hearing some kind of
disturbance coming from the Price apartment. According to an
Associated Press report, Nacogdoches police Sgt. Paul Peterson told
AP reporters Lucy had awakened to find her sister with a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears she was frantically trying to talk Katrina out of
it,'' Peterson told the AP. Peterson said there was less than a
minute between two 911 calls in connection with the incident, the
second of which allegedly came from Lucy, who was reporting the
shooting. The younger Price, who attends SFA, is not a suspect,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police had little additional information to offer Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still gathering evidence, contacting people and taking
statements,'' Nacogdoches Police Lt. Ralph Ervin said. ``We're also
waiting on the results of the autopsy and other lab tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Shead, one of her eight sisters, told the Associated
Press a despondent Ms. Price called her family shortly before the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``She talked to one sister about six yesterday morning,'' Ms.
Shead, 40, said. ``She just said she was deeply depressed, and we
offered to come and visit with her and help her. But an hour after
she hung up, it happened. We had no idea she was this depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price never told her family what was depressing her, Ms.
Shead said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice of the Peace Mike Worsham was called to the scene to
perform the death inquest, and he ordered an autopsy, said
Peterson, who added Lucy Price was the only other person in the
apartment when the incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned as to whether Katrina Price left a note or notes
for her family, friends, former teammates or coaches, Ervin said
``there's nothing I can say about that at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're trying to talk to anyone who might have been
in contact with her in the hours or days that led up to the
incident,'' he said. ``We're trying to find out what was going on
in her life and maybe establish a mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   Police told the family that Price left a note, the AP reported,
but Ms. Shead said she has not seen it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her career in the ABL was cut short, but she seemed to be OK
with it,'' Ms. Shead told the Associated Press from her home in
Kilgore, where the family gathered to prepare for Price's funeral.
``She was just looking forward to working this spring at one of the
schools in Nacogdoches and going overseas in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shead said her sister was working with her agent on a deal
with a European basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she had so many mountains to climb, with us losing
both of our parents,'' Ms. Shead said. The women's father died a
year ago and their mother died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not busy playing basketball anymore, and I think she
had some time to think about everything that had happened to her.
We just didn't know something like this was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about who owned the weapon used, Ervin said,
``we're trying to determine that and have no answers at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price played at SFA from 1994 to 1998 where she was the
university's all-time leading scorer. She received her bachelor's
degree last May and began a professional career as a first-round
selection of the Long Beach Stingrays in the American Basketball
League. She went to the Philadelphia Rage after the Stingrays
folded last fall. The ABL filed for bankruptcy in December, and Ms.
Price returned to SFA where she had enrolled in graduate studies
this semester.
</P>
<P>
   Police and SFA officials said they were contacted on Tuesday by
news agencies from throughout the country who were interested in
following up on the story of Ms. Price's death and any developments
in the investigation.

CLINTON URGES NEW ROUND OF GLOBAL TRADE TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton called for a new round of global
trade talks in his State of the Union address Tuesday night and
reiterated his long-standing plea for broader powers to negotiate
trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But unless he can somehow persuade a hostile Congress to grant
him ``fast-track'' trade negotiating authority, Clinton will be
hard-pressed to pry open foreign markets for U.S. products, trade
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the aura of the State of the Union address to call
for an accelerated series of talks at the World Trade Organization,
hoping over a three-year period to lower tariffs and expand markets
for burgeoning U.S. industries from biotechnology firms to Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must tear down barriers, open markets and expand trade,''
Clinton told the nation, a joint session of Congress and the
Washington-based diplomatic corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ... issue a call to the nations of the world to join the
United States in a new round of global negotiations to expand
exports of services, of manufactures, and most of all, farm
products,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan is to transform an already-scheduled
Nov. 30 meeting of WTO trade ministers into the start of a new
round of trade talks on par with the Uruguay Round, a seven-year
negotiating session that lowered numerous trade barriers worldwide
and led to the creation of 132-member group to handle trade
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   During those talks, administration officials hope to pry open
markets for industries such as energy and environmental services,
express delivery and professional services, while adding greater
intellectual property protections for U.S.-made computer software,
films, music and pharmaceutical products.
</P>
<P>
   But while calling for lower trade barriers, Clinton also warned
Japan that if its ``sudden surge'' of steel imports into the United
States is not reversed, ``America will respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Tuesday also reaffirmed its commitment to
negotiating a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas by 2005, a pact
that would tear down trade barriers from the Arctic to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Such an agreement would supersede the North American Free Trade
Agreement covering the United States, Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called on Congress to grant him ``the trade
authority long used to advance our prosperity,'' a rather oblique
reference to fast-track authority, a power that enables a president
to negotiate trade agreements without fear Congress would later be
able to alter the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from would-be free trade partners like Chile have
said they would be unwilling to sign a trade pact with the United
States in the absence of fast-track authority. And trade experts
fear the WTO talks will make little progress unless that authority,
first bestowed on the White House in 1974, is renewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be difficult to start a new round of negotiations
without the U.S. having fast-track because other countries won't
have confidence in the U.S. negotiating process as they would under
fast-track,'' said Laura Tomarchio, an international trade analyst
for Sandler, Travis &AMP; Rosenberg, a trade advisory services firm in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has twice failed to grant Clinton fast-track authority,
in large part because of opposition from organized labor and
Democratic members on Capitol Hill, who blame fast-tract and NAFTA
for sending U.S. jobs south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Clinton _ fearing to alienate the Democratic
base just weeks before mid-term elections _ refused to lobby
Democratic lawmakers on the fast-track, and the measure went down
in flames.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address, Clinton referred to the
bitter debates over trade, noting: ``Trade has divided Americans
for too long. We must find common ground on which business,
workers, environmentalists, farmers and government can stand
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., head of a House subcommittee on trade,
said in a prepared statement Tuesday that he thought a round of
comprehensive trade negotiations ``must be a top priority for the
U.S.,'' but he added: ``It would be extraordinarily difficult for
the president to be credible in these negotiations without having
fast-track authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Rushton, a spokesman for Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, said, ``All this other stuff is
icing on the cake, but the Chairman's view is that fast-track is
the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer, R-Texas, said, ``There hasn't been much leadership from
the president on getting his party lined up. Republicans voted
2-to-1 for fast-track last time around. Democrats voted 6-to-1
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Thea Lee, a trade expert for the AFL-CIO in Washington, argued
that labor unions are not opposed to fast-track authority per se,
but they are looking for a different kind of legislation than that
supported by the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've failed twice to pass their fast track,'' Lee said.
``They can't have worse luck doing something that would be more
responsive to concerns that labor and environmental communities
have raised.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House promised to raise the fast-track issue again
this year, but the administration _ distracted by the historic
impeachment trial in the Senate _ has given few signs it plans to
make a major push anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   While the president was calling for fast-track authority in the
State of the Union address, administration officials were busily
explaining why the authority was not all that crucial in either the
WTO talks or the hemispheric free trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official argued Tuesday that the White House
has made substantial progress on harmonizing customs requirements
among the various countries in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel San Juan, president of the Greater Houston Partnership's
World Trade Division, said Tuesday he is optimistic Congress,
prompted by concerns about the world economic crisis, will give
Clinton fast-track authority.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since its founding 20 years ago, Sylvan Learning Systems Inc.
has built itself into a little-noticed powerhouse in the world of
educational testing and tutoring, the nation's leading provider of
computerized tests and private remedial classes. Now it is moving
into a new world, founding a network of private, for-profit
colleges overseas and hiring a leading American educator to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan says it plans to announce Wednesday that Joseph Duffey,
director of the United States Information Agency and a former
president of American University in Washington and chancellor of
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, will supervise the
network of colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also announce that it has agreed to pay about
$29 million to acquire a private, profit-making 7,300-student
university in the suburbs of Madrid. But that is just the
beginning, said Douglas Becker, Sylvan's 32-year-old president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying just one university in Spain was never our intention,''
he said. ``If things go well, we are prepared to spend between $50
million and $100 million a year for 10 years to acquire a network
of about 10 universities.'' He added, ``We think it's a first,
something no one has done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan's acquisition of the University Europea of Madrid has run
into at least one snag _ a minority investor in the university
opposes the sale _ but spokesmen on both sides of the deal say the
opposition will at most delay the sale by a few weeks. The sale is
subject to approval by the Spanish government.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of Sylvan's plans are hard to grasp because the
idea is so new. But outside experts said they liked the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a challenge to merge the American business
approach with a foreign academic culture,'' said Peggy Blumenthal,
a spokeswoman for the Institute of International Education, an
organization concerned with student and professional international
exchanges. ``But this experiment could be extremely fruitful and
could create a model for private academic collaborations in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was enthusiastic. Some educators said the Sylvan
network could make it harder for American colleges and universities
to attract foreign students _ a major source of revenue. But Robert
Scott, president of Ramapo College of New Jersey and an adviser to
the federal government on higher education abroad, said Sylvan was
responding to the demand of a growing market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth of population, the increase of income and the
limited number of places available for students in foreign
universities has made private higher education a definite trend
around the world,'' he said. ``These institutions are forced to pay
attention to quality in order to attract students.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffey said he hoped to bring sound management and high academic
standards to the network. ``It will only be successful if it is
managed wisely and efficiently and is open to academic
innovation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many nonprofit American universities operate campuses and
programs abroad. But Becker, Sylvan's president, dismissed
comparisons to those operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those branches are just tinkering on the margins of this
market, with perhaps 200 students in one branch,'' he said from
Spain. ``Our universities like the one in Madrid will have
thousands of students, and that will allow us to do things in a big
way _ I mean growing institutional enrollments, the use of
technology, better marketing, better business practices and
faculty, and student exchanges to provide genuine international
education.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sylvan plan comes at a time of rising interest in for-profit
higher education in the United States _ from the rapidly expanding
University of Phoenix, which chiefly seeks to meet the needs of
adult students, to a subsidiary of New York University that is
developing specialized online courses to sell to other colleges,
corporate and training centers, and students who prefer to attend
class at home.
</P>
<P>
   But Becker said Sylvan was not interested in competing with
those institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that in higher education there are some things the
private sector should not do _ like opening a private institution
in the United States,'' he said. ``In this country you have every
possible permutation of that, so why us? But that variety of choice
doesn't exist in other countries; that's where we fit in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore, foreign governments are realizing that they can't
afford the growing cost of higher education,'' he said. ``At the
same time, there is a rising middle class saying, `What do you mean
my kid can't go to college?' That's a market for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The University Europea of Madrid, founded in 1985, became
available for takeover after it fell into debt and became paralyzed
by disagreement among its investors. Annual tuition is about
$7,000. Room and board come to about $10,000, but most students
live at home.
</P>
<P>
   Duffey said that despite its indebtedness the university has not
compromised its academic integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to make it an American university,'' he added.
``It will continue to have a Spanish rector and mainly Spanish
faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvan Learning Systems was founded in 1979, but it became a
high flier only after it was bought by Becker and his partner R.
Christopher Hoehn-Saric in 1991. It specialized in providing and
administering computerized versions of examinations created by the
Educational Testing Service.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company, which has a stock market valuation of $1.5
billion, includes more than 3,000 educational and testing centers
around the world. Based in Baltimore, it provides educational
services through three divisions. The Sylvan Prometric division
provides computer-based testing for college and graduate academic
admissions and related programs; the Sylvan Learning Centers offer
to teach students of all ages; and the Sylvan Contract Educational
Services provides supplemental education, teacher development and
consulting services under contract to large urban school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Sylvan won a $125 million contract with the
Driving Standards Agency of Great Britain to provide all written
drivers' license examinations in England, Scotland and Wales over
six years.
</P>
<P>
   Becker emphasized that although an international network of
universities might draw some students who would otherwise attend
American colleges and universities, it would not be a serious
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every foreign student who can afford an education in the
United States, there are probably five who can't afford it,'' he
said. ``And those would attend the much less expensive schools in
our network.''

COACH REMINDS STARS OF HIGH COST OF LOSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Hockey's adage is just a little bit different
than that one about victors and spoils.
</P>
<P>
   It goes something like this: ``To the losers go the bag skate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are hardly losers _ they are 19 games above .500 going
into tonight's 7:30 game against Toronto at Reunion Arena _ but
coach Ken Hitchcock yesterday reminded the team how tough losing
can be. Coming off a 5-3 defeat at the hands of the Vancouver
Canucks, Hitchcock yesterday blew a gasket after a blown
four-on-two drill and put his players through 25 minutes of hard
skating. By the end, many players were bent over gasping for breath
and a few were laid out on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 2-3-1 after running off a franchise-best 15-game
unbeaten streak, and players said they have had trouble getting
motivated. But they stopped short of saying they needed the aerobic
workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of a long season, it is, at times, hard to
get motivated,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``We haven't
been playing with emotion, and emotion goes a long way. But that's
something no one can do for you. You have to do it for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said his original intention was not to have a bag
skate, in which the players practice without a puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, as a coaching staff, we had plans for a good, effective
practice today, and I didn't sense that early on,'' Hitchcock said.
``Really, since the end of the streak, we haven't played with much
tenacity, and we expected a better response after the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Craig Ludwig agreed, saying the Stars are facing a
challenge of not looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely it's hard to keep focus when we're probably more
concerned about the playoffs,'' Ludwig said. ``But that's the
mental stuff that good teams fight through. That's why Detroit won
back-to-back and that's why Montreal was so good for so long. They
found a way to be committed when it counted most.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're trying to build here,'' Ludwig added. ``And
we think we're on the way to doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock this morning will rest his players' weary legs by
calling off the morning skate in preparation for the Maple Leafs.
Taking on one of the top teams from the Eastern Conference and
playing for the last time before the five-day All-Star break, the
Stars players know they'll be expected to take a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to send a message, he's not happy,'' Hatcher said.
``And we understand that. It would be good for us to go into the
break with a win.'' When asked about the possibility of a long
season wearing on the players, Hitchcock said he didn't think that
was the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start trying to explain things or start rationalizing,
that's the start of making excuses,'' Hitchcock said. ``If you do
that, then you start to lose accountability, and that's something
we can't afford to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have lost consecutive games only once this season _
two weeks ago in games against the Canucks and Calgary Flames. Now,
they're hoping to get back on the winning track once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we'd love to be undefeated, but I can't remember any team
going 82-0,'' Ludwig said. ``There are times when you're not going
to be at the top level, and right now is one of those times. But if
we start to build coming back from the All-Star break and start
climbing up that mountain, then when we're on top of it in May and
June, you guys aren't going to remember what you asked us about in
January and February.''

   LONG TERM
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the federal budget surpluses would total
$4.4 trillion over 15 years. Here are his proposals:
</P>
<P>
   _ 62 percent, or $2.7 trillion, would be dedicated to Social
Security, enough, the administration says, to keep the program
solvent until 2055.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of that, $700 billion would be invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   _ 11 percent, or $500 billion, would be dedicated to tax breaks
that would help workers establish retirement savings accounts, much
like 401(k) programs, with special incentives for low and middle
income families.
</P>
<P>
   _ 15 percent, about $700 billion, would be dedicated to help
shore up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   _ 11 percent, about $500 billion, would go for military and
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT YEAR
</P>
<P>
   The president outlined a menu of proposals for new or expanded
programs, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal education financing would reward local schools that
adopt stricter standards for students, teachers and schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ The minimum wage would increase to $6.15 an hour in 2000 from
$5.15 an house now.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grants and tax credits for child care would increase.
</P>
<P>
   _ New legal protections for medical patients to insure access to
specialists and emergency services and to provide an external
appeals process when care is denied.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1.4 billion to help those aged 55 to 65 obtain health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ $1 billion for welfare-to-work program.
</P>
<P>
   _ $12 billion extra for military programs.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   With their own legislative proposals, and in speeches by
representatives Steve Largent and Jennifer Dunn, Republicans in
Congress on Tuesday emphasized these goals:
</P>
<P>
   _ 10 percent cut in the tax rates, effective Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _ 4.8 percent pay raise for armed services, with future raises
pegged above rates of civilian raises.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increased penalties for drug traffickers and users.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fewer restrictions on federal education financing for local
schools.

 &HT;    Inaugural draws Texans to street corners to catch glimpse of
BushBy Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They plopped their lawn chairs down at the
corner of Fifth and Congress _ the family of the tuba player and
the retired schoolteacher who's seen nearly every inauguration
since 1957, the family of the rebel soldier and the family of the
Union soldier, the lady from Michigan who was waiting for a glimpse
of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Donning their Nimitz High School caps, Cathy and John Phillips
left their home in Aldine, near Houston, early Tuesday to document
the tuba virtuosity of their 16-year-old son, Jason, for family
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Squinting into the bright sunshine, Cathy Phillips made friends
quickly, telling her curbmates that Jason was the top tuba player
in the Nimitz marching band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quit braggin','' teased John Phillips, who was put in charge
of the camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's true,'' Cathy protested.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalynn Williams smiled. At 72, she was the matriarch of four
generations of the Williams clan who had descended on Austin from
Wimberley and Waco and San Antonio. She had her camera ready, too,
waiting for her son, Steve Williams, to stride up on his horse in
his gray Confederate uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Next to her, Frieda Revier was waiting for the same spot in the
parade lineup. Her 18-year-old son, Shaun, was part of the same
group, the Connections Living History Association of San Antonio.
Like Steve, he was riding in his first inaugural parade. She was
beaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you're proud,'' Erma Williams, a 78-year-old retired
Austin teacher, said to Revier. Williams, perched on a folding
canvas stool, didn't have anyone dear to her in the parade, but she
wasn't about to miss this. She's come to just about every
inauguration since Price Daniel took his oath in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning on her cane, Williams waved her miniature Texas flag and
smiled. She sized up the Hillsboro High School band, which she and
her siblings marched in when she was a girl. It seemed to have
shrunk since her day, she said, but that was decades ago. A teacher
in the Austin school district for 32 years, she comes mostly for
the children. The parade embodies all that she holds dear:
discipline, precision, teamwork, the celebration of youth.
</P>
<P>
   A small girl on a passing float waved. Williams smiled and waved
back.
</P>
<P>
   As the parade started on Third Street, people jockeyed for prime
viewing space along Congress while others ducked into the shade of
buildings. The street bustled with vendors hawking cotton candy and
tall hats, homeless people panhandling and a street preacher, Bible
in hand, shouting to some teen-agers: ``Hallelujah, just receive
Him.''
</P>
<P>
   Six blocks north, on the Capitol grounds, Austin's Tracie Lynn
gave a serenade as thousands filtered through for brisket, turkey,
sausage and ham. And caterer Eddie Deen of Dallas smiled, answering
reporters' questions as he kept contact with his scattered staff by
walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, passed in a shiny
convertible. Rosalynn Williams snapped what she guesses will be an
excellent photo of the back of the governor's head. Doris Miller
waved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know my slogan,'' said Miller, who had taken the
bus to the inauguration _ she doesn't drive because of her
cataracts _ and plunked down next to Erma Williams. ``Wholesome
George in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller just moved here from Ann Arbor, Mich., to be near her
daughter, Amy Miller of Amy's Ice Cream fame. She wanted to see
Bush in person, just in case he becomes the next president. She
stayed for the rest of the parade, enraptured.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best parade I've seen in decades,'' Miller said.
``Yankees don't parade much anymore. I'm so glad I came.''
</P>
<P>
   A scream from Cathy Phillips: ``Here they come!''
</P>
<P>
   The band filed past, breaking into ``The Yellow Rose of Texas.''
Cathy charged into the street, clapping and yelling. Her son, in
his dress uniform, spotted her, blushed slightly and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I embarrassed him again,'' she said. ``Did you not see him
say, `Mom, shut up!' I love that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Living History Association clopped toward them on
horseback, they attacked as a unit. Rosalynn Williams and her
family rushed forward with Revier, looking for a better angle.
Someone handed Cathy Phillips a disposable camera so she could
serve as backup photographer.
</P>
<P>
   The passing men on horseback smiled as the shutters clicked.
Then everyone settled back into their lawn chairs in the slanting
afternoon light, where they watched the last of the bands, swapped
stories about children and talked about horses until the music
stopped.

THE RUINING OF THE BULLS IS IN FULL SWING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One week after the retirement of Michael Jordan, the Chicago
Bulls are resembling a team that could lose as many games this
season as it won a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the major players from the club that won the last
three championships are only a few signatures away from fleeing the
team of the 1990's. Once the National Basketball Association's new
collective bargaining agreement is put on paper, Scottie Pippen,
Luc Longley and Steve Kerr will be gone. Each has agreed to
sign-and-trade deals that will make the Bulls younger but far less
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dennis Rodman has decided to follow Jordan's lead.
Despite being pursued by numerous title contenders, including the
Knicks, Rodman will retire to pursue an acting career, according to
his agent, Dwight Manley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm announcing that he's retiring,'' Manley said. ``He says he
wants to go into other ventures.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tim Floyd, who is in the unenviable position of replacing
Phil Jackson, has four players returning from the team that won its
sixth championship of the decade. Joining Ron Harper, Toni Kukoc,
Randy Brown and Keith Booth on the Bulls' depleted roster will be
Roy Rogers, Bubba Wells, Martin Muursepp and Mark Bryant, all of
whom will be acquired in trades for Pippen, Longley and Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls will sign Pippen to a five-year, $67.2 million deal,
with an additional $15 million in incentives, and then trade him to
Houston for Rogers, a 6-foot-10-inch forward who has played for
four teams in the past three years, and a second-round draft pick.
Longley will get a five-year, $30 million contract from Chicago,
and then will be sent to Phoenix for Bryant, Muursepp and Wells.
Kerr signed a five-year, $11 million deal with Chicago and will be
sent to San Antonio for draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Jerry Krause of the Bulls said the
sign-and-trade deals were gifts to the threesome. The arrangement
allows the players to get larger salaries than their future teams
could afford to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   But Krause is not giving without receiving. Though the Bulls are
getting little immediate help, they are positioning themselves to
be a force in next summer's free-agent market that could include
Kobe Bryant, Ray Allen, Grant Hill, Penny Hardaway and Antoine
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of when training camps begin is as iffy as the Bulls'
future. After originally targeting Tuesday as the start date, the
league office sent a memo to teams saying that camps will not open
until tomorrow at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is because of haggling between the league and the
players union over issues in the new agreement. The major point of
contention is the length of contracts signed by players under the
middle-class exception.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in an effort to flesh out their rosters, teams
continue to wheel and deal. In addition to the Chicago trades and
the Knicks' agreement to acquire Latrell Sprewell from Golden State
for Chris Mills and John Starks, the following deals have been
made:
</P>
<P>
   _In a three-team trade involving the Timberwolves, Nuggets and
Raptors, Minnesota will receive Dean Garrett and Bobby Jackson.
Denver will land Chauncey Billups and Toronto will get Micheal
Williams and two No. 1 draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   _The Los Angeles Lakers will send forward Tony Battie to Boston
for center Travis Knight. Also, the coveted free-agent forward
Antonio McDyess plans to decide Wednesday whether he will sign with
Denver or Phoenix.

A SPLIT-SCREEN DAY ON CAPITOL HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont strolled out of
the impeachment trial like a celebrity leaving the Oscars, waving
and smiling and ready to compliment the defense. Florida Senator
Connie Mack III did not react. Maine Senator Olympia J. Snowe
talked first about the afternoon's trial, then the evening's
scheduled State of the Union address, then the odd nature of the
entire thing.
</P>
<P>
   No one, it seemed, knew which part of Tuesday to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very awkward,'' Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from
Maine, said in bewilderment. ``But all of us have learned from the
president how to compartmentalize.''
</P>
<P>
   The confusion was understandable: A month earlier, the Capitol
was functioning in split-screen _ alternating between the
impeachment of President Clinton in the House of Representatives
and the simultaneous air attacks on Iraq. But Tuesday, the mood was
nothing less than kaleidoscopic, as senators filed legislation in
the morning, witnessed the impeachment trial of the president in
the afternoon, and listened to his State of the Union address at
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It points up, I suppose, the extent to which we're living in
two different worlds,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a
Democrat from Connecticut. ``Tonight, they cross. The two worlds
cross. But we'll survive it.''
</P>
<P>
   The day was rife with uncommon intersections. Actress Whoopi
Goldberg, with her companion, actor Frank Langella, took a seat in
the public gallery to watch nearly the entire proceedings, gazing
intently at White House lawyer Charles F. C. Ruff as he delivered
the defense. Goldberg was expected to return Wednesday as the guest
of Senator John F. Kerry, whose office supplied her a gallery pass
after that of Senator Edward M. Kennedy declined, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, meanwhile, had an unusually
busy day. After spending the morning at the Supreme Court, issuing
orders and hearing oral arguments, he arrived at the Capitol to
preside over the 1 p.m. trial. He planned to return to hear the
State of the Union speech at 9 p.m., rejoining the Supreme Court
justices in their traditional front-row seats.
</P>
<P>
   For senators, the day was split in three. After announcing their
agendas, both parties filed five bills each. Then they took their
seats in the Senate chamber for the fourth day of arguments in the
president's impeachment trial, with the White House delivering
opening remarks in its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators seemed distracted _ in some cases, exhausted _
by the length of the working day, which was expected to last more
than 15 hours. Senator James M. Jeffords, a Republican of Vermont,
said that he, like several colleagues, had a difficult time hearing
the remarks made by Ruff. Senator Don Nickles, a Republican from
Oklahoma, shut his eyes near the beginning of the day's trial
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But most senators, on both sides of the aisle, emerged with
positive remarks about the White House opening, although reactions
to the speech that was to follow were slightly cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awkward, to put it mildly,'' Lieberman said. ``It's
awkward in an unprecedented way. I don't think we've had this
situation, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, including Mack, a Florida Republican, took exception to
the hyperbolic terms used to describe the confluence of events.
Mack said the State of the Union has been a farce for some time and
would hardly be different simply because the president is on trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turned into a show,'' he said. ``It's a cheering section
_ who can cheer, or out-respond, the other. So `dramatic' would not
be the word I would choose.''
</P>
<P>
   For members of the House, many of whom returned from their home
districts Tuesday, the day was less of an ordeal, as they fielded
phone calls and met briefly for an afternoon session. But the
strange nature of events did not go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Democrat from Massachusetts,
said the State of the Union was a much-needed, if unusual, impetus
to change the national topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the country has gotten more information on the
Lewinsky matter than it wants,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat
who has attended 26 State of the Union addresses before Tuesday
night's, admitted, ``In my few years here, there's never been such
a looked-for State of the Union message. I don't think we'll ever
see this again: the president being impeached in one body and
giving a speech in the next.''

 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ If the hottest auction market in the country now is
in cyberspace, why shouldn't Sotheby's get in on the action?
 &HT;    Taking its cachet and gavel onto the Internet, the New York
auction house said Tuesday it would spend $25 million on a site
called sothebys.com, where the public will be able to bid on art,
antiques, jewelry and collectibles like sports memorabilia.
 &HT;    Online auctions have already taken the Internet by storm, and
consumer watchdogs have said that the emerging practice has
produced more complaints than any other Internet category because
of problems like shoddy merchandise and fraud.
 &HT;    But Sotheby's officials sought to distinguish their site from
competitors. The merchandise to be offered on sothebys.com
beginning in July will come only from the auction house or
reputable art dealers, said Susan Solomon, a former Sony executive
who was named chief executive officer of the Sotheby Internet site.
 &HT;    Just as buyers will be assured that the item has been checked
for authenticity, the auction house will also be protected from
frivolous consumers. Bids will be accepted only from customers who
have registered their charge card numbers with the auction house.
 &HT;    Sotheby's entry into the the world of online auctions comes
after other companies have already established a presence in the
business, including Ebay, which sells a huge range of products,
from Furbys to firearms.
 &HT;    Tuesday, investors signaled their approval of the new venture,
sending Sotheby's stock up by almost 25 percent to close at
$39.875, up $7.75.
 &HT;    At first, Ms. Solomon said, the estimated value of the items on
the virtual auction block will range from a few hundred dollars to
$10,000. Costlier items will go online when the imaging technology
improves, making it easier for buyers to inspect the goods from
several angles. ``There's no point in having a fuzzy image of a
$100,000 item,'' she said.
 &HT;    But she did not rule out the possibility that one day collectors
would be able to buy old masters over the Internet, paying $9
million, say, for a Rembrandt, as casino executive Stephen Wynn did
this year. ``I do see that happening,'' Ms. Solomon said, ``but I'm
not going to say when.''
 &HT;    Analysts said the Internet site would allow the auction house to
broaden its market geographically and in terms of price. Mark
Miller, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said many people think of
Sotheby's as out of their reach, when in fact 80 percent of the
items or sets in the catalog are auctioned off for less than
$5,000.
 &HT;    Merrill Lynch warned in a report in December that Sotheby's
risks offending its ``high-end clientele'' by going after Internet
users, but Miller said the company had alleviated that concern by
vowing to maintain quality control over the merchandise.
 &HT;    Ms. Solomon described online auctions as ``a natural evolution
of the business,'' and compared it to newspapers and others going
online. She said the company would save a large amount of money on
handling costs because items would not have to be moved from place
to place. ``It costs as much for us to handle a $1,000 item as a $1
million item,'' she said, ``and now every item is handled between 5
and 10 times.''
 &HT;    For its first major Internet auction, Sotheby's will offer
baseball memorabilia from the collection of Barry Halper, a limited
partner in the Yankees. Some of the 80,000 items will be sold at a
weeklong live auction, probably in July, Ms. Solomon said. The
online sale may go on for several months, giving bidders an
opportunity to study the items, just as they would at a preview at
the auction house's salesrooms in New York or London. They will
also be able to request an e-mail copy of a report describing the
item.
 &HT;    Where Sotheby's goes, its chief rival, Christie's, is likely to
follow. Taggerty Patrick, a spokeswoman for Christie's, said the
company had no immediate plans for online auctions, but is
exploring that possibility. ``Nothing will replace the magic of
attending a live auction,'' Ms. Patrick said, ``but we are
developing a strategy that looks at various collecting categories
that might be appropriate for online transactions.''
 &HT;    How will collectors react to this evolution in the art market?
Steve Shane, a New York anesthesiologist who owns 400 pieces of
art, said he has never missed a preview of a contemporary art
auction at Sotheby's or Christie's. For him, he said, collecting is
a social as well as an esthetic experience.
 &HT;    ``The previews are extremely important in my life,'' he said.
``I'll change my vacation plans to be able to go to one. I wouldn't
want to wind up staying home with my computer.''
 &HT;

 &HT;    CYBERSPACE SALESROOMS, PRESENT AND FUTURE
 &HT;    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the moment, Internet auctions are no better _ or no worse _
than giant electronic garage sales, in which thousands of potential
buyers can look at a photograph of an item but cannot inspect it,
or consult an independent expert to verify the item's quality or
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, people buy and sell things online every day, from
toys to Lincoln artifacts, especially on the largest Internet
auction service of its kind, eBay (http://www.ebay.com/).
</P>
<P>
   But eBay functions only as a sort of electronic middleman
between buyers and sellers. An item listed Tuesday as ``Ghurka
Warrior Dagger _ NEAT! PIC'' was posted with a disclaimer: ``Seller
assumes all responsibility for listing this item. You should
contact the seller to resolve any questions before bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's, in return for the commission fees it charges, employs
experts on art, jewelry, furniture and other items to authenticate
and assess what it puts up for bid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the planned auction system for Sotheby's, buyers will be
able to make multiple, successive bids in what is known as ``real
time,'' much like at a live auction. Bidding would be made through
secure servers, meaning a computer network resistant to hackers'
mischief like the theft of credit-card data. Each item for bid
would feature a photograph, a description, and a fixed period of
time for bidding. Dealers could also continuously ``upload,'' or
list, new items for bid.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, Ms. Solomon said, Internet auctions will
only be by computer and will not be combined with live auctions.

WAC GETS SPLIT DECISION ON UPSET BIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a chance to grab a season-shaking upset victory last week,
two teams from the Western Athletic Conference gave it their best
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally was ... one hit, one miss.
</P>
<P>
   The hit was delivered by New Mexico (16-2), which used a shot at
the buzzer by former TCU player Damion Walker to unhinge
seventh-ranked Arizona, 79-78.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Lobos' 56th win in their last 57 home games at The
Pit, and enabled them to move up four spots in The Associated Press
poll this week, to 12th.
</P>
<P>
   The victorywas nailed down by part of the team's Texas
Connection, which includes four players from the Fort Worth-Dallas
area _ Walker (Dallas), Kevin Henry (Denton), Greg Davis
(Arlington) and Tim Lightfoot (Everman) _ plus freshman guard John
Robinson from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson initiated the winning sequence on a break with the
Lobos down by a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was all alone until I hit the lane, then there were two guys
closing on me fast, and I saw Damion coming up the baseline,''
Robinson said. ``I looked at the clock, and it said 1.7 seconds,
and I just dished it to Damion and prayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker made the shot with two-tenths of a second to spare, and
the Lobos won a big one.
</P>
<P>
   But for Rhonda Rompola's SMU women, it was a frustrating _ and
familiar _ story.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by a dismal first half in which they shot 31 percent,
the Mustangs trailed eighth-ranked Colorado State (19-1) by as much
as 16 points _ then stormed back to within two late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams, led by 29 points from All-America candidate Becky
Hammon, stretched it back out for a 74-67 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just dug ourselves in a hole too deep to get out of,'' said
Rompola, who saw the Mustangs (7-8) lose for the fourth time this
year to a ranked team, including three _ CSU, Texas Tech, Louisiana
Tech _ in the top 10. ``I was pleased that we were able to come
back, but this was another frustrating loss.''

<P>
   SMU's Karlin Kennedy, who scored 23 points, was figuring that
things have to get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she said, ``I guess that we can at least assume that
the rest of the schedule will be a little easier than what we've
been through. Actually, we've said that before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing pretty well now, but we need to start winning or
it won't matter.'' The Buzz Responding to a rumor that SMU might be
headed for Conference USA, athletic director Jim Copeland said,
``Yes, it is a rumor. I've been hearing it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland acknowledged that he had talked with Conference USA
commissioner Mike Slive ... along with a few others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were together on the management council at the NCAA
convention last week, and we did discuss some things,'' Copeland
said. ``I guess that's how the rumor got started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I've talked to the commissioners of every conference
in the country at least once since the WAC split, and some of them
more than once. I'm just trying to learn what's going on out there;
I figure it's my job to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considered the WAC a doomed conference, Copeland
said, ``Not at all. ... I think \Rcommissioner\S Karl Benson is
working very hard on a TV contract and bowl agreement, and we
remain totally committed to the league we're in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are always rumors and scenarios, and it's just a
good idea to make sure you know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice (12-4, 3-1) remains the surprise team in the WAC after a
road split last week, while Tulsa (14-5, 2-2) is suddenly looking
for answers. Off to a fast start, the Golden Hurricane was slowed
with road losses at Nevada-Las Vegas _ where it shot 29 percent _
and Air Force.

 &HT;    Beer bash: Lobbyists, legislators enjoy inaugural libations
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You think the line of people down Congress
Avenue watching newly re-inaugurated Gov. George W. (stands for
Will-He-or-Won't-He?) Bush was long? You should have been queuing
up for free beer and prime dead cow at the invitation-only tent
party the Wholesale Beer Distributors of Texas threw.
</P>
<P>
   Now that was a line. Everybody who knew lobbyist Mike McKinney
was in it, and there's nobody McKinney doesn't know. And the Brew
Brothers, as they are often called, are known to be the go-to guys
when you need an inauguration day place to party, listen to the
Aledo High School Marching Band's interpretation of ``Rock and Roll
(Part Two)'' and to talk on your cell phone in a very intense,
focused way.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody but the Bushes, the Pope and Linda Tripp made an
appearance _ old-guard wise men like George Christian and former
Gov. Preston Smith, freshman reps looking to loosen their belts a
notch and suck up some of the good stuff, senators, Supreme Court
justices, spouses, and pundits with and without notebook
</P>
<P>
   ``I told somebody we could pass a constitutional amendment and
have the courts uphold it,'' McKinney said. ``So I think two-thirds
of 'em will be here.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just a bunch of glad-handing suits and
coiffed-to-within-an-inch-of-their-lives wives. As was the case up
and down Congress Avenue _ where wretched excess tantalizingly
mingled with just plain wretched _ the scene at the party was an
intriguing blend of players and plain folks, odd juxtapositions and
ironies. What are the odds of finding Travis County Sheriff Margo
Frasier and one of her former jail guests, Sen. Drew Nixon,
R-Carthage, under the same tent?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there's a limit to how snooty an event can be when it
offers Schlitz. (Mercifully, there were other beverage options.)
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before Bush raised his hand on the Capitol steps,
in a moment begging to be read as pregnant with political
symbolism, the sun broke through a sky that had been the color of
cigar ash all morning. The adult beverages were chilling in
barrels, and the street guy famous for wearing a tutu was installed
in front of the Starbucks down the block.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, with the swearing-in over and the swearing set to
begin, the crowd started swarming over the buffet. Stuart Coleman,
a Coors distributor from Brownwood, said about 500 invitations went
out, and there were precious few credentials left at the reception
table by the time the parade began at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Shiner and sunshine seemed to facilitate
burying the hatchet _ albeit in a shallow grave _ if only for one
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of friendship and camaraderie _ and then we have
136 more days'' in the session, said Rep. Edmund Kuempel, R-Seguin.
``You make new friends. Life is too short to not make friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We affectionately call them the Beer Boys,'' said Rep. Norma
Chavez, D-El Paso. ``And there's no other guys that work harder
with the Legislature.''
</P>

CLINTON WOULD USE TAX SURPLUSES TO BOOST SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton proposed Tuesday night the
diversion of trillions of dollars in future budget surpluses to
shore up the financially troubled Social Security program, setting
up what will be a bitter fight with Republican lawmakers who want
to use some of that money on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal, part of a four-pronged plan to delay
financial problems in the national retirement system, was more
adventurous than most lawmakers had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it fell far short of making the sweeping changes proposed
by many business groups and Republican lawmakers, who say workers
should no longer pay all of their Social Security taxes to the
government but put some of the money instead in privately owned,
401(k)-style stock accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Because the nation's workforce is aging, Social Security by the
year 2032 will have only enough money to pay three-quarters of its
promised benefits. The White House said that Clinton's plan would
keep the program solvent for an additional 23 years, until 2055.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plan would:
</P>
<P>
   --Use 62 percent of the projected budget surpluses over the next
15 years to pay Social Security benefits. The White House said this
amounts to $2.7 trillion over 15 years, a figure that critics said
relies on overly optimistic assumptions about future tax
collections.
</P>
<P>
   --Allow the Social Security system to invest as much as 25
percent of its assets in stocks and corporate bonds. These
investments would presumably pay a higher return than the Treasury
bonds the system now buys, giving it more cash to pay benefits to
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans immediately attacked the idea, saying that the
government should not own shares of corporations. ``That is fraught
with tremendous mischief, because the federal overnment will then
be in position to dictate policy to private corporations,'' said
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who leads the
House Ways and Means Committee. Senator Don Nickles, Republican of
Oklahoma, called the idea ``a nonstarter.''
</P>
<P>
   --Allow workers to open a new type of savings account for
retirement, with the government contributing some of the money. The
White House said it would propose spending 11 percent of future
budget surpluses on these contributions, equal to $500 billion over
15 years, or $33 billion a year. The accounts would work alongside
Social Security and not replace any of the benefits that the system
now promises to retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposals cut a middle line between the fixes proposed
by Democrats and certain groups representing the elderly, who
oppose private accounts, and the fixes proposed by Republicans and
business groups, which say workers would boost their retirement
benefits if they could divert some of their Social Security tax
money into private stock accounts. Clinton's plan has the potential
to win over both groups, or to alienate everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council of Senior Citizens, for example, praised
Clinton's plan but said it worried that the individual account
portion would grow in importance and eventually replace the entire
Social Security system. That would hurt low-income workers, who
cannot afford to save as much for retirement as wealthy workers,
the group said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a coalition of business groups said Clinton
did not make private accounts central enough in his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do anything to improve the finances of the Social
Security system, and I'm afraid it sets up an all-new entitlement
system by promising the matching contributions,'' said Leanne
Adbnor, of the Alliance for Worker Retirement Security, which
includes some of the nation's largest lobbying organizations: the
US Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers,
the Business Roundtable, the National Retail Federation and the
National Federation of Independent Business, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laid out plans in the State of the Union address to use
nearly all of the future budget surpluses. In addition to using 62
percent to shore up Social Security and 11 percent for worker
savings accounts, he proposed committing 15 percent to Medicare and
11 percent for military readiness and domestic priorities,
including education and research.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly objected, saying that budget surpluses come
from taxpayers and should be returned to taxpayers. Senate
Republicans Tuesday proposed cutting income taxes for all Americans
by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's proposal staves off the day that Social Security
can no longer pay all of its promised benefits, it does little to
fix the long-running financial problem in the program. The nation
will not have enough workers to pay for the benefits of Baby
Boomers who retire early in the next century, and shifting surplus
tax revenue to the retirement system is not a permanent fix for
that problem.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides acknowledged this, saying that a fourth prong
of Clinton's plan was to call on Republicans to join with him to
make ``hard-headed but sensible and achievable choices'' to put the
program on firm footing well into the future, until 2075. Some
analysts have said this can only be done by raising the retirement
age, cutting benefits or raising taxes, all politically difficult
choices.

PETTITTE AGREES TO A DEAL FOR $5.95 MILLION IN '99  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte and the Yankees led what appeared to be
a major retreat from salary arbitration Tuesday. Pettitte was one
of 15 players who had filed for arbitration but reached agreement
on new contracts Tuesday before exchanging salary figures with
their clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 settlements, which included one between Jason
Isringhausen and the Mets that still needs approval, left only 38
players to exchange numbers. Among them were Derek Jeter seeking $5
million to the Yankees' offer of $3.2 million; Mariano Rivera
asking for $4.25 million to the Yankees' $3 million, and Edgardo
Alfonzo trying for $3.85 million to the Mets' $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado of Toronto submitted the biggest number, $6.5
million, which was well short of the record high $9 million Bernie
Williams submitted a year ago. The Blue Jays countered with $4.2
million. The Texas Rangers put in the highest club figure, $4.8
million for Aaron Sele, who put in $6.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte, whose 1998 salary of $3.8 million was the highest of
the 62 players who filed for arbitration last week, agreed with the
Yankees on a $5.95 million salary. He can reach an even $6 million
if he pitches 200 innings or more ($25,000 bonus) and is named to
the All-Star team ($25,000).
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said he was not
motivated in the negotiations with Randy Hendricks, the pitcher's
agent, by a desire to avoid arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy Hendricks and I essentially put a good-faith effort
forward in trying to assess the market,'' Cashman said of the
negotiations. ``We had a lot of dialogue, a lot of disagreements.
But we analyzed them, had professional discussion and finally came
up with something we both could live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Pettitte's victory total has slipped from 21 to 18 to 16
_ he had a 16-11 record and a career-high 4.24 earned run average
last season _ some have wondered whether he will be dominating in
the future. Cashman is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I concerned? No,'' he said. ``A guy who steps up and does
what he did against the Rangers in the division series and the
Padres in the World Series, no, I'm not concerned with Andy
Pettitte at all. He had two periods where he went through slumps
and struggled, but he battled and pulled himself out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman declined to comment on the Jeter and Rivera filings.
Each player had a $750,000 salary last year, when the Yankees
renewed their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Among other players who settled Tuesday instead of exchanging
numbers (with their 1998 salaries in parentheses) were Jose
Hernandez of the Chicago Cubs $2.4 million ($725,000), Dustin
Hermanson of Montreal $2.05 million ($250,000), James Baldwin of
the Chicago White Sox $1.9 million ($300,000), Darren Dreifort of
Los Angeles $1.9 million ($685,000), Sean Bergman of Houston
$1,875,000 ($465,000) and Jay Powell of Houston three years for
$3.65 million ($320,000).
</P>
<P>
   Although the flurry of signings looked like clubs and players
preferred settlement to arbitration _ last year only seven players
settled on exchange day _ Gene Orza of the Players Association said
he didn't see a trend developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it is a function of where the numbers fall or
the relationship between clubs and players,'' Orza said. ``One year
doesn't mean anything. If it happens three years in a row, then
maybe I would say something is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little reason for Isringhausen and the Mets not to
settle because Isringhausen spent all of last season on the
disabled list and pitched very little the previous season. His
agent, Craig Fenech, said he and the club agreed on a contract that
was being held up because management's labor relations committee
was looking at a bonus provision in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provision, Isringhausen would get a bonus if he were
on the 40-man roster and pitching at any level next season. The
union approved the provision, Fenech said, but management officials
had not.
</P>
<P>
   If the contract is not approved, the two sides will exchange
numbers Wednesday, the agent said. He didn't say what those numbers
would be, but the Mets said they would submit $300,000 and
Isringhausen $450,000. He had a $220,000 salary last year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Alfonzo, the Mets exchanged numbers with Armando
Benitez, $1,575,000 and $2.4 million; Rey Ordonez, $1.25 million
and $2,275,000, and Turk Wendell $1.05 million and $1,575,000. &QL;

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton proposed Tuesday night that the
federal government invest for the first time in the stock market to
strengthen Social Security, as he delivered a confident report on
the State of the Union to a Congress considering cutting short his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in the grand chamber of the House of Representative a
month to the day after he was impeached there, Clinton also urged
Congress to begin contributing $33 billion a year to a new system
of retirement accounts for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   The president never mentioned the trial, steps away in the
Senate, where lawyers began defending him just a few hours earlier,
as he envisioned using the rest of his term to strengthen the
nation's schools, military forces and programs for the elderly.
Clinton coupled a rosy appraisal of the nation's condition with an
urgent appeal for action, flaunting his laurels but insisting he
would not rest on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is working again,'' Clinton said, according to an
advance copy of his remarks. ``The promise of our future is
limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum
of our prosperity to lull us into complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to announce Tuesday night that the Justice
Department was preparing to sue tobacco companies, opening a new
front in a war that has repeatedly gained him political ground.
Administration officials said that the president would argue that
federal programs like Medicare were due hundreds of billions of
dollars for the costs of treating lung cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The president left it to his lawyers to attack the charges he
broke the law to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky, the
former intern, Clinton clearly seized tonight on his State of the
Union Message as his most potent defense, just as for the last
turbulent year he has counted on his dogged advocacy of popular
programs to sustain him.
</P>
<P>
   The president presented his legislative shopping list _ from an
initiative to ease traffic congestion to a $1 billion program to
help people switch from welfare to work _ to a Republican Congress
with far different plans for spending the surpluses accumulating
after decades of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if some of his plans stand little chance of passage,
Clinton was able to command a traditionally vast television
audience for a recitation of the economic benefits of his
leadership _ and a powerful, implicit argument that the trial is an
unwarranted distraction from important business.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our
confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet
our historic responsibility to the 21st century,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling this time ``a new dawn for America,'' he urged his
listeners to ``put aside our divisions'' and find ``a new hour of
healing and hopefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   With the justices of the Supreme Court and his antagonists and
allies in both houses of Congress before him, the president
recognized several people in the galleries to underscore his
points. Among them, he singled out his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, whose loyalty and advice have been key to his political
stamina. He praised her for ``for all she has done for our
children'' and for ``advancing our ideals at home and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the peculiar political dynamic unfolding here,
Republican Senate leaders also seemed eager on Tuesday to play down
the trial. They laid out their own legislative agenda in the
morning, insisting that mulling the first removal ever of a sitting
president would not divert them from what the Majority Leader,
Trent Lott, called ``the people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the president called for sure-fire political initiatives
like putting 50,000 more police officers on the street, he also
used his speech to push beyond his short-term predicament. He urged
a long-term fix to the Social Security system that, according to
his associates, he hopes will shine through the historic blot of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Expected a political free-for-all over the coming budget
surplus, Clinton urged Congress in his State of the Union Message
last year to ``Save Social Security first.'' That proved a deft
political move, stifling Republican appeals for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But with the surpluses growing and a new politics of prosperity
firing legislators' imaginations, Senate Republicans declared that
they would seek a 10 percent cut this year in personal income tax
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Clinton again moved to box them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reach out my hand to all of you in both house of both
parties and ask you to join me in saying: We will save Social
Security now,'' he said. ``Last year, we wisely reserved all of the
surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security.
Again, I say, we should not spend any of it until after Social
Security is truly saved. First things first.''

TEXAS SUSPENDS MUONEKE AFTER PUNCHING FOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   University of Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes suspended
forward Gabe Muoneke yesterday for Saturday's game with Oklahoma
State for unsportsmanlike conduct during Monday's game at Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke punched Jayhawks players Nick Bradford and T.J. Pugh in
the body during Texas' 76-67 loss, which was televised nationally
on ESPN. Muoneke, the Longhorns' leading scorer, punched a
Wisconsin player during a Dec. 15 game, and Barnes warned the
6-foot-7 junior forward that he would face punitive action if a
similar incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke issued a public apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I would like to apologize to the University of Kansas,
its players and coaching staff for my actions,'' he said. ``I'd
also like to apologize to the Big 12 Conference and the University
of Texas. Most of all, I would like to apologize to my family and
the fans of the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am embarrassed and ashamed of what I have done. I said after
the Wisconsin incident that this behavior would not happen again,
but as the whole nation saw, it did. My behavior was inexcusable
and totally inappropriate, and I want to fix it. I will seek any
and all help to allow me to overcome this.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke underwent counseling last year in an effort to control
his on-court behavior, and Barnes has tried to help him channel his
competitive fire.

   ``I really am disappointed because I thought he'd really tried
to work hard with it,'' Barnes said. ``I just don't know why all at
once it happened. I do know Gabe wants to do so well and when
things don't go well he gets extremely frustrated. But there are
certain ways you react and certain ways you don't. And you don't do
what he did.''

 WASHINGTON: things first.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a month, the White House has deliberately leaked out
proposals from Clinton's State of the Union speech to capture
headlines showing the president at work. But it held back its plans
for Social Security as well as for tobacco, to insure that
Clinton's substantative proposals, rather than the spectacle of his
appearance before Congress, would drive Tuesday night's news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued that 62 percent of forthcoming federal surpluses
should be earmarked to preserve Social Security, a program that was
at the heart of the Democratic New Deal but that has since
developed overwhelming popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Another 15 percent of the surpluses, Clinton said, should go to
protect the Medicare program, which assists the elderly with health
care. The president would spend about 11 percent of the surpluses
to create new retirement savings accounts, called ``universal
savings accounts.'' Under his plan, money put into the accounts by
workers would be matched by the federal government, which would
spend some $33 billion a year on the program.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the surpluses _ roughly another 11 percent,
according to the administration _ would go to defense and domestic
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Clinton proposed that $2.7 trillion of a projected $4.4
trillion in surpluses in the next 15 years be reserved for Social
Security. The changes Clinton seeks in the system, the
administration contends, will keep it solvent until 2055. It is now
projected to run out of money to pay the claims of retirees _ who
are expected not only to grow in number but also to live longer _
by 2032.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration's goal is to secure Social Security until
2075, which means Tuesday's plan even by Clinton's standards is
only a partial solution. Clinton made clear that he had no interest
in pursuing politically unattractive options, like tax increases or
what he called ``drastic cuts in benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued that Social Security would be stronger if it
could invest some of its trust fund in the stock market, where it
could earn higher returns than from the Treasury bonds it invests
in now. Although state governments invest their pension plans in
stocks, this would be the first venture by the federal government
into the market.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he proposed investing up to 25 percent of the new money
for Social Security, or $700 billion, in stocks over the next 15
years. Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic
Council, said that under this plan, Social Security would never
have more than 15 percent of its assets in the market, a level he
called ``far, far more conservative than any pension plan in the
country does.''
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said that the federal investment would account for
about 4 percent of the money in the market _ less than half of the
investment of state and local governments and about equal to that
of the Fidelity family of mutural funds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he would work with Congress to create a
privately managed system to invest the money without political
interference.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans signaled they had no interest in the president's
suggestion. ``Government-controlled investment in markets is
contrary to free enterprise,'' said Bill Archer, the Texas
Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
He said such investment ``will open the doors to all kinds of
mischief involving government dictates, favoritism and cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the surplus money Clinton hopes to reserve for
Social Security _ about $2 trillion _ would, like the money he
would set aside for Medicare, go to pay off the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   That would simultaneously reduce the amount of government debt
and increase Social Security's financial reserves. It would help
bring down interest rates, stimulate new investment and help create
conditions for faster economic growth to guard against the strains
caused by the retirement of the Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said that under this plan, the federal debt would fall
as a percent of the domestic product from 44 percent today to less
than 10 percent by 2014. When Clinton took office, he said, that
number was 50.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing his fix for Social Security, Clinton heeded the
demands of his core Democratic constituencies, rejecting a
Republican call that individuals be permitted to make some of their
own investment decisions about the money that the government
deducts from their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he called for maintaining Social Security as a
``defined benefit'' plan, that is, one with a guaranteed payout.
But Tuesday night he also proposed the system of personal savings
accounts, which are similar to what Republicans are seeking as at
least a partial replacement for Social Security. For the president,
the new accounts would supplement Social Security, not replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Each worker would receive some flat payment, say $100, to open
an account. If he or she then chose to deposit more money,
administration officials said, the government would match a portion
of it, perhaps in the form of a tax credit. Sperling said that the
administration favored weighting the matching system so that it
provided greater benefit to lower-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides repeatedly referred to the agenda he presented
Tuesday night as the most aggressive he has offered since 1993 and
far different than the kind of agenda one might expect from a
president contemplating his seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   They were emphasizing that Clinton intended to stick around, and
they were trying to draw a sharp contrast with the Republicans.
Clinton proposed a raft of domestic initiatives, including several
to bolster education. This year, Congress must reauthorize the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as it does every five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes to amend the law, which governs aid to
private schools, to demand that states and school systems begin
testing new teachers for competence, identify failing schools and
shut them down if necessary, and end practices like ``social
promotion,'' or routinely moving children into the next grade even
if they have not gained the necessary skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year the government invests more than $15 billion in our
public schools,'' Clinton said. ``I believe we must change the way
we invest that money, to support what works and to stop supporting
what does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed a series of narrowly targeted tax
credits, rather than the kind of broad-based tax cuts that
Republicans favor. He said that he would seek a $1,000 credit to
help families pay for long-term care and another $1,000 credit to
help disabled peopled return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted a relatively small portion of his speech to
foreign policy. He proposed a 70 percent increase, to $4.2 billion
over five years, in financing to stem nuclear proliferation from
the states of the former Soviet Union. The money would to destroy
plutonium that could be used to make weapons, as well as to put
8,000 Russian scientists to work in civilian research.

EMPHATIC `NOT GUILTY' OPENS THE CASE FOR THE DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS 5th graf of 2nd take, But Ruff said ..., to ADD reasons
why Ruff opposes calling witnesses; minor changes elsewhere.)  (See related stories: IMPEACH, IMPEACH-STEELE) 
(nk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Insisting that President Clinton ``must not be
removed from office,'' White House counsel Charles Ruff opened the
president's defense against impeachment charges on Tuesday with
sweeping denials of the accusations against Clinton and stinging
attacks on the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's arguments ranged from the facts of the case to the laws
Clinton is alleged to have broken to the constitutional
ramifications. His tone was sometimes matter-of-fact, sometimes
laced with irony, and at the end charged with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Jefferson Clinton is not guilty of the charges that
have been preferred against him,'' the counsel said in a bare-bones
opening, which he repeated later in a concise, emphatic
presentation. ``He did not commit perjury. He did not obstruct
justice. He must not be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   After rebutting the charges in the two articles of impeachment
in some detail, Ruff told the 100 senators sitting in judgment of
the president that they must be sure ``beyond a reasonable doubt''
to find him guilty. Even then, he added, they must ask themselves
before voting to convict whether Clinton's conduct has brought the
nation for the first time ever to ``the horrific moment in our
history when our union can be preserved only by taking the step
that the framers saw as a last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign in Ruff's 90-minute speech of the contrition
that has marked some White House responses to the president's
sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, which underlies the
impeachment debate. But neither did he attempt to justify his
client's behavior. He said he was ``not here to defend William
Clinton the man,'' and added in an aside that some of Clinton's
answers to questions about Ms. Lewinsky were ``certainly not
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the House managers, who spelled out their charges over
three days last week, Ruff was scornful and sometimes patronizing,
like a law professor lecturing inattentive students. One of their
key arguments, he said, was made of ``sealing wax and strings and
spider's webs,'' not facts or logic. Their case, he said, was built
on ``shifting sand castles of speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was deferential to the senators, as if to play upon
senators' inherent disdain for what many of them view as an unruly
lower house.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have before you,'' he said, ``is the product of
nothing more than a rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff replied directly to the lead prosecutor, Rep. Henry J.
Hyde, R-Ill., in the emotional high point of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Hyde had invoked the heroism of American fighting
men who had died on battlefields from Bunker Hill to Normandy in
his florid wrap-up speech. Ruff, who has used a wheelchair since he
contracted a polio-like virus while teaching in Liberia from 1963
to 1965, said he had ``no personal experience with war'' and never
knew quite how to respond to courtroom adversaries who called up
``images of patriots over the centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knew one thing, he said: His father ``was on Omaha Beach
55 years ago.'' As a deeper hush enveloped the silent chamber, and
his voice broke, Ruff continued: ``If you want to know how he would
feel if he were here today, he didn't fight, no one fought, for one
side of this case or the other. He fought as all those did for our
country and our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the counsel's office say that Ruff's father, Carl
N. Ruff, had been an infantryman who had taken part in D-day, June
6, 1944. He died at 84 last April and is buried at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's arguments were aimed squarely at those the House managers
had made last week, and he met each one head-on. One that had
impressed some legal experts was the Republicans' contention that
since the Senate had in recent years removed judges from office for
perjury, they could not set a lower standard for presidents. Quite
the contrary, Ruff declared; judges are appointed for life, and can
be removed only through impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a president is on trial, the balance is very different,''
the counsel insisted, because voters can oust presidents at the
ballot box. ``Here you are asked, in effect, to overturn the will
of the electorate, to overturn the results of an election held two
years ago in which the American people selected the head of one of
the three coordinate branches of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff did not contend, as some defenders of Clinton have done,
that presidents can be indicted and convicted only for official
acts. He said he could conceive of private offenses that would be
impeachable, but he argued that the offenses, private or public,
must be those that ``subvert our system of government'' or cause
other kinds of deep damage to the commonweal.
</P>
<P>
   At the Constitutional Convention of 1787, he told the senators,
George Mason of Virginia proposed that the word
``maladministration'' be added to bribery and treason among the
impeachable offenses. But James Madison of Virginia and Gouverneur
Morris of New York objected that the word was too vague and would
mean in practice that a president sat at the pleasure of the
Senate, he said, so it was dropped and replaced by the phrase
``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the subject of dispute ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff judged the impeachment articles ``constitutionally
defective'' _ at another point he said they were ``infected with a
constitutional infirmity'' _ because they were loosely drawn. They
bundled multiple alleged offenses, he said, which was unfair
because it opened the door to some senators finding guilt on one
charge and others on other charges. That might add up to the
two-third needed to remove Clinton from office, even though
two-thirds of the senators did not consider him guilty of any one
violation.
</P>
<P>
   He also complained that the managers had imputed offenses to
Clinton in connection with his testimony in the Paula Corbin Jones
sexual harassment suit, which led to the uncovering of the
president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, even though the House
had defeated an impeachment article charging him with perjury in
that case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have treated these articles as empty vessels'' to be
filled with whatever accusations the managers chose, Ruff said.
``The managers cannot be allowed to rely on what the Judiciary
Committee thought were false statements encompassed in a rejected
Article II to flesh out the unconstitutionally nonspecific charges
of Article I.''

 WASHINGTON: of Article I.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruff himself spoke at some length on several pivotal points.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of whether Clinton lied when he denied that he had
touched Ms. Lewinsky's breasts and genitalia _ Ruff called them
``certain parts of her body'' _ the counsel said this: ``For proof
you have only her oath against his oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the managers, said
much the same thing: ``If you believe the testimony of Monica
Lewinsky, you can't believe the president.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum told the senators that if they had doubts about Ms.
Lewinsky's credibility, they should ``bring her in here and let us
examine her face to face, so you can judge her credibility for
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ruff said he opposed calling witnesses, noting that the
Senate had asked the parties to address the issue only after
opening presentations. He also pointed out that the voluminous
testimony and evidence already in the record had not proved the
President guilty of impeachable offenses and offered no basis for
the House to impeach Mr. Clinton or for the Senate to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   He hit particularly hard at two instances of what he called
``fudge'' by the prosecutors, almost but not quite calling them
liars or cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   One involved the hiding by Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, of
presents given by him to Ms. Lewinsky. The Republicans have long
suspected that Clinton had told Ms. Currie to go and pick them up,
and that Ms. Currie had called Ms. Lewinsky on her cell phone to
arrange it. They cited Ms. Currie's cell phone record, which showed
a call at 3:32 p. m. on Dec. 28, 1997, the day in question.
</P>
<P>
   The hiding of the presents is an element in the charge of
obstruction of justice. But there were problems, Ruff said, with
this ``epiphany.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he argued, the call had lasted a minute or less,
not enough time, he said, to arrange a meeting. More important, he
said, Ms. Lewinsky had three times testified that the pickup took
place at 2 p.m. on the 28th _ in other words, before the call in
which it was purportedly arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of the obstruction count involves the efforts of
Vernon Jordan, the Washington lawyer who is Clinton's close friend,
to get Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York. The Republicans have
suggested that that was done to buy her silence. Last week, Rep.
Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a manager, had said that the search only
began in earnest once Clinton and Jordan learned in early December
that Ms. Lewinsky was to testify in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruff showed logs indicating that Jordan met with Ms.
Lewinsky from 1:15 p.m. 1:45 p.m. on Dec. 11, after making two
calls to prospective employers that morning. Then Jordan took a
plane to Amsterdam, the counsel said, boarding a United Air Lines
flight at 5:55 p.m. at Dulles International Airport in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan Webber Wright, presiding in the Jones case, told
lawyers of her decision to permit Ms. Lewinsky's testimony towards
the end of a conference call that same day, Ruff said. But the
court's records showed that it began at 6:33 p.m and ended at 7:45
p.m., well after Jordan's flight was airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff was the only person to speak Tuesday, but three other
defense lawyers are to make the case in more detail Wednesday and
Thursday, along with former Sen. Dale Bumpers, who comes from
Clinton's home state, Arkansas.

CHIEF REGULATOR OF FUTURES STEPPING DOWN FROM AGENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooksley Born, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, said Tuesday that she would step down from that post,
ending a year of sharp public disagreements with other regulators
and Clinton administration officials over regulation of the
financial derivatives markets.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came just a few months before President Clinton
would have decided on whether to reappoint Ms. Born to a second
five-year term. Administration officials say that there was little
expectation that she would have been reappointed because Ms. Born
openly broke ranks with some of the administration's top economic
advisers _ including Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. The issue was
her edging toward tighter regulation of the thriving market in
over-the-counter derivatives,
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Born, who was appointed by Clinton in 1996 to oversee
the commodity futures and options market, said Tuesday that the
debate over regulating the derivatives market did not play a role
in her decision against seeking a second term. After careful
consideration over the holidays, Ms. Born said, she had decided to
return to her ``true calling,'' the private practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the controversy played any role,'' she said in a
telephone interview. ``The fact that Congress and the other
financial regulators and a number of international organizations
are now addressing the major issues posed by the over-the-counter
derivatives market is very gratifying to me. It makes me feel as
though these issues are being left in good hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over whether the complex financial instruments known
as derivatives ought to be more heavily regulated, though, clearly
contributed to the criticism of Ms. Born. The global marketplace
seems increasingly bent on deregulation, despite several
high-profile disasters in the derivatives market, most recently the
near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund
rescued in a federally orchestrated bailout by a consortium of Wall
Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, when Ms. Born issued a ``concept release'' seeking
comment on the regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives
market, the commission came under a barrage of criticism, from Wall
Street officials who saw the attempt at tighter regulation as
costly and cumbersome and from Washington officials who believed
that the commission was overstepping its jurisdiction and creating
legal uncertainties that could drive business offshore.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the ``concept release'' was issued in May, the
Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan; Rubin and Arthur Levitt,
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, issued a joint
statement saying that they had grave concerns about the
commission's action.
</P>
<P>
   Mark C. Brickell, a board member of the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, said that even though the commission
action had educated Congress about the importance of derivatives
activity, Wall Street officials were troubled by the move.
``Regulations that make it harder to manage risk raise widespread
concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Born later said that she was not intent on creating
regulatory burdens, but had simply been raising important
questions, particularly about the need for more information for
hedge funds and others that trade in the derivatives. Still,
Congress and Treasury officials evidently thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials lobbied Congress to pass legislation that
would prevent the commission from regulating the over-the-counter
derivatives market, which is now only loosely regulated through
banks and brokerage firms. It is a huge multitrillion-dollar market
that allows investors to manage a great deal of risk, and
administration officials said any move to increase regulation would
weaken the market.
</P>
<P>
   After public hearings, Congress blocked for six months any move
by the commission to enact regulation of the over-the-counter
market, where financial instruments like interest rate swaps are
traded.
</P>
<P>
   The last 12 months have been a volatile time for Ms. Born, 58,
who was on the short list of those under consideration for attorney
general in late 1992, shortly after Bill Clinton was elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Born _ who sent a letter to the president Tuesday
stating that she would not seek a second term _ said that she did
not feel any bitterness over the derivatives debate and that she
had confidence the regulators would improve the market and protect
the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   She said the ``concept release'' issued last May made more sense
in light of Long-Term Capital's near-demise, which unnerved markets
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Long-Term Capital Management vividly demonstrated
to many people that the issues that had been raised in the concept
release were important,'' she said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edison Jackson could not take it anymore. The
buckling floors. The falling tiles. The undrinkable water. Rain
trickling into classrooms and hallways. A faulty fire alarm system.
Then, part of his office ceiling came crumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   So Jackson, the president of Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn,
sounded the alarm, imploring trustees of the City University of New
York to do something to stop his school from literally falling
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Repairs and maintenance are a constant problem for colleges _
even affluent ones like Yale. And with aging buildings, slim
budgets and benign neglect, most CUNY campuses have some serious
physical problems, said Christoph M. Kimmich, who toured CUNY's 19
campuses after becoming interim chancellor in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the conditions at Medgar Evers, in Crown Heights, are
extreme, and some people, including Jackson, say the college has
been allowed to remain in disrepair because it has been relegated
to second-tier status within CUNY.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who it is, but someone has made decisions to
place us at the bottom,'' Jackson told the trustees at a committee
meeting about campus buildings earlier this month, his voice calm
but his anger barely in check. ``You can't do this unless it's a
conscious decision.''
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 5,000 students crammed into space designed for no
more than 2,800, the Medgar Evers campus is bursting at the seams.
One of its two main buildings, a former high school, dates back 100
years, and parts of it are in disastrous shape.
</P>
<P>
   Medgar also has the unique and unenviable distinction of being
the only four-year college at CUNY classified as a two-year college
for capital budget purposes _ the legacy of being bounced back and
forth between the two designations. When the state Legislature
returned Medgar to four-year college status in 1994, it did not
change its capital status as a community college.
</P>
<P>
   That means that all capital spending was supposed to be shared
by the city and the state. But, CUNY officials say, the city argues
that it should not have to pay capital costs for a four-year
college, and the state will not release capital funds unless the
city agrees to match them.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Medgar Evers College, which was named for the
slain civil rights advocate, has been given short shrift since its
founding in 1970 in response to community pressures for greater
access for minority students and for a four-year college in central
Brooklyn. Even today, 98 percent of its students are members of
minority groups. About half are blacks born in the United States,
and half are from the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five years ago, were we to have seen these conditions
at a campus of a public university in Alabama or Mississippi and
noted the racial composition of the student body, we would have had
no difficulty explaining the conditions,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, a
political scientist at Hunter College and the faculty
representative on the buildings committee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the decade since Jackson arrived as president, Medgar has had
something of a rebirth. Enrollment now stands at about 4,600
students, sharply higher than 10 years ago, although down from the
5,400 peak reached two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But as enrollment has grown, the buildings have not kept pace.
Classes spill into 12 trailers in one of the school's parking lots.
With 42 usable square feet per student, Medgar has less space per
student than any of CUNY's 10 other senior colleges and less than
all but one of CUNY's six community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The space itself has problems. The elevators of the 11-year-old
Bedford Avenue building, an attractive, sprawling, three-story
brick edifice, have a history of breaking down. Large portions of
the roof need repairs. The heating and air-conditioning system
works poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Medgar's Carroll Street building, the four-story brick and
limestone converted school two blocks away, makes the Bedford
building look good. From the outside, the building appears stately
and well-kept. The bricks look new, the limestone clean. But black
netting, like a veil, drapes the top floor to catch flying bricks
and other debris. Inside, the illusion of elegance disappears in
hallways with buckled floors and ceilings where the tiles bulge
outward and are ringed with dark water stains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it rains outside the building, it rains in here,'' said
Esther Hundley, Medgar's superintendent of buildings and grounds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rooms that takes the biggest beating every time it
rains is the fourth-floor biology lab right below the roof. The
room was empty of students last week, since it was intersession.
Five computers ruined by rain damage were parked in one corner.
Covers for the room's lighting fixtures leaned against a lab bench,
since water would collect in them if they were put up.
</P>
<P>
   Several workers were tearing up ruined floor tiles, exposing
wood that looked shredded and rotten. Medgar never replaces the
whole floor; that is too expensive. So between the lab tables, the
floor was various shades of beige, a vinyl mosaic representing
various patching sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about whether they match; we've just got to
replace them as quickly as possible,'' Ms. Hundley said.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, a professor was hit by plaster when a portion of
the ceiling fell in her office. Water still drips from the holes
that remain. ``We fix this. We fix that. Water comes in from the
roof and ruins it,'' said Anthony De Santis, an architect and
assistant to Ms. Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a Catch-22,'' he added. ``Repairs are postponed, then a
little project becomes a big project, and then we cannot do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that efforts are not being made.
</P>
<P>
   At the committee meeting, the trustees directed that fire and
safety violations be cleared up immediately. But CUNY officials say
it will take longer to deal with all the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the issues over the city's obligation to put up capital
funds, both Medgar and CUNY have been pouring in money, and the
state dormitory authority, which handles most construction, has
been a frequent presence on campus.
</P>
<P>
   CUNY says that about $1.5 million in construction projects _
including new water tank controls and the installation of
protective netting _ have either been recently finished or are in
some stage of design or construction. Another $1.7 million in
repairs have been approved. And CUNY is leasing space elsewhere so
administrators can move out of Carroll Street, opening more
classrooms. In addition, CUNY has designated a new academic
building for Medgar as a major goal.
</P>
<P>
   Emma E. Macari, CUNY's vice chancellor for facilities planning,
construction and management, said that among the projects that the
city and state share responsibility for, Medgar is now the No. 1
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson acknowledges CUNY's efforts. but says they have fallen
short, which is why he finally went to the trustees this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, they have been tremendously responsive to our
needs,'' he said, as he pointed out work going on in the Carroll
Street building. ``On the other hand, it has not been enough.
Everyone has to stop passing the buck and make this building
inhabitable.''

SHOT BLOCKER IN PLACE, NETS SEEKING CHEMISTRY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For all of their grace, athleticism and
leaping ability, the Nets have not been too skilled at blocking
shots. For that reason, the few players who worked out Tuesday at
the club's Champion Center praised Monday's three-player trade that
sent Michael Cage and Don MacLean to Seattle for Jim McIlvaine, a
7-foot-1-inch center who specializes in swatting shots away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a shot blocker,'' said Keith Van Horn, the 6-10
forward who rises high for dunks but not rejections. ``We don't
really have a pure shot blocker and that's what he is. If he can
come in here and affect some shots, he'll give us that dimension
that we haven't had before.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Nets are glad to have strengthened one of their
weaknesses, they also hope that the shopping and dealing that has
characterized the league this week will not affect them further. It
is not that Nets players believe that they have arrived and are
ready to challenge for a championship, but in a 50-game season, in
which team chemistry and familiarity will be more significant, the
Nets want to remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's trade, which becomes official as soon as the
league's new collective bargaining agreement is completed, the Nets
have nine players returning from last year's playoff team. With
only about two weeks to prepare for the regular season, that will
give Coach John Calipari's club an advantage over the many teams
whose lineups are in flux. ``If more guys keep coming in and out of
here, it's going to be hard because we only have five days to put
everything in,'' said Nets forward Chris Gatling, who has been the
subject of trade rumors. ``The more guys we have on our team who
have been here, the more guys who know the system and what we're
trying to accomplish. If a lot of the guys are new, it's going to
be hard to adapt, and with only 50 games and 12 weeks, there's not
too much room for error.''
</P>
<P>
   McIlvaine's presence is not expected to be a problem. He will
not be counted on to score or to rebound in the 15 or so minutes a
game he will play. All the Nets want from him is two blocked shots
a game. If the fifth-year veteran can do that, the Nets will have
all they need to be a solid defensive team _ quickness, strength,
heart and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a team has a shot blocker, it seems like the
perimeter defenders and all the other defenders on the floor seem
to take a few more chances,'' Van Horn said. ``They play a little
more aggressively than they normally would because they know if
they gamble and lose, they have somebody sitting back in the middle
helping them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade for McIlvaine has led to speculation that center Rony
Seikaly will be the next Net to be traded, because the club now has
three centers good enough to demand playing time. But the starter,
Jayson Williams, can also play power forward, which will allow both
Seikaly and McIlvaine to get their minutes. Steve Kauffman,
Seikaly's agent, said he would most likely have heard from teams
who were interested in trading for Seikaly because of his
complicated contract, a six-year, $23.3 million deal that is
guaranteed for the next two seasons, but not this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard from anybody,'' Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade leaves the Nets, who are hoping to re-sign the
free-agent point guard Sherman Douglas, with one open spot on their
roster. Van Horn, who plays both forward spots but who prefers
power forward, hopes the team fills it with a gifted wing player
who can spell the 6-5 Kendall Gill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need an athletic small forward,'' Van Horn said.
``Because, right now, Kendall is sometimes undersized and when I
play there, sometimes I get a 6-6 guy on me, who's a little quicker
than me. I think if we can get somebody who's 6-7 or 6-8 and
athletic, that would help us out a lot.''

BACK TO DRAWING BOARD: JETS CONTEMPLATE MOVES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Parcells says he wants to upgrade at least seven areas on
the Jets. He will retool, not rebuild, a team that he seems fond
of.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he made his first off-season moves by submitting the
names of five players for the Cleveland Browns. Four are free
safety Jerome Henderson, who started nine games before being
benched; Chris Hayes, a special teams star; the long snapper John
Hudson, and Mike Gisler, a rarely used offensive lineman. The Jets
will announce the fifth player Wednesday. They can lose only two
players and can pull one back after the first selection is made.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets finally have salary cap room and have the flexibility
to obtain a major performer. The possible areas include free safety
_ that spot is virtually vacant _ or defensive end or big
pass-rusher or one of the guard positions. ``You tell me who's out
there, and maybe I can tell you what I'm going to do,'' Parcells
said of future personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Does the Jets' future include Parcells' longtime defensive alter
ego, Bill Belichick? The Bears and the Chiefs will be talking with
Belichick in a process that Parcells believes will come to quick
conclusions. Perhaps Belichick is ambivalent about remaining as the
orchestrator of the defense and assistant head coach. Why else
would he bother interviewing for another team's head coach's job?
</P>
<P>
   He has been promised the Jets' job when Parcells steps down.
Parcells, though, said he will return next season. Belichick may
never be in demand more than now. The Jets finished second to Miami
by 1 point for yielding the fewest points in the National Football
League, putting together a defense that was recognized for its
originality and surprises.
</P>
<P>
   If Belichick leaves, the likely new defensive coordinator would
be Al Groh, the linebackers coach, who has been with Parcells for
13 seasons, including stints with the Giants and the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has some question marks at linebacker. If Marvin Jones,
who missed the entire season with knee surgery, returns in good
health, then his strongest unit is even better. He expects Jones to
successfully return, but is less certain about Casey Dailey, the
fifth-round draft pick he had hoped would become a pass rusher and
generally active linebacker. Dailey suffered a serious foot injury
and also was out for the season. While he continues his
rehabilitation, the medical staff is unsure about when he can
return and what difficulties he may have.
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of Chad Cascadden at linebacker, and the
return of Jones, the club will probably return to a 3-4 alignment
as its basic defense. Still, a quarterback sacker would be nice.
</P>
<P>
   The search will continue for a free safety. Kevin Williams, who
was a rookie, started the season there and lost his spot. Scott
Frost may still get a shot at it, while Corwin Brown finished the
season there.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more of a problem at guard. Parcells does not know
if he can re-sign Matt O'Dwyer on the right side, and the coach has
been ambivalent about Todd Burger on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is an intriguing situation at tight end.
Parcells said he wants to keep two distinct types, the typical
blocker, short-pass-catching style exemplified by Kyle Brady, as
well as the more dangerous downfield weapon personified by his new
acquisition, Johnny Mitchell. Brady may test free agency, although
Parcells claims he wants him back.
</P>
<P>
   While Parcells is set at quarterback and running back and
receiver, he seems uncertain about their backups. And the most
famous backups are always at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Glenn Foley, who started the season until
losing his job, first to injury and then to the talented Vinny
Testaverde, Parcells was noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to talk it over,'' Parcells said. ``I don't know
yet. Tell me what's out there, what's available, who they want to
trade to me. Until you know what's coming your way or what you may
be able to do, you just don't know.'' Foley suffered silently after
being benched for Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Parcells will try to replace the punter John Kidd, who
will turn 38 before the 1999 season. Kidd's average of 41.1 yards
was the lowest in the conference, although he produced a 47.9
average in the championship game last Sunday. He is also an
excellent holder.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps when the last films have been graded over that loss to
the Denver Broncos, Parcells will decide that what caused the Jets'
collapse was not necessarily being beaten by a better team, but by
one that performed better in the clutch. For two-thirds of the
Jets, who had never been in a playoff before, that experience
probably helped.

SMALL-COLLEGE RECRUITING A WHOLE DIFFERENT GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the dream of high school youngsters across America. They
wear UCLA and USC jerseys, among others, hoping some day to wear
one just like it for the university of their choice on crisp, fall
Saturday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   It's the dream of major college football -- airtime on ESPN,
bowl games, individual glory. It's just a stop on the ``Show Me the
Money'' road to shoe deals, endorsements and an NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   For most, though, the dream is shattered once the telephone
rings.
</P>
<P>
   The reality for most athletes is they'll be lucky to get a call
at all. And if they do, it likely will be from the coach of a small
college, such as Whittier, La Verne or Occidental.
</P>
<P>
   Ask small college coaches about recruiting against schools with
corporate sponsors like Nike and Adidas and they admit that the
``Who? Huh?'' responses are as common as, ``Can you repeat that
again?''
</P>
<P>
   University of La Verne football coach Don Morel admits having to
sound out the name for Leopards recruits: ``That's La-Verne.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny,'' Morel said. ``When I call a recruit,
they're hoping to hear from a Miami or Texas. When I say I'm from
La Verne, it's like `La Verne?' You can hear the sigh in their
voices. There is definitely disappointment at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Morel says the challenge of recruiting at a small college
without athletic scholarship money is, arguably, the toughest in
college coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge for small schools like us is to find a kid
who is willing to be at a place like a La Verne, Azusa Pacific or
Whittier,'' Morel said. ``Their whole life, these kids have dreamed
of being on scholarship and playing football for free. But then,
reality sets in about December or January of their senior year (in
high school) and they realize they need to be doing something.
That's when we come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Whittier coach Bob Owens has recruited at the Division I level
before. He admits Division III recruiting is a whole different
ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy like me calls, the last thing on (the player's)
mind is Whittier College,'' he said. ``Some don't even know we play
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say to an athlete who has dreamed the Division I dream of
being on scholarship and playing in front of millions of people to
come to Whittier College is a tough thing to listen to at first.
But once they get past that letdown, it's our job to pick that kid
up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the selling begins:
</P>
<P>
   A scholarship vs. loans and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the scout team vs. life as a real player.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell these kids we offer what any successful person wants
-- an education,'' Owens said. ``I guarantee you, once these
student-athletes are in school and settled, their vision starts to
change. You now have a student working hard because he's paying his
own way through school, and he's actually playing in football games
instead of running around on scout teams somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have a kid not disappointed anymore with his decision.
And a kid who is grateful at what he's become -- a real
student-athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Small colleges also have found that the ``marginal'' athlete is
as tough to recruit as a blue-chip recruit if he doesn't have the
grades. At UCLA or USC, a qualifying Scholastic Aptitude Test score
and a decent grade-point average in the right core classes can
warrant a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   But without scholarships to offer (APU does has a few), the
target athlete for schools like APU, La Verne, Whittier and
Occidental needs the grades and a high SAT score to go with his
ability.
</P>
<P>
   Money is also a formidable obstacle at private institutions. At
La Verne, for example, tuition is roughly $15,800 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Morel and the other coaches have learned that most students
can't afford the high tuition. They are, therefore, forced to
recruit athletes with excellent grades, narrowing their choices
even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it; grades are everything,'' Morel said. ``If you have
a 3.2 GPA, you can get a Cal grant and that can be worth about
$9,200 right there to your family,'' Morel said. ``And if you are
from a low-income family, you can get another $3,000 in federal
grants. Now, to a special kid working hard, that's about $12,000 he
can save his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``And any kid with a 3.5 GPA or higher can get $6,000 from La
Verne.''
</P>
<P>
   Occidental coach Dale Widolff says recruiting students first and
players second is the only route he can take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. You sell the academic standards,'' Widolff said.
``The blue-chippers, we're not going to get them. This is a tough
educational institution we have here, so we go after mature,
astute, high-standard individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Morel says an athlete not making the grade is better off at a
junior college.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you ask a guy to pay $15,000 a year when they can
register for 58 bucks at a JC?'' Morel asked. ``All we can do at
that point is sell the four-year college experience. And if you can
work it out with loans, it's a pretty rewarding experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bottom line is grades. A very small percent, probably
less than one percent, get full football scholarships. That should
tell a kid right away that, if he wants to play football after high
school, his grades are the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem for high school students looking at the
small colleges is dealing with the peer pressure and teasing that
comes with enrolling at an APU or Whittier, as opposed to receiving
a scholarship from Ohio State or Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in high school, we laughed at people going to JCs
and I didn't even know what NAIA football was,'' said APU wide
receiver Shawn Zook. ``I was close to walking on and settling for
the scout teams at a big school, but I'm glad I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more athletes are finding that the small college route
isn't a bad path to take.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is APU's Albert Baker. He was an All-American at
Saddleback College. He was recruited by many Division I schools
but, after seeing what some of his friends went through at Division
I programs, he chose APU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of friends go Division I, and it's not all the fun
it's cracked up to be,'' said Baker. ``It's business and, if you're
not playing, you're not having any fun at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could tell a guy out there deciding right now, I'd say,
`Look, go somewhere you have a good chance to play and get a good
education at the same time.' To have memories of actually playing
football in college is much better than carrying around your scout
team jersey for the rest of your life.''

PATAKI PROPOSES $600 MILLION IN INCOME TAX CUTS, WITH A 3-YEAR
WAIT
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Promising to keep cutting taxes, Gov. George
Pataki on Tuesday proposed $600 million in income tax reductions,
mostly aimed at the middle class, that would not go into effect
until 2002 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed timing of the plan was a first for Pataki, and it
raised complaints among Democrats that he was trying to sustain a
reputation as a tax cutter while making sure the bill would not
come due for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki would double the tax exemption for a child or other
dependent, from $1,000 to $2,000, which would be worth $68.50 a
year to taxpayers in the top income tax bracket. And he would raise
the floor for that top bracket from $40,000 to $60,000 for a
married couple, a savings of $190 a year for couples earning
$60,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts work,'' he said. ``They help put dollars back in the
pockets of the people who earn them.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan got a lukewarm reception from Joseph Bruno, the
Republican majority leader of the Senate, who made it clear that he
was still bent on securing his own tax-cut package this year, one
that would make college tuition fully deductible.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's proposal met with a cool silence from Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, who said he would
wait to see what is in the Republican governor's proposed budget,
to be released next week, before passing judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said that the 1999-2000 budget he is proposing for
next year would raise spending at less than the rate of inflation.
To meet that goal, he is expected to call for budget cuts,
particularly in health care, that are certain to be opposed by the
Legislature. Democrats may argue against a new round of tax cuts
that could constrain spending even further.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he would include the tax cuts in his proposed
budget, though they would have no effect on that budget, or the
next one. In all, he said, he wanted to enact $1 billion in tax
cuts this year _ he would not say what the other $400 million would
consist of _ but that very little of that would go into effect in
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki may want immediate action on tax cuts, but he is delaying
implementation out of necessity. In his four years as governor, the
state has enacted tax cuts that are worth $7.4 billion in this
fiscal year and will be worth $12.8 billion a year when fully
implemented, in 2001-02.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki made a tacit admission this month that it would be a
challenge to pay for those cuts, proposing that the state's budget
surplus be set aside to pay for the reductions and that any
increase in state spending be kept under the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts say the tax cuts could help put the state
in a precarious position in a few years, especially if there is a
recession, and the governor's own budget office last year predicted
a $5-billion deficit next year. But Pataki on Tuesday dismissed any
suggestion of trouble on the horizon. ``We don't have a $5 billion
deficit,'' he said. ``The state is in good economic condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's previous tax cuts have begun to take effect
either in the year he proposed them, or the year after. Asked why
he was proposing a reduction this year that will not be felt for
three years, he insisted that he had always looked far down the
road in making changes that affect state finances. ``This year's
budget is not just about this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But several top Democrats in the Assembly, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said politics was clearly at work, and some noted not
only Pataki's ambitions to be seen as a possible national
candidate, but his promise that he would not run for a third term
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, cut taxes now, and somebody else can pay the tab,'' said
Senator Martin Connor of Brooklyn, leader of the Democratic
minority. ``If we could have a truth-in-politics law, a politician
wouldn't be able to claim credit for a tax cut that isn't in effect
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's first and biggest tax cut, enacted in 1995 and phased
in over three years, was a 25 percent drop in the state's personal
income tax. The top rate dropped from 7.875 percent to 6.85
percent, and the point at which that rate kicked in rose from
$26,000 for a married couple to $40,000. The governor's new
proposal would raise that threshold to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The dependent tax exemption has been frozen at $1,000 since the
1980s. John Faso, leader of the Republican minority in the
Assembly, said it was $650 as long ago as 1960, so that in real
terms, the exemption has dropped sharply in value.

 &HT;    Entrepreneur puts stock in home networks
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ John McHale, the Austin entrepreneur whose magic
touch with startups led to two acquisitions worth a combined $596
million within four years, has lined up a third act _ a company
that wants to network your home.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McHale disclosed that he will make a $5 million
investment in the stock of AMX Corp. of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   AMX shares rose $1.25 to $11 in Nasdaq trading Tuesday,
increasing its market value to $91 million. It made $1.7 million on
sales of $34.1 million for the first six months of its fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes hardware and software that enables homeowners
to control household items such as lighting, heating, air
conditioning and entertainment equipment from one source. It will
extend that control to the Internet with new software to be
introduced in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   McHale sold his first company, NetWorth Inc., to Compaq Computer
Corp. in 1995 for $360 million. He used some of that money to start
NetSpeed Inc., which develops technology for fast Internet
connections over telephone lines. He sold NetSpeed to Cisco Systems
last year for $236 million. He remains a consultant to Cisco,
though he has left the company's direct employment.
</P>
<P>
   McHale's move takes him into a technology that Cisco is delving
into. At this month's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Cisco
Chief Executive John Chambers demonstrated an automated home system
with Web-operated shades, air conditioning and a Web browsing
microwave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people at Cisco and the people at AMX, including myself,
are really looking at the same trends and coming to the same
conclusion,'' McHale said. ``The home is the next frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   With its new software, AMX intends to team up with consumer
electronics companies such as Pioneer to bring products that let
users manage appliances and electronics from a set-top box or
Internet browser window. Using such a unit, a user could control an
alarm system or air conditioner or set appliances to turn off and
on.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few days, the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic
has broken just about every important promise he made last fall to
end his offensive in Kosovo. His security forces, which remain
deployed in Kosovo in violation of the agreement, apparently
massacred 45 ethnic Albanians in the village of Racak last Friday.
He is now blocking war crimes investigators from entering the
country and is seeking to expel the head of the international
mission monitoring compliance with the agreement. Milosevic, who
agreed to the plan only to head off NATO air attacks, now seems
confident that NATO is too divided to use force to hold him to his
promises. To prevent further massacres and spur a negotiated
solution, NATO must carry out its bombing threat if Serbia
continues its defiance.
</P>
<P>
   The October agreement between Milosevic and the American envoy
Richard Holbrooke came after Serbian shelling of villages and
atrocities by the special police drove hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanian civilians into the mountains, where they faced cold
and hunger as winter set in. The shelling did stop, and people
returned to their villages, which saved countless lives. But both
sides have repeatedly violated parts of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanian guerrillas have killed Serbian police and
taken soldiers hostage. They have used the pause in fighting to
retrain and smuggle in weapons. But Milosevic's violations are
worse. He has built up his special forces in Kosovo, where they
have arrested and tortured thousands of ethnic Albanians, kept
emergency food from entering, and are now arming the Serbian
minority.
</P>
<P>
   NATO should give Milosevic a short deadline to comply with all
his promises, including a pullout of his forces and full
cooperation with international monitors, humanitarian agencies and
the war crimes tribunal. If he refuses, it should pull out the
monitoring force and bomb selected Serbian military targets. If, as
has been his habit, he promises compliance but then reneges, NATO
must immediately resume the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing must be coupled with a warning to the ethnic
Albanians that the West's goal is to protect civilians, not help
the guerrillas win. NATO troops may be needed on the Albanian
border with Kosovo to stop arms smuggling to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Decisive NATO action should also prod Milosevic into negotiating
an end to the conflict. The American diplomat Christopher Hill
offers the right solution: a return to the autonomy Kosovo enjoyed
before Milosevic took over. While the ethnic Albanians want
independence, they might accept autonomy within Yugoslavia that
left open the possibility of independence later.
</P>
<P>
   The more intractable problem is Milosevic, who has no interest
in peace as long as the war helps rally the nationalism that keeps
him in power. Washington, which has often treated him as a partner,
is now rightly criticizing him and increasing its support for
democratic forces in Serbia. It should also turn over any
information in its possession implicating Milosevic in crimes to
the tribunal, which could indict him. Most important, NATO must
remember that further vacillation will only lead to more death and
disintegration.

EDITORIAL: RUFF FOR THE DEFENSE

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff put a battering ram to the impeachment case against
Bill Clinton on Tuesday, in effect trying to bring down the entire
edifice by dislodging one or more of the core arguments presented
by the House prosecution team last week. It was an audacious and in
some ways effective strategy, but it may invite just the kind of
protracted Senate battle over witnesses and other matters that the
White House hopes to avoid and the nation longs to do without.
</P>
<P>
   Though genteel in demeanor, Ruff, the White House counsel, was
blunt and occasionally caustic in disputing the House case on
constitutional, legal and factual grounds. If the White House
cannot persuade a majority of the Senate to dismiss the case next
week, it must hold at least one-third of the senators against later
conviction. Ruff probably advanced the cause of eventual acquittal
more than he did quick dismissal. His colleagues will fill in the
details on Wednesday, and Dale Bumpers, recently retired from the
Senate, will close the White House presentation on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's strongest defense was constitutional, as he showed by
opening with it. The framers of the Constitution, Ruff cogently
argued, intended the impeachment, conviction and removal of a
president to be a sanction of last resort that would be reserved by
Congress for instances of extreme presidential misconduct against
the state. President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky
and his efforts to conceal it debased his office but did not
threaten the welfare of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff convincingly challenged the assertion of House impeachment
managers that the Senate must hold wayward presidents to the same
standard it has established in removing federal judges for
committing perjury. Disrupting the quadrennial election cycle to
cut short a presidential term is a far more consequential act than
ending the term of a federal judge, and the standard for doing so
must be higher. That is why a number of judges have been removed
from office by impeachment but no president has.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff was less successful in contesting the facts and the law. In
maintaining that Clinton did not lie under oath before a federal
grand jury or try to impede justice, he offered an innocent
reconstruction of Clinton's conduct that defies both common sense
and much of the evidence presented by the House. No recapitulation
of Betty Currie's role in retrieving Clinton's gifts to Lewinsky,
or rehearsal of Vernon Jordan's job search for Lewinsky, can
extricate Clinton from the mess he created.
</P>
<P>
   In charging that the House unfairly manipulated the evidence,
Ruff gave ammunition to those senators who wish to call witnesses
to resolve conflicts in testimony. That would be a shame, for the
Senate already has all the evidence it needs to know that Clinton
lied about the affair. It also knows that the appropriate sanction
for his misconduct is censure, not removal from office.

EDITORIAL: CLINTON'S NEW AGENDA
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan. 20:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton opened what was effectively the second front
in the war over his presidency on Tuesday night. Shortly after his
lawyers argued the fine legal points on impeachment in the Senate,
Clinton outlined his most ambitious domestic agenda since 1993. Its
centerpiece, a vast scheme to set aside $2.7 trillion over the next
15 years to strengthen Social Security, and $650 billion more for
Medicare, served notice that the president's battle to stay in
office would include efforts to revitalize the big safety-net
programs that are extremely popular among the swing voters whose
support he needs in the impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political troubles could be seen immediately in the
awkward applause of many Republicans, which he tried to defuse with
an opening call for a new ``spirit of civility and
bipartisanship,'' and a handshake with the new House speaker,
Dennis Hastert. But his speech was designed to be bold and to try,
even in depressing circumstances, to show his political resilience.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks the White House has dribbled out
bite-sized initiatives in education, the environment, crime and
military preparedness, leaving the impression that his State of the
Union speech would be another laundry list, commendable in many
respects but not very inspiring. Instead he recommended that more
than $4 trillion in surpluses projected over the next 15 years,
most of it from the Social Security system itself, be mobilized for
retirement and health programs, individual savings accounts and
some spending initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The president was playing his best political cards at a time
when the country can afford to act and address these long-term
problems. In 15 years, when baby boomers start to retire, Social
Security will drain money rather than generate it. Clinton has
wisely rejected a Republican proposal, endorsed by some Democrats,
to strip away a portion of the Social Security safety net and
replace it with a system of individual investment accounts,
jeopardizing the retirement of those unlucky or unsophisticated in
the ways of the market. Instead he proposes to have 15 percent of
the Social Security trust fund eventually invested in the stock
market. This is a promising but sweeping new idea with assumptions
about the market and other factors that will need to be studied
closely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's other innovative proposal would channel $500 billion
over 15 years in matching funds for new voluntary retirement
accounts outside the Social Security system. It has some attractive
features, including a progressive approach of weighting the
benefits for those with lower incomes. But since the Republicans
control Congress and the impeachment battle will probably leave a
bitter aftertaste, the president's plans are certain to be more of
a conversation opener than a blueprint for the future. Trent Lott
and other Republican leaders signaled on Tuesday that they would
seek to use a major portion of the budget surplus for
across-the-board tax cuts. Clinton has at least defined the debate,
and many Americans are likely to favor shoring up the nation's
social safety net over passing out tax cuts now.
</P>
<P>
   The president deferred for a later day the debate about
adjustments, and perhaps new limits, on both Social Security and
Medicare. He called on the Congress to work in a bipartisan way to
enact such changes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Clinton's smaller proposals for education, the
environment, crime, military readiness and research will probably
find broad support in Congress. We hope he also fulfills his pledge
to make a strong push for campaign finance reform. If he can emerge
from the corrosive debate over impeachment and lead a cooperative
effort that borrows some ideas from the opposition, he could put a
productive stamp on his final two years in office.

TENSE TIMES AND EMPTY SHOPS ON FRONT LINE OF BRAZIL'S
HYPERINFLATION BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
  (See related BRAZIL-ECON) 
 (fb) 
By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ At the Cal Center shopping gallery in the
tony neighborhood of Jardim Paulistano here, there are more
salespeople than customers. The employees mill about the pharmacy
and the appliance store, the computer shop and the shoe boutique.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's empty stores are perhaps the clearest sign that the
country may be able to avoid a return to the inflation that many
predict is inevitable. With customers already scarce, any sudden
price increases would only make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Idle store employees say they are hanging on and hoping for
better days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really have any pattern to follow,'' said Paulo
Evandro, a 35-year-old salesman at Victor's Appliances. Evandro has
watched his commission slide from to a meager 1 percent of sales,
from 1.5 percent, lost his carfare and lunch subsidies, and had to
move his family in with his brother's to save on rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules change every day,'' he said quietly. ``Lately, the
idea is just to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   With Brazil's sudden devaluation of its currency, the real _
which the government spent tens of billions of dollars in recent
months anchoring to the dollar _ the greatest danger is a return to
hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   Until the country's Real Plan began in 1994, creating a new
currency and controlling inflation by pegging it to the dollar,
most Brazilians had never lived without high inflation. In the
years before it began, inflation peaked at more than 5,000 percent
a year. Last year, it was less than 1 percent. The Real Plan, the
single defining achievement of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's presidency, took aim not just at runaway price increases,
but at the culture that went with them.
</P>
<P>
   It meant a stunning change for a people accustomed to racing
through supermarkets to beat a treadmill of constant price
increases. At its start, it took a special advertising campaign to
instill the idea that coins had value and should no longer go into
the garbage. Brazilians were grateful and responded by re-electing
Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Real Plan faces its toughest moment.
</P>
<P>
   Following the decision on Monday to float the currency, Cardoso
can no longer rely on pegging the real to the dollar to counter
inflation. So he has turned to a stiff increase in basic interest
rates to do the job of fighting inflation for now.
</P>
<P>
   He has also threatened to retaliate against any dramatic price
increases by lowering trade barriers for imports. ``All they have
to do is begin to play with prices and I'll lower tariffs,''
Cardoso said. ``That is my decree.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, on imported goods where price increases are
striking first. At Victor's Appliances, a cordless Panasonic phone
rose to 220 reals by Tuesday, from 189 last week _ not even
covering the loss in the currency, which went to 1.55 to the dollar
from 1.22 last week.
</P>
<P>
   A 29-inch Mitsubishi television jumped to 995 reals, or $642,
from 875 reals, which were worth $729 last week. But domestic
products, like a table fan at Victor's, did not go up from last
week's 30 reals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Business has been suffering since October, and picked up only
briefly for Christmas, Evandro said. ``We increased prices the
minimum possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Air fares have gone up already, with the lowest price on the
popular Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo shuttle jumping to 113 reals from
65 last week. A highly successful sale on air fares, with
reductions of up to 35 percent, has been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   At Electro, a major electronics chain in the mall, Maria Lucia
Desiree, the store manager, said prices and credit terms had not
become more onerous in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   But even without the devaluation, interest rate increases and
fears of surging inflation in recent days, the store has been
charging customers 6.9 percent interest a month on purchases _ or
nearly 83 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Desiree said the store relied on having a few customers buying
several appliances at once. She pointed out an imported
side-by-side refrigerator-freezer, selling for 5,290 reals, or
$3,413, and said one had just been sold on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will come in and buy a refrigerator, a stove and a
washer all at once,'' she said. ``In this neighborhood, people are
not affected so much'' by the recent turbulence in the Brazilian
economy, she added.
</P>
<P>
   But Dorival Sachette, a 30-year-old salesman in the same store,
said his life has been affected because the price of basic food
items is going up. Milk is up to 95 centavos a liter from 79 last
week; cooking oil had risen from to 1.15 reals from 99 centavos,
and beans jumped to 2.40 from 1.80 for a kilo, equal to 2.2 pounds.
``I notice a big difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cokau clothing store, where British rock, jeans and
T-shirts set the mood, Fernando da Silva, the 19-old-store manager,
said prices had not gone up. ``The crisis obliges us to keep prices
low, so we can continue selling, and not fall into a crisis that's
even worse,'' he said. ``So far, we've maintained the former
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The key question for many here is whether five years of economic
stability has been enough to cure Brazilian industry and labor of
its culture of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   William Eid, a professor of financial markets at the Getulio
Vargas Foundation here, said, that the recessionary effect of high
unemployment and scarce credit would not be decisive in determining
whether inflation returns. ``When we have recession, the oligarchy
tends to raise prices to guarantee a return on its investment,'' he
said.

RUFF ATTACKS IMPEACHMENT CASE AGAINST CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening the defense for President Clinton on
Tuesday, White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff attacked the
impeachment case put together by House Republicans as a ``witches
brew of charges'' that should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-pronged assault, Ruff took aim at the conclusions and
motives of House prosecutors and urged the Senate to avoid ``that
horrific moment in our history'' when a president would be removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking so quietly that some senators leaned forward in their
desks to hear, Ruff began his dry, detailed defense by declaring
that the president did not lie to the grand jury and never
obstructed justice as alleged in two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Clinton, the nation's 42nd president and
only the second to be tried in the Senate, grew out of his effort
to conceal a sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White
House intern half his age. If convicted on either charge, Clinton
would become the first president forced from office by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by Ruff, the defense offered by a team of White
House and private attorneys over the next two days will cast doubt
on arguments House prosecutors made last week to terminate
Clinton's presidency. The president's legal team also will argue
that even if true, the charges do not merit his removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In the sharpest attack yet on the House prosecutors' case, Ruff
said the two articles of impeachment have ``no constitutional
underpinnings'' and are not supported by the evidence provided by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors _ a 13-member team of Republicans led by
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois _ ``have, in essence, treated these
articles as empty vessels to be filled with some witches' brew of
charges,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a court anywhere (that) would hesitate, if they
were confronted with an indictment written like these articles, to
throw it out,'' said Ruff, the last of the special prosecutors
during the Watergate scandal that prompted the resignation of
President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever your feelings may be about William Clinton the man
... ask only this: Should William Clinton the president be removed
from office?'' Ruff asked the 55 Republican and 45 Democratic
senators who are sitting in judgment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff challenged the assertion by House Republicans that Clinton
must be removed because he is damaging the presidency. ``Are we at
that horrific moment in our history when our union can be preserved
only by taking the step that the framers (of the Constitution) saw
as a last resort?'' Ruff asked.
</P>
<P>
   Methodically poking holes in the case against Clinton, Ruff
accused House prosecutors of ``fudging'' some key facts. ``Be wary,
be wary of the prosecutor who feels it necessary to deceive the
court,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a vivid example, Ruff used telephone records and other
documents to unravel a key claim by prosecutors that Clinton friend
Vernon Jordan intensified his search for a job for Lewinsky on Dec.
11, 1997, the day a judge ruled her testimony could be used in the
Paula Jones case. House prosecutors claim Jordan was helping
Lewinsky so she would not cooperate with Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff pointed out that Jordan's efforts on Lewinsky's behalf that
day occurred hours before the judge convened the hearing. And when
the ruling was issued late that evening, Ruff said, Jordan was on
an overnight airplane flight to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence of obstruction of justice is equally murky, Ruff
said, pointing out several instances where he believes prosecutors
embraced sinister interpretations of events that could be explained
more innocently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (House) managers have misstated the record, have
constructed their case out of tenuous extrapolations without
foundation, have at every turn assumed the worst without the
evidence to support their speculations,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly impressed by Ruff's explanation of the Dec. 11 time
sequence, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said it ``blew a hole as big as
a barn door in the prosecution's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Ruff's presentation casts the
House case in doubt. ``It is a very serious problem for the House
of Representatives to have presented this fact so erroneously ...
on such a critical issue in their presentation,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republican senators said Ruff's presentation,
which included an argument against calling witnesses, bolstered the
call by prosecutors for live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``By raising questions about disputes in sworn testimony, he may
have strengthened the case for witnesses,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Ruff finished and the Senate trial recessed for the day,
House prosecutors quickly appeared before television cameras to
dispute several points from his presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said Ruff ``focused on little time
discrepancies'' and ignored the broader case. Rep. Charles Canady,
R-Fla., said Ruff merely proved that the president's defense is
engaging in ``legal hair-splitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchison, an Arkansas Republican who stressed the
importance of the Dec. 11 order in the drive to find Lewinsky a
job, modified his argument. ``It was the witness list (issued Dec.
5) that really kicked things into gear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect the Senate to muster the votes necessary to convict
Clinton, but even Democrats acknowledged it was probably inevitable
the Senate would agree _ in a vote currently set for early next
week _ to call witnesses in the first presidential impeachment
trial since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Already looking beyond the White House presentation, Senate
Republican leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said testimony should be
sought from key figures in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Lott said, testimony could help clear up the
nature of Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky; how Clinton's
secretary Betty Currie was assigned the role of retrieving gifts
the president gave to Lewinsky; and the involvement of Jordan in
trying to find Lewinsky a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to get into details'' of the Clinton-Lewinsky
trysts at the White House, Lott said, contending both sides can
avoid getting into ``the lurid details'' to help the Senate reach a
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors galleries were half-filled Tuesday for most of the
trial, although the appearance of actress Whoopi Goldberg and actor
Frank Langella created a stir among some tourists.

varsity volleyball player in high school, she lettered in each of
her four years. A valedictorian, she went to St. Bonaventure
University on an academic rather than an athletic scholarship. She
walked on and became a leading player on the women's volleyball
team. When she graduated in 1993, just two-and-one-half years after
she enrolled, she had two years of athletic eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts to claim those two years while doing postgraduate
work at two other institutions have led to an unusual lawsuit _
National Collegiate Athletic Association vs. R.M. Smith _ which
will be heard before the United States Supreme Court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the case centers on Title IX, which bars sex
discrimination at educational institutions that receive federal
funding, all sides agree that the underlying issue is whether the
NCAA is subject to the nation's major civil rights laws on race and
disability as well as gender.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Title IX applies to the NCAA Its member
institutions, some 1,200 colleges and universities, do receive
federal funds and they pay dues to the NCAA. But Elsa Cole, the
NCAA's general counsel, said that as a private organization, the
NCAA does not directly receive federal funds and is therefore not
covered by Title IX or for that matter, by the Civil Rights Act of
1964 or the more recent federal disabilities laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that Title IX is an important concept and we
endorse it wholeheartedly, but it applies to our member schools and
not to our organization,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the lawsuit is the NCAA's main concern: becoming a
party to a vast number of lawsuits regarding eligibility
requirements involving its member institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But legal advocacy groups representing student-athletes are
furious that the NCAA seeks to remove itself from the civil rights
laws of the land. They believe that the NCAA's member schools have
ceded authority to the NCAA, and that the organization is therefore
governed by Title IX, as its member schools are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA determined with panache, coercion and the muscle of
its Committee on Infractions to install itself as the arbiter of
intercollegiate athletics throughout this nation,'' Barbara Ransom,
of the Public Interest Law Center of Philadelphia, wrote in a
friend of the court brief filed in the Smith case.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom represents a group of special education students with
learning disabilities who have sued the NCAA in another case
because their athletic careers were cut short when the NCAA refused
to accept the legitimacy of their high school courses.
</P>
<P>
   Another advocacy group, Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, said
the NCAA is using the Smith case to remove itself from liability
under the Civil Rights Act. In a current nationwide class-action
suit, Cureton vs. NCAA, lawyers assert that African-American
student athletes are being denied athletic scholarships because
they cannot meet the NCAA's minimum score requirement on the
Scholastic Assessment Test, which they feel discriminates against
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NCAA denies it is the recipient of federal funds,
Adele Kimmel, a lawyer in the Cureton case, said the NCAA receives
federal funding for a summer National Youth Sports Program. Cole
said that the youth program is administered by a separate entity
supervised by the NCAA and that Congress never intended the funds
for NCAA use.
</P>
<P>
   In another friend of the court brief, the U.S. solicitor
general, Seth P. Waxman, said Renee Smith should be permitted to
amend her complaint to include material on the National Youth
Sports Program but he also said the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals failed to apply the appropriate test when it held that the
NCAA is a recipient of federal funds. The appeals court ruling, he
said, ``is tainted by legal error.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith believed she was entitled to complete her two years of
eligibility when she arrived at Hofstra University in 1993 to
pursue a master's degree. A student cannot seek a waiver, but its
university can, and Hofstra officials agreed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that under the circumstances the NCAA would definitely
grant me a waiver,'' Smith said. ``But they denied the waiver. They
did not say why. I was extremely disappointed. Then I enrolled in
law school at the University of Pittsburgh in the fall 1995. I went
to the athletics department and like Hofstra they appealed the
bylaw for me. This time, the NCAA would not even consider reviewing
it because they had already made a decision and they wouldn't look
at it again.''
</P>
<P>
   In turning her down, the NCAA cited its post-baccalaureate bylaw
that says a student athlete may not engage in varsity sports at any
school other than the one from which the student earned an
undergraduate degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA later recognized there was a significant problem,''
Cole said in the interview last week. ``The case highlighted it and
we corrected it ourselves, which is the way a membership
organization works.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cole pointed out, if a student meets the transfer
requirement, he or she can use the last years of eligibility at his
or her graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, at age 23 and still a law student, Smith did not
have that recourse and sued the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   No lawyer would take the case, so she did it herself. In her
civil procedure class she learned to draft a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   She lost at the District Court in Pittsburgh, but the appeals
court ordered the district court to let her amend her complaint.
The NCAA now wants the United States Supreme Court to reverse that
order.
</P>
<P>
   This is a case with virtually no court record. One obvious
question if Smith gets beyond the procedural issue: can she show a
pattern of gender discrimination? She claimed that the NCAA
violated Title IX because it granted more waivers for men than it
did for women.
</P>
<P>
   Cole, the general counsel of the NCAA, said that on the merits
alone, Smith is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, we were applying more waivers percentage-wise to
women than to men,'' Cole said. (The NCAA granted waivers to 10 of
35 men who requested them, 28.6 percent; whereas 5 of 15 women, 33
percent, received waivers.)
</P>
<P>
   The new NCAA policy concerning graduate students will not help
Smith. She is no longer a student. Because the NCAA denied her a
waiver, she could not play volleyball. Her collegiate playing
career is over, but she is still seeking damages. This time not as
a law student, but as a lawyer. Last month she was admitted to the
bar.  &QL;

BEWILDERMENT AFTER ABL PLAYER'S APPARENT SUICIDE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By LENA WILLIAMS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until she stood before her younger sister early Monday morning
with a shotgun in her hand, Katrina Price seemed ready to get on
with her life, friends and acquaintances of the 23-year-old Waco,
Texas., native said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Price, the leading career scorer for the Stephen F. Austin
women's basketball team and a rookie guard with the Philadelphia
Rage of the American Basketball League, had been disappointed that
the women's pro league abruptly declared bankruptcy last December.
But no more so than other players, people close to her said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Price had expressed interest in playing professionally
overseas. But when an agent called with a possible offer, Price
never called him back. She had decided to return to her alma mater
to pursue a master's degree in education, and was enrolled for the
current semester. Her younger sister, Lucretia, is a junior at the
university, and they shared an apartment near campus.
</P>
<P>
   It was there, inside a bedroom, that Price apparently committed
suicide, according to the police in Nacogdoches, Texas. Responding
to reports of screams and a gunshot inside the apartment about 7
a.m. Monday, the police found Price dead of an apparent gunshot
wound.
</P>
<P>
   Lucretia Price told the police that she awoke that morning and
saw her sister holding a gun. According to a family friend who
spoke with the younger Price after the incident, she said that her
older sister twice tried to wound herself with the weapon that
morning. On a third attempt, she placed the gun to her head, the
friend was told. A shotgun was found under Price's body. There were
no signs of a struggle, and the younger sister was not considered a
suspect, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Ralph Ervin said Tuesday that the case was being
investigated as a homicide because there were no witnesses to the
incident. Price's body was sent to a medical examiner in nearby
Lufkin for an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Price described her as a confident, intelligent
young woman with a sweet quiet manner that endeared her to
teammates, in college and in the pro league.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors from Stephen F. Austin met with members of the
Ladyjack basketball team and coaching staff, who were said to be
visibly shaken by the news. Some were former teammates of Price,
who had graduated last May. Students plan to hold a memorial
service for the 5-foot-10-inch former all-American, and an all-star
game of ABL players this Sunday will be dedicated to Price,
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over Tuesday, those who knew Price expressed surprise
that she would take her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe it,'' said Teresa Weatherspoon, guard for
the New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball
Association. Weatherspoon lives near Nacogdoches. ``She had talent,
smarts and potential. My prayers go out to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Chasity Melvin, a close friend and teammate of Price on the
Rage, remembered her as a player who worked hard and got along
extremely well with her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being rookies we were going through a lot of the same
issues,'' Melvin said through her agent, Erica McKeon. Melvin is
playing professionally in Spain. ``We bonded because of that. I
felt very close to her. She spent Thanksgiving with my family. All
I can say is that this comes as a big surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite an illustrious college career, Price had a less than
stellar season in the pros. Drafted seventh over all last May by
the Long Beach Stingrays, the team disbanded before Price played a
game. She was placed on the Rage squad last August. She averaged
2.7 points a game as a reserve guard.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, many of Price's former colleagues questioned whether
the demise of the ABL may have been a factor in her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to think that, but we don't know what was going on
with her,'' said Jennifer Azzi, a guard for the San Jose Lasers of
the ABL and one of the players who is spearheading the all-star
game. Azzi said she did not personally know Price, but was
nevertheless shocked by news of her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can somehow connect and relate to the psychology of
someone who may have gone through similar things in life, playing
the sport,'' Azzi said by telephone from San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Price is survived by eight sisters. &QL;

   &UR; AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RULING RIPPLES THROUGHOUT TEXAS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a federal court decision effectively ended affirmative
action in Texas college admissions, sparking a national debate over
racial preferences. Two years later, the ruling appears to be
reaching beyond student admissions into faculty hiring with the
termination of a program at the University of Texas that helped
increase the number of minority professors to 332 in 1997 from 214
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Target of Opportunity program at the University of Texas at
Austin, which had been in place for 10 years with an annual budget
of $300,000, provided money to departments to help them lure
minority scholars.
</P>
<P>
   But a spate of reverse-discrimination lawsuits that followed the
1996 ruling on student admissions, known as the Hopwood decision,
convinced administrators that the same principles were likely to
apply in recruiting new faculty members. The program was quietly
discontinued at the start of the academic year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advised the U.T. system that when it comes to hiring
decisions that include race, they will be subject to the strictest
scrutiny,'' the university's general counsel, Ray Farabee, said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ricardo Romo, a professor of history and former director of
the program, now works to encourage deans to keep minorities in the
pool of potential hires. ``If we don't, the department will think
no one cares,'' Romo said. ``We have to keep the race dialogue
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The system's chancellor, William Cunningham, created the Target
fund in 1988 while president of University of Texas at Austin. At
that time, minorities accounted for 9 percent of the university's
faculty. By 1997, the last year Target money were used, that number
had grown to 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked fairly well while it lasted, to tell you the
truth,'' Cunningham said. ``But it was a classic set-aside program
and the courts have held on numerous occasions that set-aside
programs are illegal. It's as simple as that.''

   &UR; OHIO INTERNET COMPANY SUED OVER SCHOLARSHIPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ohio filed suit Tuesday against World Education Access, an
Internet company based in Dayton, charging that it runs a
fraudulent college scholarship program. The company offered ``a
scholarship for everyone'' in exchange for membership fees and took
thousands of dollars from scores of applicants without providing
the promised aid, Attorney General Betty D. Montgomery of Ohio
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission says scholarship fraud has grown as
college fees have increased and state and federal aid has fallen.
Karen Watkins of Oakland, Calif., whose son, Wesley, sent the
company $1,289 and got nothing in return, said Tuesday: ``I hope
this will prevent others from being damaged.''

   &UR; FROM IBSEN AND MOLLUSKS TO MAH-JONGG AND FISHING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Academic credit for fly fishing? Or how about a course to
improve your skill in the Chinese game of mah-jongg? Or a course to
study the fanciful gadgets dreamed up by the makers of ``Star
Trek''?
</P>
<P>
   College courses have come a long way since ``Ibsen and His
Time'' and ``The Life Cycle of Mollusks,'' and some of the zaniest
are offered at Western Maryland College in Westminster, Md., a
small private liberal arts school near Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a three-week-long mini-mester between the fall and
spring semesters, and so we decided to ask faculty to use that time
to teach subjects they don't usually get to teach,'' said Joyce
Muller, a spokeswoman for Western Maryland College.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the birth of the courses mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
   To see how effective the mah-jongg course has been, students
will face off Thursday against the Ladies Mah-Jongg Club at the
Hannah More Senior Center in nearby Reisterstown.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fishing season is still far off, fly fishing
students have been refining their technique in a gym rather than
beside a brook.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Star Trek'' aficionados are being encouraged to look
seriously at such science fiction hardware as phasers,
transporters, replicators and the holograph deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just being silly,'' said Michael Panunto, a professor
of physics at Western Maryland College who teaches the course. ``By
thinking seriously about these inventions we can begin to ask the
right questions and figure out what might be needed to have a
machine that could respond when someone says `Beam me up,
Scotty!'''

ABOUT NEW YORK: A CARDINAL'S-EYE VIEW OF A GROWING NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The moving van has yet to roll up to Cardinal John
O'Connor's residence on Madison Avenue. Although at 79 he has
passed the church's mandatory retirement age of 75, he continues to
serve at the discretion of his friend and superior, Pope John Paul
II. So, what gives with all the boxes he has been sending to the
archdiocese's seminary in Yonkers?
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal is not cleaning house; he has history on his mind.
The boxes, several dozen so far, contain speeches, letters and
assorted awards from his tenure as Roman Catholic Archbishop of New
York. They have joined hundreds of other boxes, albums and books
from his predecessors that now spill out of three rooms at the
seminary's library. Come September, the documents will have a new
home at the seminary's Archbishop John Hughes Heritage Center, a
climate-controlled archive and exhibition space for scholarly
research on the church in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the archive's value, O'Connor said, goes beyond church
matters. He said it offered an often-overlooked perspective on the
city's growth, as seen through the church's network of schools,
charities and societies that turned immigrants into Americans.
While some social critics have recently embraced the notion that
churches can save the inner city, the archives show that such work
was being done since the diocese's founding in 1808.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the church here parallels the history of New
York and in many ways is one with it,'' the cardinal said. ``We are
an immigrant church today. We were an immigrant church 200 years
ago. Right now, I'm meeting with a group of concerned individuals
about how do we support the Mexican community. In trying to come to
grips with this, I have been going back and seeing what was
recorded in how we dealt with immigrant populations through the
past 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   A striking example is found in the legacy of the center's
namesake, Archbishop Hughes of the mid-1800s. Dagger John, as he
was known, defended the Irish immigrants, who were scorned as
criminals and louts. His battles with Protestants whom he accused
of anti-Catholic bias in the education of poor children led him to
start a system of parochial schools. When nativist riots were
threatened, he rounded up 1,000 militiamen to protect the
cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an enormous impact on the city,'' the cardinal said.
``He was almost alone in recognizing the needs of the immigrants
and the contemptuous treatment of them. He helped them integrate
into society.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Marguerita Smith, the seminary's archivist, said such
efforts eased the way for other immigrants who arrived facing even
more hurdles than the Irish. The Italians who settled in New York
in the late 1800s, she said, did not speak English and were often
beholden to padrones who treated them like indentured servants.
Archbishop Michael Corrigan established the St. Raphael Society to
break those ties and encourage assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priests would try to meet them at Ellis Island so they
wouldn't fall into the hands of the padrones,'' she said. ``The
priests would find them jobs, tide them over with money or help
them if somebody died in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Other groups followed a similar path and the church responded in
kind. When paperboys and ragamuffins slept in hallways, Father John
Christopher Drumgoole started an orphanage on Staten Island. The
archives hold copies of a newsletter he published about the
hard-knock lives of homeless waifs.
</P>
<P>
   There are volumes about the hospitals founded by nuns to treat
the poor, demands for economic and racial equality in Harlem and
calls for increased attention to the social ills that plagued the
newcomers in old neighborhoods. You could tell the newest arrivals
easily enough: They were the ones who held services in church
basements.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the archives up to date, 100 priests, nuns and lay
people are being interviewed for oral histories that will reflect
the moods of various neighborhoods in this century. A photographer
has been visiting several landmark churches, documenting the
handiwork of generations of artisans.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Jeremiah Monahan, chancellor of the archdiocese, said
the archives would ultimately affirm the heritage and contributions
of the city's people and parishes. After nearly 200 years, they've
finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always thought the archives would be a grand place to match
the grandeur of New York,'' Monahan said. ``It's not just a place
where we put our things.''

SAN FRANCISCO PIE-THROWERS ARE GUILTY OF BATTERY, BUT NOT OF
ASSAULT
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN. Calif.)  (fb) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The pie-throwers were on a roll. Within a few
months, they had whammed their liberal objections into a gallery of
unwitting political foes. They ``pied'' more than a half dozen
bigwig corporate executives and politicians in the face, and they
got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three members of the local pie-throwing movement, known as
the Biotic Baking Brigade, took aim at the city's big cheese: Mayor
Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The three Biotic Baking Brigade members, who said they were
protesting the mayor's lack of solutions to San Francisco's severe
homeless population, nailed their target. But this time, the target
struck back. Not only did Brown wrestle one of the pie-throwers to
the ground, but in a move that has inspired debate throughout San
Francisco over whether the pie throwing was political theater, a
silly prank or assault and battery, he pressed charges. Last week,
the pie-throwers, or so-called Cherry Pie Three, went on trial.
</P>
<P>
   The star witness: Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, announced Tuesday afternoon after the jury of six
men and six women deliberated for nine hours: Not guilty of assault
on a public official, guilty of battery.
</P>
<P>
   It was a decision that left both sides slightly deflated and
failed to definitively answer the question of just what a pie in
the face constitutes, at least in San Francisco. Still, both the
prosecution and the defense claimed victory. ``The verdict shows
there's a thin line between free speech and battery,'' said Maria
Bee, the assistant district attorney who tried the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Vermeulen, one of the defense lawyers, countered that
the acquittal on the assault charge, which charged that the
pie-throwing was an act of retaliation and an attempt to impede a
public official from doing his job, was more important than the
guilty verdict in the battery charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That acquittal was a pie in the face to Mayor Brown,''
Vermeulen said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, Justin Gross, 27, of Berkeley and Rahula
Janowsky and Gerard Livernois, 34, of San Francisco, could have
faced up to a year in county jail if convicted on the first count.
They face up to six months in jail when sentenced later this month
for the second.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a liberal city where the mayor has been faring badly
in the polls partly because of the problem of homelessness, many
courtroom observers _friends and members, mostly, of the Biotic
Baking Brigade _ expected a full acquittal. Even the one juror who
agreed to talk to reporters said the panel had been taken aback to
find that the pie-throwing fit the legal definition of battery.
``We were all surprised,'' said Susan Cassidy a public school
teacher.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In terms of the pie-throwing,'' she added, ``I think it's
really important that people choose how to express their
activism.'' She said she empathized with their cause but was
emotionally affronted by seeing a video of the mayor being hit with
the three pies.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which happened Nov. 7, was widely publicized,
since the mayor was on a public podium, about to kick off a
city-wide street-cleaning campaign and announce a new stadium deal
for the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the defense lawyers had argued that the whole trial
was orchestrated by the mayor to avenge a public embarrassment that
he had shrugged off at the time as ``a momentary inconvenience.''
The district attorney, Terence Hallinan, who refused to consider
plea bargains that did not involve an admission of assault, was a
good friend of the mayor's, they said. No pie-throwing case had
gone to trial in this country in more than 20 years _and that one
had ended in acquittal. Not to mention that no pie in the history
of pie-throwing, from the days of the Keystone Kops, had ever hurt
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pie,'' said Kim Melcheski, another of the defense lawyers,
`` is not a gun, a pie is not a knife, a pie is not a rock. A pie,
is not under any circumstances, a deadly weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor made a forceful witness, telling the jury that the
first ``object'' that hit his face had blurred his vision, had
frightened him. He sprained his right ankle moments later in the
scuffle between the pie-throwers and the police and said it still
hurts a little.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the mayor, the Biotic Baking Brigade has ``pied'' the
economist Milton Friedman, for being what it calls ``the world's
foremost neo-liberalist economist,'' Charles Hurwitz, the chief
executive officer of the Pacific Lumber Co., which logs old-growth
redwoods, and a San Francisco supervisor, Gavin Newsom, for
``becoming pro-development,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the brigade were not sure what the conviction would
mean for future pieings. ``I know there's a pastry revolution going
on,'' Janowsky said. ``Public officials are getting pied every
day.''

THESAURUS TAKES ACTION TO REDUCE GAY SLURS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster Inc., the nation's oldest and largest dictionary
publisher, took steps Tuesday to remove references to homosexuals
in its classic collegiate thesaurus amid complaints about a word
list of offensive slurs and synonyms.
</P>
<P>
   That action came after the 150-year-old Merriam-Webster company
and American Online Inc. temporarily removed an online thesaurus on
Friday that contained a word list for ``homosexual'' that included
references to ``faggot,'' ``fruit'' and ``pederast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We very clearly had made a mistake and we wanted to get that
mistake out of the hands of the public and in a position where we
could start working on it very quickly,'' said Deborah Burns,
marketing director for Merriam-Webster, a division of Encyclopaedia
Britannica Inc. ``We knew that while a dictionary needs to be
comprehensive, a thesaurus doesn't. We had a lot of unfair words,
unfair terms.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a corporate mistake that had been overlooked for at least
20 years because the same list of synonyms for homosexuals was
circulating in Merriam-Webster thesauruses dating to the late 1970s
that were promoted as ``totally new.''
</P>
<P>
   The words finally drew new scrutiny from homosexual rights
groups last week after a radio show host in Seattle used the online
version of the thesaurus and e-mailed the results to a reporter at
the GAYBC Radio Network, an Internet audio news service. The
reporter, in turn, shared the list with a friend in Washington, who
started raising alarms through the Internet, entreating others to
send their complaints to Merriam-Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked on a number of fronts,'' said John Aravois, who
runs his own political Internet consulting company, Wired
Strategies, out of Washington. ``First of all, you're never happy
to read 20 different ways that you're less than human. Secondly, I
was shocked that they would use completely inaccurate words like
`pederast,'' which essentially means pedophile. The only thing that
wasn't defamatory was `lesbian.' Everything else was words like
`nancy' or `uranist.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Burns said that the company would probably not revive its
online thesaurus for at least a week while the company's editorial
staff continued to review the reference guide for any other
offensive references. Although the company does not plan to recall
any of its printed material from bookstores, she said that future
editions would also be edited to remove the offending words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to make sure that it doesn't carry offensive
words that label people,'' she said. ``We're looking at the entire
thesaurus.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the company made the decision to excise references to
homosexuals to be consistent with a longstanding policy of not
offering entries for ethnic or racial minorities like Jews, blacks,
or people of Hispanic descent because many of the synonyms were
negative. And with that decision, it issued a written public
apology that promised revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merriam-Webster acknowledges that inclusion of these words was
the result of an error on its part, and it fully extends its
apologies,'' the company said in its statement.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster's swift response pleased some of its critics,
but some remained nettled by the company's decision to eliminate
the reference to homosexuals completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that there won't necessarily be inaccurate
descriptions,'' said John McMullen, a reporter and talk-show host
for the GAYBC Radio Network, who first raised the issue. ``I'm not
entirely happy that they want to withdraw the word altogether. When
I started this, we didn't do this because we wanted to censor any
words. We just wanted them to be accurate in the words they used.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation praised
Merriam-Webster's actions, noting that the group was starting to
check reference guides circulated by other publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we're starting to do more research, it's actually
more prevalent than we thought,'' said Cathy Renna, a spokeswoman
for the alliance. ``It's really not just an issue of
Merriam-Webster. We really have to look at how the definitions have
evolved.''

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton proposed Tuesday night that the
federal government invest for the first time in the stock market to
strengthen Social Security, as he delivered a confident report on
the State of the Union to a Congress considering cutting short his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in the grand chamber of the House of Representative a
month to the day after he was impeached there, Clinton also urged
Congress to begin contributing $33 billion a year to a new system
of retirement accounts for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   The president never mentioned the trial, steps away in the
Senate, where lawyers began defending him just a few hours earlier,
as he envisioned using the rest of his term to strengthen the
nation's schools, military forces and programs for the elderly.
Clinton coupled a rosy appraisal of the nation's condition with an
urgent appeal for action, flaunting his laurels but insisting he
would not rest on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is working again,'' Clinton said. ``The promise of our
future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow
the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced Tuesday night that the Justice Department was
preparing to sue tobacco companies, opening a new front in a war
that has repeatedly gained him political ground. He argued that
federal programs like Medicare were due hundreds of billions of
dollars for the costs of treating lung cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The president left it to his lawyers to attack the charges he
broke the law to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky, the
former intern. But he clearly seized on his State of the Union
message as his most potent defense, just as for the last turbulent
year he has counted on his dogged advocacy of popular programs to
sustain him.
</P>
<P>
   In a characteristically smooth address that lasted well over an
hour, Clinton exuded ease and a sense of political control. He
reacted with unmistakeable delight when both sides of the chamber
erupted in applause for his call for equal pay for equal work by
women or men.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was more encouraging, you know,'' he said, grinning and
spreading his arms wide as he bent slightly from side to side.
``There was more balance on the seesaw. I like that!''
</P>
<P>
   After the traditional bipartisan ovation welcoming the
president, Democrats applauded far longer and louder, and some of
Clinton's accusers sat with lips compressed and hands folded.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton tried to draw his opponents in. Early in his speech,
he recalled the acceptance speech of the new Speaker of the House,
Dennis Hastert, who called for members to work together in a spirit
of civility and bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that,'' the president said,
turning and extending his hand to the Republican. A clearly
surprised Hastert rose and accepted the handshake, to applause.
</P>
<P>
   The president presented his legislative shopping list _ from an
initiative to ease traffic congestion to a $1 billion program to
help people switch from welfare to work _ to a Republican Congress
with far different plans for spending the surpluses accumulating
after decades of deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if some of his plans stand little chance of passage,
Clinton was able to command a traditionally vast television
audience for a recitation of the economic benefits of his
leadership _ and a powerful, implicit argument that the trial is an
unwarranted distraction from important business.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our
confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet
our historic responsibility to the 21st century,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling this time ``a new dawn for America,'' he urged his
listeners to ``put aside our divisions'' and find ``a new hour of
healing and hopefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   With the justices of the Supreme Court and his antagonists and
allies in both houses of Congress before him, the president
recognized several people in the galleries to underscore his
points. Among them, he singled out his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, whose loyalty and advice have been key to his political
stamina. He praised her for ``for all she has done for our
children'' and for ``advancing our ideals at home and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the peculiar political dynamic unfolding here,
Republican Senate leaders also seemed eager on Tuesday to play down
the trial. They laid out their own legislative agenda in the
morning, insisting that mulling the first removal ever of a sitting
president would not divert them from what the Majority Leader,
Trent Lott, called ``the people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the president called for sure-fire political initiatives
like putting 50,000 more police officers on the street, he also
used his speech to push beyond his short-term predicament. He urged
a long-term fix to the Social Security system that, according to
his associates, he hopes will shine through the historic blot of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Expected a political free-for-all over the coming budget
surplus, Clinton urged Congress in his State of the Union Message
last year to ``Save Social Security first.'' That proved a deft
political move, stifling Republican appeals for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But with the surpluses growing and a new politics of prosperity
firing legislators' imaginations, Senate Republicans declared that
they would seek a 10 percent cut this year in personal income tax
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Clinton again moved to box them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reach out my hand to all of you in both house of both
parties and ask you to join me in saying: We will save Social
Security now,'' he said. ``Last year, we wisely reserved all of the
surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security.
Again, I say, we should not spend any of it until after Social
Security is truly saved. First things first.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For a month, the White House has deliberately leaked out
proposals from Clinton's State of the Union speech to capture
headlines showing the president at work. But it held back its plans
for Social Security as well as for tobacco, to insure that
Clinton's substantative proposals, rather than the spectacle of his
appearance before Congress, would drive Tuesday night's news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued that 62 percent of forthcoming federal surpluses
should be earmarked to preserve Social Security, a program that was
at the heart of the Democratic New Deal but that has since
developed overwhelming popular support.
</P>
<P>
   Another 15 percent of the surpluses, Clinton said, should go to
protect the Medicare program, which assists the elderly with health
care. The president would spend about 11 percent of the surpluses
to create new retirement savings accounts, called ``universal
savings accounts.'' Under his plan, money put into the accounts by
workers would be matched by the federal government, which would
spend some $33 billion a year on the program.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the surpluses _ roughly another 11 percent,
according to the administration _ would go to defense and domestic
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Clinton proposed that $2.7 trillion of a projected $4.4
trillion in surpluses in the next 15 years be reserved for Social
Security. The changes Clinton seeks in the system, the
administration contends, will keep it solvent until 2055. It is now
projected to run out of money to pay the claims of retirees _ who
are expected not only to grow in number but also to live longer _
by 2032.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration's goal is to secure Social Security until
2075, which means Tuesday's plan even by Clinton's standards is
only a partial solution. Clinton made clear that he had no interest
in pursuing politically unattractive options, like tax increases or
what he called ``drastic cuts in benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton argued that Social Security would be stronger if it
could invest some of its trust fund in the stock market, where it
could earn higher returns than from the Treasury bonds it invests
in now. Although state governments invest their pension plans in
stocks, this would be the first venture by the federal government
into the market.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the administration proposed investing up to 25 percent
of the new money for Social Security, or $700 billion, in stocks
over the next 15 years. Gene Sperling, the director of the National
Economic Council, said that under this plan, Social Security would
never have more than 15 percent of its assets in the market, a
level he called ``far, far more conservative than any pension plan
in the country does.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration proposes to work with Congress to create a
privately managed system to invest the money without political
interference.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans signaled they had no interest in the president's
suggestion. ``Government-controlled investment in markets is
contrary to free enterprise,'' said Bill Archer, the Texas
Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
He said such investment ``will open the doors to all kinds of
mischief involving government dictates, favoritism and cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the surplus money Clinton hopes to reserve for
Social Security _ about $2 trillion _ would, like the money he
would set aside for Medicare, go to pay off the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   That would simultaneously reduce the amount of government debt
and increase Social Security's financial reserves. It would help
bring down interest rates, stimulate new investment and create
conditions for faster economic growth to guard against the strains
caused by the retirement of the Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said that under this plan, the federal debt would fall
as a percent of the domestic product from 44 percent today to less
than 10 percent by 2014. When Clinton took office, he said, that
number was 50.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing his fix for Social Security, Clinton heeded the
demands of his core Democratic constituencies, rejecting a
Republican call that individuals be permitted to make some of their
own investment decisions about the money that the government
deducts from their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he called for maintaining Social Security as a
``defined benefit'' plan, that is, one with a guaranteed payout.
But Tuesday night he also proposed the system of personal savings
accounts, which are similar to what Republicans are seeking as at
least a partial replacement for Social Security. For the president,
the new accounts would supplement Social Security, not replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Each worker would receive some flat payment, say $100, to open
an account. If he or she then chose to deposit more money,
administration officials said, the government would match a portion
of it, perhaps in the form of a tax credit. Sperling said that the
administration favored weighting the matching system so that it
provided greater benefit to lower-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides repeatedly referred to the agenda he presented
Tuesday night as the most aggressive he has offered since 1993 and
far different than the kind of agenda one might expect from a
president contemplating his seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   They were emphasizing that Clinton intended to stick around, and
they were trying to draw a sharp contrast with the Republicans.
Clinton proposed a raft of domestic initiatives, including several
to bolster education. This year, Congress must reauthorize the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, as it does every five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes to amend the law, which governs aid to
private schools, to demand that states and school systems begin
testing new teachers for competence, identify failing schools and
shut them down if necessary, and end practices like ``social
promotion,'' or routinely moving children into the next grade even
if they have not gained the necessary skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year the government invests more than $15 billion in our
public schools,'' Clinton said. ``I believe we must change the way
we invest that money, to support what works and to stop supporting
what does not work.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also proposed a series of narrowly targeted tax
credits, rather than the kind of broad-based tax cuts that
Republicans favor. He said that he would seek a $1,000 credit to
help families pay for long-term care and another $1,000 credit to
help disabled peopled return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted a relatively small portion of his speech to
foreign policy. He proposed a 70 percent increase, to $4.2 billion
over five years, in financing to stem nuclear proliferation from
the states of the former Soviet Union. The money would to destroy
plutonium that could be used to make weapons, as well as to put
8,000 Russian scientists to work in civilian research.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Egregious and criminal conduct; repeated lying;
adultery, obstruction of justice and perjury. In great detail,
these are the charges that have been laid against the President of
the United States in the past few days. Is it any wonder that
Americans have such a low view of their politicians?
</P>
<P>
   Except, it seems, they don't. Most of the evidence shows that
Americans have, over the last few years, recovered some of their
trust in politics and government, and calling someone a politician
is no longer the worst insult you can level.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that America still has it in for politics, at
least if Hollywood's latest outpourings are anything to go by.
</P>
<P>
   Last year saw three blockbuster films _ ``Primary Colors,''
``Bulworth'' and ``Wag the Dog'' _ which all painted politicians as
venal, corrupt, depraved and obsessed by personal ambition.
</P>
<P>
   This, in itself, was nothing new. After all, the classic film
``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' had a similar message: the
innocent comes from outside the city to bring a breath of fresh
air.
</P>
<P>
   Bumper-sticker politics has had it in for big-time politics for
decades, with stickers proclaiming that ``All politicians are
liars,'' or hoping that the Russians would nuke the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   And ask virtually any American in any bar in any city what they
think of Democrats or Republicans, and the gist of the inevitable
tirade is likely to be ``a plague on both their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism about politics and politicians grew throughout the late
1960s, and exploded as the Watergate saga broke. In the postwar
years, there was great faith in government: it had, after all,
ended the Depression, won the war and emerged stronger and more
confident than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of Vietnam, inner-city riots and Watergate
sent public trust plunging. It recovered during the 1980s under
Ronald Reagan, but then sank again in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As the cry of ``throw out the rascals'' went out across the
country, there was a rise in insurgent politics: a preference for
non-politicians, whether real non-politicians like the businessman
Ross Perot, the independent candidate for the White House, or
invented non-politicians like Ronald Reagan, who ran as an
anti-Washington, anti-government figure from California.
</P>
<P>
   The libertarian right was on the upswing, deregulating,
privatizing, deunionizing and ridding the nation of the threat of
Big Government. Yet against all the expectations, public trust in
politicians now seems to be rising again.
</P>
<P>
   Most opinion polls show that not only is Bill Clinton's approval
rating solid, but that in general politicians are reasonably
well-regarded. Incredibly, a poll in November showed that 54
percent of Americans trusted the president to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Though the same polls show little respect for him as a person,
he is widely thought to have done a good job, as are those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Gallup poll, 76 percent of Americans hold
either ``a great deal'' or ``a fair amount'' of confidence in the
federal government to handle international problems, and 61 percent
have a high level of confidence in its ability to handle domestic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Though these figures are about 10 percent lower than they were
pre-Watergate, they are significantly higher than in much of the
intervening period.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment made no difference. As Gallup said: ``If any change
has occurred in the past year-and-a-half, it has been in a positive
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The last elections showed voters backing incumbents in record
numbers. The nation seemed to be saying: keep the rascals in. Even
the film ``Bulworth'' is about the humanization of a politician, a
man who comes to see what damage he and his colleagues have done.
</P>
<P>
   There has even been something of a sense of the wheel coming
full circle. The repudiation of ``ideology'' and partisanship
around impeachment has been mainly directed at Republicans from the
House of Representatives, led by Newt Gingrich until his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich led an anti-Washington, anti-government crusade, but
ultimately had to face the fact that he was in power.
</P>
<P>
   He and his ``revolutionaries'' attracted a great deal of
criticism; the Senate, entirely composed of professional
politicians, is suddenly seen once again as the repository of
experience and good sense, not a nest of privilege.
</P>
<P>
   If this feelgood sense of politicians persists, it may have
important implications for the next presidential election.
Vice-President Al Gore, who is expected to win the Democratic
nomination for the presidency next year, was born in Washington,
the son of a senator, and has worked there most of his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   The early policy positions he has taken are about revitalizing
city centers and conserving the U.S. equivalent of the Green Belt _
activist ideas that seem to resonate with suburban concerns across
America. George W. Bush, his most likely Republican opponent, is
another insider, but he lacks political experience.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, of course, hangs on the economy. The indices
tracking confidence in government correlate closely with rising or
falling personal incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The current boom has been longer than that of the 1980s, and
nearly matches that of the 1960s; hence Bill Clinton gets the
plaudits, whatever voters think of his character. &QL;

   Americans credit their politicians with creating economic booms,
and blame them for creating recessions, like most electorates. They
are, by comparison with the British, more trusting of public

</P>
<P>
   The British place implicit trust in the men and women who read
the scripts, while Americans do not.
</P>
<P>
   If one group of people have really been lambasted over the
Clinton saga, it is the media. Expect the next rash of films to be
about the cynical, corrupt and depraved inhabitants of the nation's
newsrooms. &QL;

A DAY OF CONTRASTS: SENATE TRIAL, CLINTON'S ADDRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tuesday was a schizophrenic day in the nation's
Capitol, a day split between trying a president for high crimes and
misdemeanors and welcoming the same man to outline his agenda for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day divided between sex and Social Security, perjury
and public policy, Monica Lewinsky and baseball star Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress, particularly Republican senators, were
clearly uncomfortable with the dueling duties of holding Clinton's
impeachment trial in the afternoon and listening to his State of
the Union address that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lawmakers filled the House chamber to hear the
president, acting at times as if the scandal that has obsessed the
nation's capital and driven a wedge between the parties had never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally the partisan divide became evident. When the
president proclaimed that ``the state of our union is strong,'' the
Democrats rose to their feet and cheered while Republicans remained
glumly in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras zoomed in on House Judiciary Committee
members who spent last week trying to persuade the Senate to kick
Clinton out of office. Several of them sat without emotion as
Clinton reeled off his plans for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Before the speech, the buzzword in the halls of the Capitol was
compartmentalization _ a term Clinton's advisers have used to
describe his ability to deal with the scandal and the nation's
problems without one muddying the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have learned from the president to
compartmentalize,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   While most lawmakers attended Clinton's address, a number of
Republicans suggested they were not going gladly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, complained that listening to the
speech was worse than a trip to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' junior GOP senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison said ``no one
could think that it's comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   On the House side, a handful of Republicans had organized a
boycott of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., complained it was ``incredibly
inappropriate to invite the president into the House chamber when
the House has just impeached him.''
</P>
<P>
   But newly elected House Speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
sent a letter to his colleagues urging them to attend and be
courteous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will listen to the president's remarks soberly and with the
dignity that befits the U.S. Congress,'' the letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans declined to attend but stressed that their
absences had nothing to do with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, who has led the House investigation of
the president, stayed home to watch the address. Hyde spokesman,
Sam Stratman, said that Hyde had skipped numerous State of the
Union addresses and was not singling out this one.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, also watched the president's speech on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Paul spokesman Michael Sullivan said the Texas congressman was
not making a statement about impeachment, but just disliked the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a wild madhouse. It's not something he is interested
in doing, all the pomp and circumstance,'' said Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scanlon, a spokesman for House majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, said that about 20 of the 223 Republican House members
were not expected to attend. DeLay, who led the charge last fall
for Clinton's impeachment, showed up to hear Clinton speak although
he rarely clapped and often remained in his seat when his GOP
colleagues rose to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats appeared to have little problem cheering Clinton,
who was bolstered by new public opinion polls this week showing his
approval ratings among the highest of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., mocked those Republicans who
believed they were winning points with the public by snubbing the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any member of Congress who thinks there is significant
interest in where he parks his ass for the evening is delusional,''
said the liberal lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, said Clinton deserved a good
reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's not to cheer. The economy is in good shape. We're the
strongest country in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And some Republicans said they had no problems attending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grown-ups here,'' said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas.
``Frankly, it won't be the first time in my life I have respected
an office perhaps more than the person who holds it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also intent during the day on demonstrating
that they could focus on more than the president's trial.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the Senate trial adjourned for the day, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, held what was billed as a
``pre-buttal'' where he urged the president to embrace
across-the-board tax cuts and a comprehensive solution to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Clinton walked into the House chamber to outline
his program, Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, issued a news release commenting on wire reports that
the president would propose that the government invest a portion of
Social Security funds in private markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. A thousand times no,'' the Archer release screamed.
</P>
<P>
   While some members of Congress complained about the awkwardness
of having the trial and president's address on the same day, some
Capitol tourists didn't seem fazed by the sequence of events.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Tammy Foulcher of Texas took in the Senate trial in
the early afternoon and were rushing to catch a plane to return to
their suburban Dallas home in time to watch the president address
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both agreed that Clinton was right to give the address despite
the complaints of some members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to separate the trial from the business of the
nation,'' said Robert Foulcher. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Egregious and criminal conduct; repeated lying;
adultery, obstruction of justice and perjury. In great detail,
these are the charges that have been laid against the President of
the United States in the past few days. Is it any wonder that
Americans have such a low view of their politicians?
</P>
<P>
   Except, it seems, they don't. Most of the evidence shows that
Americans have, over the last few years, recovered some of their
trust in politics and government, and calling someone a politician
is no longer the worst insult you can level.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that America still has it in for politics, at
least if Hollywood's latest outpourings are anything to go by.
</P>
<P>
   Last year saw three blockbuster films _ ``Primary Colors,''
``Bulworth'' and ``Wag the Dog'' _ which all painted politicians as
venal, corrupt, depraved and obsessed by personal ambition.
</P>
<P>
   This, in itself, was nothing new. After all, the classic film
``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' had a similar message: the
innocent comes from outside the city to bring a breath of fresh
air.
</P>
<P>
   Bumper-sticker politics has had it in for big-time politics for
decades, with stickers proclaiming that ``All politicians are
liars,'' or hoping that the Russians would nuke the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   And ask virtually any American in any bar in any city what they
think of Democrats or Republicans, and the gist of the inevitable
tirade is likely to be ``a plague on both their houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism about politics and politicians grew throughout the late
1960s, and exploded as the Watergate saga broke. In the postwar
years, there was great faith in government: it had, after all,
ended the Depression, won the war and emerged stronger and more
confident than ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of Vietnam, inner-city riots and Watergate
sent public trust plunging. It recovered during the 1980s under
Ronald Reagan, but then sank again in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   As the cry of ``throw out the rascals'' went out across the
country, there was a rise in insurgent politics: a preference for
non-politicians, whether real non-politicians like the businessman
Ross Perot, the independent candidate for the White House, or
invented non-politicians like Ronald Reagan, who ran as an
anti-Washington, anti-government figure from California.
</P>
<P>
   The libertarian right was on the upswing, deregulating,
privatizing, deunionizing and ridding the nation of the threat of
Big Government. Yet against all the expectations, public trust in
politicians now seems to be rising again.
</P>
<P>
   Most opinion polls show that not only is Bill Clinton's approval
rating solid, but that in general politicians are reasonably
well-regarded. Incredibly, a poll in November showed that 54
percent of Americans trusted the president to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Though the same polls show little respect for him as a person,
he is widely thought to have done a good job, as are those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Gallup poll, 76 percent of Americans hold
either ``a great deal'' or ``a fair amount'' of confidence in the
federal government to handle international problems, and 61 percent
have a high level of confidence in its ability to handle domestic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Though these figures are about 10 percent lower than they were
pre-Watergate, they are significantly higher than in much of the
intervening period.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment made no difference. As Gallup said: ``If any change
has occurred in the past year-and-a-half, it has been in a positive
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The last elections showed voters backing incumbents in record
numbers. The nation seemed to be saying: keep the rascals in. Even
the film ``Bulworth'' is about the humanization of a politician, a
man who comes to see what damage he and his colleagues have done.
</P>
<P>
   There has even been something of a sense of the wheel coming
full circle. The repudiation of ``ideology'' and partisanship
around impeachment has been mainly directed at Republicans from the
House of Representatives, led by Newt Gingrich until his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich led an anti-Washington, anti-government crusade, but
ultimately had to face the fact that he was in power.
</P>
<P>
   He and his ``revolutionaries'' attracted a great deal of
criticism; the Senate, entirely composed of professional
politicians, is suddenly seen once again as the repository of
experience and good sense, not a nest of privilege.
</P>
<P>
   If this feelgood sense of politicians persists, it may have
important implications for the next presidential election.
Vice-President Al Gore, who is expected to win the Democratic
nomination for the presidency next year, was born in Washington,
the son of a senator, and has worked there most of his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   The early policy positions he has taken are about revitalizing
city centers and conserving the U.S. equivalent of the Green Belt _
activist ideas that seem to resonate with suburban concerns across
America. George W. Bush, his most likely Republican opponent, is
another insider, but he lacks political experience.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, of course, hangs on the economy. The indices
tracking confidence in government correlate closely with rising or
falling personal incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The current boom has been longer than that of the 1980s, and
nearly matches that of the 1960s; hence Bill Clinton gets the
plaudits, whatever voters think of his character. &QL;

and blame them for creating recessions, like most electorates. They

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The president is threatened with impeachment. His
enemies believe he is guilty of high crimes (not to mention
misdemeanors), and want him thrown out of office. They regard him
with a venom that at times defies explanation.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he embroiled in such banal matters as trying to conceal a
tawdry love tryst from his McCarthyite political foes. No, these
charges involve such issues as destroying an empire, taking up arms
against parliament, waging an illegal war and committing genocide
against his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, the subject of these allegations enjoys almost
no support from the general public, many of whom would agree that
he is guilty of at least some of these offenses, and should
certainly leave office.
</P>
<P>
   These days very few Russians support Boris Yeltsin. And, for the
past six months, a 15-member Russian parliamentary commission has
been investigating whether there are grounds to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings could scarcely offer a greater contrast from the
Clinton circus. The Moscow media has paid sparse attention,
although it has given plenty of coverage to the Washington
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   This interest is partly because Russians see a link between the
more aggressive aspects of U.S. foreign policy, such as the
Anglo-American bombing of Iraq, and White House efforts to distract
attention from the shame of the president; and partly because
skewering a leader over an issue like Monicagate causes universal
astonishment here.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin himself has given the hearings little heed, not even
bothering to send a Kremlin representative along to defend his
corner. Nor has the general public, as it battles to weather deep
economic depression, shown much interest.
</P>
<P>
   Russians tend to confine themselves to wry comparisons between
the two beleaguered leaders. Would that the moribund and remote
Boris Yeltsin had the energy to chase young women, they remark.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's foes believe that he has committed five impeachable
offenses: destroying the Soviet Union; using force to destroy the
Soviet-era parliament in 1993; illegally waging war in Chechnya _
in which tens of thousands died; undermining the armed forces; and
presiding over the genocide of Russians _ ravaged by poverty,
alcoholism and disease, the population has fallen by 2 million
since he took office.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, convened by the State Duma, or lower house, has
already concluded that there are grounds to charge him with the
first four. The fifth _ genocide _ has yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   According to the commission's Communist chairman, Vadim
Filimonov, the hearings should be completed and the findings sent
to the lower house next month.
</P>
<P>
   This will mark the beginning of a long process which, if nothing
else, illustrates the absence of a separation of powers between the
Kremlin, the judiciary and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   To impeach Yeltsin, his opponents must win a two-thirds majority
in the 450-member Duma. The Supreme Court must then agree that the
President has committed treachery or a crime against the state. The
proceedings would then be reviewed by the Constitutional Court,
before going back to the Federation Council (the upper house) for a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The path is littered with people who owe their jobs to Yeltsin
and is so tortuous that, even if the impeachment passed the first
hurdle, there is no chance that it could be completed before
Yeltsin leaves office next year. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 575. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   One leading newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, has condemned the
proceedings as ``a farcical waste of time.'' Even Filimonov
grudgingly admits there is ``a grain of truth'' to the widely held
view that Yeltsin stands no chance of being removed from office.
(As for the charges against Clinton, he agrees that they are
ludicrous.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Filimonov concerned by the fact that three of the Russian
president's alleged crimes _ breaking up the U.S.S.R., shelling
parliament and launching the Chechen war _ were blazingly public
events which happened before Yeltsin was returned to office, with a
comfortable majority, by the electorate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an obstacle,'' he says. ``At the time of the
election these actions had not come under judicial analysis...
People could have thought others were to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: even if everyone knows they cannot
impeach Yeltsin, the issue is not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were launched by parliament to defend itself
against dissolution by Yeltsin during their battle with him last
summer over his choice of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a new reason to carry on. There are parliamentary
elections in December, and the Communist opposition is unlikely to
miss the chance to use the process to trumpet its case, hammering
Yeltsin and all those who have worked by his side. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As opposition to its garbage plans sparks outcries
from Brooklyn to New Jersey to Virginia, the Giuliani
administration has grudgingly agreed to meet in the next few weeks
with community and environmental groups that think they have a
better idea.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Sanitation Department will soon schedule a
meeting to discuss using its waterfront terminals to load garbage
into containers for shipment out of state. These terminals are
where sanitation trucks load trash in barges bound for the Fresh
Kills landfill on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   After Fresh Kills closes at the beginning of 2002, the city
plans to continue to use the so-called marine transfer stations to
load barges with garbage for shipment to giant new stations for
what the industry refers to as containerization _ putting garbage
into containers for shipment by rail or barge.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for new transfer points have stirred intense opposition in
the three places where the city has proposed building them: the Red
Hook section of Brooklyn, Newark, N.J., and Carteret, N.J.
Opposition is also mounting in Virginia, where as much as 4,000
tons of waste a day could be taken by barge from the Red Hook
terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of room for conversation here,'' said Martha
Hirst, the city's deputy commissioner for solid waste management
and planning.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hirst also cautioned that there was a substantial risk
in changing the city's basic trash collection system. ``We
certainly don't want to design a system that's less efficient and
effective than the one we currently have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The city is responding to requests to revisit the issue from
three dozen environmental groups around the city and from the
borough presidents of the Bronx and Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no reason to tow municipal garbage from a
city-owned transfer station to a giant new station a stone's throw
away,'' said Leslie Lowe, a coordinator of the New York City
Environmental Justice Alliance. ``It can and should be
containerized right at the city-owned transfer stations and taken
directly to the rail links or container ports.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowe said the city had yet to show ``credible evidence'' why
that could not be done. The city has responded that it has studied
the feasibility of containerizing in the stations for more than a
decade. Among other objections, it says that there is too little
space to store the containers, that the amount of garbage that
could be handled would shrink by 25 percent and that the lines of
trucks waiting to dump would grow.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hirst bridled at opponents' charges that the Sanitation
Department was unwilling to try new things. ``People can say we
love the status quo,'' she said. ``Well, so what? The status quo
works. There's a lot of security in Department of Sanitation
collection operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hirst also said that no city in the world compacted and
containerized garbage in marine transfer stations.
</P>
<P>
   James Tripp, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund,
said he thought many of the city's arguments against greater use of
the marine transfer stations might eventually prove true. ``But
we're not going to make any progress on any other issue until we
work through this,'' he said. ``The city has made a mistake in
putting up a Chinese wall and refraining from any public discussion
of the issue.''

   MOSCOW _ The president is threatened with impeachment. His
enemies believe he is guilty of high crimes (not to mention
misdemeanors), and want him thrown out of office. They regard him
with a venom that at times defies explanation.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he embroiled in such banal matters as trying to conceal a
tawdry love tryst from his McCarthyite political foes. No, these
charges involve such issues as destroying an empire, taking up arms
against parliament, waging an illegal war and committing genocide
against his own people.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, the subject of these allegations enjoys almost
no support from the general public, many of whom would agree that
he is guilty of at least some of these offenses, and should
certainly leave office.
</P>
<P>
   These days very few Russians support Boris Yeltsin. And, for the
past six months, a 15-member Russian parliamentary commission has
been investigating whether there are grounds to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings could scarcely offer a greater contrast from the
Clinton circus. The Moscow media has paid sparse attention,
although it has given plenty of coverage to the Washington
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   This interest is partly because Russians see a link between the
more aggressive aspects of U.S. foreign policy, such as the
Anglo-American bombing of Iraq, and White House efforts to distract
attention from the shame of the president; and partly because
skewering a leader over an issue like Monicagate causes universal
astonishment here.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin himself has given the hearings little heed, not even
bothering to send a Kremlin representative along to defend his
corner. Nor has the general public, as it battles to weather deep
economic depression, shown much interest.
</P>
<P>
   Russians tend to confine themselves to wry comparisons between
the two beleaguered leaders. Would that the moribund and remote
Boris Yeltsin had the energy to chase young women, they remark.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's foes believe that he has committed five impeachable
offenses: destroying the Soviet Union; using force to destroy the
Soviet-era parliament in 1993; illegally waging war in Chechnya _
in which tens of thousands died; undermining the armed forces; and
presiding over the genocide of Russians _ ravaged by poverty,
alcoholism and disease, the population has fallen by 2 million
since he took office.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, convened by the State Duma, or lower house, has
already concluded that there are grounds to charge him with the
first four. The fifth _ genocide _ has yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   According to the commission's Communist chairman, Vadim
Filimonov, the hearings should be completed and the findings sent
to the lower house next month.
</P>
<P>
   This will mark the beginning of a long process which, if nothing
else, illustrates the absence of a separation of powers between the
Kremlin, the judiciary and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   To impeach Yeltsin, his opponents must win a two-thirds majority
in the 450-member Duma. The Supreme Court must then agree that the
President has committed treachery or a crime against the state. The
proceedings would then be reviewed by the Constitutional Court,
before going back to the Federation Council (the upper house) for a
final decision.
</P>
<P>
   The path is littered with people who owe their jobs to Yeltsin
and is so tortuous that, even if the impeachment passed the first
hurdle, there is no chance that it could be completed before
Yeltsin leaves office next year. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 575. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   One leading newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, has condemned the
proceedings as ``a farcical waste of time.'' Even Filimonov
grudgingly admits there is ``a grain of truth'' to the widely held
view that Yeltsin stands no chance of being removed from office.
(As for the charges against Clinton, he agrees that they are
ludicrous.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Filimonov concerned by the fact that three of the Russian
president's alleged crimes _ breaking up the U.S.S.R., shelling
parliament and launching the Chechen war _ were blazingly public
events which happened before Yeltsin was returned to office, with a
comfortable majority, by the electorate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an obstacle,'' he says. ``At the time of the
election these actions had not come under judicial analysis...
People could have thought others were to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems certain: even if everyone knows they cannot
impeach Yeltsin, the issue is not going to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were launched by parliament to defend itself
against dissolution by Yeltsin during their battle with him last
summer over his choice of prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a new reason to carry on. There are parliamentary
elections in December, and the Communist opposition is unlikely to
miss the chance to use the process to trumpet its case, hammering
Yeltsin and all those who have worked by his side. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ No matter that 40 million Russians are below the
poverty line. No matter that Moscow is looking for another
multibillion dollar bail-out from the International Monetary Fund
to plug a gaping hole in the budget, or that it defaulted on
foreign debts to the horror of the world's financiers only months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The country is _ at least by one calculation _ extremely
wealthy, with enough funds to pay off its international debts four
times over, and to dwarf the personal fortune of the Queen of
England.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official, Pavel Borodin, has told the Russian
television channel, NTV, that the Kremlin owns $650 billion _ yes,
billion _ worth of property, a statistic that makes it one of the
world's largest commercial entities.
</P>
<P>
   This figure was confirmed Monday as accurate by his office to
The Independent. ``It is national wealth and cannot be sold,''
explained Galina Khavrayeva, a consultant for Borodin.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin is manager of the Kremlin Office, an empire directly
answerable to President Boris Yeltsin. It is believed to comprise
60 separate companies, including 10 construction firms, eight
farms, a furniture factory, about 100 sanatoria and rest homes, and
the exclusive President Hotel in Moscow, originally built for the
Communist Party elite.
</P>
<P>
   It also controls luxury dachas _ country retreats _ hotels,
restaurants, and the lavish, multi-domed Kremlin Palace itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound in Moscow that revenues from these businesses were
used to finance Yeltsin's extravagant, but successful, election
campaign in 1996, although there has been no firm proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``This property is...is very effectively run,'' Borodin told
NTV's respected ``Itogi'' program.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks are likely to revive an issue that has long irked
Yeltsin's foes, who find it hard to reconcile Russia's bankruptcy
and worsening widespread poverty with the lavish spending of the
Kremlin and its incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The mass circulation ``Argumenti i Fakti'' weekly newspaper
reported recently that an estimated $250 million has been spent
repairing the Kremlin alone, including the purchase of a
presidential dinner set costing $1,000 a plate. One square meter of
repairs cost several thousand dollars, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, whose declared 1997 salary was the ruble equivalent of
$325,000, is certainly no stranger to fine living. Apart from the
Kremlin, he has four presidential country retreats (including one
of the Black Sea), a 650-strong corps of guards, and an Ilyushin-96
aircraft which reportedly costs $42,000 for a one-hour flight.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin's revelations about the Kremlin's finances _ an issue
which is normally shrouded in secrecy _ drew swift criticism,
although he sought to stress that they generate much-needed
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kremlin's property abroad should be sold to pay our
foreign debts,'' said Viktor Vishnyakov, who represents the
nationalist LDPR party in the lower house of parliament, and who
has long been campaigning for the Kremlin to come clean about its
assets. ``These matters should come under proper legal control.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Yeltsin's chief doctor said Monday he believed the
ailing leader would spend at least two weeks in hospital recovering
from a bleeding ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the dynamic remains as positive as it is now...and we do
not need to operate, then his stay in hospital will be limited, I
believe, to two, two and a half or three weeks,'' Sergei Mironov
told ORT television. He said the decision on whether to operate
would hinge on tests set for Wednesday. &QL;

   ANAHEIM, CALIF. _ What's the price of fame? At Tinseltown
Studios, it's an easy question to answer: $44.50.
</P>
<P>
   That's the cost of admission to a novel Southern Californian
theme park that promises to turn everyone who visits into a movie
star, at least for a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   Walk up to the heavy black gates of the studio _ situated just a
short drive away from that other land of make-believe, Disneyland _
and you will be greeted by paparazzi snapping away as you approach
the red-carpeted walkway.
</P>
<P>
   A television crew is on hand to interview you about your latest
projects and who the co-stars of your next movie will be.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you are swept into an awards ceremony where, with a
little sleight of video technology, you can appear in your very own
film clip opposite Henry Fonda or Kevin Costner, be nominated for
one of Tinseltown's very own statuettes (the ``Oggies'') and even
give a teary acceptance speech if you are named as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner is served during the all-singing, all-dancing awards
ceremony, in which even the waiters profess their ambition to
become a star as big as you.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless fantasy or sign of the times?
</P>
<P>
   Tinseltown has been open to the public for just a couple of
months and already it is getting packed pretty much every night.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity, it seems, is a compelling draw, even when the stars
are fake, the studio is fake, the awards ceremony is fake and even
the steak dinner is no better than average.
</P>
<P>
   Only the television cameras are real _ a sign that, for most
people, Hollywood isn't Hollywood without the reassuring artifice
of being simultaneously retransmitted on video.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the guests, it seems, are out for a laugh or a birthday
celebration. A few arrive in Liz Taylor look-alike outfits, or with
outrageous beehive wigs; on one night last week, a gaggle of
teenage girls screeched in Beatlemania-style hysteria for half of
the show.
</P>
<P>
   But most of them don't seem to have half as much fun as the
employees, who get to emulate the cloying style of the real-life
Oscars presenters, entertainment journalists and jealous would-be
stars. A few of them get to sing and dance, too.
</P>
<P>
   When the pre-show ``interviews'' are played back during the
ceremony, just as they would be on television during the Oscars,
there are hoots of mirth from the relatives and friends of the
``star'' on the video screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking to the great Glen Peterson,'' says the breathless
would-be television journalist to a balding moustachioed man of a
certain age. ``Tell me Glen, where did you get that fabulous
outfit?'' ``The Men's Warehouse,'' he answers bashfully. The
audience erupts in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   The show can seem forced, even idiotic at times, as the staff
entertainers trot out every tired cliche about Hollywood
superficiality and sing every obvious song from ``Hooray for
Hollywood'' to ``That's Entertainment'' to the maddeningly
ubiquitous theme from ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the only-in-California glamour and the obsession with
celebrity, the show bears an uncanny resemblance to old beach
entertainments in Blackpool _ a few silly songs, a few bad jokes,
and the chance to have your picture taken in costume. &QL;

LAWSUIT OVER DRUG ROYALTIES SET BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A state Superior Court judge has declared there are
major flaws in the state's lawsuit claiming two researchers
swindled millions of dollars in potential royalty payments for a
disease-fighting product they developed at a state laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has raged for more than three years. It involves
questions of whether the researchers, Dr. George Siber and Jeanne
Leszczynski, developed the medical product as part-time officials
of the state Department of Public Health or, as the doctors insist,
during time they were paid as employees of a private institute that
formerly ran several health programs for DPH.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling this month, Suffolk Superior Court Judge Maria Lopez
rejected Attorney General Scott Harshbarger's request for a
preliminary injunction blocking the doctors from receiving any
royalty payments for the immune globulin product, used to treat
deadly viral infections in infants.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's ruling apparently clears the way for the doctors to
receive more than $650,000 in royalties that have been held in an
escrow fund since the issue went to court. Another $2 million or
more could be paid out to the state treasury, state health labs,
and the health institute for their role in developing the product,
with millions of dollars more potentially coming.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the judge repeatedly ruled that the state ``is not likely
to succeed'' in its claims that Siber and Leszczynski violated
state fraud and conflict-of-interest laws and ``has failed to show
that success on the merits is likely'' if the case goes to a full
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, state Inspector General Robert A. Cerasoli accused
Siber, Leszczynski, and the Massachusetts Health Research Institute
of concocting an elaborate scheme to swindle the state of up to $67
million in potential royalties for the product, sold as RespiGam by
a Maryland pharmaceutical company, Medimmune.
</P>
<P>
   RespiGam is used to treat respiratory syncytial virus, which
kills more than 4,500 US children every year and hospitalizes more
than 91,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cerasoli asserted that Siber and Leszczynski did the key work on
RespiGam between 1986 and 1988 while they were top officials at the
DPH labs in Boston. The two doctors said they achieved the
breakthroughs while on the payroll of the health institute, which
largely ran the Jamaica Plain labs before the University of
Massachusetts took them over in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While Cerasoli has accused the doctors of making a secret deal
to steal royalties that should have gone to the state, Lopez wrote
in her ruling that ``the DPH approved of the royalty agreement'' in
a 1989 contract.
</P>
<P>
   Top DPH officials, including former commissioner David I.
Mulligan, were ``fully informed of the licensing provisions
throughout the negotiation process and even participated in the
negotiations,'' Lopez wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Commonwealth cannot now accuse the defendants of
self-dealing and breach of fiduciary duty because, in hindsight,
they wish they had made a better deal,'' Lopez wrote in the Jan. 5
ruling, which the Globe obtained Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 agreement calls for the doctors to get 30 percent of
the royalties for RespiGam, with 20 percent going to the health
institute, 10 percent to the state general fund, and 40 percent to
the Jamaica Plain DPH labs.
</P>
<P>
   In one apparent key finding, Lopez ruled that even if the
doctors invented the products while being paid as state employees,
it does not matter because the 1989 contract, signed by the DPH,
assigned ownership of RespiGam to the health institute regardless
of whether the inventors were institute employees at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The express terms of the 1989 (contract) assign to MHRI
ownership of all technologies developed in the relevant research
programs by any DPH or MHRI employee at any time . . . without
regard to the timing of their discovery,'' Lopez ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Harshbarger, who was completing his last day in office
Tuesday, did not respond to a request for comment. State lawyers
have discussed a settlement with the doctors and the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Some people involved with the case think the latest ruling could
push incoming Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly to settle the case
soon, while others think it might encourage the doctors to press
for a full trial to recover damages and attorneys' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the two doctors and the institute all praised the
ruling Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's opinion makes clear that the Commonwealth does not
have a case and does not have legitimate claims against the
doctors,'' said Cheryl Cronin, attorney for Leszczynski. ``The
court's opinion makes clear as well that the inspector general's
constant attacks against the doctors were unfounded and
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Moore, representing the health institute and its
executive director, Jonathan Spack, said, ``If we're not able to
settle it, we are confident we will get a similar judgment after
trial.''

 By MARY DEJEVSKY  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A face appears on the television screen, full
frontal. It is brown, wide-eyed, and framed _ quite discreetly _
with dreadlocks. ``I want to let you into a little secret,'' says
the voiceover. ``I'm black.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are reading this in London or any British city, your
reaction might well be neutral or dismissive: ``Well, so what. Of
course, you are.'' But this is the United States and such frankness
about race still shocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who never notice another person's
color,'' the advert continues. ``But most of us do. And that's OK.
Don't feel guilty. Noticing a person's color doesn't make you a
racist. Acting like it matters does.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen more telescopic sentences later, the face fades out
to be replaced by a yellow, red and green logo: ``Denny's.''
</P>
<P>
   To an American viewer that logo means two things. It means a
chain of rather old-fashioned restaurants _ the sort of no-frills
formica-topped places where you can have breakfast or a burger and
be waited on by motherly ladies with large-pocketed aprons. The
food is uninspired mostly, but constant.
</P>
<P>
   But that Denny's logo also means something else. It is a chain
with a past.
</P>
<P>
   It has behind it two expensive court judgments for
discriminating against black customers _ or rather, would-be
customers, because their main complaint was that they could not get
served.
</P>
<P>
   Either they were ignored at the door when they waited for the
``hostess'' to seat them, or they seated themselves and went
unserved.
</P>
<P>
   Now I too have a problem with the ``hostess'' system at American
restaurants, and not just at Denny's. I fail to understand why, at
an eatery which is but a couple of notches up from a fast-food
joint, I should have to stand at ``reception,'' contemplating
dozens of free tables, while waiting for someone to seat me.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of those American practices that leads Europeans to
ask whether American service-sector jobs are ``real'' jobs and, as
we wait for the frazzled ``hostess'' to notice us, to ponder the
economics.
</P>
<P>
   How can they afford to keep so many tables empty and employ
someone just to seat us? Would they not do better to employ fewer
people at higher pay and have them all wait at tables, instead of
having us wait around for the ``hostess?''
</P>
<P>
   This, however, might be ``white'' reasoning. If you are black or
Hispanic, you might reach a different conclusion. And it was this
sort of thing that gave Denny's a bad name with the very customers
that it could have courted.
</P>
<P>
   A new set of television commercials, of which the ``I'm black''
advert is one, is the company's way of signalling that it has
changed. It is costing 2 million dollars, and is the brainchild of
James Adamson, chief executive of the parent company, Advantica.
</P>
<P>
   Adamson was appointed four years ago when Denny's was at its
nadir. It had just paid out 54 million dollars to two groups of
aggrieved customers who said they had been refused tables or
service for no reason other than their skin color.
</P>
<P>
   A small, slight and bouncy 50-year-old, Adamsom embodies that
very American virtue: feeling good about yourself and, of course,
your company. He has an all-American pedigree, coming from Gap, via
Burger King, and is credited with rescuing Denny's: its fortunes
and its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Advantica _ which owns three restaurant groups
besides Denny's _ caused a stir by coming second in Fortune
magazine's first list of ``best 50 companies for Asians, Blacks and
Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost half its employees are now black or Hispanic, and
one-third of its supervisory staff are ``minorities.'' It has
``minority'' representatives on its board and puts all staff
through ``diversity'' training.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Denny's franchises held by black Americans has
gone from one to 123 in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Adamson, as a successful white executive, is a rare creature in
that he acknowledges that discrimination exists, deliberate or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a complete supporter of affirmative action,'' he says,
embracing a policy that is fast becoming an anachronism, ``because
I don't believe the playing field is level...white men tend to hire
white men.''
</P>
<P>
   He is unusual, too, in believing _ probably correctly _ that in
terms of racial integration in the U.S., ``we're not getting
better, we're getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaign, which shouts about an issue that white
Americans tend to treat only in whispers, is an expensive gamble
that Advantica _ which emerged from bankruptcy only last year _ can
hardly afford. But as the complexion of America changes, and the
spending power of minorities grows, it is a gamble that Adamson for
one thinks worthwhile. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ A face appears on the television screen, full
frontal. It is brown, wide-eyed, and framed _ quite discreetly _
with dreadlocks. ``I want to let you into a little secret,'' says
the voiceover. ``I'm black.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are reading this in London or any British city, your
reaction might well be neutral or dismissive: ``Well, so what. Of
course, you are.'' But this is the United States and such frankness
about race still shocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who never notice another person's
color,'' the advert continues. ``But most of us do. And that's OK.
Don't feel guilty. Noticing a person's color doesn't make you a
racist. Acting like it matters does.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen more telescopic sentences later, the face fades out
to be replaced by a yellow, red and green logo: ``Denny's.''
</P>
<P>
   To an American viewer that logo means two things. It means a
chain of rather old-fashioned restaurants _ the sort of no-frills
formica-topped places where you can have breakfast or a burger and
be waited on by motherly ladies with large-pocketed aprons. The
food is uninspired mostly, but constant.
</P>
<P>
   But that Denny's logo also means something else. It is a chain
with a past.
</P>
<P>
   It has behind it two expensive court judgments for
discriminating against black customers _ or rather, would-be
customers, because their main complaint was that they could not get
served.
</P>
<P>
   Either they were ignored at the door when they waited for the
``hostess'' to seat them, or they seated themselves and went
unserved.
</P>
<P>
   Now I too have a problem with the ``hostess'' system at American
restaurants, and not just at Denny's. I fail to understand why, at
an eatery which is but a couple of notches up from a fast-food
joint, I should have to stand at ``reception,'' contemplating
dozens of free tables, while waiting for someone to seat me.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of those American practices that leads Europeans to
ask whether American service-sector jobs are ``real'' jobs and, as
we wait for the frazzled ``hostess'' to notice us, to ponder the

 &HT;    Clinton's speech reminds us how he handles pressure
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a while before he became president, Bill Clinton's
best-known speech was one he was called on to make in order to fill
a hole in the schedule at the 1988 Democratic National Convention,
a service to his party which earned him a reputation as a windbag.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have guessed a decade ago, when he was the butt of so
many jokes, that Clinton's ability to keep on talking, in
situations when others would be cowed into silence, would turn out
to be among his most precious political talents?
</P>
<P>
   Without that ability, it would have been impossible for the
president to walk into the House chamber where he was impeached
last month with a text as thick as a court deposition, stand in
front of a Congress divided bitterly over him, and deliver the
speech he did Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great... more balance on the see-saw,'' the president
ad-libbed after coaxing a little more applause than before from the
Republican side of the aisle, about 40 minutes into his State of
the Union speech.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of moment he has worked into nearly all his
yearly addresses: nonplussed by the stresses on him, he called the
attention of a large national audience to the stiffness of his
adversaries. You could see it coming - which may be one of the
reasons Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde and Rep. Bob Barr decided not
to attend the speech.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda Clinton outlined would be a load for a president
beginning a term with a Congressional majority and no cloud of
scandal. It is far more than a president under fire can do in 20
months, assuming he has that long.
</P>
<P>
   But by shaping this speech as a Rooseveltian call to address the
problems of the Senior Boom, as he called it, and nodding his
discontent with every problem from child labor in the Third World
to middle school test scores in the United States, Clinton
demonstrated the vitality and passion for issues which has stood
him in such good stead politically.
</P>
<P>
   By throwing down the gauntlet to the Republicans on the
patient's bill of rights legislation, the minimum wage and USA
accounts, and asking for more money for after-school programs as
well as military bases, he made his point without any mention of
the proceedings on the other side of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The drama and pomp of Tuesday night overshadowed White House
attorney Charles Ruff's plodding testimony earlier in the day at
the Senate impeachment trial, but that may have been the bigger
development.
</P>
<P>
   Taking less than his allotted time, Ruff was able to raise
serious questions of fact about the case presented by the House
impeachment managers last week, shooting a big hole in Rep. Asa
Hutchinson's chronology of the Vernon Jordan job search for Monica
Lewinsky, and the cell phone record of Betty Currie's conversation
with Lewinsky about which much was made last week.
</P>
<P>
   These questions may sway no Republican votes, but they give the
Democratic senators the countervailing arguments they were looking
for after the House managers laid out their case last week.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton, with a speech another politician might not have
been able to make, reminded them forcefully of the political
reasons for standing by their president.

UNDAUNTED, A COMPLEX PRESIDENT PRESSES AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, his lawyer
spoke softly, gently. In his State of the Union address to the
Congress, the president spoke forcefully, boldly.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, he has cast his lot with the Democrats in a
process that has been bitterly partisan. In the speech, he poached
ideas from Republicans in hopes that he can salvage a bipartisan
agenda from the rubble of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate chamber, temporarily transformed into a hushed
courtroom, he was on the defensive. In the House chamber, setting
for the president's annual message and a raucous rite of democracy,
he was on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   With the American political crisis about to enter its second
year, the depths of the divisions in the nation, the difficulty of
the political and legal questions it faces, and the immense
complexity of the man at the center of it all were painted in sharp
relief.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary, exhausting day of argument and oratory, the
president's legal team was setting forth the case for his survival
in the next few weeks even as the president himself was sketching
out a road map for political cooperation that could affect
Americans in the year 2075.
</P>
<P>
   Here was, to be sure, one of the memorable moments of the tawdry
12 months that have set Americans against Washington: an impeached
president struggling for his political life, standing before the
very politicians who will determine his destiny and blithely
speaking of the bright morning of the new century, sketching the
new world they would make together.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the president's survival strategy was indistinguishable
from his policy strategy. He should continue as president, as his
lawyer, Charles F.C. Ruff, argued in the afternoon, in part because
his policies are popular and successful. Hours later, Clinton
sought to demonstrate that he could still be president, even if
impeached, even if threatened by removal, even if his moral
authority was undermined.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the simple but defiant act of
delivering his annual message blared an unmistakable message of its
own: Clinton would govern even if his opponents insisted he
couldn't, he would survive even if his rivals argued he was doomed,
he would look forward even if his detractors picked through the
muck of the past.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second year in a row, the president went over the
heads of the nation's leaders to speak to its people, putting aside
the base language of a capital consumed with scandal and reaching
for the lofty rhetorical heights of national ambition. ``This is
our moment,'' the president said. ``Let us lift our eyes as one
nation, and from the mountaintop of this American century, look
ahead to the next one _ asking God's blessing on our endeavors and
our beloved country.''
</P>
<P>
   His style was classic Clinton, forged in three decades of a
political life that, in Little Rock, Ark., as in Washington, has
been full of threats and tumult. His formula: Stick with his own
kind, the Democrats, in the elemental issues of high emotion, but
sidle to the center and embrace the ideas of his rivals, the
Republicans, in policy questions.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that formula that has allowed him to persevere, but
it is also the formula that has inflamed both his allies and his
opponents. On the day that his lawyer was trying to convince
stubborn Republicans that the president had committed no crime and
should not be removed from office, the president used that very
same office to propose one of the chestnuts of Republican policy:
private investment of Social Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   There was enough of the Republican idea in the proposal to
inflame the old accusations of political larceny that followed the
president's offensive to balance the budget (a staple of GOP
platforms), overhaul welfare (the mantra of Republican governors),
and increase defense spending (a reliable GOP position since the
Nixon administration).
</P>
<P>
   But like many of the ideas the president has borrowed from the
Republicans over the years, its resemblance to the GOP plan was
only surface deep. The Republicans want private citizens to be able
to invest some of their Social Security taxes in the private
sector, creating their own retirement portfolios. Clinton would
invest a portion of the Social Security surplus in the private
sector, linking the fate of the signature New Deal program to the
caprices of the modern markets.
</P>
<P>
   In private briefings, White House officials described the
president's agenda as the boldest one since 1993, when he proposed
an overhaul of the nation's health-care system, which accounts for
one-seventh of the economy.
</P>

   This time he offers his most audacious notion: After a year of
revelations about intimate relations with an intern, legalistic
distinctions about the definitions of ``sex'' and ``is,'' and
efforts to block an independent counsel and impeachment itself,
Bill Clinton is still president, and probably will be a year from
now, when he is to deliver his last State of the Union Address.

   Serbian forces may have cleared the bodies from the mosque. They
may have succeeded in hiding some of the evidence from
international observers. But the implications of the massacre in
the town of Racak cannot be cleaned up so easily, for the anger
felt around the world has been both heartfelt and genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage is justified, but action founded on emotional impulses
and nothing else _ with no vision of what NATO and the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) wish to achieve _
will get nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it could embroil our troops in an endless and thankless
police action. OSCE monitors are already exposed to the threat of
kidnap or even murder. No more men and women should be risked
without the ``endgame'' that diplomats speak of so fondly but never
seem to play.
</P>
<P>
   One aim should be to secure justice for the slain. The murders
are an affront to the embryonic system of world justice.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, may have been able to
bar Louise Arbour, a war-crimes prosecutor, from Racak. He may
secure the expulsion of the head of the OSCE verification mission
in Kosovo. But the very fact that he thinks these people worthy of
notice shows that he recognizes their power and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Arbour has already secured a series of convictions in her court
in The Hague. The Bosnian Serb war criminals, Radovan Karadic and
General Ratko Mladic, are locked inside their puny enclave of
Republica Serbska by fear of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   President Milosevic's record, hitherto spared investigation
given his cooperation with the Dayton accord on Bosnia, should now
be subjected to the closest scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The more pressing dilemma is what to do in terms of military
action. The history of Yugoslavia's wars since 1991 is one long
demonstration that Serbia's radical nationalists will not yield
unless they are staring military defeat in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Armed resistance freed Slovenia and Croatia; a string of
Croatian victories, combined with NATO action, forced the Serbs to
an agreement at Dayton. European foreign ministers, including
Britain's Robin Cook, talked last October of ``final warnings'' and
secured a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   NATO generals have now been dispatched to Belgrade to warn that
military operation orders have not been rescinded since last year's
crises, and can be activated at any time.
</P>
<P>
   At least this is an improvement on the West's craven behavior
over Bosnia, though we must hope that the threat of force is being
made explicit.
</P>
<P>
   However, we must have a vision of what force will achieve. It
seems that nothing can salvage Kosovo's status as an integral part
of Serbia. But immediate independence, secured by military force,
is no more of an option.
</P>
<P>
   It would involve full-scale war with Serbia, an unpopular option
in the West. It would destabilize the whole Balkan region, with
Albanian populations in northern Greece and Macedonia encouraged to
pursue separatist demands.
</P>
<P>
   Greece, fretting over the status of the former Yugoslavian
republic of Macedonia, would never allow it.
</P>
<P>
   If we do not wish to see more innocent people die, the only
solution is to intervene in force to secure the separation of the
combatants and to hope that negotiation is forced by the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The ``observers'' will have to be armed and backed with ground
troops; if possible nations such as Russia, traditionally
sympathetic to Serbia, and Germany should be involved.
</P>
<P>
   If, in the long run, the people of Kosovo wish to join their
brethren in Albania, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a more democratic Serbia could emerge, shorn
of its present leadership, allowing Kosovo to retain some
relationship with its powerful neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   That is for those most directly involved to decide _ but we can
at least give them the time and the chance to negotiate. &QL;

HORRY GLAD TO BE BACK IN TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Home is nice, but Robert Horry was plenty thrilled
to be back in Los Angeles on Tuesday, working out with teammates
for the first time in nearly eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy to get this started. I've been kind of
missing L.A., missing the fans, missing playing in the Forum. I'm
just ready to get this started,'' Horry said after participating in
voluntary workouts at Southwest College.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Houston, Horry chose to stay with his family for
as long as possible before rejoining the Lakers for post-lockout
practices. His wife Keva is pregnant with their second child, and
first boy, who's due any day now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so funny, my daughter was looking at me like, `You're
still here?' It's funny, they're used to me being gone, that when
you're there for so long, they really appreciate it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't working out with other out-of-work NBA stars at
the gym, Horry spent a lot of time working on his golf game _ his
video golf game. Did all that time at home start to get on the
nerves of Mrs. Horry?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't bugging her yet. She was more like bugging me,
because I just wanted to sit on the couch and watch TV,'' Horry
said, then quickly added, ``(begin ital)after(end ital) I finished
working out now.''
</P>
<P>
   Delays, delays: The NBA pushed back the start of training camps
another day, and the Lakers' camp at UC Santa Barbara will begin
Thursday afternoon, at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Correction: Tickets for the Lakers' public scrimmage are
available at all TicketMaster outlets, except the ones located at
Robinsons May stores, the team announced.
</P>
<P>
   The scrimmage will be held Jan. 27 at the Forum, and admission
and parking are free.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Beaming indomitability, President Clinton
shouldered past friend and foe in Congress on Tuesday night to
personify for the nation the question of the hour: Is he on the
brink of destruction, or at some fresh peak of resilience?
</P>
<P>
   ``America is working again,'' Clinton declared as he closed out
an extraordinary Capitol day that arced from accusations to
accolades, from his harrowing impeachment trial to an ebullient
delivery of his State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   Throatily cheered by the Democrats, the president moved across
the House floor as if he indeed believed that the trial to remove
him from office was, at its heart, another initiative-rich
political campaign to be won _ his third and ultimate test to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats shouted encouragement of their champion; House
Republican leaders who led the impeachment campaign remained
noticeably undemonstrative.
</P>
<P>
   After a solid year of political and personal anguish, Hillary
Rodham Clinton _ no less scarred a veteran of grand jury inquiries
than the president _ looked with smiles upon her husband as if he
were the First Survivor down there detailing the strengths of the
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The fascination of watching such a durable, if self-tarnished,
president perform at the very firebase of impeachment prompted
grudging, less boisterous applause from Republicans. Some of his
House Republican prosecutors simply stood as he entered without
applauding the president they are fighting to banish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reach out my hand to those of you of both parties in both
houses,'' Clinton declared, speaking not of his own chances of
political extinction but of Social Security proposals that, he well
knows polls show, excite Congress' constituents far more than does
the Republicans' impeachment drive.
</P>
<P>
   The House scene presented an eerily exultant blend of lethal
politics within the Capitol and a far more soaring opportunity for
Clinton to reach beyond to the nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   The mob of watching fellow politicians, aware that the Clinton
popularity ratings have only further solidified since the trial
opened, eyed the president as a wounded but formidable contender.
He watched them, in turn, for hopeful signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was encouraging, you know?'' the president suddenly
interjected at a bipartisan burst of applause at a proposal for
parental aid. ``There was more balance on the see-saw!'' he
enthused, nudging forth more applause.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans in the audience appreciated Clinton's
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same problem, don't we?'' Sen. Ted Stevens of
Alaska asked in commenting on the burdens on the president but also
on his impeachment court. ``It's the strength of the system, not of
any one individual. Our Constitution provides for government to go
on no matter what happens to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of government going on was embodied by Clinton as he
entered the House chamber most eagerly, his smile undaunted, his
spirit seeming far from the Senate dock, just a short stroll to the
Capitol's far side. His own trial, while never explicitly alluded
to in his speech, seemed to punctuate the night as much as all the
bursts of applause.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of moving beyond ``the daily press of events'' and the
``clash of controversy,'' so that future Americans will see that
``we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and
hopefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before, the House Republican prosecutors helped to
fill television air time after Tuesday's trial session by
re-arguing their case and reaffirming their certainty that Clinton
deserves a Senate conviction and removal from office. Democrats, in
turn, darkly warned Republicans that they would be viewed by voters
as ``the party of impeachment'' unless they found a swift end to
the trial as much as a fair one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be and must be One America,'' the president firmly
insisted, speaking of immigration in a comment that seemed to
underscore the gravely fractured state of affairs between
legislature and executive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton offered national optimism, not personal apology, as he
faced, in effect, a mass political gathering of his judges and
jurors, defenders and enemies, all packed together in the same
chamber in ritual display of democracy's endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., earlier insisted, ``It seems to me
the impeachment trial has in fact sharpened our focus on
substantive issues,'' as if another day's impeachment argument was
an appetizer for the evening's searing political repast of the
president looking beyond his accusers to the judgment of ordinary
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The double-edged day began with the opening defense argument
before the Senate impeachment court by White House counsel Charles
Ruff, whose lawyerly tone in no way masked the bare-knuckled
resolve of the president's defenders to see to his survival. ``And
so we are here,'' Ruff solemnly declared of the approaching
showdown, proceeding to accuse House Republican prosecutors of
deception, ``nonsense'' and, above all, ``a rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we at that horrific moment in our history?'' he asked the
Senate, fighting back tears in pleading for the president to be
spared removal from office. Seated in the well of the Senate in his
wheelchair, Ruff provided a thematic prologue to the State of the
Union address, defending Clinton by interweaving the notions of the
nation's ``more perfect union'' with the ``human imperfections'' of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff kept the proceeding to little more than two hours, as if
deliberately clearing the day's main focus for the president's
message. Still, the scene displayed how emotionally draining the
occasion was: in the quiver of Ruff's hand as he pleaded before the
silent Senate; in the sudden urgency with which, off camera, the
Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, dispatched an
aide to do something about Ruff's microphone placement that muffled
for a while this most crucial pleading for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the two chambers, a sense of political free fall tinged
the comments of passing senators as they awaited the president's
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best ideas in Washington don't come from Congress,''
declared the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, as
he labored through the day to unveil a legislative agenda devoid of
the tar-baby impeachment issue that has been consuming the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was of similar mind as he addressed ``freedom's House''
Tuesday night, noting that the new speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, had talked hopefully of trying something new in the
Capitol _ ``a spirit of civility and bipartisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that,'' Clinton slowly
emphasized in his own pleading. For the moment, both sides in his
polarized audience applauded the embattled president.

PALMER BEGINS 39TH HOPE CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer begins his 39th Bob Hope Chrysler Classic today in
La Quinta, and he remembers his first one as clearly as his last.
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old Palmer, a five-time winner of the event, fondly
recalled what it was like when he won the inaugural event in 1960.
It was called the Palm Springs Golf Classic and played at
Thunderbird Country Club in Rancho Mirage. The total purse was
$70,000; Palmer's victory was worth $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Campbell earned more money than Palmer that year, and didn't
even finish in the top 20. He scored an ace on the fifth hole at
Tamarisk CC and won $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   This year's purse is $3 million, and the winner gets $540,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played in the Thunderbird Invitational, which was the
first tournament in the desert, there were only three courses in
the Coachella Valley,'' Palmer mused. ``That was in 1956. Now, they
have about 100 courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tournament is indicative of what has happened in
golf. It has gone from days when we were lucky to have 5,000 fans
spread over four courses to having a tremendous fan base.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention a tremendous base of talented golfers. This
year's defending champion is Fred Couples, who defeated Bruce
Lietzke in a playoff a year ago. Couples will be opposed by a field
that includes David Duval, who won the season-opening Mercedes
Championships in Hawaii, and 15 of the top 30 moneywinners from the
world money list.
</P>
<P>
   Those include 1998 Nissan Open champion Billy Mayfair, Payne
Stewart, Scott Hoch, Jesper Parnevik and John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   Former Hope champions include John Cook (1992 and '97) and Corey
Pavin (1987 and '91).
</P>
<P>
   The amateur portion of the field (which plays the first four
days) figures to get most of this week's attention because of the
presence of Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley. Jordan, who just
retired, and Barkley will be paired together. They will play with
Payne Stewart at Bermuda Dunes CC today, with John Daly at Tamarisk
on Thursday, with Pavin at Indian Wells CC on Friday and with Peter
Jacobsen at PGA West's Arnold Palmer Course on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Some professionals don't enjoy playing with amateurs, but
Couples said he enjoys it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to play with them,'' he said. ``There is actually an
advantage because, when you have so many people out there, some
people get in the way of balls that miss the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there are more cameras and many other things going
on, too, and the people get as excited to see celebrities as they
do for the golfers. It's just part of the Hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly would love to deal with it again. Winning the Bob
Hope last year was a huge thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the tournament will be televised on Thursday and
Friday from 1-3 p.m. by ESPN, and Saturday and Sunday from noon to
3 p.m. by ABC (Channel 7).

U.S. AUDIT FAULTS NYC ON WELFARE, OFFICIALS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A two-month federal inquiry into New York City's
welfare program has found that city officials routinely violate the
law by denying poor people the right to apply promptly for food
stamps, according to two officials who have read a draft report
prepared by the U.S. Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said federal auditors, who reviewed 600 cases at
two welfare offices in Queens, had found that city workers failed
to make applications immediately available as required by law. The
workers also failed to screen families for emergency food needs,
required the poor to search for jobs before applying, and cut off
food stamps to needy families who were still eligible for those
benefits, the officials said, speaking on condition that neither
they nor their agencies be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigators, the officials said, also sharply
criticized the state for failing to properly monitor the city's
welfare program, which the Giuliani administration has said was
intended to discourage people from applying for public benefits,
including food stamps. Advocates for the poor _ not state officials
_ alerted the federal government to the problems at city welfare
offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantial noncompliance with the food stamp act and
regulations has gone undetected and unaddressed at the local
level,'' the report said, according to the two officials who
described its findings to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The federal report offered the sharpest criticism yet of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's tough welfare policies, which Giuliani has
described as one of his biggest accomplishments. Federal officials,
who suspect the city is also improperly preventing the poor from
applying for medical assistance, are also reviewing the city's
Medicaid policies.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials, who presented the draft report
to the city and state last week, told the local officials that they
must act immediately to correct the deficiencies and gave them
until Tuesday evening to respond.
</P>
<P>
   City officials declined to discuss the report or to describe the
changes they were making in response to it. Instead, they accused
the federal investigators of trying to sabotage their efforts to
push people to rely more on themselves and less on government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The review being conducted by USDA is a misguided effort
intended to derail the state and city's progress in transforming
welfare, which includes food stamps, into one where work and
self-sufficiency are the foremost objectives of the program,'' said
Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources
Administration, which runs the city's welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said they had responded in writing, telling the
federal auditors that the city had agreed to develop a new
application form, to improve the screening process for emergency
food needs and to allow food stamp applicants with children under 6
to forgo the work rule.
</P>
<P>
   But the state officials vigorously defended their oversight of
the city, saying the problems uncovered were minor and were already
being addressed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent unprecedented amounts of time working on various
food stamp issues,'' said Daniel Hogan, a deputy commissioner of
the state's Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, which
oversees welfare programs in New York City and across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have asked the federal government to withdraw this
review,'' Hogan said. ``There's no basis for it. A conference call
could have taken care of these issues. The city's only intention
here is to run a fair, efficient operation that works.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The situation in New York highlights the conundrum confronted by
welfare officials across the country, who find themselves
struggling to juggle two very different federal mandates. While the
federal welfare law allows states and municipalities to discourage
people from applying for cash benefits, it requires states to
encourage the needy to apply for food stamps and Medicaid, two
benefits described as critical by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   New York City began its new application process in April when it
started converting welfare offices into ``job centers,'' where
caseworkers encourage people to seek child support payments,
unemployment benefits or help from food pantries instead of cash
benefits. The workers offer applications only if a person returns
for a second appointment.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the city's welfare offices currently operate
under those rules. When the federal investigators examined the two
Queens offices, they were among only nine of the roughly 30 offices
citywide that had been converted.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare issue is important to Giuliani, who aspires to
national office and often mentions his tougher approach to welfare
when he travels across the country testing the political waters.
And when the federal inquiry became public last November, Giuliani
began a vigorous attack on the federal investigators and advocates
for the poor.

CLINTON COMBATS IMPEACHMENT WITH SOCIAL SECURITY RESCUE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: UPDATES throughout with quotes, Clinton delivering speech;
note optional trims)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, delivering his State of the
Union address to a Republican-led Congress weighing his ouster,
proposed extending the solvency of Social Security for another
generation Tuesday by investing one-seventh of the system's
reserves in the stock market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan was the centerpiece of a 77-minute address
brimming with fresh initiatives and rehashed proposals that he
delivered to the House and Senate just hours after White House
counsel Charles F.C. Ruff opened the president's three-day defense
in the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered his policy-laden address with an air of
confidence after he was warmly greeted by three minutes of
sustained applause as he entered the chamber. He was interrupted at
least 85 times by applause, mostly from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The president stabbed the air with his left hand to underscore a
rhetorical point, clutched his jacket lapels, patiently scanned the
House chamber to await for applause to subside and veered off his
prepared text on occasion in response to encouraging applause.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats repeatedly rose to their feet to applaud Clinton's
proposals, often in response to Vice President Al Gore standing
from his seat on the podium behind the president.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans applauded politely or sat passively in their seats,
rising only when Clinton touched upon a GOP-backed proposal such as
charter schools or paid tribute to an American hero such as civil
rights pioneer Rosa Parks, who was seated in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty five minutes into his address, a beaming president took
note of the first sustained bipartisan applause for a proposal _ to
strengthen enforcement of equal pay for equal work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was encouraging, you know,'' Clinton injected. ``There
was more balance on the seesaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made only a glancing reference to his travails, telling
the nationally-televised audience that ``perhaps in the daily press
of events, in the clash of controversy, we do not see our own time
for what it truly is _ a new dawn for America.''
</P>
<P>
   He appealed for lawmakers and the nation to ``put aside our
divisions'' and find ``a new hour of healing and hopefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is accused of obstruction of justice and perjury in
connection with his efforts to conceal a sexual relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He delivered his address
in the same chamber where the House voted, on Dec. 19, to impeach a
president for only the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laid out ambitious domestic priorities for the coming
year that touched upon Americans' top priorities of education,
Social Security, crime, health care and Medicare, as identified in
a nationwide survey released Monday by the Pew Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the president's proposals appeared designed to court
support from the political constituencies that supported him for
re-election in 1996 _ women, suburbanites, minorities, the elderly
and union members.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential counselor Doug Sosnik said Clinton's ``very
ambitious agenda'' for the final two years of his presidency would
bolster the White House effort to combat Senate conviction on the
impeachment charges. ``Good policy is in fact good politics,''
Sosnik said.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two minutes into his speech, Clinton paid personal
tribute to his wife, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Mrs. Clinton's preparations to mark the nation's turn
into the 21st century, the president said: ``I honor her _ for
leading our Millennium Project _ for all she has done for our
children _ and for her historic role in serving our nation and
advancing our ideals at home and abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball slugger Sammy Sosa sat between Mrs. Clinton and Tipper
Gore in the House gallery; Parks sat adjacent to Mrs. Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most far-reaching proposal was his plan to salvage the
Social Security system from the technical bankruptcy that begins to
loom in 2013, when receipts from payroll taxes and interest begin
to fall short of benefits' payments for an expanding elderly
population.
</P>
<P>
   By 2032, the Social Security system's income would enable the
federal government to pay only 75 cents of every promised dollar in
benefits. Clinton said his proposal would prolong solvency until
2055.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show Social Security second only to
education as Americans' top concern as the first of 76 million baby
boomers near retirement in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   Some 44 million beneficiaries currently receive $393 billion in
payments each year under the program proposed by President Franklin
D. Roosevelt and adopted in 1935, during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to
address a remarkable new challenge _ the aging of America,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed earmarking 62 percent of the federal
government's projected $4.4 trillion budget surplus over the next
15 years for the Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he abandoned his opposition to investing Social
Security funds in the stock market _ and risked the ire of
organized labor _ to propose investing up to 15 percent of the
trust fund's $849 billion reserves in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the Clinton plan, up to 25 percent of the $2.7 trillion in
budget surplus funds diverted to Social Security would be invested
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   A private-sector team of managers under federal control would
oversee the investment of Social Security funds in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
criticized Clinton's proposal for opening the door to ``all kinds
of mischief involving government dictates, favoritism and
cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Clinton proposal appear to respond to a call by GOP
congressional leaders for a detailed White House rescue plan for
Social Security by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, Clinton's top adviser on the economy, said no
more than 15 percent of Social Security reserves would be invested
in the market.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Social Security Administration said Social
Security funds would account for barely 4 percent of the value of
the stock market. Studies show that Social Security trust funds
invested by in Treasury bonds yield about 2.5 percent in income
each year compared to a potential yield of about 6 percent in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expanded on the proposal, suggesting that 15 percent of
the projected $4.4 trillion surplus _ about $650 billion over 15
years _ be devoted to rescuing Medicare, to prolong its financial
solvency from 2008 to 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also suggested using about $500 billion of the projected
surplus to create a ``universal savings account,'' or ``USA
account,'' in which the federal government would match the savings
contributions of individual Americans on a sliding scale depending
upon income.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said that Clinton's plan to earmark 89 percent of the
projected federal budget surplus until 2015 would, in effect,
prevent the kind of across-the-board tax cut proposed by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., noted that Clinton proposed many of
the same programs last year but his leadership had been ``severely
undermined'' by his personal conduct and ``the erosion of trust and
integrity his actions have produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., one of the 13 House prosecutors who
presented the case against Clinton to the Senate, said he skipped
the address because it was ``inappropriate and awkward'' for
Clinton to address members of the Senate who were sitting in
judgment and members of the House who presented the case against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen seats in the 435-seat House chamber were vacant.
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced that the Justice Department will follow the
lead of states and sue cigarette makers in an effort to recoup
hundreds of billions of dollars the federal government has spent
caring for sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 55-cents-per-pack tax increase on cigarettes to help
discourage smoking among teen-agers and a Justice Department
enforcement effort targeting tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Overhauling $20 billion in annual federal assistance to public
school districts to improve performance by students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $1,000 tax credit to offset lost income for family members
providing long-term care for relatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $250-per-child tax credit for parents who stay at home.
</P>
<P>
   _ The addition of 50,000 police officers to the ranks of the
100,000 officers authorized under his program to federally
subsidize the police officers' first years of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called for stepped-up efforts to protect national
security, with a 70 percent, five year increase of $4.2 billion in
U.S.-subsidized efforts to buy or divert Russian nuclear weapons'
materials into civilian use and a $110 billion hike in U.S. defense
spending over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most dramatic proposal for national security was a
plan to double the amount of federal spending on defending the
nation against a chemical or biological weapons attack by rogue
nations, such as Iraq or Libya, or terrorist factions such as
Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   He seeks stockpiles of vaccines; development of a public health
surveillance system; and creation of a national preparedness office
to train police, firefighters and hospital workers in 120 cities to
deal with an attack.

&HT;        MURTHA HAS RESERVATIONS ABOUT CLINTON'S PLANS TO HELP AGING
AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 19, -- Rep. John Murtha said he was skeptical
about President Clinton's plans for saving Social Security, the
cornerstone of Tuesday's State of the Union address. Murtha called
it ``too risky'' for the government to privately invest a portion
of the nation's federal budget surplus to increase the Social
Security trust fund, an idea proposed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure that investing Social Security dollars in the
stock market is the best direction,'' said Murtha, D-Johnstown.
``There's no issue more important to our area and to the nation in
the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   But Murtha said he was pleased that saving Social Security and
Medicare, programs that help the aging, were priorities outlined by
Clinton for the year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the trust fund be at the front of the line
before our federal surplus is used for anything else,'' Murtha
said. ``In that regard, the President is clearly on the right
track.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton said he wants to use 60 percent of the
federal budget surpluses over the next 15 years to shore up the
system that pays benefits to America's retirees.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of that money would be invested in the stock
market. An independent board would make the decisions about
investing. Clinton also proposed that 11 percent of the surplus be
set aside to create new private retirement accounts with a variety
of investment options individuals could choose among.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Murtha said he thought the stock market was
too much of a gamble for Social Security funds because so many
retirees rely on it for their entire income. ``The Congressman just
has some serious reservations about the risks involved in putting
any money needed for Social Security into the stock market,'' said
Murtha's spokesman Brad Clemenson. ``Now the stock market is doing
great but what about when things change and take a turn and the
stock market drops?''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said the best way to keep Social Security a
guarantee is, ``not to make drastic cuts to benefits, not to raise
payroll tax rates, and not to drain resources from Social Security
in the name of saving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., now a juror in Clinton's impeachment
trial, said he thought the president's plan for reforming Social
Security was a good starting point, but needed work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I am concerned with the president's proposal,''
Santorum said. ``I think he's shown some initiative in establishing
some element of personal savings accounts and recognizing that
investing trust fund dollars in the stock market is a necessity to
preserve the long term social security solvency.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he favored establishing personal investment
accounts, where individuals could invest directly in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do now is blend those two concepts,'' Santorum
said. ``You can you have personal investment into the stock market
so individuals can reap the benefits and save social security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants to use one of every six dollars of the
surpluses in the next 15 years to extend Medicare until the year
2020. He asked for a patients bill of rights in managed care and
tax cuts geared toward helping cut the cost of long-term health
care.
</P>
<P>
   While 12.6 percent of the nation is 65 years of age or older,
Pennsylvania has 15.9 percent, the third highest percentage of
elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   Census data, which includes Cambria and Somerset counties in the
Johnstown regional count, reported that last year 18.7 percent of
the population in the Johnstown area is at least 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have been grappling with how to prevent Social
Security from going bankrupt, which experts say will happen in 2032
unless it is reformed. As early as 2013, the system will be paying
out more in benefits to retirees than it takes in from taxes on
workers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his plan for Social Security would keep the program
funded until 2055.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha said he would like to have seen Clinton focus more on
plans that would prevent illness through research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the President would also focus more on health-care
research,'' Murtha said. ``In the 12th District alone, 37,000
people have diabetes. Nationwide diabetes costs Medicare $40
billion. If we can defeat this illness, millions of Americans will
have better lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faced the nation and Congress to layout his plans for
leading the nation in the next year at the end of a dizzying day on
Capitol Hill. White House counsel Charles Ruff spent most of the
afternoon arguing in the Senate's impeachment trial against Clinton
that the president is innocent and should remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers had even urged Clinton to dispense with the
speech, saying it would be inappropriate for a president on trial
to address Congress and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But Murtha said Clinton's ideas about Social Security reform and
other issues was a wake-up call to Congress to put aside partisan
differences and get back to the nation's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hopeful that all sides in Washington are starting to get
the message that the people of Western Pennsylvania have been
telling me: stop the battling and politics as usual and get
together on the programs that help people,'' Murtha said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security poses a real test of whether Congress still is
able to set aside partisan differences and act in the national
interest.''

CLINTON PUSHES TO SAVE MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the same day his defenders fought to save his
presidency in the Senate, President Clinton unveiled Tuesday an
ambitious agenda that would use expected budget surpluses to save
Social Security and Medicare from insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising move, Clinton also said in his State of the
Union message that the Justice Department will file a lawsuit
against the nation's major tobacco companies to recover Medicare
costs from smoking-related illnesses. States, including Texas,
already have settled with several tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave his address to a joint Congress amid an atmosphere
electrified by partisan politics and a historic impeachment trial.
Still, Clinton kept his focus on his multifaceted, poll-tested
laundry list of 79 items that challenges Congress to act while the
nation basks in prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps in the daily press of events, in the clash of
controversy, we do not see our own time for what it truly is: a new
dawn for America,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president saluted new House Speaker Dennis Hastert and the
Illinois Republican's call for civility and an end to partisanship.
``Mr. Speaker, let's do just that,'' Clinton said as he turned from
the podium and shook Hastert's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The House, led by the Republican majority, one month ago
impeached him on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
Clinton, defying calls that he postpone the speech, addressed the
joint session just hours after his own attorneys opened their
defense of him before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton made clear he intends to be in office not just next
month but the next two years and outlined a plan for not just 1999
but for the next 15 years as he urged Congress to use the nation's
projected budget surpluses on a series of social programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is working again. The promise of our future is
limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum
of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a
nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a
nation today,'' said Clinton, who spoke for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In a theme repeated throughout his address, Clinton said it was
time for his generation to begin to meet its ``historical
responsibility'' to provide for families, school children, senior
citizens and the nation just as previous generations ``answered the
call to greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Clinton's 1999 agenda calls for devoting 60
percent of the expected budget surplus over the next 15 years, an
expected $2.7 trillion, to the Social Security Trust Fund. He
proposed 25 percent of that amount be invested in the stock market
to generate higher rates of return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to keep Social Security a rock-solid guarantee is
not to make drastic cuts in benefits; not to raise tax rates; and
not to drain resources from Social Security in the name of saving
it. Instead, I propose that we make the historic decision to invest
the surplus to save Social Security,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Social Security reform should be bipartisan. ``I
reach out my hand to those of you of both parties in both houses
and ask you to join me in saying: We will save Social Security
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security plan, aides said, would extend the solvency
of the system until 2055 from 2032. He urged Congress to go beyond
2055 and work to save Social Security until the year 2075 while
also working to reduce the poverty rate of elderly women and to
eliminate the earnings test for beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Congress to use the surplus to save Social
Security first before turning to the other programs he outlined.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed Congress then devote 15 percent of the surplus
to Medicare to provide an additional $650 million to $700 million
and extend the life of the health insurance program for senior
citizens until 2020. Currently, Medicare is expected to be bankrupt
by 2008. He also urged additional reforms, including the creation
of a prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising announcement came midway through his address
as Clinton announced the Justice Department was preparing a lawsuit
against tobacco companies. Congress last year refused to approve a
25-year, $350 billion settlement between the states, the federal
government and the tobacco companies. The states later reached a
separate agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars
under Medicare and other programs. You know, the states have been
right about this. Taxpayers shouldn't pay for the cost of lung
cancer, emphysema and other smoking-related illness, the tobacco
companies should,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the funds recovered from the companies would be used to
strengthen Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the creation of Universal Savings Accounts (USAs) to
help working Americans save for their retirement by using 11
percent of the projected surplus over 15 years, but suggested
Congress work out the details.
</P>
<P>
   The USA program, similar to a 401k program, would have the
government make dollar-for-dollar contributions into savings
accounts opened by lower-income workers. The program would cost
$500 billion over 15 years. But details, such as the size of
contributions, the government match rates and income limits, should
be determined by Congress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plans for the budget surplus drew lukewarm responses
from Republicans who intend to make tax cuts the key item in their
agenda this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plans also called for a $1,000 credit for long-term
health care, $500 for a child care credit for a stay-at-home spouse
and a $1,000 tax credit for workers with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for reserving 11 percent of the surplus over
15 years for domestic priorities such as education and military
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed more money for education to end social promotion,
turn around low performing schools, test new teachers, hire more
teachers, reduce class size and build new classrooms. He called for
a $1 minimum wage increase over two years. He again offered a plan
to expand child care.
</P>
<P>
   On the international front, Clinton proposed expanding a program
that helps Russia and the former Soviet states destroy nuclear
weapons and help keep their scientists employed. He also said the
United States would continue to work to contain Iraq and to work
for new leadership there.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred years from tonight, another American president will
stand in this place to report on the State of the Union. He, or
she, will look back on a 21st century shaped in so many ways by the
decisions we make here and now,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of
our time, but of their time; that we reached as high as our ideals;
that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and
hopefulness; that we joined together to serve and strengthen the
land we love,'' he said. ``My fellow Americans, this is our
moment.''

NBA.COM'S NEW LOOK DESIGNED TO WIN BACK FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the lockout behind it, the NBA is making a pitch to be
fan-friendly on all levels, including and possibly starting with
the league's official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   NBA.com (www.nba.com) officially launched its new look Tuesday.
It's not so much a redesign as it is a basic reorganization of the
site with easier navigation.
</P>
<P>
   It's one way to let fans know ``we're back in business,'' said
Stefanie Scheer, director of Internet services for NBA
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   NBA.com's new look has an ESPN.com-like design, which is to be
expected, of course, because NBA and ESPN.com are partners.
</P>
<P>
   The new look enables NBA.com users to access more updates and
features on a single screen. Those changes don't sound truly
innovative, but they're the most radical the site has made since
its launch four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be able to easily find the usual exclusive NBA
features, such as an extensive video collection, fantasy games and
merchandise. Another big draw is a special retrospective look at
the career of Michael Jordan with exclusive video and audio, and
hundreds of images.
</P>
<P>
   The new look also includes a Java-powered news update and a live
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   When the season starts, it should be interesting to see if
NBA.com can match or improve on its fan-base numbers. Scheer said
NBA.com attracted more than 500,000 visitors per day during the
last regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Scheer said the new look underscores the site's mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everything anyone wants to know about the 29 teams,'' she
said. ``Our focus is being the resource for everything basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ramped up and excited.''
</P>
<P>
   MJ TRIBUTE: Everyone is getting into the act with Michael Jordan
tributes. At CNN/SI.com, Jordan fans can check out photos and
articles about Jordan from Sports Illustrated and interactive
features, including video highlights and reaction audio from around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   AUDIO/VIDEO HIGHLIGHT: For the fourth consecutive year,
Dallas-based Broadcast.com plans to provide audio and video
Internet coverage of events and activities leading up to the Super
Bowl. Broadcast.com's best feature for Super Bowl XXXIII? From the
comforts of your personal computer, you can crash super agent Leigh
Steinberg's private party.

RODMAN APPARENTLY TO SIT OUT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Richie Whitt 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of joining Latrell Sprewell as two of the baddest apples
in the Big Apple, Chicago Bulls forward Dennis Rodman has
apparently decided to worm his way toward retirement by sitting out
the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   On another frenzied day of free-agent transactions and another
delay to the start of NBA training camps, hours after his agent
said Rodman was retiring, the seven-time rebounding champion said
he will sit out the season instead of accepting a trade that would
have sent him to the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play this year,'' Rodman told Fox Sports
News. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who lives in Dallas and spends time during the summer
with his excavation company, said last season he would return to
the Bulls only if the nucleus of their six-time champion dynasty
was kept intact. With Michael Jordan's retirement, the expected
departure via trade of Scottie Pippen to the Houston Rockets and
the expected sign-and-trade deals of Luc Longley and Steve Kerr,
Rodman also won't be back.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Dwight Manley said the Bulls were preparing to sign Rodman
to a three-year deal and then trade him to the Knicks in exchange
for veteran forward Buck Williams. While the deal would have netted
the scorched-earth Bulls another player in the last year of his
contract and enabled them to move closer to their goal of creating
cap room for the 1999-2000 off-season, Rodman would have joined
Sprewell in one of the most colorful tandems in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, who will go to the Knicks for forward-guard Chris
Mills and Golden State's choice of Chris Childs or John Starks once
the lockout is officially lifted later this week, received a
one-year suspension for choking coach P.J. Carlesimo last season.
Rodman, one of the most controversial and fierce competitors in the
league, has excelled on the court while creating stirs off it by
dating Madonna, flying to gamble in Las Vegas and later attending a
professional wrestling event during last year's Finals, marrying
Carmen Electra, dressing in drag for a New York book signing, and
kicking a Minnesota cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   With Rodman gone and a plethora of free agents lined up to
leave, official trades and signings remain stagnant as lawyers try
to dot the i's and cross the t's on the collective bargaining
agreement. A league spokesman said the sides are still haggling
over the newly created ``middle class'' exception, with the league
seeking to keep contracts to three years while the union wants to
allow deals as long as six years under the salary-cap loophole.
</P>
<P>
   Training camps were originally scheduled to open Monday, but the
earliest date will now be tomorrow, meaning the previously
announced start of the 50-game regular season Feb. 5 will likely be
pushed back as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a realistic chance of getting it done'' tonight, said
union legal counsel Jeffery Kessler.
</P>
<P>
   The delay gives blue-chip free agent Antonio McDyess another day
to decide between the Phoenix Suns and Denver Nuggets. McDyess,
whose decision will create a domino effect among other free agents,
can get more money from the Suns since he played there last year,
but has strong ties to Nuggets coach Dan Issel and point guard Nick
Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Tony Dutt, indicated McDyess is leaning toward
Denver, but wouldn't make his decision until today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be an honor for us to be like \RJohn\S Stockton and
\RKarl\S Malone,'' Suns point guard Jason Kidd said. ``We've got
that type of potential, but I don't know what's going to happen. He
hasn't returned anyone's phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns expect to trade three of their five signed players _
Mark Bryant and former Mavericks Bubba Wells and Martin Muursepp _
in exchange for Longley.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our efforts right now are hopefully for a return of
Antonio,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said. ``Option B, and it's a
strong option, is looking at other top free agents. Until the dam
breaks at the top, it's just speculation on everybody's part.''
</P>
<P>
   Should McDyess sign with Denver, the Suns will turn their focus
to small forward Tom Gugliotta, also weighing an offer to return to
the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   In an agreed-upon deal, the Seattle SuperSonics were set to send
center Jim McIlvaine to the New Jersey Nets for veteran forwards
Michael Cage and Don MacLean.

BRUINS EXPECT TO SEE DREADED ZONE DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Bruins think they know what's coming tonight
against USC at the Sports Arena. But can they do anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll probably play 40 minutes of zone (defense),'' UCLA
coach Steve Lavin said with a slight smile.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? UCLA has struggled against zones throughout the
season, culminating in a 10-minute shutdown against Stanford.
Unable to contain the Bruins in a man-to-man defense, the Cardinal
shifted to a 2-3 zone midway through the second half. It paralyzed
UCLA and changed the game.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the Trojans devised their strategy with that game in
mind. Meanwhile, UCLA practiced its zone offense for 45 minutes
Tuesday, emphasizing movement, spacing and passing _ the very
ingredients it lacked against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's probably our weakness,'' guard Baron Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin believes the Bruins are most effective against zones when
big men Dan Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso are on the court. Moiso
extends the defense with his shooting range, and Gadzuric pressures
the underbelly with his size and strength. Because of foul trouble,
they were rarely on the floor together against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The other key to disarming a zone is perimeter shooting _ a
wanted commodity in Westwood. UCLA is last in the Pac-10 in 3-point
shooting (20.2 percent) in conference games. If he gets desperate
tonight, watch for Lavin to insert designated shooter Brandon Loyd,
who missed the Stanford game with food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been real frustrating,'' Davis said. ``We know we can hit
them, so we shoot and miss, and they're the same shots we hit in
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson update: Sophomore guard Earl Watson is listed as
day-to-day, but the consensus at UCLA is that he's expected to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has a deep cut between the middle and ring fingers on his
right (shooting) hand. He'll use tape to keep the fingers from
separating and ripping apart the stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play, but I don't know if it's the right thing. I
don't know if it's the smart thing,'' said Watson, who is UCLA's
leading scorer at 13 points per game. ``One option I've got to
think seriously about is missing a game or two to let the healing
process develop quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin expects Watson to play, although the tape may hinder his
ballhandling and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been around a player who has as high a pain
threshold,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the streak? UCLA has won eight straight over USC in
football and men's basketball, the last loss coming in the Sports
Arena late in the 1994 season. The Bruins will use that success as
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about . . . not wanting to drop the ball, so to
speak,'' Lavin said.

 &HT;    Getting down with the Republican posse
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was the editors' idea that I attend the
George W. Bush Inaugural Ball for people 35 and under.
</P>
<P>
   My bosses think it's funny to send an old, limping, sore,
gray-headed columnist such as myself to the young people's affair
to see if they'll actually let me in.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they let me into the Young Texans Ball. The
Republicans sold me a ticket for $40 to get in, just like they did
to everybody else. What do they care how old I am? All they wanted
was my money.
</P>
<P>
   If I was a stiff and you dropped me off at the front door of the
Austin Music Hall, where this inaugural ball for young Republicans
was held Tuesday night, they would have let me in as long as I had
a couple of $20 bills pinned to my tux.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if I had been a dead guy dressed in a pair of
overalls, they might not have let me in. This was a black-tie
affair. I think this was the first time I'd had on a tuxedo since
my first marriage, which occurred in 1436. So it took me about half
an hour just to figure out how to put the ensemble on. And if the
current Mrs. Kelso hadn't helped me with those funny little studs,
I would have had to go studless, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look swell, you really do,'' my wife Sally said as I left
the house. ``You look just like Rutherford B. Hayes.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, to the young people at this party, most of whom really
were under 35, I probably looked more like Gabby Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of the age of the partygoers, this ball was like
most any other Republican social I have ever been to _ a bunch of
people standing around, chatting politely and drinking responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you just want to set off a cherry bomb at these deals,
to get something going.
</P>
<P>
   I was at this alleged shindig for about an hour and the whole
time I was there, the only people I saw dancing were the bartenders
behind the bar, who were doing kind of a line dance. And a band
called Blue Mist was playing some pretty bouncy music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's behaving themselves pretty well _ so far,'' said
bartender Janice Hampton, 36. You could say that again.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, compassionate conservatism apparently doesn't
include free beer because it was a cash bar. And not a cheap one. I
paid $3.75 for a Heineken.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't you punks out there shaking that thing? ``Because
we're all too busy eating,'' said Sabrina Beleck, 21, a George W.
Bush supporter from Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if it had been a Democratic gathering, the floor
would already have been filled with people doing the funky chicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody'd be dancing by now, that's for sure,'' she said.
And some of them would be under arrest for doing funny things with
their zippers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Sabrina had a point. The groceries at this party were
pretty good, although a lot of the grub was that upscale stuff that
makes you wonder what the heck it is you're fixing to put in your
mouth. Maybe that's why the caterers labeled some of the food with
small signs. Otherwise, who would have known those little brown
hummers were sun dried tomato cream cheese vegetable roulades. You
could have fooled me.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the mashed potato bar. Now this is what I call
Republican. At the mashed potato bar, you scoop some mashed
potatoes out of a fancy chaffing dish, cover them with shrimp and
crab leek sauce, and eat out of the plastic martini glass.
</P>
<P>
   I tried this, and this good-looking young blonde walked by and
looked at me as if she were wondering, ``Why is that old man eating
out of his martini glass?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a largely conservative crowd, so I guess I shouldn't be
surprised that I only saw one tattoo on a chick and just one guy in
the whole bunch wearing a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of noting that myself,'' said Eric Meyer, 26, of
San Antonio. ``I've had mine for a while and I don't plan on losing
it any time soon. I just cut 12 inches off last year, and that was
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He, too, was hoping the party would steam up. ``I'm hoping it
picks up a little bit and gets a little more crowded,'' said Eric,
a consultant for an engineering company. ``I'm hoping to see a lot
of single women.''
</P>
<P>
   So next time take this advice from old Gabby _ GO TO SIXTH
STREET.

 &HT;    Austin inside/ out _ Inaugural Edition
 &HT;    By Michael Corcoran
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Houston Chronicle enlivened the humor factor
at Tuesday's Inaugural ceremonies, as folks were still cackling
about a typo in Sunday's I-Day advance story that changed Gov.
George W. Bush's motto ``Juntos Podemos'' to ``Juntos Pedemos'',
which means ``Together we pass gas.'' The real translation of
``Juntos Podemos,'' of course, is ``Together We Can'' . . . . .
Cynics might brush off Bush's commitment to Latino issues as simply
a case of language tapes paying off big time, especially when they
note el guv didn't make it to Tuesday's reception for visiting
governors from the Mexican states of Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas,
Veracruz and Chihuahua held by the Mexican American Legislative
Caucus. U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Jeffrey Davidow was there, as was
Mexico's Ambassador to the U.S., Jesus Reyes Heroles. But the party
ran from 5:30 to 7 pm _ prime time to get ready _ and Gov. Bush
probably wanted to look bueno for all the ball-hopping he'd be
doing later in the evening . . . . . Laura Bush always looks great,
so look for her favorite designer, Dallas' Michael Faircloth, to
receive a heightened profile, a la Nancy Reagan's clothier Jimmy
Gallanos, if our Laura gets to the White House. As she sweltered in
the late spring temps of Tuesday, however, Texas' first lady
must've been wondering if a mohair and wool suit was the right
choice. . . . . Didja know that if the Bushes move to D.C., Texas
will be the only state in the union with a governor named ``Rick?''
</P>
<P>
   There was more clout than at a home run derby Sunday night at
the Stratford Hills home of lobbyist Neal T. ``Buddy'' Jones, who
threw a soiree for inauguration-covering journalists Ron Brownstein
of the L.A. Times and Dan Balz of the Washington Post. Guests on
hand included the Perrys, Rick and Anita, new Comptroller Carole
Keeton Rylander and her campaign manager/
</P>
<P>
   son Scott McClellan, powerhouse state Sen. Bill Ratliff and
state Rep. Rob Junell, former President Bush staffer Texas house
speaker James ``Pete'' Laney and Mayor Kirk Watson, who probably
looked even shorter than usual in such company. Perhaps as a show
of solidarity for Red McCombs (whose Vikings couldn't close the
sale on that 1999 Super Bowl model earlier in the day), Gov. Bush
was a party no-show. . . . . The Guv's parents Barbara and George
flew to Austin separately, but they'll be flying back to Houston
together on Southwest Airlines, instead of a private jet. Did they
lose a bet or something? . . . . After a full day with the
political social set, I'm wondering why no one's had the idea to
start a new ``Trophy Wife'' magazine (with former governor Preston
Smith's new girlfriend a cover subject in waiting). Some women
evidently find power attractive, and if you don't believe that,
I'll bury you. You'll wish you never heard the name

 &HT;    El-Amin is all the rage at UConn
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ He can't tell you where the joy comes from even though
it is his most devastating skill.
</P>
<P>
   Khalid El-Amin is one of the best collegiate point guards in the
country because of his ability and talent, but don't watch him only
because he can expertly handle the full-court press or make the
last-second hope shot.
</P>
<P>
   He may not even be the top player on the No. 1 ranked University
of Connecticut men's basketball team (that nod would likely go to
National Player of the Year candidate Richard Hamilton) and at a
generously listed 5-foot-10 and more accurate 203 pounds, he
certainly doesn't look the part.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin doesn't have to. He has something else. If Hamilton is
the bomb, El-Amin is the bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get more comments about Khalid than about any other player
who's been here,'' Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said. ``It transcends
background. People see something in him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is likely there aren't many 19-year-old college sophomores
who are married, have two children, are practicing Muslims and also
are the floor general for the best team in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter. El-Amin strikes a chord in the collective inner
child of those who watch him play. He posesses an exuberance and
love for the game never before seen on the court of Gampel Pavilion
on Connecticut's campus in Storrs, at least not by a player wearing
a Huskies uniform.
</P>
<P>
   He plays each game as if its his last, only this season could go
on longer than ever before for the team because of what he's
brought in just his second season: the ability to take over a game
and to get the ball to those who need it, especially Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never gets bored at being exciting,'' Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
   And he's old, in basketball years. His father, Charles, has a
favorite story he tells about watching his 4-year-old son dribbling
the basketball on the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Their Minneapolis neighborhood had lots of kids at least four
years older than him, and that helped El-Amin develop his skills a
lot earlier and a lot faster. He played with on his brother's
seventh-grade team when he was in third grade, and played for the
high school team as an eighth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   He led his Minneapolis North High School team to three
consecutive state championships and was the two-time Minnesota
State High School Player of the Year. He even orally committed to
the University of Minnesota his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   The many accolades and gobs of attention he received didn't mean
much once he stepped in the door of his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't allow him to wallow in adulation from other people,''
said his mother, Arlene. ``If he had a good game, I'd say,
`Congratulations, nice job, now it's time to clean the bathroom.'
Because the reality is, the dishes still need to be washed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows his ability is a gift from God. If he abuses it, it
can leave him very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say his parents aren't proud of him. They are.
El-Amin was raised in the Muslim faith and still prays five times a
day. They encouraged him to marry Jessica his junior year of high
school, and supported him after he fathered his first son,
Tezzaree, his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica gave birth to his second son, Ishmael, last month, and
the three live together in an off-campus apartment. Tezzaree is in
Minneapolis, where he goes to the El-Amins and points and yells
``Daddy'' as they watch his father play via their satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   Both son's names are written on El-Amin's basketball sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done things kids my age haven't done,'' El-Amin said. ``I
know I've been through a lot and that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents also helped him make one of the more unpopular
decisions of his hometown when he decided maybe schools besides
Minnesota had something to offer. He narrowed his list to
Minnesota, Georgetown, Kansas and Connectiuct, where he chose to go
because in his mind, they had the best chance of any to go to the
post-season each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies made it to the Elite Eight last season. This season,
they're undefeated and El-Amin averages 14.5 points and 3.8 assists
per game.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Calhoun forgets he's dealing with a young kid because
of El-Amin's wordliness; Calhoun said El-Amin can speak of many
subjects, and wishes he'd share his perspective and outlook on life
more often.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin is understandably guarded. The basketball court is where
he expresses himself, and that may be as close to knowing him as
most of this country will get.
</P>
<P>
   He momentarily shocked his coach earlier this season at
Pittsburgh. El-Amin had been taunted by the crowd for the entire
game, which was led by Pittsburgh. The Huskies managed to score
five points in the last 9 seconds, including El-Amin's leaner in
the lane with 2 seconds left which gave Connecticut the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The stunned crowd then watched as El-Amin leapt onto the
scorer's table, thumped his chest and shouted `We're No. 1.'' It
was not, as El-Amin now says, the ``classiest of class.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun pulled him down, put his arm around him, and the two
hadn't taken more than a few steps before El-Amin said he was
wrong. Calhoun agreed, but he also understood.
</P>
<P>
   Secretly, he admired and even relished it. Perhaps he found the
missing ingredient that's kept the Huskies from achieving the
ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to see that excitement every game,'' Calhoun said.
``Yes, he's 19, but he's brought something to the team we
definitely needed. He's unique. I enjoy the challenge of him.''

 &HT;    Knicks win Sprewell bidding war
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The New York Knicks, who were running
third in the Latrell Sprewell trade talks just two days ago,
emerged as the winners Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Heat's chief rivals will trade for the Warriors guard
when the collective bargaining agreement is finalized, barring any
last minute complications. New York will send Chris Mills and John
Starks to the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat and Indiana Pacers were at different times reported to
be the leaders for Sprewell, but Miami lost interest after a
proposed four-team trade fell apart Monday and the Pacers pulled
out the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy its over with,'' Heat guard Tim Hardaway said.
``We don't have to hear about it anymore. I know Mash (Jamal
Mashburn) is happy, P.J. (Brown) is happy. We go on and keep the
same core.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn, Brown, Dan Majerle and Brent Barry were all part of
several packages the Heat reportedly were offering. But in the end,
sources said Pat Riley's reluctance to trade Brown and Mashburn,
and Riley's desire to move on and not allow the Warriors to play
the Eastern Conference contenders off one another, was the reason
Miami pulled out of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Heat players predictably said it was no great loss that they
won't get Sprewell and did not seem too worried their main rival in
the division landed the one time all-pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be right there,'' Hardaway said. ``I'm very
comfortable with my team and my teammates. We can beat anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brown: ``It's not etched in stone he's going to turn that
team around. We know what kind of a player he is but just because
you're a good player it doesn't mean you are going to come in and
do a great job. It's a whole different (game) in the East than it
is in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat need Sprewell, or a player of similar talents to
challenge for a title. Voshon Lenard, the Heat's starting shooting
guard, is Miami's weakest defender at a position that is loaded
with offensive stars in the East. He has trouble guarding players
like Penny Hardaway, Allan Houston, Mitch Richmond, Reggie Miller,
Steve Smith, Ray Allen and Kerry Kittles.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hardaway believes the Heat still have the better team, he
believes he will help the Knicks. In fact, he said Tuesday he was
``shocked'' the Knicks only had to part with Mills and Starks.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Golden State screwed up the trade, Hardaway said:
``They have a history of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had to make this trade. Without Sprewell, New York
has no chance of winning the East. With Sprewell, the could
explode. ... or implode.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, a lineup of Charlie Ward, Houston, Sprewell, Larry
Johnson and Patrick Ewing is as good as any in the East. But
Sprewell must conform in several ways to make this unit effective.
</P>
<P>
   One wrong move and Sprewell's mug will be splattered all over
the back pages of the tabloids. Sprewell's temper is as explosive
as his game. In New York, that could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell has been a big scorer for bad teams. He now joins a
team that already has had trouble finding enough shots for Ewing
and Houston. Add Sprewell to that equation and the Knicks will
either be lauded for their chemistry in June, or ripped for their
selfishness in May.

BASKETBALL COLUMN: JOHN STARKS IS LEAVING TOWN
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BKN-KNICKS-SPREWELL, BKN-VECSEY-COLUMN) 
 (bl) 
By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ John Starks Jr. heard the rumors Tuesday
morning and decided to confront his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son asked me today, `Dad, I got to leave school?' I said:
`Yeah, maybe. I'm not sure.' He said, `But Dad, we've already been
out to Golden State.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, John Jr.'s father needed a job. The Warriors had just
cut him after 36 games. It was off to the Continental Basketball
Association for a year. But it was still basketball. He remembered
that each day after after bagging groceries in Tulsa, Okla., where
he worked on his game, dreamed his dream and prayed the two would
fuse together.
</P>
<P>
   He would become an NBA All-Star or a bag boy. He would throw
down the most monstrous dunk over Michael Jordan in 1993, or he
would shoot 2 for 18 against the Houston Rockets in Game 7 of the
'94 NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   All or nothing. That is how the John Starks story began, and he
never deviated from the plot.
</P>
<P>
   On his last day as a New York Knick, the player who took Madison
Square Garden on a thrill-seeking ride for eight seasons _ the
player who once said someone would have to tear the No. 3 jersey
from his chest before he was traded to another team _ did not
regret where he was going.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of us who find a connection in a peak-and-valley
existence, Starks remembered how far he had come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on down the line, I'll probably shed a tear or
something,'' Starks said as he stood outside the Knicks' practice
facility amid reports that he was headed to the Warriors in a deal
for Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny, huh?'' he added. ``Not in my wildest dreams did I ever
think I would have this much effect on people. But I think you when
you grow as a person and people get to see you grow _ the way you
mature _ well, that's insight for people to help them grow and
mature. If people take anything from how I played, I hope they
remember that when they think they can't get any lower, to hold
their head high and walk straight ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to get clouded emotionally when the subject is
Starks, and forget sometimes that he never met a shot he wanted to
pass up or let Reggie Miller get too far under his skin to think
rationally. But six months after Charles Oakley was sent packing to
an Eastern Conference doormat, the franchise that used to be built
on grit, perseverance and will sent its most popular player off to
Western Conference purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   No player resonated more with Knick fans than Starks, whose
failures and successes were always magnified.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunk came in the 1993 conference semifinals, a lean-in,
left-handed slam that shook the Garden and the Bulls in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew John could go upstairs, but the thing about it is, he
brought the ball back to the defense with his left hand,'' said
Herb Williams, who looked like he was standing in a ghost town
Tuesday as he bounced a ball in an empty gym. ``And as high as
Michael and Scottie jump, you figured they would have got it. But
they couldn't do nothing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams re-enacted the dunk, rubbed his chin, folded his arms
and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got both of them that day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was dusting off the cobwebs Tuesday, perhaps because
Starks was also part of a larger mosaic.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly one-sided, Bulls-Knicks represented the best theater in
the NBA over the past 10 years. With Jordan retiring last week,
Pippen off to Houston and a dynasty dissolving within days, trading
Starks was another blow to the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Starks thought about it Tuesday, calling his 2-for-18
performance against Houston in 1994 his lone regret with the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any regrets except for one, and that was Game
7,'' he said. ``When I wasn't able to perform the way I'm capable
of performing and bring a championship to this city, which is so
deserving of one. That' s the only thing I'll regret about being
here. That one game.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Knicks, Starks was often like the little brother you
couldn't ditch and finally said, ``Enough already,'' before
inviting him to tag along.
</P>
<P>
   But there were at least 35 games over the past three years that
Starks won for the Knicks. If it wasn't with his infectious energy
_ the way he sprinted to the scorer's table and discarded his
warm-ups like a high school freshman playing in front of his
parents for the first time _ it was his knack for dropping in jump
shots at the most crucial time.
</P>
<P>
   So he was a gunner, a few fries short of a Happy Meal sometimes.
What do you expect from a man who left his own wedding reception
for a junior college game? Starks thought the game was canceled,
but he received a call from his coach after the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove from the reception in Tulsa to a small town about an
hour and a half away,'' he said. ``Picked up a speeding ticket.
Scored about 30 points in that half.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Some people wrote I ripped off my tuxedo when I got
there. But that part isn't true. I changed before I got to the
gym.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks walked out of the practice facility, shook the hand of
the Knicks equipment manager Wayman Manning, walked down two
flights of stairs and tossed his duffel bag into his jet-black
Mercedes. He will get his money, he still has his health and this
is only the business side of sports. ``There's no place like being
in the Garden when it's rocking,'' Starks said. ``The fans here
took me to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dunk. 2 for 18. John Starks, the quintessential boom-or-bust
player, Tuesday took all of New York with him.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing will ever be the same.

 &HT;    Rush to land Sprewell points out a sad fact
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Michael Jordan is gone, on his own
terms, and Latrell Sprewell is back, ditto.
</P>
<P>
   Got to hand it to the NBA, don't you? One feel-good story after
another for an industry that welcomes its players back to work
after a ridiculous labor war but can't quite agree on when they
should start. One hard foul after another in a game that began with
peach buckets nailed to the wall and has evolved to the point where
fans are similarly spindled.
</P>
<P>
   Distasteful to see Pat Riley among the supplicants at Spree's
feet. The expensive suits and motivational books and commanding
stage presence say that Riley is something else altogether, but in
the end the man who runs the Miami Heat is just a coach.
</P>
<P>
   He proves it when he pursues a thug with a 20-point career
scoring average, minimizing Sprewell's attack on a former boss as
an error in judgment rather than a strike at the jugular,
fantasizing about a Miami locker room in which a time bomb ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line, and what else matters to a coach, the Heat would
have won more games with Sprewell. What's more, if a four-team
trade involving 10 players had gone off as planned and brought
Sprewell to Miami, the confounded Knicks wouldn't be adding the
game's most dangerous shooting guard to their roster. Losing out on
Sprewell now is an annoyance for Riley, but losing out to him in
some upcoming playoff round is an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody suffers to some extent, however, when a spoiled brat
is coddled. Today the Knicks celebrate. Soon enough they will
tolerate. With what can New York coach Jeff Van Gundy threaten
Sprewell the first time sparks fly?
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest you stand down, Latrell,'' Van Gundy might say, ``or
you'll get more of what I gave Alonzo Mourning in that playoff
brawl last year. You think Zo wasn't scared when I was wrapped
around his left leg like a leech, refusing to budge while he
stumbled around the floor? It could have been worse, too. I could
have tied his shoelaces together while I was down there. That would
have been humiliating on national television, let me tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Humiliation epidemic
</P>
<P>
   The real humiliation is in watching coaches, team owners, league
commissioners, even arbitrators and other impartial bodies, bow
down to the big stars of the day. It's the same with Mike Tyson,
back in the ring after taking two lunatic bites out of a better
man. It's the same with Kevin Greene, the Carolina Panthers' sack
specialist who was sent back into a game after attacking an
assistant coach on the sidelines and suffered a suspension of only
one game.
</P>
<P>
   It's the reason umpires are spat upon. It's why NHL ninnies
trash Olympic dorm rooms and never even have their names
identified.
</P>
<P>
   It's the lesson, in sum, that talent talks and common civility
walks. Sprewell must laugh at the notion that this is anything new.
Before he threatened to kill his coach, then explained it all away
by saying that at no time was Carlesimo's windpipe actually
compressed to the point of asphyxiation, the white towel already
had been waved.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year earlier, Robert Horry threw a towel in the face of
Phoenix coach Danny Ainge after being pulled from a game. A few
days later Horry was traded to a better team, the Lakers, and the
incident actually benefited him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate act of disrespect,'' Riley called Horry's
behavior, but when Sprewell, a three-time NBA All-Star, became
available to the Heat and every other team, the ultimate meat
market was open for business.

CLINTON STRESSES SOCIAL SECURITY, HEALING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Addressing a Congress that includes his impeachment
accusers and judges, President Clinton delivered a State of the
Union address Tuesday &UR;  &LR; night that proposed an ambitious agenda to
save Social Security and bolster education and warned lawmakers
they will be judged by their willingness to ``put aside our
divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no mention of his impeachment trial as he spoke in
the House chamber, where exactly one month ago he became the first
president to be impeached in 131 years. Instead, he offered a
challenging array of ideas and programs for governing in the next
two years, including a bold plan to commit a large share of the
budget surplus to Social Security and invest part of it in private
markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a follow-up to his call last year to ``save Social Security
first,'' Clinton said: ``I reach out my hand to those of you in
both parties in both houses and ask you to join me in saying: We
will save Social Security now.''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his opposition to using part of the surplus for a
tax decrease, which the Republicans urge. ``Again, I say, we should
not spend any of it until after Social Security is truly saved.
First things first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his speech on the day that his lawyers began their
opening arguments to senators in his impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the president was received respectfully. And while
Republican members greeted some of his spending proposals with
scowls or silence, his speech was frequently interrupted by
applause.
</P>
<P>
   With the Congress split along party lines over his impeachment
and the American public determined to have him lead, some House
Republicans who voted to impeach Clinton refused to attend the
speech. Representative Bob Barr of Georgia, one of the GOP's
impeachment managers, skipped the event, saying it was
``inappropriate and awkward'' for Clinton to be speaking to
lawmakers who are both presenting the case against him and sitting
in judgment of him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded by offering what a senior aide, Doug Sosnik,
said was good politics, ``good policies,'' and ideas that some
Clinton's aides said were more suited for a first-year president,
not one struggling to hold on in his seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand before you to report that the state of our union is
strong,'' Clinton said. ``America is working again. The promise of
our future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we
allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we
fare as a nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do
as a nation today.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals likely to have the broadest reach and
perhaps stir the most controversy are Clinton's ideas for fixing
Social Security and improving the quality of public education.
</P>
<P>
   The president proposed transferring 60 percent of the $4
trillion projected budget surpluses over the next 15 years to prop
up Social Security, which is estimated to pay more in benefits than
it collects in payroll taxes by 2032. In addition, he said 11
percent of the surplus, or $500 billion, could go to helping
Americans create Universal Savings Accounts, new 401(k)-type
investments for personal savings and pensions.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security plan, Clinton said, would keep the program
solvent through 2055, though aides say Clinton's goal is to find a
bipartisan consensus for saving Social Security through at least
2075.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of the budget surplus of $650 billion to $700
billion over the next 15 years will be used to ensure financial
solvency for the Medicare Care Trust Fund through 2020, Clinton
said. If no action is take, the health care program is expected to
run out of money in 2008 because of the aging of the baby boom
population.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to spend the rest of the surplus _ about 11
percent _ on military readiness and domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   The president outlined a major initiative aimed at reducing the
threat of the Soviet nuclear arsenal by spending $4.2 billion over
five years to get Russia to dismantle warheads and other weapons,
retrain its military scientists for the civilian workforce, tighten
export controls on nuclear-grade materials, and call its troops
home from other countries. The proposal would increase by almost 70
percent current US expenditures aimed at Russian defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing the domestic danger posed by terrorists with
biological and chemical weapons, the president said he was
proposing more funds for vaccine research in the next federal
budget and announced several initiatives to provide a better early
warning system for the nation, including its computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised a continued reduction of US troops in the
Balkans, despite the leadership role he said the United States must
play in ending the bloody ethnic war in Kosovo. He said his
administration would remain vigilant about containing Iraq, seeking
peace in Northern Ireland, and pressuring Israel and the
Palestinians to carry out their Wye River Plantation commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he would provide more than the White House
had planned, $12 billion from the budget surplus in fiscal year
2000, for military modernization and improving the recruitment,
training, and benefits for the US fighting force.
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, Clinton said despite considerable success
nationally in moving people from welfare to work, he would propose
another $1 billion, in addition to the $1.5 billion Congress
already has provided, to help some 200,000 hard-to-place
individuals find jobs. Clinton also proposed raising the minimum
wage from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour over two years.
</P>
<P>
   The president's other family-friendly plans include adding $600
million in the next budget for after-school and summer school
programs and expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act to require
employers with as few as 25 workers to grant time off for family
activities and emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed figures that show a slowing crime rate and
proposed sustaining the trend through a $1.3 billion, five-year
initiative to help communities hire 30,000 to 50,000 more police.
He proposed several gun-control ideas, including mandating
child-safety locks on handguns, extending the Brady law waiting
period on handgun purchases, and banning for life gun sales to
violent juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   The president recognized as guests in the gallery Evelyn Gibson
and Wei Ling Chestnut, the widows of the Capitol police officers
slain at the Capitol in August. Gibson is the niece of
Representative J. Joseph Moakley of South Boston and her late
husband was a native of Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   On education, Clinton proposed a plan to hold states and school
districts more accountable for the performance of their students as
part of the five-year reauthorization of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   School districts will be required to end social promotions, a
step already taken by Boston and several other urban school
systems. New teachers will be required to pass a test to qualify
for the classroom and steps taken to ensure that teachers are
assigned to teach subjects they know.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants to triple funding for after-school programs
to $600 million, spend over $1 billion to finish hiring 100,000 new
teachers to reduce class sizes in the first grade through the third
grade and make available $22 billion in loans over the next five
years to modernize school buildings, particularly those with many
low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   While the president shied away from proposing that any part of
the budget surplus be used for a broad-based tax cut, as many
Republicans want, he has put forward a host of targeted tax
credits.
</P>
<P>
   They include a $1,000 tax credit to help the disabled needing
long-term care and their relatives who provide it, and an equal
amount to help the disabled Americans go back to work. He also has
proposed the $500 per child tax credit for stay-at-home parents as
part of a larger child-care package.
</P>
<P>
   The president's other family-friendly plans include expanding
the Family and Medical Leave Act to require employers with as few
as 25 workers to grant time off for family activities and
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   He renewed his call for a bill of rights to allow patient in HMO
programs broader medical options. The legislation died narrowly in
the House. He also recyled a proposal to allow Americans as young
as 55 to buy into Medicare, and clear he intend to continue working
to reduce teen smoking, proposing a new 55-cent-a-pack cigarette
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives Jennifer Dunn of Washington state and Steve
Largent of Oklahoma, in the official Republican response following
Clinton's speech, disputed the president's plan for the budget
surplus, proposed a 10 percent, across-the-board tax cut, and said
Americans should be allowed to invest their Social Security in
personal retirement accounts.

 &HT;    An 'unprecedented' view of the Presidency _ or was it?
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's play two!
</P>
<P>
   ``A political double header,'' CNN's Mary Tillotson called a day
that neatly bundled the Senate impeachment trial with President
Clinton's State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reinforces the split personality of this president,'' said
CNN's Frank Sesno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty strange,'' agreed Charles Bierbauer, making CNN's take
on the day unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   But if it was difficult for the Senate to try the president in
the afternoon, then try to listen to him that night, it wasn't any
easier for viewers. NBC's Jonathan Alter suggested people take a
cue from the Clinton playbook: hold two conflicting notions, then
deal with them one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole country is being asked to compartmentalize which
Clinton counts more: the man who helped construct the economy, or
the man accused of obstructing justice,'' said Alter. ``I don't
think there's any kind of precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   But CNN's Jeff Greenfield said that while the day might be
unprecedented, ``unprecedented'' might not be as unprecedented as
it used to be. Last year's address took place as the Lewinsky
scandal broke. The year before, the address played with an inset of
the O.J. Simpson civil trial verdict. Now: impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fourth straight weird State of the Union timing,''
said Greenfield. ``Maybe this is the new paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday began with lawyer Charles Ruff ``teeing up'' (the day's
most overused sports analogy) the White House's case in the Senate.
TV analysts seemed of two minds on Ruff's 21/2 hour opening
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Cokie Roberts: ``People are riveted. The galleries are
full _ actress Whoopi Goldberg is there! It's taken on the air
today we read about in the Andrew Johnson trial.''
</P>
<P>
   PBS's Tom Oliphant: ``We may have a world record for buttering
up a jury. `You da man!' is really what he was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff didn't play to the cameras: he dropped his mike, sipped
water in mid-sentence. Speaking of Linda Tripp taping Lewinsky, he
was ``reminded of Iago and Desdamona's handkerchief.'' He ended
with a voice-choking remembrance of his father fighting in
Normandy, a battle Republicans raised last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``His curtain line was pretty emotional,'' allowed CBS's Dan
Rather. ``It packed a wallop.''
</P>
<P>
   That wallop was followed by another wallop, watched by as many
as 60 million viewers: Clinton's 77-minute appearance in the same
House chamber where he was impeached a month ago. Just him showing
up was a kind of event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing, Pat,'' Bill Press told Pat Buchanan earlier on
CNN's ``Crossfire,'' ``is he'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was more than just there. He looked energized, enthused,
happy _ he looked like the only person in the place unaware of the
mess going on around him. He came out firing: the economy's good,
the environment's good, crime is good. Democrats popped up in their
seats like they were hotwired (``Getting an aerobic exercise,'' Fox
News' Tony Snow put it).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, looked in a pickle: Oklahoma's J.C. Watt
chewed gum; Texan Bill Archer tugged at cufflinks. ``Republicans
were polite but nothing beyond that,'' said CBS's Bob Schieffer.
``If Dick Armey (House Majority Leader from Texas) applauded at all
or ever stood up, I never saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton looked oblivious. A CBS quick-poll showed 82 percent
of Americans liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems there's someone here in town who's the subject of
impeachment,'' joked Fox News's Brit Hume, ``but it couldn't have
been this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment? What impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   Let's play three!

BIBBY EDUCATES TROJANS ON RIVALRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Henry Bibby remembers his first taste of the
USC-UCLA rivalry, when he was an underclassman guard for the Bruins
nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby went with UCLA forwards Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe to
play a pickup game at Pauley Pavilion. They soon noticed another
player on the court, USC guard Mack Calvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe would talk about how they hated
Mack Calvin,'' Bibby recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Then they showed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sidney Wicks choked Mack Calvin,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Bibby realized USC was probably an opponent
he should take a little more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I played at UCLA, I wanted to kill SC. They were
like the enemy,'' said Bibby, who is now USC's coach. ``I knew
nothing about SC. I just knew all my friends hated SC. I don't
think it's to that point now.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst it gets these days is some garden-variety trash
talking. USC forward Jeff Trepagnier remembers being approached by
UCLA guard Baron Davis last summer during some pickup games, and
Davis telling him that he would never lose to USC during his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to be true. I'll make sure of that,''
Trepagnier said. ``I'm looking forward to getting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Trepagnier should have choked Davis instead. The rivalry
could certainly use a boost, at least from the Trojans'
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   USC has lost eight straight games to the Bruins, and hasn't
defeated its crosstown rival since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even close to being the longest winning streak in the
series. UCLA defeated USC 18 straight times from 1971-79. And the
Trojans defeated UCLA 41 consecutive games from 1933-43.
</P>
<P>
   But with today's shortened attention spans, this might feel like
a 10-year drought, especially since most of USC's players can't
even remember the Trojans' last victory over the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, many of USC's players can't even remember last
season's losses to the Bruins. With five new players on the team,
including three from outside California, it's debatable how much
the streak weighs on the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just made aware of it five minutes ago,'' center Brian
Scalabrine said Tuesday. ``I know it's a big thing. (Athletic
director) Mike Garrett wants us to win this game. I just play. It's
not any different than other games. My teammates say it's pretty
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Trepagnier, who grew up in Southern California, isn't
consumed by the eight-game skid against the archrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about the losing streak, but I've heard
about it,'' Trepagnier said. ``It's not any extra pressure because
it's UCLA. It's just another game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only person who truly appreciates the rivalry is
Bibby, who has seen it from both sides. Although he is 0-5 as a
coach against his alma mater, he has come close to major upsets
twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans lost to UCLA 61-59 at the Sports Arena in 1996 when
Charles O'Bannon hit a 12-foot jump shot with 0.4 seconds
remaining. Last year, USC forced the game into overtime before the
Bruins pulled away for an 82-75 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby believes the Bruins' recent success in the series stems
from their confidence, something he hopes the Trojans will have for
tonight's matchup at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're winning, you kind of find a way to win,'' Bibby
said. ``UCLA is winning and never thought they were going to lose
those games. I don't think we're snakebitten.''
</P>
<P>
   So aside from the fact UCLA has confidence and has had
more-talented teams, what can USC do to change its fortunes?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to play basketball and not worry about it being
UCLA,'' Bibby said. ``Make them worry about playing USC. I would
like to win a game once in awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game has more incentive. Hopefully, these guys will know
they have to dig a little deeper. It doesn't help you to have so
many first-year guys. (Freshman forward) Sam Clancy is from Ohio.
He has no idea about the rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby will spend some part of today reminding his players of the
significance of the rivalry, and hoping he can finally turn the
tables on the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make (UCLA) aware of SC,'' Bibby said. ``And show
that we're not the stepping stone. We're not the stepchildren in
town.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, his message is sinking in slowly. But some players
understand. Senior Adam Spanich, who is from Iowa, didn't
completely appreciate the rivalry until playing in his first game
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really understand it, coming from Iowa,'' Spanich
said. ``I liked UCLA. They recruited me. I had a UCLA hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Spanich feels differently today, after playing two games against
the Bruins. He had a chance to win last season's game at the Sports
Arena but missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is the most important of the season, our lives and
all year,'' Spanich said. ``It means a lot to play UCLA. I
definitely want to improve on my performance.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Trojans don't, they will have a nine-game losing streak
heading into next month's rematch at Pauley Pavilion.

 &HT;    Arrest in Piro case could be made by month's end
 &HT;    By Joe Brogan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ A source close to the Janette Piro murder
case said Tuesday an arrest could be made in the Singer Island
woman's death by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Piro, 45, was found strangled Nov. 23 in a freezer at her home.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Christopher Benedetto, 42, has been missing since
Nov. 11 when the couple failed to show for a dinner date with
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have been slowed because they are analyzing
numerous financial documents found in the house and are awaiting
results of tests at Piro's home and on family vehicles and a boat,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   But progress is being made and someone could be charged later
this month or in early February, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Detective Pat Galligan, the lead investigator, said the
department will neither comment on the case nor confirm or deny
what other sources say.
</P>
<P>
   The source confirmed that investigators have questioned a New
Jersey businessman, but that he is not the only suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators began looking at his possible role after
Benedetto's cousin, Titusville, Fla. Detective Arthur Esposito,
told them in November of business dealings the man had with
Benedetto, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, Esposito said he learned Benedetto was upset
about the investment and wanted his money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel he was getting ready to go to the police,'' Esposito
said.
</P>
<P>
   Piro's murder could also have been connected to an investment
gone bad, Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris was a very open person who would not keep anything from
his wife,'' Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   Police found a Toyota pickup truck belonging to Benedetto in the
parking lot of a Palm Beach Shores hotel after his disappearance
but investigators won't comment on any clues it may have revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever killed Piro also took more than $100,000 in jewelry,
including a 4-carat diamond engagement ring and a bracelet with
diamonds totaling 5.3 carats.

 &HT;    CLINTON OFFERS BROAD AGENDA TO COUNTER IMPEACHMENT PUSH
 &HT;    830&AMP;add. With UNION-SCENE and UNION-SOCIAL.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Casting the glaring beam of an audacious agenda
into the ignominious shadow of impeachment, President Clinton
called on a prosperous nation Tuesday to invest $4 trillion over
the next 15 years to shore up Social Security, Medicare and the
national defense.
</P>
<P>
   And throwing the gauntlet of the U.S. Justice Department down
before the giant tobacco industry, Clinton announced a massive
federal lawsuit seeking to recover ''hundreds of billions of
dollars'' from cigarette makers as compensation for decades of
smoking-related health care costs borne by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Congress and the American people in his annual State
of the Union address, Clinton proposed investing up to 15 percent
of Social Security funds in the stock market, a shift that would
harness a portion of the retirement cushion of nearly all American
workers to the potential risks and rewards of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   And, in an initiative aimed at boosting the savings of millions
of lower-income Americans, Clinton unveiled a plan to spend $500
billion over the next decade and a half to create federally
subsidized investment accounts targeting workers without access to
corporate 401(k) savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   The money to fund those schemes and a long menu of others _
addressing issues ranging from education and crime to health care
and the environment _ would come, Clinton said, from budget
surpluses expected to top $4 trillion over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals drew immediate fire from Republicans who control
the House and the Senate. They contended that much of that surplus
should be returned to workers and corporations. Responding to
Clinton's speech on behalf of his fellow Republicans, Rep. Steve
Largent of Oklahoma vowed to fight ''Washington's wasteful
spending'' and called for a 10 percent across-the-board income tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the House chamber where he was impeached on charges
of perjury and obstruction of justice just one month ago, Clinton
ignored the sex-and-deception scandal that has dragged his
administration through a year-long crisis and made him only the
second president in history to face the Senate's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Clinton _ speaking to his House accusers, the senators
now weighing his fitness to serve and a country bitterly divided
over his conduct _ summoned the nation to embrace the unprecedented
possibilities stretched out before it, saying the moment has come
for a richly blessed generation to step up to meet the challenges
of its age.
</P>
<P>
   ''The promise of our future is limitless,'' Clinton said. ''With
our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our confidence
rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic
responsibility to the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal to his Republican tormentors, Clinton asked ''that
we put aside our divisions'' in favor of ''a new hour of healing
and hopefulness.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing a less compromising side, though, Clinton fired off a
stark reminder that it is he, not his political opponents, who has
presided over six years of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Six years ago, I came to office in a time of doubt for
America, with our economy troubled, our deficit high, our people
divided,'' Clinton asserted. ''Some even wondered whether our best
days were behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans from the House and Senate sat stone-faced through
much of Clinton's address, dismissing dozens of his carefully
crafted applause lines and pressing themselves deeply into their
seats as their Democratic colleagues rose to greet his remarks with
at least 95 ovations.
</P>
<P>
   At times it was almost as though Clinton were speaking to two
separate rooms: an enthusiastic crowd of Democratic supporters to
his right, and a stubbornly sober block of Republicans to his left,
adamantly refusing to acknowledge all but the most uncontroversial
of Clinton's ideas and the nation's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 77-minute speech, the partisan-spotted reception
appeared to have an impact on Clinton, who seemed distracted at
times, and was clearly hurrying his delivery at others,
particularly as he hashed through well-worn economic, social and
educational themes he has visited repeatedly during last year's
campaign season and in the months since.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rose to an energetic peak, however, when he announced
that he had instructed Attorney General Janet Reno to initiate a
federal lawsuit against the nation's tobacco companies. He said he
would use money collected through the suits to strengthen Medicare,
the federal health care insurance program for retired workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars,
under Medicare and other programs,'' Clinton said. ''Taxpayers
shouldn't pay for the cost of lung cancer, emphysema and other
smoking-related illnesses _ the tobacco companies should.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The largest single initiative Clinton proposed, however, was a
plan to set aside 60 percent of the projected budget surplus out
through the next 15 years to help put the Social Security program
on sound financial footing through the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which sends monthly retirement checks to one in
every six Americans, is on track to begin paying out more than it
takes in by the year 2013, as baby boomers begin to retire, and to
run completely out of money by 2032.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan, some $2.7 trillion would be transferred to
the Social Security trust fund over the next 15 years, a measure
Clinton said make the program whole through 2055.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan dodged the tough political tradeoffs between
reduced benefits and increases in the premiums workers pay into
their Social Security accounts out of every paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues, Clinton said, should be the subject of bipartisan
discussions in the months ahead, in effect suggesting the
Republicans take up the politically painful tasks of suggesting
cuts in benefits or hikes in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans made clear that Clinton faces uphill sledding on
Capitol Hill over much of his agenda, particularly his plans for
spending the projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans stand for limited government,'' said Largent in a
prepared public response to Clinton's address. ''The federal
government is still too big and taking more than it should. We will
continue our efforts to control Washington's wasteful spending and
its insatiable appetite for your money.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House countered, however, that the surprisingly strong
Democratic showing in last year's midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that the new Congress learned something in November,
which is the American people want results,'' said White House
domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reached beyond U.S. borders in his speech, assailing the
recent killing of civilians in the province of Kosovo by Serb
police and calling on Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic to stop the
''brutal repression'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has threatened Milosevic with U.S.-led NATO
attacks, he did not reiterate those threats on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harkening to an economic hallmark of the early years of his
administration, Clinton asked Congress, yet again, to grant him
so-called ''fast track'' authority to negotiate free-trade
agreements. He specifically cited his quest for a free-trade zone
spanning the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   He cast his efforts to win trade agreements around the world as
part of a historic mission to, in effect, make the world safe for
global trade, and vowed to seek this year an international ban on
the scourge of child labor.
</P>
<P>
   'When you come right down to it, now that the world economy is
becoming more and more integrated, we have to do in the world what
we spent the better part of this century doing here at home,''
Clinton said. ''We have got to put a human face on the global
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining what has been his strongest parry to the impeachment
efforts, Clinton trumpeted the products of an administration that
has presided over six years of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tonight I stand before you to report that America has created
the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history,'' Clinton
said, ''with nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than
twice the rate of inflation, the highest home ownership in history,
the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years, and the lowest peacetime
unemployment since 1957.''
</P>
<P>
   He added props, heroic figures such as Suzann(cq) Wilson, who
has turned the loss of her daughter to a youthful gunman in
Jonesboro, Ark., last year into a crusade for gun-control
legislation, and Air Force Capt.. Jeff Taliaferro, a pilot who
participated in last month's Desert Fox attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Both were seated near first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, as was
civil rights heroine Rosa Parks, whose introduction drew one of the
longest extended ovations of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Forty three years ago, Parks ''sat down on a bus in Alabama and
wouldn't get up,'' Clinton said, describing her act of civil
disobedience that helped ignite a national movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's sitting down with the first lady tonight, and she may
get up or not as she chooses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional highlight of the evening, though, came a few
minutes later, when Clinton paused to pay tribute to his wife, who,
publicly at least, has stood by his side as a pillar of strength
and dignity under fire through a year that has brought
unquantifiable pain to her family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to take just a minute to honor her for leading our
Millennium Project, for all she's done for our children, for all
she has done in her historic role to serve our nation and our best
ideals at home and abroad,'' Clinton said, his eyes bearing down on
the seat she occupied. ''I honor her.''

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First, his lawyers argued that the president, an
invisible presence in the well of the Senate courtroom, should not
be removed from office for anything he has done.
</P>
<P>
   Then the president himself, towering above the assembled three
branches of government in the House chamber, presented the case for
his continuance in office based on what he has yet to do.
</P>
<P>
   In a looking-glass day in which the president's regretted past
and his hoped-for future were juxtaposed with stunning clarity, the
nation watched and listened on Tuesday night as the president's
glaring personal weaknesses and manifest political strengths were
on near-simultaneous display.
</P>
<P>
   Without once uttering the word ``impeachment'' or making any
obvious reference to the deeds that had put him on trial, Clinton
delivered a virtuoso performance in a 77-minute State of the Union
address Tuesday night that detailed an ambitious agenda for what he
prays will be 730 remaining days in office. Thirty-nine times he
exhorted his Congressional audience that it ``must'' or ``should''
tackle some urgent problem, and every time he did, the implication
was obvious: the lawmakers had more important business than
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser politician or a more timid soul than Bill Clinton might
have balked at facing his accusers from the House and his jurors
from the Senate at a moment of political peril greater than that
faced by any president for many years. But Clinton seems to thrive
on such adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night he showed not only that he could take everything
Congress had thrown at him for a year but that he could dish it out
as well, baiting the sullen Republicans in the House chamber with
jabs on issues they abhor, from the minimum wage to campaign
finance reform. Yet in the next breath he extended the hand of
bipartisanship, as when he paid tribute to the new House Speaker,
Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., or called on both parties to join him
in one or another worthy cause like fighting drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It was all a vintage display of Clinton's oratorical and
political gifts, a masterly show that managed to make the lawmakers
look somehow small by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   He reveled at his moment alone on the stage, saluting the first
lady and baseball hero Sammy Sosa, and laughing when reluctant
Republicans rose to applaud his call for equal pay for men and
women.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, White House counsel Charles Ruff told the
Senate that Clinton stood accused of a ``witches' brew'' of charges
that, even if true, do not warrant his removal from office. He
entered a plea of not guilty on behalf of the president and called
on the Senate to acquit him and return to the nation's business.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was careful to make no mention of his impeachment
trial, Ruff did not shy from using the State of the Union address
to buttress his argument for retaining Clinton in office.
</P>
<P>
   He said that however distasteful senators might find Clinton's
personal behavior, it did not pose such a threat to the union that
the only remedy was his removal.
</P>
<P>
   And in his peroration, Ruff said: ``When the American people
hear the president talk to Congress tonight, they will know the
answer to the question `Neighbor, how stands the Union?' It stands
strong, vibrant, free.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff's message presaged that of Clinton: the president has his
priorities straight, so should you.
</P>
<P>
   On the grand stage of the House chamber, Clinton left
impeachment to his lawyers and his jury. He argued for political
redemption through motion _ on Social Security, on health care, on
education, on military preparedness. He warned against complacency
and tried to summon the Congress and the nation to act at a time of
unparalleled peace and plenty.
</P>
<P>
   This was no ordinary speech, and the Senate is no ordinary jury.
An impeachment trial is by nature political, and Clinton's
strongest card through a year of investigation and revelation has
been his continued popularity with the public. Opinion polls taken
before the speech show that 70 percent of the public approves of
the job Clinton is doing and a large majority of the electorate
believes the nation is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the State of the Union fell at another time of trauma
for the president, coming less than a week after his relationship
with Monica S. Lewinsky was first disclosed. That speech, built
around a promise to ``save Social Security first'' before spending
the federal budget surplus, was a hit with the public and helped to
salvage a foundering presidency.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Clinton again used a vow on Social Security as the
centerpiece of his address, using an issue that has proven a winner
for him to make the case that Republicans have abdicated their
governing responsibilities in their zeal to get him.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than most State of the Union addresses, he was talking
directly to what has been the primary source of strength for him
throughout this process, and that is the American majority,'' said
Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan. ``And I think
they'll feel indeed he's right _ there's other, important work to
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Brinkley, a presidential scholar at the University of
New Orleans, said State of the Union addresses had been Clinton's
most effective soapbox, a means he had mastered of reaching
millions of Americans without the filter of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a stage performance of Clinton at his best,'' Brinkley
said. ``We watch in wonderment this flawed, failed president who
has so much talent, so much intelligence, but whose Achilles' heel
has been so destructive for him.''
</P>
<P>
   While the public was Clinton's chief target Tuesday night,
though, his immediate audience included a House that voted by
narrow majorities to impeach him on counts of perjury and
obstruction of justice. It is also possible that a majority of
senators will vote to remove him from office. But the two-thirds
majority required by the Constitution seems most unlikely, and that
arithmetic comforts Clinton and provided the foundation for his
ambitious catalogue of policy prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the president's subtext was something much deeper than
a policy agenda for the last two years he expects to serve. He was
beginning to build a case for his historical rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The speech offered the customary recitation of the
administration's past progress and its promises for the future. But
in some respects, Brinkley argued, the speech was much broader and
was aimed at those who will judge the Clinton presidency in decades
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that Bill Clinton, starting with the State of the
Union, will be spending the rest of his life seeking political
vindication and this was the opening salvo,'' Brinkley said.
``Whatever happens in the Senate trial, Clinton will spend his
whole life figuratively trying to scrub that scarlet `I' off his
chest and rewriting the first chapter of his political biography.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and members of Congress gamely
played their assigned parts in Tuesday's State of the Union
pageantry.
</P>
<P>
   By acting much as they had at previous State of the Union
addresses, he and they hoped to dispel the widespread suspicion
that attempts by Clinton and Congress to reach compromises on
substantive legislation are hobbled by the fact that the House
impeached Clinton last month and the Senate may convict him within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Give them this: They tried, they really tried.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton nodded, clutched and hand-grabbed his way down the
center aisle and up to the podium in front of the presiding
officers of the Senate and the House, Vice President Al Gore and
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. Gore is a Democratic ally who
would replace Clinton if the president is convicted, and Hastert is
the third House speaker in six years to be nationally televised
trying to look alert for more than an hour while staring down at
Clinton's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton delivered a classic, applause-drawing oration that
lasted almost an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   His top priorities: ``Saving Social Security, strengthening
Medicare, establishing USA (savings) accounts, and supporting
long-term care.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever applause flagged, he would point to a hero or a victim
in the balconies that surround the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Singling out Hastert's wife Jean, he noted that her companions
were Lyn Gibson and Wei Ling Chestnut, widows of two police
officers who were slain while guarding the Capitol last year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides introducing his wife Hillary and Gore's wife Tipper,
Clinton praised and pointed out Air Force Capt. Jeff Taliaferro,
who flew a B-1B bomber over Iraq; baseball hero and philanthropist
Sammy Sosa; anti-gun activist Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Ark., and
Rosa Parks, who triggered the anti-racism Montgomery bus boycott by
refusing to give up her seat 43 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the Supreme Court's nine justices came, and even they _
trying to decide when applause or standing would be inappropriate _
stood up for Mrs. Parks, though not for Mrs. Clinton or Mrs. Gore.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who is presiding over the Senate
trial of Clinton, and two other justices stayed at home.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans managed to contain their enthusiasm when the
Democratic president ran through a long list of new federal
requirements for schools to follow if they want to keep getting
federal funds, which supply only eight percent of their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of his litany, even Sen. Phil Gram, R-Texas, and
other conservatives gave in and applauded his call for states and
school districts to ``adopt and implement discipline policies. In
fact, two Texas Republicans, House Majority Leader Dick Armey and
House Whip Tom DeLay, appeared to be the only spectators to get
through the entire speech without standing up or clapping at any
line.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 tickets were issued to legislators, Cabinet
members, diplomats, dignitaries , guests, attendants, guards and
journalists jammed elbow-to-elbow in a chamber that normally holds
fewer than 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the absence of House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde of Illinois and a handful of less prominent Senate and
House Republicans wasn't obvious. After all, it's not unusual for
10 percent of the members to miss a State of the Union speech.
</P>
<P>
   But by ostentatiously skipping the event, the absentees were
able to convince the news media to relay their points. Rep. Tom
Tancredo, R-Colo., exclaimed, ``Didn't we just impeach him?'' the
press secretary to Sen. Bob Smith said the New Hampshire Republican
stayed away because he thought it would be ``inappropriate and
awkward'' for Clinton to present his policy agenda while on trial
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not comfortable,'' admitted Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, one of those who did attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the president would be better off delaying the State
of the Union, but he chose not to do that,'' she said with a
nervous laugh. ``We didn't withdraw the invitation because we
didn't want it to look like we were not going to carry on
business.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The televised portion of the day's pageantry began shortly after
9 p.m. Eastern Time, the earliest point at which Clinton could hope
for a substantial home audience on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But the partisan jockeying for the public's attention and
approval began a full 12 hours before Clinton entered that hall.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 a.m., Senate Republican leaders announced that at 10:15
a.m. they would unveil their own top five legislative priorities.
They stressed two of them _ cutting income tax rates by 10 percent
and pledging that the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means
committees would offer ``serious consideration'' at a joint hearing
to any Social Security bill introduced by Clinton before March 1.
</P>
<P>
   But coverage was sparse, because within a half hour the White
House trumped them by revealing that Clinton's Social Security plan
would include government investments in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans saw that Clinton's Social Security plan was
getting more coverage than their tax cuts, they quickly issued two
``pre-responses'' to Clinton's upcoming address.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:05 p.m., GOP messengers arrived in the House press gallery
with a release in which House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer
said, ``No, No, A thousand times no. If you thought a government
takeover of health care was bad, just wait until the government
becomes an owner of America's private sector companies.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m., the messengers brought a milder response from
Majority Leader Armey. While saying he was ``concerned'' about
having a government board investing tax money in the stock market,
Armey praised Clinton for the fact that his speech would use only
some of the surplus to save Social Security and for endorsing the
concept of private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two out of three isn't a bad start,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   An even milder response came from Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott after the Senate adjourned its impeachment trial at 3:34 p.m.
Reporters were told that the Mississippi Republican would conduct a
``pre-rebuttal to the State of the Union Address'' at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Mississippi Republican one more chance to describe
the GOP tax-cut bill on television news shows. Asked what he
thought of the Social Security plan Clinton would be unveiling
about five hours later, Lott said, ``It looks to me like it does
not provide the long-term solution that we're really looking for,
(but) I think it's premature to comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, two young, telegenic Republicans _ Reps. Steve Largent
of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of Washington _ spent hours on a
windy balcony of the Cannon House Office Building, with the Capitol
behind their backs, rehearsing the the nationally televised
post-speech GOP response. They stressed the GOP tax-cut plan.

</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: SUBS 5th graf, last sentence, `Clinton has at least ..., ' to
recast debate with GOP over Social Security.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan. 20:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton opened what was effectively the second front
in the war over his presidency on Tuesday night. Shortly after his
lawyers argued the fine legal points on impeachment in the Senate,
Clinton outlined his most ambitious domestic agenda since 1993. Its
centerpiece, a vast scheme to set aside $2.7 trillion over the next
15 years to strengthen Social Security, and $650 billion more for
Medicare, served notice that the president's battle to stay in
office would include efforts to revitalize the big safety-net
programs that are extremely popular among the swing voters whose
support he needs in the impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political troubles could be seen immediately in the
awkward applause of many Republicans, which he tried to counter
with an opening call for a new ``spirit of civility and
bipartisanship,'' and a handshake with the new House speaker,
Dennis Hastert. But his speech was designed to be bold and to try,
even in depressing circumstances, to show his political resilience.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks the White House has dribbled out
bite-sized initiatives in education, the environment, crime and
military preparedness, leaving the impression that his State of the
Union speech would be another laundry list, commendable in many
respects but not very inspiring. Instead he recommended that more
than $4 trillion in surpluses projected over the next 15 years,
most of it from the Social Security system itself, be mobilized for
retirement and health programs, individual savings accounts and
some spending initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The president was playing his best political cards at a time
when the country can afford to act and address these long-term
problems. In 15 years, when baby boomers start to retire, Social
Security will drain money rather than generate it. Clinton has
wisely rejected a Republican proposal, endorsed by some Democrats,
to strip away a portion of the Social Security safety net and
replace it with a system of individual investment accounts,
jeopardizing the retirement of those unlucky or unsophisticated in
the ways of the market. Instead he proposes to have 15 percent of
the Social Security trust fund eventually invested in the stock
market. This is a promising but largely untested new idea with
assumptions about the market and other factors that will need to be
studied closely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's other innovative proposal would channel $500 billion
over 15 years in matching funds for new voluntary retirement
accounts outside the Social Security system. It has some attractive
features, including a progressive approach of weighting the
benefits for those with lower incomes. But since the Republicans
control Congress and the impeachment battle will probably leave a
bitter aftertaste, the president's plans are certain to be more of
a conversation opener than a blueprint for the future. Trent Lott
and other Republican leaders signaled on Tuesday that they would
seek to use a major portion of the budget surplus for
across-the-board tax cuts. Clinton has at least defined the outline
of negotiations with congressional Republicans over how to balance
the popular but expensive goals of protecting the elderly and
granting tax relief for those still in the work force.
</P>
<P>
   The president deferred for a later day the debate about
adjustments, and perhaps new limits, on both Social Security and
Medicare. He called on the Congress to work in a bipartisan way to
enact such changes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Clinton's smaller proposals for education, the
environment, crime, military readiness and research will probably
find broad support in Congress. We hope he also fulfills his pledge
to make a strong push for campaign finance reform. If he can emerge
from the corrosive debate over impeachment and lead a cooperative
effort that borrows some ideas from the opposition, he could put a
productive stamp on his final two years in office.

COMMENTARY: SEX AND BALANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 13th graf, In his speech ..., to ADD color from
speech. ) 
(JT) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Our newspaper banned the phrase ``split screen'' in
stories about the surreal day with the president's impeachment
defense bumping up against his State of the Union speech.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, I forgot, the editors also banned ``surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   These words have been used so often with this president that
they have lost all meaning.
</P>
<P>
   But the editors didn't ban the phrase ``split personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since Joanne Woodward vamped it up as Eve and Sally Field
atomized as Sybil has America been treated to such an entertaining
display of schiziness.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about the president's dual _ and dueling _
personalities. The good Bill who promotes solid American values
like V-chips and targeting deadbeat dads, and the bad Bill who
cavorts with interns and lies about it. Saturday Night Bill and
Sunday Morning Clinton, as Saturday Night Dick Morris puts it.
</P>
<P>
   But now the dichotomy has reached an absurd level with
Impeachment Bill and State of the Union Clinton. The president and
his doppelgaenger were side by side in Congress Tuesday, but did
not acknowledge each other's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has detached himself from the mess he caused, without
even a trace of irony. President Out-of-Control has suddenly turned
into President In-Control.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day the House managers unveiled their case of high
crimes against Impeachment Bill, State of the Union Clinton
unveiled a new crime-fighting program surrounded by police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House euphemistically dubs it ``compartmentalizing,''
and The New York Observer wrote about compartmentalization chic
among boomers juggling busy schedules.
</P>
<P>
   All this prattling about compartmentalization has got to stop.
This therapeutic alibi is a little too convenient. We are all
complicated people whose brains are divided and dispersed. Isn't
there something a little creepy about the way the president has
turned denial into a psychological ideal? He has achieved the
ultimate triangulation, separating himself from himself, and
defining himself against the image of himself painted by the House
managers who would oust him. The man is his own hypotenuse.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Impeachment Bill last week, State of the Union
Clinton treated his trial as an out-of-body experience: ``The
important thing for me is to spend as little time thinking about
that as possible and as much time working on the issues we're here
to discuss as possible. They have their job to do in the Senate and
I have mine and I intend to do it.'' (Sex and balances, you might
say.)
</P>
<P>
   In his speech last night, State of the Union Clinton, welcomed
by wild Democratic applause, once again gave the people what they
wanted. He seized the initiative on key policies by offering a
proposal on Social Security, a plan to improve the nation's schools
and a program to move more people off welfare to work. He reminded
Americans why they want him on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his usual cliffhanger: Would he hold himself
together? Would he bring it off? Would the stock market plummet?
Would Hillary move to New York? Is it just me, or is this plot line
getting stale?
</P>
<P>
   The president's ability to wall himself off from himself and
give masterful performances under incredible pressure gains him
admiration even from his foes, but finally his tour de force is a
tour de farce.
</P>
<P>
   There is something deeply troubling about the president's
inability to be one thing or to view himself whole. He refuses to
be seen except in pieces, giving unprecedented political and
spiritual meaning to the term ``separation of powers.''
</P>
<P>
   He has raised his personality disorder to a management style.
His aides and lawyers, who were in a state of denial for seven
months about Monica Lewinsky caused by the president's callous
denial, routinely talk about his presidency in Sybilesque terms.
</P>
<P>
   So we appear to be a nation of enablers, encouraging the
president to persist in his duality. When we look at him, we like
seeing double. A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll taken on the eve of the
speech showed Clinton with an impressive 69 percent job approval
rating, but a record low 24 percent view him as honest and
trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has delivered on the promise of his 1992 campaign.
We got two for the price of one.

 &HT;    A day like Tuesday not likely to be repeated soonBy Rebecca Carr
and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _The morning began with a flurry of bills addressing
the likes of school construction and telephone fraud. It peaked at
the lunch hour with party huddles over impeachment. Then came the
White House defense. Finally, the president topped off the day with
a trip to Capitol Hill to unveil his agenda for the year as if
nothing else was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was a day like no other in Washington. A relentless and
dizzying array of events made senators scratch their heads in
wonder: What next?
</P>
<P>
   It started at 9:30 a.m. with members of both parties introducing
a flurry of bills. Two hours later, senators dined over
impeachment, plotting strategy behind closed doors in their
respective party's dining room.
</P>
<P>
   When they emerged, they were barraged with questions from
reporters. Should Monica Lewinsky come to the witness stand? Would
Republicans come to hear the president's State of the Union speech?
</P>
<P>
   Then came the White House's day ``in court.'' White House
counsel Charles Ruff began the defense of the president against
charges that he lied under oath and obstructed justice in an
attempt to conceal his affair with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as trial ended for the day, the Senate turned its
attention to the State of the Union address. There was Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) holding forth, calling on
Clinton to unveil a plan to insure the solvency of the Social
Security system and to push for an across the board income tax cut,
perhaps as much as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first and last time this will likely ever happen,''
said Sen. John Breaux (D-La.) commenting on the odd collision of
impeachment with the State of the Union speech, as he stepped into
a subway car that carts senators from one end of the Capitol
grounds to another. ``It is truly extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), said it felt almost uncanny, even
surreal, to think that the president was beginning the defense of
his political career on the very day that he would address the
nation with his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined we would be in this place,'' Snowe said,
shaking her head. ``A year ago, I never thought it would come to
this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it mildly, it's awkward in an unprecedented way,'' said
Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very awkward,'' agreed Senator Susan Collins, a
Republican from Maine. ``But all of us have learned from the
president how to compartmentalize.''
</P>
<P>
   At precisely 1:03 p.m., the Senate reconvened. Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) rose to remind the senators to stand behind
their desks when Chief Justice William Rehnquist entered the
chamber. They did and week two of the Senate impeachment trial
began.
</P>
<P>
   As Rehnquist took his place overlooking the Senate chamber's 100
mahogany desks, the White House ``scandal team'' watched from the
vice president's ceremonial chamber just off the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff wheeled to the well of the Senate from the defense table to
the right of the podium. The lectern used by the prosecutors last
week had been removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are free to criticize him, to find his personal conduct
distasteful,'' said Ruff. ``But ask whether this is the moment
when, for the first time in our history, the actions of a president
have so put at risk the government the framers created that there
is only one solution.''
</P>
<P>
   As they listened to Ruff, White House aides and lawyers from the
blue chip Washington law firm Williams &AMP; Connolly munched on
chocolate chip and cinnamon cookies (provided for by the Senate)
and watched Ruff lay out the president's defense on a television
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Whoopi Goldberg and actor Frank Langella looked on from
one of the upper galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Ruff had trouble with his microphone, which fell twice
from his lapel where it had been clipped.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) worried that the wheel chair
was hurting Ruff's presentation, causing the senators to be
distracted. But that soon changed.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, Cleland thought that Ruff had carved out a ``new
place for himself in judicial history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought the wheel chair might defeat him,'' said
Cleland, who is in a wheelchair himself. ``But as he went on and
made his point, he was very powerful. Unlike many presenters, where
the longer they go, the weaker they get, the longer he went on, the
stronger he got.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, that is not how the House Republicans saw Ruff's
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), who pushed for the president's ouster
long before the nation ever heard Lewinsky's name, said he thought
that Ruff had strengthened the Republican case for witnesses by
showing the disparities in the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, one of the 13 House prosecutors putting on the case, said
he was hopeful that witnesses would be called to support the
articles of impeachment. ``Professor Ruff may have helped our
case,'' said Barr, who had Ruff as a professor when he was a
student at Georgetown Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Diane DeGette (D-Col.) and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee
(D-Texas) were the only two House Democrats who watched the
proceedings from the chamber. Lee, a member of the House committee
that brought the charges against the president, has been present
every day, feverishly taking notes. Rep. David Dreier (R-Calif.)
and Rep. Ed Whitfield (R-Ky,) also sat in for a time.
</P>
<P>
   His old colleagues warmly greeted former Sen. Dale Bumpers, the
Arkansas Democrat, who joined Clinton's defense team. Bumpers will
deliver the closing argument on Thursday. Most senators,
Republicans and Democrats, said they were glad to see Bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   The day had many senators shaking their head at the irony.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) said, ``It's very unusual. I don't
know what to make of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of witnesses, how many to call and which ones to
call, remained the question of the day, as Senate aides dissected
the president's State of the Union address in search of programs
they would either praise or shoot down.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the State of the Union speech, reporters flooded
Statutory Hall waiting for response. Barr, who boycotted the speech
was present to deliver his sound bite for the evening, telling
reporters that the speech raised more questions then it answered.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less eager to be there. ``Get me out of here in 10
minutes and I'll give you a raise,'' said Rep. Dave Weldon (R-Fla.)
to his aide in the media-soaked hallway.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a day of days when Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) walked
back to his office on the second floor of the Capitol Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing is very awkward, very unfortunate,''
Nickles said. ``His speech sounded like he was trying to make it to
the Democratic National Committee. It was unbelievable, big
government. A state of nothing.''

A DAY TO COMPARTMENTALIZE, NOT A DAY TO BE COMFORTABLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Resent to include updated material) &HT;     
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Tuesday was a schizophrenic day in the nation's
Capitol, a day split between trying a president for high crimes and
misdemeanors and welcoming the same man to outline his agenda for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day divided between sex and Social Security, perjury
and public policy, Monica Lewinsky and baseball star Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress, particularly Republican senators, were
clearly uncomfortable with the dueling duties of holding Clinton's
impeachment trial in the afternoon and listening to his State of
the Union address that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lawmakers filled the House chamber to hear the
president, acting at times as if the scandal that has obsessed the
political elite and driven a wedge between the parties had never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally the partisan divide became evident. When the
president proclaimed that ``the state of our union is strong,'' the
Democrats rose to their feet and cheered while Republicans remained
glumly in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras zoomed in on GOP House Judiciary Committee
members who spent last week trying to persuade the Senate to kick
Clinton out of office. Several of them sat without emotion as
Clinton reeled off his plans for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Before the speech, the buzzword in the halls of the Capitol was
compartmentalization _ a term Clinton's advisers have used to
describe his ability to deal with the scandal and the nation's
problems without one muddying the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have learned from the president to
compartmentalize,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   While most lawmakers attended Clinton's address, a number of
Republicans suggested they were not going gladly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, complained that listening to the
speech was worse than a trip to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' junior GOP senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison said ``no one
could think that it's comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   On the House side, a handful of Republicans had organized a
boycott of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., complained it was ``incredibly
inappropriate to invite the president into the House chamber when
the House has just impeached him.''
</P>
<P>
   But newly elected House Speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
sent a letter to his colleagues urging them to attend and be
courteous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will listen to the president's remarks soberly and with the
dignity that befits the U.S. Congress,'' the letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans declined to attend but stressed that their
absences had nothing to do with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has led the House investigation of
the president, stayed home to watch the address. Hyde spokesman Sam
Stratman said that Hyde had skipped numerous State of the Union
addresses and was not singling out this one.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, also watched the president's speech on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Paul spokesman Michael Sullivan said the Texas congressman was
not making a statement about impeachment, but just disliked the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a wild madhouse. It's not something he is interested
in doing, all the pomp and circumstance,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those happy to be invited was National League MVP Sosa,
who had a prime perch between first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Tipper Gore. The Chicago Cub star was singled out by the president
for his contribution to relief efforts in the Dominican Republic
after Hurricane Mitch battered the island.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans mentioned frequently how awkward the moment
was for the president, it was often the GOP members who appeared
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, sat in their seats, refusing to join even as some
of their colleagues rose to applaud various initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats enthusiastically cheered Clinton, who was bolstered by
new public opinion polls this week showing his approval ratings
among the highest of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, said Clinton deserved a good
reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's not to cheer? The economy is in good shape. We're the
strongest country in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And some Republicans said they had no problems attending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grown-ups here,'' said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas.
``Frankly it won't be the first time in my life I have respected an
office perhaps more than the person who holds it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were also intent during the day on demonstrating
that they could focus on more than the president's trial.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after the Senate trial adjourned for the day, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., held what was billed as a
``pre-buttal'' where he urged the president to embrace
across-the-board tax cuts and a comprehensive solution to Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Clinton walked into the House chamber to outline
his program, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, issued a release commenting on wire reports that
the president would propose that the government invest a portion of
Social Security funds in private markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. A thousand times no,'' the Archer release screamed.
</P>
<P>
   While some members of Congress complained about the awkwardness
of having the trial and president's address on the same day, two
Capitol tourists didn't seem fazed by the sequence of events.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Tammy Foulcher of Texas took in the Senate trial in
the early afternoon and were rushing to catch a plane to return to
their suburban Dallas home in time to watch the president address
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both agreed that Clinton was right to give the address despite
the complaints of some members of Congress. ``They have to separate
the trial from the business of the nation,'' said Robert Foulcher.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
There was talk about Scottie Pippen bringing a fast break back to
the Rockets. Players considered his defense, his play-making skill,
his shooting touch, and plugged the unusual collection of varied
talents into the Rockets' mix.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Players spoke of Pippen's ability to set up Rockets guards Matt
Maloney, Brent Price, Michael Dickerson and Bryce Drew for their
outside shots. They considered how rookies Dickerson and Cuttino
Mobley would look on the wings of a break, how the combination of
three of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players would not end with the
retirement of Clyde Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, players awaiting the end of the NBA moratorium on
completing deals and the deliverance of Pippen to the Rockets'
roster spoke of championships. And they were not speaking only of
the Bulls' collection of six titles. The morning after Pippen
became destined to play in Houston, Rockets players considered the
championship he might bring to town with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a good chance to go all the way,'' forward Matt
Bullard said. ``In a shortened deal like this, with a short time to
put the team together, a short training camp and a short season,
it's going to be hard to predict. But a team like the Rockets, with
experienced championship players, that's got to put the Rockets in
as favorites for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous. Adding Pippen with Hakeem (Olajuwon) healthy
and getting Charles (Barkley) back, the Rockets may have another
fantastically talented team. We can get some things done this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Western Conference crowded with contenders, the Rockets
said the addition of Pippen would make them not necessarily the
favorites, but unquestionably one of the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' Olajuwon said. ``I think he's a complete player
offensively and defensively. He knows how to win. He's been there
many times. The most important thing is to make (the new
combination of players) work. We must be competitive and at the
same time make it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Rockets players said being competitive and enjoying
it are certain. But they also said even with the addition of one of
the league's most coveted free agents and most celebrated players,
there would be a rushed period of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA on Tuesday pushed back the planned start of training
camp until Thursday at the earliest. Although the schedule is not
complete, the season is expected to begin as little as two weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great addition,'' Othella Harrington said of Pippen.
``He brings a lot to any team. It's a step in the right direction
to winning another championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of new guys. We need time to jell, to feel each
other out, to put in the system, so everybody understands it. Once
everybody gets in sync together and the chemistry starts coming
through, it's going to be a heck of a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rockets began the week with just three healthy
players under contract and will add three rookies, they will likely
end the week with eight of last season's players back. And with
Pippen such a versatile and veteran player, it would seem simple to
put in the system.
</P>
<P>
   But with Pippen and the rookies, the Rockets almost surely will
try to make changes that the entire roster will have to make work.
Much of the offense is likely to remain the same as long as
Olajuwon is in the middle, but the Rockets will want to take
advantage of Pippen's ability to lead a break and the young
players' ability to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know with a lot of players back, the nucleus knows the
offense, the coaches and the teammates,'' Maloney said. ``I would
assume we're going to run a lot more, which is something the
coaches have talked about the last year. I would definitely look
forward to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic. It makes us that much better as a team with a
good chance to win it. It's a short season, but it's a season.
We've got to attack it as one. It's a great land to get a great
player like that and to be that clairvoyant to leave enough room to
get a player like that. Even though it's a shortened season,
they've done their part to put a great team on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was not clairvoyance as much as planning that had
the Rockets beginning a transformation to a more up-tempo, younger
team. Although the Rockets will continue to rely upon Olajuwon and
Barkley in the half-court offense, Pippen will help with the pace
of play, and the rookies _ and Rodrick Rhodes when he returns from
a chest injury _ will help with the tempo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they said when they drafted me,'' said Michael
Dickerson, the Rockets' first draft pick. ``They wanted a team that
could run in transition. That's one of the reasons they drafted me,
because of my style of play. Everything they said, they followed
through on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets will have to count on the rookies, which will
require they not spend much time in the abbreviated training camp
star-struck with their new teammates. Drew said he grew up watching
Pippen and the Bulls' championship celebrations. Dickerson said he
modeled himself after his new teammate-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envisioned myself being Pippen, being him and doing what he
was doing,'' Dickerson said. ``He always has been one of my
favorite players in the NBA. Before I would have (been in awe), but
I played with Hakeem out here. I'm used to being with guys that are
great players. You have to let that go and go out to play to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's move, the chances of achieving that improved,
Pippen's future teammates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got drafted to Houston, there was Charles and Hakeem
here,'' Mobley said. ``Now we have Scottie, one of the best
all-around players. I don't know, but when he comes, I guess I'll
be smiling every day.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans sought Tuesday to dispel the image of a
Congress consumed by impeachment and put forward an agenda that
calls for a 10 percent across-the-board cut in income-tax rates and
pledges to engage President Clinton on assuring the long-term
solvency of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal for a sweeping income tax reduction was
made by Senate Republicans in a morning news conference and
amplified by Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., in the televised
Republican response to the State of the Union.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate coordination on tax cuts showed a new unity
on the part of Republicans in the two chambers, who feuded bitterly
over tax reduction last year. The proposal sets up a sharp
ideological collision between Republican tax-cutting objectives and
Clinton's call to allocate budget surpluses over the next 15 years
to Social Security, Medicare and increased domestic and military
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans should not have to wait 15 years for a tax cut,''
said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., after Senate Republicans introduced
the tax cut plan as one of the first five bills of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Republicans in the House and Senate on Tuesday also
immediately criticized Clinton's call for the federal government to
invest some of the retirement benefits in the stock market. They
prefer giving Americans private accounts to manage themselves. ``If
you thought a government takeover of health care was bad,'' said
Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
``just wait until the government becomes an owner of America's
private-sector companies.''
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Dennis Hastert said, ``Having the government
invest in the stock market for the American people will not
strengthen our economic security. The president's suggestion that
Social Security reform starts with government intervention in the
stock market is plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who is influential on Social Security
issues, said ``This plan is going nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day that saw lawmakers ricochet from the impeachment trial
in the Senate to the president's State of the Union message before
a joint session of Congress in the House chamber, most Republicans
were studiously polite, although two House leaders _ Dick Armey of
Texas and Tom DeLay of Texas _ noticeably did not applaud. DeLay
said of the president's speech ``It was a political speech. He used
all of his weapons of mass distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Republicans as much as Clinton sought to play down the
impeachment struggle. By putting forward Reps. Dunn and Steve
Largent, R-Okla., to deliver the televised Republican response to
the president, they also tried to give a fresher and more diverse
look to congressional Republicans, who had so long seemed to be
defined by just one person, Newt Gingrich. The two had stressed
their fresh faces as selling points in House leadership races late
last year, which they both lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the advanced text of the Republican response, neither House
member ever mentioned impeachment outright, but Ms. Dunn tried to
defuse the issue immediately and remove it from center stage.
``These are disturbing and controversial times in our nation's
capital,'' she said. ``A couple of weeks ago I heard a network
anchor say, `The capital is in chaos.' Another proclaimed we were
in the midst of a constitutional crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, our
country is not in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted, ``There are no tanks in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Then picking her words delicately, she said, ``No matter what
the outcome of the president's situation, life in America will go
on. Our lives will continue to be filled with practical matters,
not constitutional ones.''
</P>
<P>
   She called for an array of tax cuts to satisfy every Republican
constituency, beginning with the 10 percent reduction in tax rates.
``That is the down-payment on a simpler, fairer, flatter tax
system,'' she said. She also advocated an end to the so-called
marriage penalty, which charges some couples more in taxes than
they would pay if they were single, and a reduction in the
inheritance tax, which she called the ``death tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans did not spell out how much revenue the
government would lose under their proposal. By some estimates, such
a tax reduction would amount to $700 billion over a decade. Under
their plan, each income marginal tax rate would fall. The 15
percent rate would drop to 13.5 percent, for example, while the
highest rate of 39.6 percent would fall to 35.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tax proposal, a married couple with two children
earning $75,000 a year would see their tax payment fall to $9,277
from $10,308, for a net tax savings of $1,031, according to the
Senate Finance Committee. In the example, the couple does not
itemize its taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders sought to counterpose such a sweeping tax
rate reduction against Clinton's on call for specific tax credits
for needs such as child care and displaced workers. Earlier
Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott called such selective
tax relief ``the old Washington solution: Take it from the worker,
bring it to Washington, Washington takes the parts it wants. And
then return it back to the people in a way that we tell them that
they can have a tax credit.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
To say Scottie Pippen is a lucky man is an understatement.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pippen, who will be traded to the Rockets for Roy Rogers and a
second-round pick when the lockout is lifted, knows how lucky he
is.
</P>
<P>
   But he might take exception if you start talking about how lucky
he was to have won six NBA championships while playing Robin to
Michael Jordan's Batman in Chicago all these years. Jordan might
have been the heart of the Bulls, but during the championship years
Pippen was the pacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   A lithe, multiskilled player, Pippen has worked on his game to
the point that he becomes the best all-around player in the
Jordanless NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the result of work, not luck. Nope, luck comes into
play when one considers Pippen's odyssey from tiny Hamburg, Ark.,
to the NBA. From team manager at the University of Central
Arkansas, hardly a hotbed of NBA prospects, to Hall of Famer. From
a skinny, awkward 6-1 college freshman to finely muscled 6-8
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   One of Pippen's coaches at Central Arkansas, Arch Jones,
recalled the first time he laid eyes on the 18-year-old Pippen, who
back then didn't display a hint of his future NBA greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie was about 6-1, about 135 pounds,'' said Jones, who was
then an assistant but is now the head coach at Central Arkansas.
``His high school coach called us and said he had a young man with
the potential to be a college player.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we looked at him and said we'd help him with a work-study
grant if he'd be the team manager. (His jobs included) sweeping up
the gym, washing the clothes for the players, bringing out and
picking up the equipment, picking up the balls.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon, things started to change for Pippen, physically and
metaphysically. The 6-1 stringbean started to sprout, and he seemed
to have a supernatural grasp of the game that he now exhibits
nightly on NBA courts.
</P>
<P>
   And as is usually the case, it didn't take NBA scouts long to
start beating a path to Central Arkansas. Pippen was becoming big
news, much to the chagrin of Bulls general manager Jerry Krause,
who coveted the silky forward.
</P>
<P>
   Playing against inferior competition, Pippen averaged 24 points,
10 rebounds and four assists per game his senior year and was named
an NAIA All-American.
</P>
<P>
   That's when luck again came into play. When Pippen excelled in
postseason all-star games, Seattle took him with the fifth pick in
the 1987 NBA draft but quickly shipped him to Chicago for draft
picks and the rights to No. 8 pick Olden Polynice.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen found himself paired with Jordan, and the rest, as they
say, is history. Finally teamed with another great player, Jordan
blossomed into the game's dominant force. Pippen learned how to
blend his talents with Jordan's, and the tandem would become
perhaps the greatest one-two punch in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who averaged 18 points, 6.8 rebounds and 5.3 assists in
his 11 seasons with the Bulls, comes to the Rockets as a seven-time
NBA All-Star, winning the Most Valuable Player honor in the 1994
game. In addition to his six NBA titles, Pippen has two gold medals
from the 1992 and 1996 Olympics and in 1997 was named one of the
NBA's 50 Greatest Players.
</P>
<P>
   He has been selected to the All-NBA first team three times, has
been on the second team twice and has been named to the NBA's
All-Defensive first team seven times.
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen's history in Chicago included moments of misery as
well. Indeed, while Jordan was deified by Chicagoans, Pippen often
was vilified for transgressions real and imagined.
</P>
<P>
   There was Game 6 of the 1989 Eastern Conference finals, a 103-94
series-clinching loss to Detroit in which Pippen left the game
after being laid out by the Pistons' Bill Laimbeer. And then there
was Game 7 of the 1990 Eastern Conference finals, a 93-74 loss to
the Pistons when Pippen was practically AWOL because of a
mysterious migraine _ leading Jordan and the Bulls to doubt
Pippen's ability to play under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   There was the notorious last 1.8 seconds in Game 3 of the 1994
Eastern Conference semifinals against New York, when Pippen refused
to enter the game because coach Phil Jackson had drawn up the last
shot for Toni Kukoc and not Pippen. With Pippen on the bench, Kukoc
hit the game-winner in a 104-102 Bulls victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can consider me a quitter,'' Pippen said.
``I think you can look at it and say I made a stupid mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But the highlights have far outweighed the lows. Pippen
delivered 32 points, 13 rebounds, seven assists and five steals in
the 108-101 Game 5 title-clincher over the Lakers that gave the
Bulls their first NBA title. And not only did Pippen hit the
3-pointer that started a 9-0 run that allowed the Bulls to overcome
a 93-90 deficit and put them ahead for good, but his defense on
Magic Johnson was huge.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was overshadowed by Jordan in last year's
playoffs, Pippen put on a show, starting in the Eastern Conference
finals. Faced with shutting down the Pacers' running game, Jackson
assigned Pippen to guard Indiana point guard Mark Jackson. Pippen
rose to the challenge, shutting down Jackson and the Pacers'
running game, one of the biggest reasons the Bulls beat Indiana in
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen then went on to shine against Utah in the Finals, playing
in severe pain because of an injured back that required offseason
surgery to finally lay to rest the whispers that followed him since
his migraine problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pip has proved himself time and time again since then,'' said
Bill Cartwright, who started at center on the Bulls' first three
NBA title teams. ``The real measurement of Scottie was last year
against Utah when he was in agony and could barely move (in the
series-clinching Game 6 victory). Most players would have just
stayed in the locker room. He came out on the court and really put
himself on the line to play that game. This guy was brave enough to
get back on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain forced Pippen to the locker room in the first half of
Game 6, but he returned to put up eight points, four assists, three
rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot in 26 minutes (19 in the
second half) in the clinching 87-86 victory.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be his last game as a Bull. Jordan's retirement
meant a new era would yawn in Chicago, the make-some-space age. No
more Michael. And no more Scottie, who agreed to a five-year deal
that could be worth as much as $82 million with incentives and was
dealt to the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The move lifted the Rockets to contender, even favorite in the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulls couldn't have won six titles without him,'' Steve
Kerr, who played on the Bulls' last three championship teams, said
of Pippen. ``I don't know if they would have been able to win one.
That's how good Scottie is. He distributed the ball on offense and
helped out all over the place on defense. He is the guy who brought
the team together.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the Pippen Rockets fans will see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie makes us a championship-caliber team,'' said Eddie
Johnson, a free agent expected to re-sign with the Rockets. ``He
makes everyone around him better. The Rockets have always shown the
ability to stay in the hunt in terms of championship-level teams.
Scottie is definitely the best all-around player in the league now.
He's well-respected in the league. The guy won six championships
and then had an opportunity to win a seventh without Jordan (in
1994) if it wasn't for the phantom call (by Hollins) against New
York. A lot of players look up to him. He hasn't gotten his just
due because he's had to play with Jordan all this time. We're lucky
to get him.''

WASHINGTON: tax credit.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Social Security, Ms. Dunn challenged Clinton to send forward
legislation immediately. But she criticized his proposal as
``giving government more control of your retirement income.'' She
promoted instead a Republican proposal for Americans to have
individual accounts which they choose how to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Largent's half of the televised response stressed issues of
concern to the Republicans' conservative base. ``First, we must
preserve the notion that true liberty and freedom come from God and
are His blessing on this land and that freedom reigns only as we
act responsibly toward God each other and his creation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Clinton for proposing an increase in military
spending and asked him to embrace a Republican proposal for a
national missile defense system. Republicans seemed to be acting in
concert on these military issues, just as on tax cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans on Tuesday introduced a measure they called
the ''soldier's bill of rights'' to increase the rates of monthly
basic pay for members of the armed services by 4.8 percent
effective in the year 2000 and providing subsequent indexing
slightly above inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Largent also turned to an issue that is paramount for social
conservatives, saying ''protecting individual liberty also means
protecting the unborn.'' He called for an end to a form of abortion
that abortion opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.'' Clinton
has vetoed legislation that would ban the practice in which a fetus
is partially extracted and its skull collapsed in the birth canal.
The Senate failed to override his veto last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another major policy battle was shaping up on education, an
issue both parties said would be a priority in this session.
Republicans criticized Clinton's newest proposals, which would hold
states and schools accountable for their progress and use federal
aid as a lever to improve performance, as an encroachment on local
control of schools. ``We will focus on local school districts,''
said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn. ``We will focus on local school
systems. We will focus on state control.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans were also dubious of Clinton's announcement
that the Justice Department will sue the tobacco companies. ``Some
may view it as relieving the Congress of having to move on any
legislation,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who tried and failed
to push through the Senate anti-tobacco legislation last year.
</P>
<P>
   By night's end some members of Congress were left reeling by the
convergence of impeachment and the State of the Union. ``This is
schizophrenia at its highest,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
``The president excels at appearing oblivious.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans on Tuesday night did not stick to the script
and minimize impeachment. Two conservative Republicans, Reps. John
Shadegg of Arizona and Bob Schaffer of Colorado, sent a letter to
colleagues saying they would boycott the president's speech.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter they said that if Clinton had respect for
Congress, he would defer his address until his impeachment trial is
over. By proceeding, they said, ``he also clearly intends to gain
political advantage and demean the significance of the impeachment
proceeding now going forward in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   They added: ``We will not play a role in facilitating his
disrespect.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRAN BLINEBURY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
THE last best chance for the unstoppable Minnesota Vikings hung up
in the air like a snowflake. For just a moment, Randall
Cunningham's third-down, overtime rainbow to Randy Moss looked like
it would find its pot of gold down the left sideline.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then, as unexpected as a January heat wave in the frozen north,
free safety Eugene Robinson arrived on the scene to swat down the
pass and make one more statement on a Sunday afternoon that was
full of them for the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I may be getting a little older,'' Robinson said.
``But I'll tell you one thing. I can still run. I can still cover.
Hey, I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he can. Yes, they can. Those stubborn, persistent Falcons
are going to the Super Bowl because they are so good at so many
aspects of the game.
</P>
<P>
   That is, apparently, a surprise only to the whole world outside
the Falcons' nest. Which is why the Dirty Birds were able to soar
to a 14-2 record in the regular season and advance to the NFC
Championship Game without anyone giving them a second thought. Or
even a first thought.
</P>
<P>
   All year long, they had flown beneath the radar. Weak division,
it was said. Weak schedule.
</P>
<P>
   So the Falcons entered the noisy Metrodome on Sunday as an
11{-point underdog and left as the biggest upset winners ever in a
conference championship. And Atlanta is burning again.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with the combination of a flawless offensive game
plan that took full advantage of the Vikings' emphasis on stopping
the run and an attitude that said they were going to hang around
until something good happened. Which occurred when heretofore
perfect kicker Gary Anderson of Minnesota missed a field goal from
38 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Call it fate or serendipity or just plain old dumb luck that sat
on Anderson's shoulder at just the wrong time and served up
Atlanta's chance.
</P>
<P>
   But give the Falcons all the credit for not getting
steamrollered by the potent Vikings in the first half and giving
themselves a chance.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a pair of early turnovers that resulted in a
Vikings field goal and touchdown, the Falcons rarely made a mistake
the rest of the way. They never surrendered to the reverberating
din of the Metrodome, executing their offense as if playing in the
solitude of a library. One week after the Arizona Cardinals were
whistled for nine false starts in getting hammered by the Vikings,
the Falcons' offense had none.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an amazing turnaround by the Falcons under coach Dan
Reeves in just the past 15 months. While the Arrogant Tuna, Bill
Parcells, was getting all the acclaim for lifting the Jets out of
mediocrity in just two years, the about-face by the Falcons has
been even quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta began the 1997 season 0-5, stood 1-7 at the midway point
of the schedule, and has won 22 of 26 games since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound strange,'' said quarterback Chris Chandler, ``but
the time that really established this team and made it what we are
now was the first half of last year. When you lose the first five
games of the year, and you're sitting there at 1-7 at midseason,
you find out who really wants to be here, who is committed to the
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a time when it could all have come apart. I've played
on a lot of bad teams where it has come apart. But our locker room
then was as upbeat as it is today. Guys believed in what we were
doing. You could tell that the guys all liked each other. They
liked the coach. This was a job that was going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the job of the Vikings, who will be remembered for all
those long passes, all those touchdowns, all those points all year
long. But they also carved out a legacy of retreat when coach
Dennis Green had Cunningham take a knee on third down with 30
seconds left in regulation and the score tied.
</P>
<P>
   Why not one more fly pattern to the amazing rookie Moss, to get
either a long catch or draw an interference call? Why not a pass
over the middle to Cris Carter? Why not anything?
</P>
<P>
   The high-stepping, big-strutting, defense-busting,
riverboat-gambling, sneak-peek-of-the-21st-century offense simply
took a knee and surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was a little surprised,'' said Robinson. ``I mean,
these were the guys who were favored by so much, who where changing
the way the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were telling us they were content to go to overtime.
Well, we weren't content. We were happy. Delirious. Crazy. That was
our time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worried about Moss getting deep on me in overtime.
Randall always underthrows him on those long passes, and all I had
to do was close on the ball. I'm telling you I can play, man.''
</P>
<P>
   They all can. Now, finally, everyone knows it.
