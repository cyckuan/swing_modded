SOMETIMES CHECKING IN JUST ON TIME JUST ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH

   With the number of passengers on most of the nation's major
airlines up slightly last month from August 1998, airlines continue
to advise passengers to show up at the airport at least an hour
before domestic departures and two hours before international
departures to cope with airport traffic and to clear airport
security.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason for allowing plenty of time to
arrive at the airport: your flight could take off without you.
</P>
<P>
   While airlines have made it clear that passengers should be in
their assigned seats at least 10 minutes before a scheduled
departure, under certain conditions, airlines will close the cabin
doors sooner and taxi out for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   What conditions? When a storm is bearing down on the airport and
waiting until the last minute would be likely to force the delay or
cancellation of a flight.
</P>
<P>
   That happened on at least one US Airways &UR;  &LR; flight from Milwaukee
on Aug. 12, when a storm was rapidly approaching and the airline's
public address system warned a passenger who had already checked in
to board immediately so the plane could depart ahead of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, Delta Air Lines and the American Airlines unit of
AMR acknowledged that they had occassionally left early, either to
avoid storms or when all ticketed passengers were in their seats _
but only after an early departure was approved by the captain, air
traffic control, the dispatcher, customer service, meteorologists
and other flight officials, though such early departures are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Airline Bargains
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate its new nonstop service between Atlanta and Vienna,
Austrian Airlines is offering $340 round-trip fares from Atlanta to
six Austrian cities: Vienna, Innsbruck, Salzburg, Linz, Klagenfurt
and Graz. It is also offering $440 round trips to those same cities
from nine other cities in the United States, including Dallas,
Miami, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and Tampa, Fla. The nonrefundable
tickets must be bought by Sept. 24 for departures between Oct. 1
and Dec. 7, with travel completed by Dec. 18. Other restrictions
apply.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways &UR;  &LR; has added beds that recline fully to a length
of 6 feet 6 inches on its daily nonstop flights between
Baltimore-Washington International Airport and Gatwick Airport
outside London. Pillows and pajamas are included.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Airtran added a fifth daily nonstop between its
Atlanta hub and Philadelphia. Year-to-date, Airtran has flown 5.8
percent more passengers than in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines has joined Hyatt Hotels' frequent-flier
program. Each stay at a Hyatt is good for 500 frequent-flier miles
on the airline, but through Nov. 14, Singapore members who stay at
participating Hyatt International hotels in more than 30 countries
outside the United States, Canada and the Caribbean will get 1,000
miles for each stay.
</P>
<P>
   Other Airline Business
</P>
<P>
   Several airlines are adding new destinations or flights, some of
them seasonal. Northwest Airlines, for example, is adding a new
daily Detroit-Honolulu nonstop between Dec. 17 and April 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 18, Air Canada &UR;  &LR; will begin daily nonstop service between
Dulles International Airport, serving Washington, and Halifax, Nova
Scotia. To promote the flight, the airline is offering round-trip
fares starting at $179 for sale until Sept. 29 and valid for travel
until Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Next April 13, US Airways will begin daily nonstop flights
between Charlotte/Douglas International Airport in North Carolina
and Paris, and on May 19 will begin a daily nonstop between
Charlotte and Frankfurt. On May 26, US Airways will add a daily
nonstop between Philadelphia and Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
   Airports
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte/Douglas still has comfortable oak rocking chairs in
its atrium and has no intention of removing them. Installed in 1997
to promote a photo exhibition of Southern porches, the chairs were
being taken away at the end of the exhibit until passengers
complained, whereupon they were promptly returned. Unlike the
typical airport seat, the rocking chairs can also be bought at the
airport for $225 plus shipping. &QL;

PEREZ PUT ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Carlos Perez's troubled season officially ended Tuesday
when the Dodgers' exiled left-hander was placed on the 60-day
disabled list with a deep bone bruise in his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were hoping to put Perez back in the starting
rotation after one more minor-league start. But he was struck on
the right leg by a line drive 10 days ago and the club decided he
was in no shape to pitch again this season.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who had the worst season of his five-year major-league
career, finished 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA. He was optioned to Triple-A
Albuquerque on July 28 and made four starts. But he never regained
the command or velocity that made him a quality starter for
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped to get him one more start at Albuquerque and then
evaluate him in September,'' manager Davey Johnson said. ``But when
he hurt his leg, it put him so far behind. There was no reason to
bring him back at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, signed to a four-year, $15.5 million, never got on track
this season. He was 0-7 at Dodger Stadium and his fastball rarely
reached the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be the first to tell you he was not prepared for this
season,'' Johnson said. ``He had some other issues, but he did
nothing to adjust this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he seemed to be doing some good things at Albuquerque. He
was the first one to the ballpark and he seemed to be enjoying
baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   __ More moves:In addition to the Perez decision, the Dodgers
recalled right-hander Jamie Arnold, infielders Juan Castro and Alex
Cora from Triple-A. The club also purchased the contract of
left-hander Jeff Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold spent most of the season with the Dodgers, posting a 2-3
record and 4.91 ERA in 32 games. He made three starts for the
Dodgers but was sent down Aug. 23 and went 0-2 with a 9.53 ERA for
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Castro and Cora played for the Dodgers in 1998 but did not make
the big leagues this season. Castro, perhaps the best defensive
player in the organization, signed a two-year, $400,000 contract
last winter but was not a good fit, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with him in spring training and I even
think he'll hit in the big leagues,'' Johnson said. ``But he was a
right-handed bat on a team with too many right-handers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora, brother of former big-league second baseman Joey Cora, did
not make the majors this year after breaking his right hand during
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   __ Floyd wants out, sort of: Florida's left-handed-hitting left
fielder Cliff Floyd, who has drawn interest from the Dodgers, was
scheduled to return to the Marlins lineup Tuesday after missing 10
weeks with a torn right Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   But when Floyd arrived several minutes late for a pregame
workout, he was benched by manager John Boles. Floyd also opened
the season on the disabled list after surgery on his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   He is in the first season of a four-year $19 million contract
after having 22 homers and 90 RBI in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd is angry but will not demand a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Boles) wants to scratch me for that, fine,'' Floyd said.
``I've had it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Dodgers starter Eric Gagne is one of four
Canadian pitchers in the big leagues. The others: Florida's Ryan
Dempster (Gagne's opponent Tuesday night), Texas reliever Jeff
Zimmerman and Angels injured right-hander Jason Dickson.

CITY STRIKES DEAL WITH PIPELINE COMPANY ON SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olympic Pipe Line Co. has agreed to extensive testing,
monitoring and safety improvements to win the right to repair the
10-mile section of line through Bellingham, Wash., closed since a
deadly explosion in June.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-month agreement with the city of Bellingham puts
restrictions on Olympic that are tougher than what federal
regulators require.
</P>
<P>
   Tests using water pressure, for example, will be performed at
such high levels that failures may be likely. The company also will
have to install at least three new valves and employ a second
leak-detection system.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic also has committed to study the idea of moving the
pipeline outside the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is rare among pipeline companies and municipal
governments. In Washington state, most local governments have
franchise agreements with pipelines. In a few places in the
country, especially those that have had serious accidents, local
governments restrict development near pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   But Bellingham _ located about 80 miles north of Seattle in
Whatcom County _ may be alone in extracting what it has from
Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson told reporters Tuesday that the
agreement should better ensure the safety of local residents. The
agreement, he said, ``truly is what every community deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another action that we have taken to show people we are
willing to do whatever it takes to show that we have a safe
pipeline,'' said Fred Crognale, Olympic's president.
</P>
<P>
   Bellingham's negotiations with Olympic might inspire similar
attempts by other cities. The pipeline goes through Redmond,
Bellevue, Renton, Seattle and several other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue, for example, already has asked Olympic for maintenance
records and will be paying close attention to Bellingham's
agreement, said Tony Perez, franchise manager for Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   Crognale said Olympic is willing to hear other cities out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to have conversations with them all,'' Crognale
said. But he said the circumstances in Bellingham were unusual.
There was the June 10 accident, and Olympic's franchise agreement
there had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Only the federal Office of Pipeline Safety has the authority to
allow Olympic to resume using the upper 37 miles of its pipeline.
That section has been closed since the catastrophic accident in
Bellingham on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic has 400 miles of pipeline in Washington state, running
from the Arco refinery at Cherry Point to the Columbia River. Three
other refineries also pump gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel into
the line.
</P>
<P>
   Bellingham, as well as most other local governments, paid little
attention to the pipeline until June 10. On that day, the 16-inch
line in Bellingham ruptured, sending 277,000 gallons of gasoline
into creeks. The fumes and subsequent fire killed an 18-year-old
man and two 10-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
   A federal criminal investigation is looking for violations of
the Clean Water Act in the accident. Other federal investigations
are trying to determine a cause of the accident and what can be
done to prevent similar mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   Bellingham's franchise agreement with Olympic expired in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached Tuesday was the result of two months of
negotiations. They began shortly after the city submitted a list of
demands to Olympic on July 19.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the negotiations resulted in Olympic agreeing to
do things it had already committed to do or was being ordered to do
by regulators. However, the city has in several instances insisted
on tougher standards.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which Bellingham's City Council must approve,
will run through May 4 of next year. It covers getting the pipeline
ready to operate, and also governs the first weeks of operation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear when the upper 37 miles of pipeline will reopen.
</P>
<P>
   But once it does, Olympic has agreed to reduced operating
pressure through Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
   As an extra safety precaution in the first week of operation,
the pipeline will run only diesel and jet fuel. Those fuels are
less volatile than the gasoline that exploded June 10.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has agreed to use three different types of
internal inspection devices to check for corrosion and deformities
after the upper 37 miles has opened. It also will have an outside
safety audit 180 days after the line is opened.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening the line, Olympic has agreed to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hydrostatic testing. That involves putting water into the
10-mile section of pipeline in Bellingham at high pressure to test
for weak spots. Olympic last tested in this way in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A consultant to the city said he expected that test to result in
a failure. But Crognale is not so sure that there will be a
failure. The test will take four weeks to set up, perform and
evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Surge analysis. Federal regulators already have asked for
these tests, which look at how pressure can build up in the
pipeline in different situations.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are important because pressure in the line built up on
June 10 when valves downstream closed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Review the computer system that operates and monitors the
pipeline. The computer system, which crashed June 10, has already
been the subject of federal orders and Olympic improvements. The
company, for example, is increasing computer processing power by
750 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Install a new leak-detection system. Olympic has such a system
as part of its computer network. The additional system would be
able to detect major leaks even if the computer was down.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations do not require pipelines to have leak
detection.
</P>
<P>
   _ Study moving the pipeline. Such a move might prove costly and
technically difficult, Crognale said. It also would present
problems when it comes to getting government permits for a new
location. If it is feasible, Olympic would have to move the line in
five years, Crognale said.

METS BULLPEN COLLAPSES IN LOSS TO GIANTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Turk Wendell's slide continued Tuesday night as the
spirited relief pitcher blew yet another game. With the Mets
leading the San Francisco Giants by one run in the eighth inning,
Wendell allowed consecutive doubles to Rich Aurilia and Doug
Mirabelli, the seventh and eighth batters in the Giants' lineup, to
jump-start what became a mess of a finish for the home team in the
Mets' 7-4 loss at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The winning run was allowed by John Franco, who relieved Wendell
after Mirabelli's double, but was credited to Wendell, giving him a
line of three hits and two earned runs in two-thirds of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in his last four outings that Wendell
crumbled. Last week, he gave up a grand slam to Ken Caminiti in a
6-2 loss to Houston, then, two nights later, was charged with three
runs in a 5-2 10th-inning loss to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wendell was the losing pitchers, his problems were
shared by his teammates, as three pitchers followed him from the
bullpen in the final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets used a total of eight pitchers, breaking the franchise
record of seven pitchers used in a nine-inning game. The Mets used
eight pitchers once before, but that was in a 24-inning game
against Houston on April 15, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets dropped to 3 1/2 games behind Atlanta, which defeated
St. Louis by 3-2 in the National League East Division race and lost
a half-game of their wild-card lead on the Cincinnati Reds.
Cincinnati split a doubleheader with the Chicago Cubs to move 3 1/2
games behind the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wasted start for Rick Reed, who made his first
appearance since being placed on the disabled list with a strained
middle finger on his right hand on Aug. 9, and a wasted opportunity
for the Mets, who briefly took a lead after being down by 3-0. Reed
blew through the Giants in the first two innings, but his lack of
control combined with San Francisco's power resulted in a three-run
third.
</P>
<P>
   The poor performance damaged Reed's chances of gaining a place
in the Mets' postseason rotation _ if there is a postseason for
this team _ despite his deceiving 10-4 record. With Valentine
employing a six-man rotation the rest of the way, Reed, who has
benefited from terrific run support, is in line for three more
starts. But with Bobby Jones back in the mix, that number could
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had to go to his bullpen early, and the pitching staff
wilted. The seven Mets' relievers allowed six hits and four runs
over the last five innings.
</P>
<P>
   While Wendell had the hardest time, Franco also was hit hard in
his second appearance since returning from the disabled list on
Saturday. He entered in the eighth with the game tied at 4-4 and
Brent Mayne on second base. Two batters later, the Mets were down
by 5-4 as Franco surrendered a run-scoring single to Marvin Benard.
After getting Charlie Hayes to ground out to end the inning, Franco
was lifted after Bobby Bonds lined a single off the right field
wall at the start of the eighth. He gave up two hits and one earned
run in two-thirds of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' pitchers were not the only ones who seemed to be
absent for much of the game. Starting opposite Reed was the Giants
right-hander Joe Nathan, a rookie who is 5-3 with a 3.58 earned run
average in 13 major league appearances, eight as a starter. Matched
against Nathan for the first time, the Mets appeared baffled. They
went hitless through the first four innings and got only two balls
out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pratt changed that in the fifth by doubling off the base of
the wall in center field to score Roger Cedeno, who had walked. It
was the Mets' first hit of the game and a precursor of things to
come in the sixth. Trailing by 3-1, the Mets scored three runs on
the strength of the hitting of John Olerud, who doubled to score
Edgar Alfonzo (walk), and Darryl Hamilton, whose single scored
Olerud. Hamilton scored later on a fielder's choice to short by Rey
Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   Reed started well, setting the Giants down in order in the first
inning and striking out Jeff Kent and Ellis Burks to begin the
second. He walked J.T. Snow and gave up a single to Rich Aurilia,
but averted trouble by striking out Doug Mirabelli.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had four strikeouts at that point, but he was crushed in
the third. Nathan, of all people, started Reed's undoing by opening
the inning with a double to right field that went over Cedeno's
head. Marvin Benard followed with a single that sent Reed to third,
and Hayes knocked a grounder to Alfonzo at second base. Realizing
it was a pitcher on third, Alfonzo nailed Nathan at the plate to
save the run.
</P>
<P>
   The Giant's pitcher proved to be a gamer by charging hard into
Pratt, but the Mets' catcher held on to the ball, if not his
senses. Shaken up in the collision, he needed a five-minute break
and a few warm-up pitches before returning to play.
</P>
<P>
   With Benard and Hayes on, Reed walked Barry Bonds before Jeff
Kent cleared the bases with a double to center field that touched
the wall on one hop and put the Giants ahead by 3-0. &QL;

CONE TAKES THE LOSS AS ROYALS DOWN YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ David Cone embraces responsibility readily,
as if it were a privilege. If a teammate makes an error and Cone
then gives up a run-scoring hit, Cone blames himself. If he loses a
game by 1-0, he will say he should have pitched better.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone might have felt like passing around some blame Tuesday
night, for he was victimized time and again by the actions of
others, from Vice President Al Gore to catcher Jorge Posada to
second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, in losing, 6-3, to the Kansas City
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams was in the starting lineup Tuesday night, but
the Yankees have plans to send him back to New York on Wednesday, a
day earlier than the rest of the team, so that he can have his sore
left (nonthrowing) shoulder tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we might do it so we can have him for Friday,'' said
manager Joe Torre, referring to the day the Yankees begin a
three-game series against Boston, a division rival. ``We'll do all
that stuff tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging scan, in an
effort to determine what is causing the inflammation that hampers
his swing. He initially injured his shoulder attempting a diving
catch in a game in June and has played through pain, and he even
went on an offensive binge in late July. But the shoulder has
bothered him on this trip and it is apparent it is effecting his
swing, particularly when he swings at pitches high in the strike
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Players will sometimes take a shot of cortisone to reduce
inflammation and to function better. And given that Williams does
not appear to be seriously injured, it figures that at some point
between now and the start of the postseason, Williams will get a
shot to help his swing.
</P>
<P>
   Williams batted third Tuesday night in a lineup stifled by the
Royals' Jose Rosado, a left-hander, like the Anaheim pitcher who
shut down the Yankees Monday, Jarrod Washburn. The Yankees had
runners on base in every inning and just couldn't get the big hit.
</P>
<P>
   Cone's bad day actually started Monday. When the Yankees are
ready to complete a series in one city and travel to another, they
will send the next day's starting pitcher ahead, on a commercial
flight, so he can get a full night's rest. Cone was supposed to fly
here, his hometown, on Monday, have a leisurely evening and prepare
to pitch Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Because of flight cancellations, however, Cone had to travel
from one airport to another in the Los Angeles area before finally
giving up in frustration and deciding to travel on the team's
charter flight.
</P>
<P>
   There was another problem: Gore flew into Los Angeles
International Airport late Monday evening, delaying the Yankees'
charter and other planes. The Yankees' team bus did not pull up to
the team hotel until 4:50 a.m., and by all accounts, Cone was not
pleased. He looked tired when he arrived at Kauffman Stadium
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked Johnny Damon, Kansas City's first batter, and Damon
stole second base and moved to third on a bunt. Carlos Beltran
grounded sharply to first, the second out of the inning, and Damon
had to hold at third. Rather than throw Jermaine Dye a good pitch
to hit, Cone walked the Royals' cleanup hitter, and went after Mike
Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
   The count was two balls and one strike and with Cone's right
foot against the pitching rubber, he stared in for the sign from
Posada. The Yankees' catcher flashed a sign, Cone nodded quickly in
assent and almost simultaneously began to draw his hands together.
But when Posada flashed another sign, Cone hesitated and shook his
head. Chuck Meriwether, the first-base umpire, called a balk, and
Damon walked home from third base with the first run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals added a second run in the third inning, and though
Cone had relatively good stuff _ his fastball was 88 to 90 mph _ he
was laboring, throwing 66 pitches through three. At a time when
Torre and Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach, are trying to limit
the stress on Cone's arm and prepare him for the playoffs, it was a
pace he could not maintain for long.
</P>
<P>
   Cone walked Beltran with one out in the fifth. Dye then hit a
ground ball between Shane Spencer in right field and Williams in
center. Beltran was running hard all the way from first; Spencer
cut the ball off perhaps 30 feet in front of the fence and threw it
to the infield, to the relay man Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran would have stopped at third in most circumstances. But
Rich Dauer, the Kansas City third-base coach, waved Beltran around
third and homeward and he scored easily with a slide, an unusual
play with just one out. Knoblauch's throwing woes are hardly a
secret, and like sharks sensing a kill, third-base coaches won't
hesitate to exploit a perceived weakness. (Knoblauch did not have a
good game in the field. He dived for several balls, and though they
appeared to be well within his reach, he wasn't able to catch them
or even knock them down.)
</P>
<P>
   Cone was replaced after five innings, having thrown 106 pitches.
The Yankees could not rebound against Rosado, and Cone was stuck
with his eighth loss in 19 decisions. His record is 2-4 since the
All-Star Game break. But in 10 starts since the break, Cone has
allowed three earned runs or fewer in eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have been in first place comfortably for more than
two months, but are suddenly within range of the Red Sox in the
American League East. Going into Tuesday night's action, the
Yankees led Boston by 6 1/2 games, and the Red Sox will be in
Yankee Stadium for three games over the weekend.

AMERICAN GLAD TO BE OUT OF FRAY IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ When Sue Mackley left East Timor in a
jam-packed Australian military cargo plane Tuesday, she wasn't
quite sure how to feel.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old former Overland Park resident was relieved to
get out of the violence-racked territory alive, but she also was
concerned for the East Timorese people she left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to somewhere safe, but I felt complete
guilt and betrayal,'' Mackley said from Darwin, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   She had traveled to East Timor as a representative of the
International Federation for East Timor, a U.N.-accredited group
that monitored a referendum on the territory's independence from
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of independence, but
violence broke out after election results were released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mackley, a Chicago resident, has family in the Kansas City, Mo.,
area, including her father, Jim Mackley, and mother, Sandra
Hanshaw, both of Overland Park. She called them from Darwin on
Tuesday to let them know she was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Mackley lived in Overland Park for about seven years until 1984,
when she moved to Atlanta. She graduated from high school there the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 she graduated from the University of South Carolina, and
she later spent time working in France, Russia, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia and Cambodia before moving to Chicago in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mackley became interested in East Timor more than three years
ago. She quit her job as a software developer early last month so
she could travel to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, she worked with a lobbying group to stop
arms sales to Indonesia because of its policies and actions in East
Timor. However, her role in East Timor was to be a neutral election
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be professional and diligent about your job,''
Mackley said. ``The best way to credit your organization is by
being impartial.''
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor she was part of a team of five persons sent to
Vikeke, a mountainous town of about 45,000 residents. She spent 2
weeks living with a family there before leaving Saturday in
anticipation of post-election violence.
</P>
<P>
   The group had planned to flee to the territorial capital city of
Dili but ended up in another city, Baucau. The group was among 50
persons _ 10 from Mackley's organization, 40 from the United
Nations _ holed up in a two-story building in Baucau on Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-independence militia members fired at the building, on and
off, for about 90 minutes before a U.N. convoy took Mackley and her
colleagues to the airport Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Their plane was surrounded by members of the Indonesian
military, but it was allowed to take off without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Mackley isn't sure what her group will do next, but she's
willing to do whatever she can to help East Timor gain
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go back in (to East Timor) as necessary, if that's the
best way to help.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Birch Telecom is making several changes in
its executive ranks, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Don Goldman, former chief marketing officer and senior vice
president of Internet services, has been appointed chief operating
officer. He will be responsible for the company's daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   David Vranicar, who has been acting as chief information officer
for the past year, will formally assume that title. He will be
responsible for developing systems and processes to support the

cities.
</P>
<P>
   The management reorganization is designed to support a rapid
growth plan, said Birch President David Scott. He said the plan was
the first of many corporate moves that would stem from a recent $60
million equity infusion by the New York investment bank Kohlberg,

GOLD BANC TO ACQUIRE 10-BRANCH BANK COMPANY BASED IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Gold Banc Corp., the quickly expanding
Leawood, Kan., bank holding company, on Tuesday announced plans to
buy a 10-branch bank company based on the west coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Banc will pay $91.4 million in stock to acquire American
Bancshares. American is based in Bradenton, Fla. It has about $485
million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes about a month after Gold Banc announced it would
pay about $65 million in another tax-free stock swap to buy Union
Bankshares Ltd. of Denver. That company's Union Bank &AMP; Trust has
seven locations and $340 million in loans and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   If the two deals close, they will give Gold Banc assets of more
than $2 billion. American and Union will continue to operate under
their current names.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Banc is paying $18.18 a share for American Bancshares.
American's stock closed Tuesday at 13 7/8, up 1 7/8. The number of
Gold Banc shares paid will be based on an average price of Gold
Banc's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Banc, which went public in November 1996, has expanded by
acquiring small community banks and financial services companies.
Gold Banc's stock closed Tuesday at 10 3/4, down 1 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gullion, Gold Banc's chairman and chief executive, said
that by expanding in fast-growing metropolitan areas, Gold Banc
should be able to achieve above-average earnings growth, without
relying solely on acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is one of the best banking markets in the U.S., and
Manatee County, where American is based, has been the
second-fastest-growing county in the U.S. since 1986,'' Gullion
said. ``In some of our rural markets, we can't get that kind of
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next 10 years, some baby boomers will take their
significant wealth and head to the Sun Belt states, Gullion said.
Gold Banc wants to stay ``in front of the money'' with money
management and brokerage services for customers in that area and
for any of its customers who might move to that area.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a bank as far away as Florida poses an operating
challenge for Gold Banc, said Erick Reim, an analyst with U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. But Gold Banc's technological
sophistication makes it manageable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gold Banc is very technologically advanced, with significant
back office support,'' Reim said. ``This should make the
consolidation easier.''
</P>
<P>
   American has not been as efficiently run as it might have been,
Reim said, and has not focused on products that generate fees. So
while it appears Gold Banc is paying a significant premium for
American's stock, there should be plenty of opportunities to
enhance the company's profits beyond the usual consolidation
savings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Banc reported in July that its net earnings increased 22
percent, to $3.4 million, in the second quarter. Net earnings per
diluted share increased 18 percent, to 20 cents a share. Last
year's earnings were restated to include the effect of
acquisitions. If the results had not been restated, this year's
second-quarter earnings would have increased 147 percent and
earnings per share would have increased 54 percent.

WALK-ON FULLBACK GETS HIS WISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When it comes to UCLA and disabled-parking
placards, one player's suspension is another player's start.
</P>
<P>
   That was never more true than at fullback, where Durell Price
will miss his long-awaited game at Ohio State and walk-on Matt
Stanley, a former Columbus resident, will get the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a dream come true for me,'' said Stanley, who
attended Bexley High School in Columbus. ``When I was coming to
UCLA, I checked the future schedule and saw the game. I was
concerned with making the travel squad and hoping to play a little
on special teams. I never realized I'd be in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Price, who circled this game the instant his signed
letter of intent was improperly faxed to Ohio State in 1996; the
snafu freed him to sign with UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated as hell I can't play,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stanley lived in Columbus for six years, attended
several Ohio State-Michigan games and knows the words to Ohio
State's fight song, his blood is Bruins blue and gold. Both his
parents attended UCLA, and his father, Steve, and uncle, Jim,
played for the Bruins in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   As an oversized tailback in high school, Stanley considered
walking on at Purdue and Pittsburgh and did not receive any
scholarship offers. When decision time arrived, he followed his
roots to Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be awesome Saturday,'' he said. ``I can't wait
for kickoff. I get to play against the uniforms I grew up watching
and idolizing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Lineup changes: After Tuesday's practice, coach Bob Toledo
announced three depth-chart changes.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sophomore Bryan Fletcher will start at tight end over junior
Gabe Crecion.
</P>
<P>
   __ Junior Santi Hall will start at outside linebacker over
freshman Asi Faoa.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sophomore Julius Williams will start at strong safety over
sophomore Jason Stephens, who played poorly against Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tight coverage: UCLA has placed many of its best athletes on
the kickoff and punt-coverage units, and it shows. Boise State had
one punt return for minus-2 yards, and it averaged just 15 yards on
seven kickoff returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of first-line people covering,'' Toledo said.
``Tackling is athletic ability.''
</P>
<P>
   For proof, Toledo cited receiver Freddie Mitchell, who made a
diving, drive-stopping tackle while playing cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   __ Return to action:!of! Hard-hitting redshirt freshman Audie
Attar returns this week from a one-game suspension for fighting.
He'll compete with Williams and Stephens for time at strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   __ What of Roques? The Bruins aren't sure where senior defensive
back Ryan Roques will play when he returns next week from his
disabled-parking-scandal suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, Roques will replace the weakest link in the
secondary _ whether it's freshman cornerback Joe Hunter, senior
free safety Joey Strycula or Williams/Stephens/Attar.
</P>
<P>
   __ Probable return: After a collision late in Tuesday's
practice, suspended linebacker Ali Abdul Azziz complained of
numbness in his arm and neck. He was whisked to the UCLA Medical
Center, but X-rays showed no fracture or instability. He could
return as early as next week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ As international pressure mounted on
Indonesia on Tuesday to halt a continuing surge of violence in East
Timor, analysts here were stumped by two fundamental questions: who
is orchestrating the carnage and why?
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of players in this sprawling country, which
is experimenting with democracy. The military is divided and the
president is weakened. New political alliances are coalescing as
Indonesia's first democratically elected assembly prepares to be
seated and a new president is about to be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop it has become clear that irregular
militias backed by the Indonesian military are carrying out an
organized campaign of terror that involves widespread killing,
arson and the forced evacuation of tens of thousands from the
remote territory of 800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   What is not clear is what the campaign is meant to achieve and
what degree of control the government in Jakarta has over the
people who are carrying it out. These are key questions as the
United Nations and a number of foreign countries seek to put
pressure on Indonesia to bring the violence to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the people of East Timor voted 78.5 percent in favor
of independence from Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese
colony in 1975 and has fought against separatist guerrillas there
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   That vote, organized by the United Nations, is now, as one
diplomat put it, ``part of history.'' It was unclear whether the
current violence was an attempt somehow to turn back history, to
seek some sort of bargaining power in a new East Timor, to send a
warning to other separatist movements or simply to wreak vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these elements may be involved, but none seem to
explain fully what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear whether the policy, whatever it is, was
ordered by Gen. Wiranto, the armed forces chief, or whether it was
the work of military elements in East Timor that have rampaged
beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto is in a tenuous position of command as he seeks to lead
the military toward reforms that reduce its power and privileges at
a time of dangerous instability in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say he may find it difficult to bring to heel the
entrenched units that have had their way in East Timor for 24 years
and are unwilling to let it go now.
</P>
<P>
   If Wiranto is in fact commanding the campaign of violence, he
would be undermining the policy of President B.J. Habibie, who
offered the East Timorese their freedom early this year. That
sudden shift in policy by the president was deeply unpopular among
many in the military.
</P>
<P>
   With an electoral assembly due to choose the next president
later this fall, Habibie's East Timor policy could cost him the
potentially decisive political backing of the armed forces for a
new term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Jakarta does have the power to halt the violence
if it is pressed hard enough, Australia announced Tuesday that it
had dispatched two warships with 500 troops to the waters off East
Timor with the intention of leading a peacekeeping force if
Indonesia agrees to its presence.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, a five-member delegation from the
Security Council was arrived here Wednesday to press for quick
action.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Indonesia
had 48 hours to show that it could control the situation. If not,
he said, ``the international community will have to consider what
other measures it can take to assist the Indonesian government in
meeting its obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, though, the options of the international
community are extremely limited. It is most unlikely that any
military action will be taken without Jakarta's consent _ and that
consent is also most unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   And any economic sanctions would jeopardize hopes for the
recovery here that foreign nations have worked so desperately, and
at such huge cost, to foster.
</P>
<P>
   Though the carnage in East Timor arouses moral outrage, the
territory is a tiny one with little international importance. Any
intervention on its behalf must be weighed against the costs to
relations with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation,
with more than 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In his warning, Annan was referring to Indonesia's announcement
Tuesday that it was imposing martial law on East Timor, which has
descended into chaos since it voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said the decree included ``the
shooting on sight of people who go against the curfew,''
</P>
<P>
   If the military cracks down now on the campaign of violence, it
will be cracking down on a campaign that it instigated and that is
being controlled now by at least some of its own elements.
</P>
<P>
   The militias that are carrying out the carnage were created by
the military early this year in an evident attempt to skew or
derail the vote through violence and intimidation. Until election
day, that plan seemed straightforward enough.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly and inexplicably the militias backed off. On the
day of the vote, East Timor became an island of peace, with
virtually no attempt made to disrupt the vote. Once the voting was
complete, no one tried to steal the ballot boxes. And during five
days of vote counting in an unguarded building, no attempt was made
to spoil the process.
</P>
<P>
   If this was a real attempt to derail the vote, one diplomat
said, it seemed a rather halfhearted one.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the result was announced last Saturday, the
militias took heart again, launching a rampage of terror that has
continued for four days.
</P>
<P>
   They have intimidated most foreign journalists, aid workers and
election observers into fleeing the territory and Tuesday even
Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, whose residence was burned
Monday, fled to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The militias have been rounding up tens of thousands of
residents and trucking them, in organized convoys, across the
border into West Timor, which is part of Indonesia. The
International Committee for the Red Cross said refugees were
pouring across the border Tuesday at the rate of 3,000 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But why? With four out of five East Timorese voting for
independence, it seemed futile to try to expel all independence
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation here that the anti-independence forces
could be hoping to create an Indonesian enclave within a new East
Timorese nation, but this theory too seemed inadequate to explain
the tactics of the militias.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the declaration of martial law early Tuesday morning,
residents of the capital, Dili, reported that the violence and
terror were continuing. It was unclear whether the state of
emergency was a serious attempt to bring order and whether it could
succeed even if it tried to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation here in the United Nations compound is
deteriorating very rapidly,'' said Tjitske Lingsma, a Dutch
journalist who has remained in Dili, speaking by telephone Tuesday
evening. ``All day around Dili buildings have been set on fire.
Just after dark we saw two huge fires not too far from the United
Nations compound. The whole city is being destroyed and houses are
being looted. The situation is getting worse and worse.''

ANTI-SMOKING DRIVE: ACTIVISM WITHOUT A NEED

<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ One of the most nerve-racking jobs on the
planet must be running a restaurant in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   As if coping with a tight labor market isn't tough enough,
there's always a contingent of elected city officials wanting to
run your business for you.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that the smoking issue apparently was resolved
in a manner generally acceptable to most. When smoking foes are
determined to impose their vision of a perfect world on everyone,
the issue isn't resolved until the world as they can control it is
smoke free.
</P>
<P>
   While the latest bid to give the city more control over public
smoking options would affect only about 20 percent of the city's
restaurants, the question that needs asking is why this has
re-emerged as an issue.
</P>
<P>
   There are no doubt many Johnson Countians who support such an
effort because they find smokers loathsome and their secondhand
fumes repulsive. Even so, where's the conflict?
</P>
<P>
   If you eat out regularly in Overland Park, you'd probably be
hard put to remember a recent instance when you've witnessed
smokers and anti-smokers clashing at a restaurant serving both.
This absence of rancor apparently indicates that the current
smoking ordinance is working as everyone had hoped: Restaurant
operators decide what's in their best business interest. Slightly
more than half allow smoking, apparently in a way satisfactory to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   This state of harmony, however, isn't good enough for some
council members. They want to turn the screws a bit tighter by
banning smoking at all food-service establishments without bars
unless separately ventilated areas are provided for smoking
patrons. At restaurants with bars, smoking would be restricted to
within 10 feet of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking foes may justify these efforts as necessary to protect
the public from the health threat of secondhand smoke. The
secondhand smoke ruse, however, has been discredited as an exercise
in junk science.
</P>
<P>
   This reality has unfortunately been ignored by anti-smoking
crusaders, whose primary leverage is pushing the public-health
dimension of their campaign. In fact, theirs has always been more a
moral crusade than a health crusade. Inventing a health threat from
passive smoke and thus a need to protect nonsmokers from smokers
has been the key to success.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, in a country that traditionally has prided itself on
tolerance and a democratic approach to governance, smoking has
created an exception to these centuries-old norms. As unfortunate
as this recent embrace of intolerance is, though, it still doesn't
justify legislating on the basis of personal crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Just because elected officials perceive their position as
morally right or well-intentioned doesn't justify legislating
personal feelings into law. Moreover, citizens who encourage such
behavior by elected officials put their own personal liberties at
risk down the road. When legislators take this approach, it's a
form of tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   The criterion for legislation should be whether there's a
compelling need. In the case of Overland Park's restaurant
situation, smoking and nonsmoking restaurant patrons seem to have
arrived at a mutually satisfactory accommodation. Given this,
what's the point?

MICROSOFT TO JOIN FIBER OPTIC VENTURE IN ASIA
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expanding the reach of advanced fiber optic communications in
Asia, the Microsoft Corp., Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda and the
Softbank Corp. of Japan have agreed to form a $1.3 billion joint
venture to build a new communications web stretching from Japan to
Malaysia, executives close to the agreement said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies intend to announce the venture, to be called Asia
Global Crossing, as soon as Wednesday, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been moving at a moderate pace to extend its
dominance in computer software into the communications world. Until
now, most of Microsoft's communications efforts have appeared
focused on local markets. Two years ago, the company invested $1
billion in the Comcast Corp., one of the nation's biggest cable
television companies. In January, it invested $500 million in NTL
Inc., one of Britain's largest cable television operators.
</P>
<P>
   But the new venture with Softbank, the media and Internet giant,
and Global Crossing, the upstart long-distance carrier, appears to
be Microsoft's first move into the fast-growing market for
long-distance and international communications services. Propelled
by the Internet and deregulation, entrepreneurs and old state
monopolies alike are betting that new communications pipes can be
filled almost as quickly as they are built.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Global Crossing will contribute to the new
venture its 57.75 percent stake in an undersea fiber optic cable
called Pacific Crossing 1, which is scheduled to begin operating
between Japan and the West Coast of the United States by January.
The minority investors in Pacific Crossing 1 include the Marubeni
Corp. of Japan, the trading concern, and Kokusai Denshin Denwa,
Japan's dominant international telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Softbank and Microsoft have each agreed to
contribute $175 million in cash to the venture and to buy a joint
total of $200 million worth of communications capacity over the
next three years, executives close to the deal said.
</P>
<P>
   The three partners have assigned the new venture an initial
value of $5 billion. So the investments by Softbank and Microsoft
will garner each company a 3.5 percent initial stake in the
operation, with Global Crossing controlling the other 93 percent.
But Microsoft and Softbank stand to make a substantial profit on
their investments if the venture succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The three partners intend to offer stock in the new venture to
the public, and if the value of the operation exceeds $5 billion,
the equity controlled by Microsoft and Softbank will rise.
According to executives close to the deal, Microsoft and Softbank
could each come to control 19 percent of the new venture if its
total value reaches $7.5 billion, making each such stake worth $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The venture intends to use the $350 million in cash contributed
by Microsoft and Softbank as part of a $1.3 billion project to
build a new international fiber optic network called East Asia
Crossing. By the end of next year, the companies intend the new
system to link Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and
the Philippines. By June 2001, the system is meant to also reach
China and South Korea. Eventually, the three partners would like to
expand as far south as Indonesia and as far west as India. The new
network will initially link with the older Pacific Crossing 1 cable
in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Global Crossing renegotiated its deal to acquire
the Frontier Corp., formerly Rochester Telephone, in light of the
fact that Global Crossing's stock has lost more than half its value
since that deal was announced in the spring. Shares of Global
Crossing fell $2.0625 Tuesday, to $20.3125.

STRONG STILL FUMBLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC tailback Frank Strong might have wanted
sympathy from his teammates after two fumbles against Hawaii.
Instead he got nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fumbleitis. Fumblerooski. Those were a couple names,'' Strong
said.
</P>
<P>
   Strong's season couldn't have started any worse. After fumbling
three times in 37 carries last season, he hoped to show the coaches
that he could be trusted to hold on to the ball. But in six
carries, he fumbled twice against Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare,'' Strong said. ``It's always tough when you
make a mental error. Whatever, you're doing, it just keeps coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, Strong has been bothered by a deep thigh
bruise that has caused his knee to stiffen the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make excuses, but it had an effect on the
mental aspect of the game,'' Strong said. ``I didn't get hit in a
while, so I wasn't used to contact.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that will matter if Strong doesn't demonstrate he can
run without fumbling. Coach Paul Hackett reiterated his position on
the matter Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real simple. Don't fumble,'' Hackett said. ``How much is
too many? I'm not going to be stupid. If there's a problem that
becomes alarming, you have to reduce a guy's opportunity to carry.
There's a concern clearly. (But) I thought that was real good work
today.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick start: Freshman wide receiver Kareem Kelly had an
impressive debut, with 104 yards receiving on five catches. But
Kelly was hardly among those surprised by his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people didn't expect much from me because I'm a
freshman,'' Kelly said. ``But I had a real good training camp. The
game was pretty cool. I can't get content though. But I thought it
was a real good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also hoped his 43-yard, over-the-shoulder reception
dispelled the belief he has questionable hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that a lot,'' Kelly said. ``That my hands were a flaw.
I heeded what people thought about me.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Soward's sick: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward did not practice
Tuesday because he had the flu.
</P>
<P>
   __ Arbet, Pierson out: Freshman cornerback Kevin Arbet, who
started the Hawaii game, has a badly sprained ankle and will likely
miss the San Diego State game. Freshman fullback Chad Pierson also
has an ankle sprain and is not expected to be available for San
Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Return to paradise: Hawaii has already made inquiries to USC
about returning to Honolulu for another game, perhaps in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   __ Players of the game: USC coaches selected offensive lineman
Jason Grain as the offensive player of the game. Cornerback Kris
Richard was the defensive player of the game. Kicker David Newbury
won the honor for special teams.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stat fix: After USC reviewed game films, wide receiver
Windrell Hayes was credited with six receptions. The postgame stats
in Hawaii gave him seven. His yardage total (80) remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   __ Touchdown total: USC's six rushing touchdowns were the most
by a Trojans team since they had six against Oregon State in 1976.

   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ before he'd quit.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley was more than just a great shot. He was sometimes
second-guessed for passing the ball instead of taking a shot
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a team beat, he'd quit shooting,'' Haley said.
``He'd give it to me or whoever hadn't scored that many points.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley was a gifted passer. ``He'd hit you in the head if
you were not prepared for it,''Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   Still others talk about how Bradley's back yard was the daily
gathering spot for kids from all over town. ``It didn't matter
where they came from as long as they were well-mannered,'' Bond
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when Bradley held a party at his home, he invited the
whole school instead of issuing invitations and risk leaving anyone
out.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is a perfect mix of his mother and father, Bond said.
From his father, he learned patience and a need for privacy. From
his mother, Bradley picked up nonstop energy.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the White Grill restaurant on Tuesday morning, Jack
Geiler, a resident for 74 years, looked a visitor in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   With all the trouble the country has had with President Clinton,
Bradley would be ``more like a god,'' Geiler said. ``You never hear
anybody say anything against him.''

CANALS OF SCOTTSDALE DEFEATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Scottsdale voters dashed developers' wishes Tuesday to
transform the Arizona Canal's south bank into a watery wonderland
in a surprise finish to a campaign in which backers outspent the
opponents 70-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were rejecting by a 54 percent to 46 percent margin plans
for the Canals of Scottsdale, a $653 million, 27-acre museum,
retail and entertainment complex downtown near Fashion Square that
was to be partially publicly funded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any paid volunteers. We simply had hard-core
volunteers who said, `We're taking our city back,' '' said Lois
Fitch of Save Old Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, who collected campaign funds by putting jars on the
counters of stores that would be wiped out by the development, had
said they were fighting to keep the soul of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Developers had pitched it as the best deal the city could
possibly make to clean up a deteriorating part of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised that the citizens couldn't see the advantage
of this, I think they thought it was a tax issue and it wasn't,''
said Stan Castleton, an Anaheim developer and a partner in the
project.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the project would have been paid for with sales
taxes collected in the development under a state theme park law
that Scottsdale would have been the only Arizona city to use.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout of about 31,221 was 27.4 percent, and at least 13,465
voters cast early ballots.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Canals project was heavily backed by the city's power
structure, including Mayor Sam Campana, and the defeat could pose a
problem for the next redevelopment plan the city has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 2, voters will decide whether the Ellman Cos.,
financially backed by Canals developer Excel Legacy Corp. of San
Diego, can also use a tax incentive to rebuild Los Arcos Mall as a
$624 million Phoenix Coyotes hockey arena, entertainment and
conference complex.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the Canals project, Great for Scottsdale, Great for
You!, gathered Tuesday at one of Scottsdale's swankiest new spots:
The Sanctuary nightclub that sits in the shadow of the Scottsdale
Galleria, the center of a years-long debate over downtown's
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   But they were a solemn crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't win the will of the people. It's a shame,'' said
Bill Heckman, campaign chairman. ``We offered a fantastic plan.
It's been rejected. We have no plan B.''
</P>
<P>
   An overhauled version of the Galleria _ remade into four museums
_ was slated as the centerpiece of the Canals project, which would
include about $200 million in public funding.
</P>
<P>
   The winners gathered at Madison's on Stetson, one of the 40
businesses that would have been wiped out by the Canals project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the citizens of Scottsdale could not be bought,''
crowed an exuberant Tom Silverman, a downtown hotel owner and a key
member of Save Old Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Chapparo, who owns a Sixth Avenue beauty salon that would
have been torn down, said, ``I have 10 employees. I just didn't
know where I was going, what I was going to do, and I am
thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   The election wound down last week with the developers'
announcement that Dan Harkins would locate a new and improved
version of the historic Cine Capri theater in the Canals project, a
plan that now goes back to the drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
   Also, opponents filed an eleventh-hour lawsuit by that raised
questions about the project.
</P>
<P>
   A group of downtown Scottsdale merchants claimed in the suit
filed Friday that the city violated city ordinances and state laws
when it expanded the boundaries of the redevelopment district that
includes their businesses in the Canals project.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue and Stetson Drive Merchants
Association were asking a judge to invalidate the boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Those opponents, including several downtown merchants organized
as Save Old Scottsdale, had argued that the plan would siphon
dollars from the state treasury and force out shopkeepers who have
added to the Western character of downtown Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they were outmatched by the developers. The
developers, led by Excel, gave at least $838,000 to the campaign
and were the sole contributors. In contrast, opponents raised about
$12,000 in individual contributions in the four months before the
election. &QL;

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ the first shot.
</P>
<P>
   There was a scuffle. A burst of gunfire. Panic. ``The race war
was on, and I was powerless to stop it,'' McCullough later said.
</P>
<P>
   Violence raged all night and through the next day. Angry whites
descended on the Greenwood district. The first fire broke out an
hour after midnight. By dawn white men filled cars that roared down
the streets, ``guns blazing indiscriminately,'' writes Ellsworth,
who is white.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. James Robertson dispatched the National Guard and declared
martial law. By noon all of Greenwood was in flames, including the
new Mount Zion Baptist Church, where armed blacks were barricaded.
One thousand surrounding homes, 31 restaurants, 24 groceries and
eight medical offices burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star sent a reporter as soon as the first
reports hit the wire services. ``Races at War,'' the newspaper's
early afternoon edition declared June 1, 1921. ``Death Toll is
50?''
</P>
<P>
   A later edition: ``Death Toll Reaches 74,'' nine whites and 65
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Star's final edition that day told of a city
``blood-drenched and blackened by incendiary fires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Major Charles W. Daley of the police force this afternoon
estimated the dead at 175. He believes a number of Negroes were
burned to death when their homes were swept by fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion over the casualty count persists.
</P>
<P>
   Official sources eventually set the death toll at 36. Local
history books have cited figures ranging from 33 to ``some nine
whites and 68 blacks.'' Several books on Tulsa history ignored the
riot altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth and others working with the riot commission now think
the toll may have reached 300. They base this on a variety of
incomplete records and unconfirmed reports. They are dealing with
nearly eight decades of hearsay and horror stories.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the days after the riot, the Tulsa World acknowledged
rumors of widespread carnage and cover-up:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who will always believe that truck loads of
Negro bodies were dumped into the Arkansas River or buried in a
mythical trench or piled into a building which was later set on
fire....There is not a shred of truth'' to the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: In the riot's wake, thousands of black
Tulsans were rounded up and interned at sites throughout the city,
ostensibly for their own safety. Countless others jammed into
trains or automobiles and fled for good.
</P>
<P>
   The black exodus included the family of Joyce Walker Hill, who
has lived in Kansas City, Kan., ever since. She was 11 when the
riot occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Her father's six-bedroom home was destroyed. Her mother was
seven months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the son her mother was carrying traveled to Tulsa
with Hill to attend a public meeting of the riot commission. ``I
wondered why it took so long to find out these things,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just never talked about it. All we knew is that the house
burned down. I guess my father thought that talking about it would
just frighten us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, the young man whose arrest sparked the melee, was said
to have moved to the Kansas City area, as well. The assault case
was dropped when alleged victim Page declined to press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Essie Beck, 85, eases herself into a Victorian chair beneath a
chandelier at the Greenwood Cultural Center. She gently sets her
cane against her thigh.
</P>
<P>
   The camcorder begins taping. Beck's testimony, along with
accounts of 64 other known survivors of the riot, will be reviewed
by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a little girl, I was frightened,'' Beck tells
interviewer Gates. ``We had to run to try to stay out of the way
(of the violence). We'd hide behind trees...hide behind gardenia
bushes, hide behind little rocks....
</P>
<P>
   ``There were airplanes in the sky that seemed to be shooting and
dropping things on the rooftops.... We were ducking and dodging to
get to the park. My mother was able to keep five children together.
Of course, we were crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Her account of aircraft is echoed by other survivors. Historian
Dick Warner says it is not known who manned the planes. Also
uncertain is whether they were attacking or just flying
reconnaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Beck recalls the fretful months that followed, when her family
lived in a Red Cross tent on the ashes of their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes, there were nightmares. Lots of nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinney Booker is 86.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and four brothers and sisters were up in the
attic,'' the retired English teacher says. ``We knew there was
shooting and killing going on outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard some men come into the house and say to my father,
`...Do you have a gun?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The next thing Booker says he heard were Papa's pleas _ ``Please
don't set my house on fire'' _ as he was taken away and led to an
internment camp.
</P>
<P>
   The intruders torched the place, anyway. Booker and his family
managed to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon as we got outside, my sister said to me _ she was 6 _
`Kinney, is the whole world on fire?' I said, `I don't know, baby,
but we're in lots of trouble.' That scene I'll remember forever.
Pretty horrible to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa's story isn't all horrible.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathetic whites, especially those in the Red Cross, fed and
dressed the wounds of black refugees. A white oil tycoon who
employed Booker's father as a driver helped reunite and shelter the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kinds of things help you understand that all white
people weren't evil,'' Booker says.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Greenwood proved resilient. Hundreds rebuilt, with
no help from the city. In fact, city officials tried to convert the
burned-out area into an industrial park. The Tulsa Tribune in 1921
reported that, because of the proposed building requirements, ``it
is believed impossible that the Negroes will again build homes
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greenwood district is still alive in 1999. Ironically, the
Tulsa Tribune is out of business.
</P>
<P>
   And the rest of the city is finally talking about an event that
past generations _ white and black _ declined to discuss aloud.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 the Tulsa Chamber of Commerce refused to publish a 50th
anniversary story about the riot. Author Ed Wheeler gave the
article to a regional magazine, Impact, co-owned by a black Tulsan
named Don Ross. According to Ross, ``both blacks and whites got on
my case for causing trouble. I had violated the conspiracy of
silence going on for 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, now a state representative, in 1996 drafted the bill
creating the riot commission. He says the response has been
``overwhelmingly wonderful.'' A story told only in whispers when he
was a Tulsa teen in the 1950s has drawn worldwide press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing else comes of this, the most laudable thing is that
we're willing to confront the past,'' he says. ``It was my
generation that had to tell the story.''

   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Most Americans know Bill Bradley as the
brainy East Coaster who attended Princeton, played for the New York
Knicks and represented New Jersey in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday Bradley returns to Missouri and the hometown he
left 38 years ago to launch a new phase in his uphill, but
unquestionably competitive, campaign for the presidency. The task:
Tell America who William Warren Bradley really is.
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople say Crystal City, a well-kept, tree-lined town of
4,000, about 30 miles south of St. Louis, is the perfect place to
do just that.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that Bradley, now 56, grew into his role as the
proverbial all-American, a real-life Jack Armstrong, who starred in
sports and academics at Crystal City High School and became a
legend that burns brightly to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he is more than the local kid who made good. He is the man
who became a Rhodes scholar, a best-selling author, a gold medal
winner in the Olympics and a three-term senator. Never once,
friends say, did he embarrass himself or the town he now frequently
mentions on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he learned here during his first 18 years he's never
forgotten,'' said Bob Freese, 63, who knows Bradley well. ``He has
a real fondness for this area. His foundations are here, and he's
never forgotten that.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents say they are not bothered by the notion that Bradley,
an only child, visits only sporadically these days. His father,
former president of the Crystal City State Bank, died in 1994 and
his mother, a strong-willed, energetic homemaker, passed on a year
later.
</P>
<P>
   Townspeople don't seem to mind that Bradley will benefit
politically by renewing his ties with Crystal City or the pivotal
swing state of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Friends point out that Bradley owns a 158-acre farm in town and
that the limestone family home on Taylor Avenue still has the
basketball hoop out back where Bradley honed his feathery jump
shot. The shooting stroke helped him average 35 points a game as a
high school senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame him one bit,'' said Larry Sabato, a University
of Virginia political scientist. ``George Bush Sr. was
simultaneously from Connecticut, his birthplace of Massachusetts
and from Texas. He had, like, five or six home states.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley critics exist. Edward Graham of nearby De Soto
recently wrote a scathing letter to the editor in the Jefferson
County Leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Bradley ever becomes president, I'll eat a taco shell
hat,'' Graham wrote. ``The local gush is nauseatingly mindless. The
editorial hype is pure tripe. Who is buying the high-dollar
consultant spin that Crystal City is the source of the values
Bradley holds today?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, returning to one's roots has become part of the theater
of presidential politics. Dwight Eisenhower had Abilene, Kan. Bill
Clinton spoke of Hope, Ark. And Kansan Bob Dole, of course, made
regular use of Russell to highlight his small-town roots.
</P>
<P>
   Most Crystal City residents give Bradley a pass. He did, after
all, move away from here after high school and made his career on
the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The main regret is that Democratic politicians in Missouri
chased Bradley out of the state in the late 1970s when he was
considering where to begin his political career. The Democrats
wanted Bradley to start small and work his way up. Bradley had
other ideas and opted for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost him,'' Freese said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history, and Bradley hopes to make some more as he
takes aim at Al Gore and seeks to become the first candidate to
defeat a sitting vice president for his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is scheduled to speak at noon Wednesday on the steps of
his old high school. The school band will play, and a third-grade
class will lead the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Then the assembly moves indoors to the old gymnasium that has
changed little since Bradley played. The wooden bleachers still
pull out from the wall, and the baskets swing down from the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Outside is a case that holds trophies from Bradley's basketball
exploits, including one commemorating a second-place finish in the
1961 state tournament. Alongside is Bradley's retired jersey _ a
white uniform with a red No. 52 outlined in black trim.
</P>
<P>
   In the gym, long-time friends will tell their best Bradley
stories.
</P>
<P>
   One will be Elmer Earl Smith, who taught Bradley physics and
chemistry in high school. Smith said he planned to recount how
Bradley, as Student Council president, once offered to help him
find the student who had stolen a chemistry exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `As president, I thought perhaps I should volunteer
to help you,' '' Smith recalled. The teacher wound up not needing
Bradley's help to find the thief.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the thing that amazed me,'' Smith said, ``was that at that
young age, he was willing to stick his neck out and really and
truly do what he thought the right thing was.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends recall how Bradley's mother, Susie, worked to keep their
only child from getting a big head. If he won a race, recalled
Hardeman Bond, Bradley's aunt, Susie would remind him that his
victory was due to his longer legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd tell him he had an unfair advantage, that he couldn't
help but win,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   His father, a staunch Republican, wanted Bradley to do more in
his life than just play basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are you going to get a real job?'' he once asked his son
after he had played a few years with the Knicks, Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Haley, Bradley's high-school basketball teammate, recalled
how Bradley worked on his jump shot. He would shoot 10 shots from
the corner, then move around the perimeter. He would have to hit 10
straight shots from each spot before he'd quit. MORE

SEVENTY-EIGHT YEARS LATER, TULSA RE-EXAMINES DEADLY RACE RIOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ Nobody knows how many died.
</P>
<P>
   Was it three dozen or 300?
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, when 35 blocks of a black district burned in what may
have been America's worst race riot, the shamed city of Tulsa
settled on the lower body count. Today, some people re-examining
the riot lean toward the higher.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa is looking back, with pained expressions, at that week in
which hatred, horror and denial overtook a booming oil town.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-member Tulsa Race Riot Commission, formed by the state of
Oklahoma, is fielding testimonials from dozens of persons who fled
the fires that wiped out what Booker T. Washington called the Negro
Wall Street, Tulsa's vibrant Greenwood district.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Eddy, 88, stands in the sunshine at the paupers' section
of Oaklawn Cemetery. He sweeps his arm across an expanse of green.
This is where he saw the hole, the retired engineer says. And over
there, the big crates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was three days after the riot. A hot day, like today,''
says Eddy, who was 10 at the time. ``My cousin and I were walking
to my aunt's house. Right in through here, we saw these big crates.
They were randomly spaced; I'd say six or seven....
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised the lid of the first box and saw three bodies
inside. We went to the next and saw four bodies. They were black
men.''
</P>
<P>
   For 78 years, Eddy, a white man, told his story to friends and
family. But the Tulsa establishment would hear none of it.
Schoolteachers rarely even mentioned the riot, much less the rumors
of mass graves or of black corpses supposedly stacked on trucks.
``It was a hush-hush deal,'' Eddy says.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. As Eddy paces through the cemetery, Eddie Faye Gates
of the Race Riot Commission follows closely to catch every word.
Another volunteer records Eddy on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   He continues:
</P>
<P>
   The largest crate was the size of an upright piano. Eddy and his
cousin tried to look inside, but a worker told them to beat it. So
the boys watched from behind a fence as laborers continued to dig
the hole. After a few minutes the boys walked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to take this episode out of the category of something
to be ashamed of, and to face it, and to see it as a lesson for us
all,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions the commission hopes to answer:
</P>
<P>
   Who was responsible for the riot? A grand jury in 1921 pinned
blame on black militants and a lethargic police force. Today the
evidence points to trigger-happy white mobs, even the local power
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Are the black survivors who rebuilt their community entitled to
financial reparation?
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, how many died?
</P>
<P>
   That question brought state archaeologist Bob Brooks to Oaklawn
Cemetery earlier this summer. Using three electronic detection
devices, Brooks scanned the ground where Eddy claimed to have seen
the big crates.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the detectors picked up something. Four to 6 feet deep.
Below an unmarked patch of grass covering 1,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say they're individuals,'' Brooks said. ``But
something's down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pending approval from the city, excavation of the site could
begin before 1999 ends.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting, historians say, that the city's soul-searching
would come at the close of a century in which Tulsa became Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900 it was a ramshackle village of only 1,340 residents.
They called it Tulsey town. But the discovery of oil in 1901
changed everything. The population erupted to more than 18,000 by
1910 and nearly 75,000 by 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma became a state in 1907, a ``promised land'' for whites
and blacks alike. But lawmakers immediately decreed that the races
be segregated. For Tulsa, that meant blacks would shop, go to
school and live in the district just north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   For a time both races prospered. Oil-rich Tulsa touted one of
the highest per-capita incomes in the nation. And the Greenwood
district _ Little Africa, as whites dubbed it _ more than held its
own. Its storefronts, law firms, theaters and clubs were run by
African-Americans serving African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Rowland lived there.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1920s, he dropped out of high school to shine the
shoes of white men downtown, where the tips were known to be
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   On May 30, 1921, Rowland, 19, left his shoeshine stand to go to
a rest room for blacks on the top floor of the Drexel Building. A
white girl, Sarah Page, 17, operated the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   What happened between them still is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ellsworth, author of Death In a Promised Land: The Tulsa
Race Riot of 1921, cites accounts suggesting that Rowland probably
stumbled or stepped on Page's foot. Police thought otherwise and
arrested him for attempting to assault Page.
</P>
<P>
   The front page of the May 31 Tulsa Tribune carried the headline
``Nab Negro for Attacking Girl in Elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   This article and a mysterious back-page editorial in the late
edition, which allegedly called for a lynching, have become central
to the riot probe. Both were neatly torn out before the Tribune
microfilmed its back issues for posterity. Researchers uncovered
the front-page story years ago, but they never found the
inflammatory editorial, if one existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Holy Grail of the race riot,'' says Heath Henry,
Tulsa Historical Society archivist.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the afternoon paper hit the streets, a white mob
showed up at the courthouse, where Rowland was held. Turn him over,
they said. Sheriff Willard McCullough refused.
</P>
<P>
   Black residents gathered on Greenwood Avenue to discuss how they
might protect Rowland. They armed themselves. They, too, appeared
at the courthouse. A black police officer, Barney Cleaver, assured
them that Rowland was safe. Go on home, he said. And for a moment,
the crowd began to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows who fired the first shot. MORE

GAGNE IS STELLAR IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Out of the black hole of the Dodgers minor-league system
came a bright light Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Gagne, a 23-year-old right-hander from Double-A San
Antonio, had a major-league debut that certainly will be remembered
long after the Dodgers' 2-1 loss to the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 13,644 at Pro Player Stadium witnessed a sterling
performance that included six scoreless innings and just one walk.
But in a season in which the Dodgers farm system has been ridiculed
repeatedly for losing records and a lack of prospects, Gagne
represented much more than one great night.
</P>
<P>
   He is a symbol of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell those guys down there that I am proof that you
can get here,'' said Gagne, who will start Sunday against the New
York Mets. ``A lot of people have said things about the minor
leagues, but there are plenty of guys who can play. They can look
at this and know there is a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne overcame a one hour and 26 minute rain delay at the start
with a composure that teammate Ismael Valdes did not have the night
before. Gagne gave up just two singles and did not allow a batter
to reach second. Four of his eight strikeouts came on called third
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne even got a single in his first major-league at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first batter, I was totally comfortable,'' Gagne
said. ``I was much more nervous waiting around for the game to
start than I was out on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne said he could have pitched longer, but manager Davey
Johnson wanted him to go out on a positive note.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne knew, perhaps better than anyone, that he was in for a
tough night against Marlins' starter Ryan Dempster. They were
roommates on the 1993 Canadian Junior National Team. Tuesday night
marked the first time since July 28, 1973 that two Canadians
started against each other in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close then, but we haven't stayed in close touch,''
Gagne said. ``That's how it is in baseball. But Ryan is still the
same tough pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempster allowed four hits in seven innings. The Dodgers had
runners aboard in the first five innings but stranded nine runners
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne and Dempster were gone by the time Florida scored two runs
in the bottom of the eighth against Matt Herges (0-1). The Marlins
scored their first run on a one-out RBI triple by Alex Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   After Herges struck out Mark Kotsay for the second out, Kevin
Millar grounded off Eric Karros' glove at first for an error to
score Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got a run in the ninth on an RBI pinch single by
Devon White, but that was it. The Dodgers have now dropped two to
the Marlins after sweeping the Cubs in Chicago. It didn't matter.
The Dodgers postgame clubhouse was electric because of Gagne's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Gagne, Mike Judd and Robinson Checo were
question marks in the minors. Now, they are considered pitchers who
can push for starting spots in next year's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what we have been trying to build all season,''
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``You need to have flexibility.
The only way to have that is develop players.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne has made the biggest impression. He was the Texas League
Pitcher of the Year with a 12-4 record and 2.63 ERA. He led the
league with 185 strikeouts, was second in ERA and third in
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew before tonight that I could get out major-league
hitters,'' Gagne said. ``I have a lot of confidence and this was my
chance. It was a great night.''

HANDICAPPING NFL RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picking the eventual Super Bowl champion is easier than a Falcon
hailing a hooker in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   First you eliminate all teams that have never been to a Super
Bowl. First-timers won three straight between 1984 and 1986 (49ers,
Bears, Giants), but none since. Then you eliminate all teams that
have never won a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Then you get rid of all teams that have changed cities in the
last two decade (four of them), have new coaches (six of them), are
employing suspect quarterbacks (most of them), or have 10 or more
players with rap sheets.
</P>
<P>
   If you have no teams left over at this point, you begin
preparing for the basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully, there hasn't been a surprise winner of the Super
Bowl since Bill Parcells' second New York Giants team, and in
hindsight, it doesn't seem surprising. We know more about Parcells
and the Buffalo Bills now than we did in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And when one factors in the importance of quarterbacks to Super
Bowl champs, and the lack of good quarterbacks in the league today,
the NFL has fewer candidates than the Republicans. It's quarterback
theories like this which keep Dan Marino and Miami a candidate each
year, despite the city having hosted three Super Bowls since the
Dolphins' last appearance (1985).
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd love a real surprise NFL champ, or a people's
champ. Maybe an ugly-looking team that wins games with defense
(Tampa Bay), or a team without stars (N.Y. Giants), or a team that
dares to be different (Jacksonville).
</P>
<P>
   All one can predict about the NFL right now is that very little
can be predicted. I have 31 teams and 31 questions, 32 if you
include when L.A. will get an expansion team, 2003 or 3002.
</P>
<P>
   Divisionally-speaking, here come the questions and brave, naive
answers:
</P>
<P>
   NFC West questions:
</P>
<P>
   Can Atlanta's Chris Chandler stay healthy? Did New Orleans'
Ricky Williams sign a bad contract? Will the Rams' Torry Holt be
rookie of the year? Can George Seifert rebuild Carolina in a year
and embarrass the 49ers in the process?
</P>
<P>
   Answers:
</P>
<P>
   In assessing the Dirty Birds, please invoke the law of averages.
Chandler is even money to break something, and the Falcs won nine
games by eight points or less last season. That won't happen again.
Until Steve Young retires, the 49ers begin each season the team to
beat.
</P>
<P>
   Williams signed a weird contract, but his biggest mistake
(besides that wedding gown in ESPN Magazine) was being drafted by a
team with two Billy Joes at quarterback. Holt could be this
season's Randy Moss if he had someone to throw him the ball.
Seifert will find it was easier inheriting a team with Super Bowl
talent than a four-year-old expansion team with old players.
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: Frisco.
</P>
<P>
   NFC East questions:
</P>
<P>
   If there's a Mets-Yankees World Series and a Giants-Jets Super
Bowl, will New Yorkers secede from the union in celebration of its
greatness? Will Dallas' Michael Irvin be a character witness at
Jerry Jones' trial for leaving the scene of an accident? Will
Washington's Brad Johnson turn Viking fans seven shades of purple?
Is Arizona's Jake Plummer the new Montana? Will the Eagles be
demoted to the World League?
</P>
<P>
   Answers:
</P>
<P>
   The givens here are that the Cowboys won't repeat last year's
trifecta of losses to the Raiders, Bears and Saints; the Redskins
will be better with Johnson; Plummer won't lead the Cards to seven
wins by three points of
</P>
<P>
   or less like he did last year; and Andy Reid will be fired
before most people realize he's the Eagles coach.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 season represents the Cowboys' last hurrah. The Giants
may be the most non-descript team in the league, and for some
reason, that's appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: Dallas. Wild card: New York.
</P>
<P>
   NFC Central questions:
</P>
<P>
   Will Jeff George ruin the Vikes through osmosis? Will an exodus
of talent send the Pack back to the pack? Can Tampa Bay find an
offense its defense can be proud of? Will Barry Sanders stay in
London and play in the World League? Will Bears fans be patient
with Cade McNown?
</P>
<P>
   Answers:
</P>
<P>
   Yes, no, yes, no, maybe. Chalk me up as a Viking doubter on the
strength of Randall Cunningham not repeating his
I-sold-my-soul-to-the-devil season and the George virus infecting
the franchise. Speaking of unholy pacts, is there a luckier person
in football than Packers coach Ray
``happiness-is-seeing-Philly-hit-by-nukes'' Rhodes?
</P>
<P>
   If Cunningham can mount a stunning comeback, then there's hope
for Trent Dilfer, who is supported by good rushing and defense. The
only question in Detroit is when Bobby Ross gets fired, week eight
or week 16. Chicagoans are reminded it took McNown a season-plus to
hit his stride at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: Green Bay. Wild cards: Minnesota, Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   AFC Central questions:
</P>
<P>
   Would Jacksonville's Mark Brunell be the consensus league MVP if
he faced his defense twice a season? Will Steelers' QB Kordell
Stewart star in the sequel to The Crying Game? Will Art Modell dare
make the Ravens' Nov.7 road trip to Cleveland? Will the Tennessee
Titans invoke memories of the New York Titans? Is Cincinnati coach
Bruce Coslet the Marion Campbell of the '90s?
</P>
<P>
   Answers:
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville would clinch the division by November 1st if not
for 10 divisional games and the spectre of the Steelers getting a
comeback year out of Kordell and Jerome Bettis. Don't bet against
the Browns winning more games than the Ravens, who believe they can
rebuild around QB flops Scott Mitchell and Tony Banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were known as the Titans their first three seasons. At
least New York is big; what exactly is the relevance of Titans in
Tennessee? Campbell was 17-51 in two separate stints as the Falcons
head coach. Coslet's career record is 43-62. How do guys like this
keep their jobs?
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   AFC East questions:
</P>
<P>
   Are we really supposed to believe the Jets are Super Bowl
timber? Does Miami's Tony Martin send his shirts to be, uhh, dry
cleaned? When will Buffalo trade Rob Johnson? Does Indianapolis
deserve a quarterback as good as Peyton Manning? Will Bob Kraft
stop counting his stadium money long enough to fire Pete Carroll?
</P>
<P>
   Answers:
</P>
<P>
   The Jets seem to have the best package, but we've never seen a
Parcells team run from the front of the pack. It's safe to say
Jimmy Johnson regrets taking the Miami job and being stuck with a
legendary quarterback who doesn't fit his style. Anything short of
a Super Bowl will send Marino to co-star in the next Ace Ventura
sequel, and Johnson back to his fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo gets kudos for having two capable starting quarterbacks
at a time when one is never enough. But they'll likely trade the
ex-Trojan quarterback if they get a good offer. Here's the real AFC
East conundrum: In a division with quarterbacks like Drew Bledsoe,
Manning, Marino, Doug Flutie and Johnson, we're to believe Vinny
Testaverde will win the division?
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: N.Y. Jets. Wild cards: Miami, Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   AFC West questions:
</P>
<P>
   Did Mike Shanahan take more out of his Raiders experience than
anyone suspected? Aren't the Chiefs acting more like the Raiders
than the Raiders? Does Mike Holmgren really think he's going to win
in Seattle with Jon Kitna? Did Mike Riley really think coaching the
Chargers was a step up from Oregon State? Does Al Davis really
believe anyone in California cares where his Raiders play?
</P>
<P>
   Answers:
</P>
<P>
   In the next episode of Star Wars, Shanahan will play the Anakin
Skywalker-Darth Vader character. Dumping on Bubby Brister the way
he did indicates Davis didn't give Shanahan enough time to develop
his dark side. The Broncos are still good enough to win this
division with any quarterback. The Chiefs began to cannibalize
themselves last season. Ex-Raider aide Gunther Cunningham is a good
man, but he inherited a team in descent.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren will build his Seahawk dynasty via defense and Ricky
Watters, especially now that he's dumped Joey Galloway. Holmgren
went 9-7 in his first three seasons as Packers head coach. Riley
obviously misjudged his career: If he goes 6-5 in Corvallis, he's a
hero. If he goes 4-12 in San Diego, he's fired.
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: Denver. Wild card: Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Raiders are concerned, I urge them to return to
L.A. and agree to play in a new stadium in Carson. Because if ever
a team was born to play on a toxic landfill, it's the Raiders.

FALK LANDS TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The team that could justify stamping Murphy's Law
on its letterhead is about to boldly heckle its own standard of
doom.
</P>
<P>
   For the Los Angeles Clippers, today figures to be a bit dicier
than a bad hair day.
</P>
<P>
   Today is when David Falk, the Lex Luthor of player agents, lands
in L.A. for his dreaded date with Clips owner Donald T. Sterling.
They are scheduled to meet at a neutral site. Falk is expected to
ask Sterling to extend the contract of Maurice Taylor, Falk's
newest big-name client, for the NBA maximum of $70.9 million over
six years.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling is expected to bite his lower lip, click his heels, and
say no.
</P>
<P>
   Falk, according to sources who have seen the dailies, will ask
the Clippers to trade Taylor, one of the league's coveted, young
power forwards.
</P>
<P>
   Or else.
</P>
<P>
   The team's alternative would be to refuse, force Taylor to play
for them this season (the last on his three-year contract), then
risk losing him without compensation to free agency.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the lesser of two evils looming, the Clippers may
investigate the market and attempt to deal Taylor. Taylor will be
paid ``just $1.367 million this season, so in order to bring back
any ballpark value (go ahead and exhale), Falk may be needed to
help broker a more sophisticated deal.
</P>
<P>
   This still would be considered a defeat for the franchise, but
with Sterling unwilling to open up his checkbook and let the good
times roll, it could be time for the team's basketball-acquisitions
department to cut its losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clipper good (and unrelated) news could involve the
signing-and-trading of in-limbo point guard Sherman Douglas, who
just spent one overweight-and-injury-plagued season in L.A. But
Indiana Pacers coach Larry Bird is a Douglas fan (going back to
Sherm's days in Boston), and wouldn't argue if the team moved one
of his point guards Mark Jackson or Travis Best to Toronto to get
Douglas. The Raptors, in turn, would send power forward/center
Kevin Willis to the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers would complete the circle by sending Douglas, who
seems to inspire very little interest for an L.A. encore from Clips
officials, to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? According to a league source, new Raptor Antonio
Davis is an old Pacer, and is encouraging his new team to insist
upon acquiring Jackson rather than Best from the Pacers. But the
Pacers, the source said, would rather unload Best. That, as they
say around NBA campfires, could be a deal-buster, the Best-case
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   In Willis, the Clippers could have an aggressive, 7-foot veteran
(he turned 37 years old two days ago). In a perfect world, he would
replace the departed Lorenzen Wright as the insurance policy for
young center Michael Olowokandi and a spot replacement for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But if Taylor is moved, Willis would have an opportunity to suit
up with the Clips and be a frequent offensive option something he
has been accused of not minding.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING AN EARLY CAMP
</P>
<P>
   After losing 41 of 50 games last season, the Clippers and Coach
Chris Ford decided that the best way to prepare for next month's
training camp is to have a voluntary pre-training camp.
</P>
<P>
   So on Tuesday morning, five Clippers showed up at the Veteran's
Park SportsComplex gym for brtually repetitive shooting and
footwork drills.
</P>
<P>
   The roll call: Prized rookie Lamar Odom, point guard Troy
Hudson, guard Charles Smith, power forward Brian Skinner and backup
center Keith Closs.

EDITORIAL: A BOLD RULING IN ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 8,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Supreme Court acted bravely and correctly Monday in
banning the Shin Bet security service from using physical coercion
to extract information from terrorism suspects. The judges
acknowledged that their ruling might make it more difficult for the
authorities to prevent and combat terror. But they wisely gave
precedence to the principles that distinguish Israel from most of
its Mideast neighbors, mainly the rule of law and respect for human
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   The court specifically banned certain interrogation techniques,
all of them repugnant. They include violent shaking, which causes
the head to whip back and forth, risking grave injury, as well as
shackling prisoners in painful positions and denying them sleep for
long periods. The judges acknowledged that Israeli courts might
choose not to punish Shin Bet agents for using coercion in
emergency situations. But the judges ruled that even in such
situations, coercion would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   If it wished, Israel's parliament could negate the court's
ruling by passing new legislation specifically giving Shin Bet the
authority to use such techniques. Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
already suggested he wants to find a way to facilitate
interrogations in emergency situations. But legislators should let
the court's decision stand. The forms of interrogation it prohibits
are, as the judges noted, excessive and unjustified. Coercion
sometimes produces useful leads. But it can also produce unreliable
information as detainees seek to avoid further pain by offering
whatever answers they think their questioners want.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of a terrorism threat unequaled in any other
democracy, Israeli courts long gave the security service wide
latitude to extract information by physically coercive methods. In
1987 a government commission officially endorsed this kind of
interrogation, and the ruling has been renewed repeatedly since
then. But more recently political opinion has begun to change, and
Monday's court ruling was warmly welcomed by such leading figures
as Yossi Beilin, the current justice minister, and Dan Meridor, who
held that job in the early 1990s under Yitzhak Shamir.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been surrounded by enemies and threatened by terror
since its birth. In the eyes of its founding generation, those
conditions amply justified extraordinary methods like violent
interrogation. But things have begun to change. Israel has peace
treaties with Egypt and Jordan and is again engaged in serious
negotiations with the Palestinians. In tandem with these changes,
Israel has more leeway to embrace the legal and human rights
standards of less threatened democracies. Monday's ruling marks a
healthy step in that direction.

EDITORIAL: EAST TIMOR UNDER SIEGE 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 8,
1999:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a referendum with nearly 100 percent turnout, East
Timor's voters overwhelmingly supported independence from
Indonesia. Now rampaging militias, with the backing and apparent
complicity of Indonesia's army, are taking revenge against the
inhabitants of this unlucky territory. They have set East Timor on
fire _ murdering residents and driving tens of thousands of people
to neighboring West Timor. Unfortunately, the proposals coming from
Jakarta to stop the terror are less than reassuring. The U.N.
Security Council should immediately endorse Australia's attempts to
assemble a quick-reaction international peacekeeping force, and
countries with economic influence should use it to press Indonesia
to end the violence now or let the peacekeepers in.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, after Portugal withdrew from its colony of East Timor,
Indonesia brutally invaded. Its annexation, carried out with the
acquiescence of the United States and Australia, led to the deaths
of 200,000 Timorese, nearly one in three residents.
</P>
<P>
   But East Timor provided huge international headaches for the
dictatorship of President Suharto. His successor, B.J. Habibie,
decided to offer East Timor a plan for autonomy inside Indonesia.
If Timorese voters rejected it, then Indonesia would pull out and
East Timor would become independent. Despite growing violence by
anti-independence militias, the U.N. agreed in May that if East
Timor chose independence, Indonesia would withdraw its troops and
the U.N. would take over security in the region _ but only well
after a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's military and millions of nationalists deeply resent
the offer of independence, and worry that it could encourage
separatist movements in other regions. What East Timor is suffering
is not chaos but an organized rampage by the militias, as some of
the more than 15,000 Indonesian troops there stand by and even
participate. The violence is very likely being coordinated by
military men in Jakarta. Indonesia's government insists that it can
solve the problem without international help, and has declared
martial law. But Indonesia's military is the problem, not the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Although Australia is now rightly assembling a peacekeeping
force, the U.N. Security Council has announced that it will not
endorse it without Indonesia's agreement. Getting Jakarta's consent
will require strong and immediate pressure, especially from the
United States, Australia _ which has strong ties to Indonesia's
military _ and Japan, a large donor of economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   All three nations should announce that they are cutting off all
military aid and sales. They, and the international banks, should
also stop all but humanitarian loans and economic aid. America
should give the peacekeeping mission a strong endorsement. An
international force is clearly the last resort, to be tried only if
Habibie and Indonesia's military leader, Gen. Wiranto, will not
stop the violence. But a united, powerful threat from abroad is
likely needed to persuade them to end the killings.

EDITORIAL: THE CISNEROS PLEA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, September
8:
</P>
<P>
   It was reasonable for Attorney General Janet Reno to recommend
that an independent counsel investigate whether former Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros lied to federal agents
conducting a background check in his confirmation process in 1993.
Now the expensive, overly protracted investigation has ended in a
negotiated wrist-slap for Cisneros. That seems an appropriate
outcome for a case in which a Cabinet officer had clearly erred but
the prosecution was apparently unable to prove all its charges.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of jury selection Tuesday, Cisneros reached
agreement with independent counsel David Barrett to plead guilty to
one misdemeanor count of making a false statement to Federal Bureau
of Investigation agents. Cisneros will pay a $10,000 fine but faces
no jail time and no probation. He was accused of lying to FBI
agents about how much money he had given to a former mistress after
their affair in the late 1980s became public.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett had obtained an indictment against Cisneros on 18 felony
counts of conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of justice.
But his case suffered from the fact that his star witness, Linda
Jones, the former mistress, is serving a 42-month federal sentence
for fraud and money-laundering in a separate case. She had hoped to
reduce her jail time by testifying against Cisneros. But the
prosecutors would have had a hard time presenting her as a credible
witness since she had repeatedly lied about altering secret tapes
she made of telephone conversations with Cisneros that were a
crucial part of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, public officials cannot be permitted to lie in background
investigations, and Cisneros has now acknowledged wrongdoing. That
may be the one lesson to be drawn from a case that should have been
settled in less than the four years it took.

TIME TO PULL PLUG ON WOODY ... AND LOU, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Despite the fact that they are 56-year-old natives of
Florida who played in World Series and were Yankees general
managers ousted by George Steinbrenner, Lou Piniella and Woody
Woodward are not twins separated at birth.
</P>
<P>
   But after seven years together as baseball commanders of the
Seattle Mariners, it has become difficult to distinguish which of
them gets the credit and which gets the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Though they long have been friends and colleagues, in recent
times they have quietly suggested that the other is more
responsible for the club's dearth of quality pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella is irked by criticism that he's hard on young pitchers,
claiming he hasn't been given enough major league arms. Woodward is
persuaded that the talent has been sufficient, but the pitchers
have been underused or unappreciated, as evidenced by the success
of so many after leaving Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they can agree on privately is that they've been
stymied by an ownership largely unwilling to provide resources to
compete at baseball's top level.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ownership, the manager or the general manager has had
the greater role in Mariners travails, what is indisputable is
that, despite the club's prominence in local sporting culture, it
has won more than 85 games in a season only once in the seven-year
regime of Woodward and Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's 11-year term is the longest among current major
league GMs. The tandem tenure with Piniella is exceeded only by GM
John Schuerholz and manager Bobby Cox with the Braves and GM John
Hart and manager Mike Hargrove with the Indians _ clubs with
considerably more to show for themselves this decade, even before a
possible World Series meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, meanwhile, have won one playoff game since '95 and
are going nowhere next month.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989 under Woodward (he arrived at midseason of 1988), the
Mariners have won 49 percent of their games. Piniella is at 52
percent since his appointment in '93 _ not bad by major league
standards, but weak considering the team's company.
</P>
<P>
   Only after baseball subdivided in 1994 to provide the Mariners
with just three mostly average rivals in the American League West
did the club win division titles, in 1995 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   Results in '98 and so far in '99 have amounted to a squandering
of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The prime culprit: A failure to develop, keep or acquire
pitching sufficient for contention.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the failure is the move from the Kingdome to the
Guilty Pleasure, a new ballpark friendliest to the aspect of
baseball where the Mariners historically have been poorest.
</P>
<P>
   The decade of pitching flops and this season's abrupt
reinvestment in arms for the new ballpark mandate more switches
this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners should begin with a new manager and general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners need baseball leadership with some history and
touch with pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Though the club's sudden stockpiling of young arms has turned
the season into one long audition _ a club-record 27 pitchers used,
including 14 rookies, with more to come _ the sudden overload isn't
as impressive as it looks, for two reasons:
</P>
<P>
   -- No pitcher from the farm system has developed into a
significant contributor in Seattle since Erik Hanson (1988-93);
</P>
<P>
   -- Other than being forced to deal superstars Ken Griffey Jr. or
Alex Rodriguez, the Mariners have few position players at any level
to fill holes created by the trades for pitching or losses from
attrition. That means they will have to trade pitching for
pitching, because the free-agent market this off-season is thin.
</P>
<P>
   Think about this: The Mariners last week had to bring back Mike
Blowers, cut from his Japanese team, to play first base _ the
eighth player to do so since David Segui's July trade, prompting
more thoughts of Abbott &AMP; Costello routines instead of wild-card
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise storehouse is depleted, because so many trades
have failed to fill voids, while creating their own.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's losing record when it comes to pitching deals and
Piniella's inability to bring out much from young or average
pitchers have left the Mariners dealing from weakness as the club
approaches the latest pivot point in club history _ the attempt
this winter to keep Junior and A-Rod in Seattle long-term.
</P>
<P>
   Trading either or both superstars becomes a stronger temptation
for a club in need of multiple fixes. The problem is that such a
deal means sacrificing either the greatest player of his era in
Griffey, or Rodriguez, perhaps baseball's glamor answer to Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   By this off-season, the team can't get well enough fast enough
to make much more than promises to the two stars. And failure to
resolve the Griffey and Rodriguez situations by Opening Day 2000
will cast a bleakness over the season far worse than the
debilitating Randy Johnson trade watch of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and his top aide, vice-president of player development
Roger Jongewaard, have been solid spotters of young pitching
talent. But a glance around the major leagues reveals many of them
are pitching respectably elsewhere: Dave Burba, Shawn Estes, Mike
Hampton, Matt Mantei, Joe Mays, Jim Mecir, Jeff Nelson, Ron Villone
... the list is long and painfully familiar to Mariners fans.
</P>
<P>
   Over the holiday weekend, Boston reliever Derek Lowe put up two
saves against the Mariners, while catcher Jason Varitek homered
three times as the wild card-leading Red Sox won three of four
games. They were traded from Seattle in July 1997, for much
lamented relief pitcher Heathcliff Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the veterans from outside the organization whose
stays in Seattle ended for reasons other than being a decent major
league pitcher: Mike Jackson, Sterling Hitchcock, Andy Benes, Terry
Mulholland, Omar Olivares, Tim Belcher. They remain solid
contributors, the kind so long missing here that the Mariners this
season were forced to put the bulk of their starting rotation upon
three rookies.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, all teams have former players who flourish
elsewhere. Some amount of baseball success can be attributed to
right place, right time, or just plain luck, as opposed to
managerial brilliance or talent-sniffing acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the talent drain was not the responsibility of Woodward
and Piniella, but budget decisions from ownerships petrified by
baseball's economics.
</P>
<P>
   Well-funded teams such as the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers and Braves
can afford to squander talent occasionally because the cupboard is
plentiful. But for most of their 23 years, the Mariners have posed
themselves as a have-not, usually surrendering their top homegrown
talent to richer clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, despite an impressive fan base and a lucrative new
park, trades this season have unloaded so much salary that the
current payroll value is under $40 million, well into the bottom
half of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, spending on player salaries is no guarantee of a
championship, as flops this season by the Dodgers, Angels, Orioles
and Rockies attest. But the old bromide still prevails _ not
spending heavily virtually guarantees no championship. Remember,
this year's low-budget darlings, the A's and Reds, haven't won
anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners have spent money, it hasn't been done wisely.
The nadir of the Woodward-Piniella regime was last year's bullpen,
which had the AL's highest payroll and its highest earned-run
average, and became a national baseball joke. To improve the 'pen
this year, more resources were exhausted, and it's still
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Mariners have had their No. 1 starter go
haywire in three of the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Johnson was lost for much of the year with a back
injury. In 1998, it was his head. The decision not to lock him up
with a long-term deal distracted The Big Unit into an 8-10 record
before he was traded to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Jeff Fassero flopped, a victim of elbow surgery and
a contract-year brain cramp. Part of Fassero's trouble that
preceded his waiver was, in his own words, a fear of failing to
fill Johnson's role as the ace _ yet another casualty of the Big
Unit botch.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mariners bosses are rightfully proud of the performance
of the players acquired for Johnson, the fact is they still don't
have a proven No. 1 pitcher, and probably won't unless they trade
Griffey or Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   In the Johnson mess and some other pitching failures, Piniella
has been as much victim as perpetrator. And this year, if he had
full seasons from Rodriguez, Carlos Guillen, Jay Buhner, Butch
Henry, Mark Leiter and Paul Abbott, the Mariners would be much
closer in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what team doesn't have injuries? And what divine
baseball grace says the Mariners deserved improbably creditable
years from rookie starters Freddy Garcia, John Halama and Gil
Meche?
</P>
<P>
   They all came to Seattle as almost ready-made major leaguers.
Will they stay that way?
</P>
<P>
   That is the ultimate question dictating Piniella's fate. He's on
his fourth pitching coach in seven years, having flailed almost
helplessly trying to make average pitchers out of Ken Cloude, Bob
Wolcott, Dave Fleming, Salomon Torres and a host of other
youngsters who have flickered in Seattle, then flamed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw strikes,'' Piniella always demands. Well, no kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Piniella's umpire outbursts that are so ejectibly amusing also
reflect much of the way he works with his pitchers _ emotionally,
not analytically. Too many good arms have come and gone through the
organization to suggest it's merely coincidence that none have
flourished here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the club's sudden investment in pitching, and the good
fortune of three talented rookies, the staff ERA remains the worst
in the AL, as well as club history. Lately, production from the
cannibalized offense has slumped.
</P>
<P>
   This call for big change is not made easily. Piniella and
Woodward aren't dumber now than when they were hailed in 1995. A
champion as player and manager, Piniella has more than 1,000 career
victories with three clubs, handles well the difficult tasks of
managing the clubhouse and the media and remains a popular figure
here for many.
</P>
<P>
   The travails of other top managers such as Davey Johnson, Jim
Leyland and Tony La Russa suggest again there is no formula, system
or personality type that assures managerial success.
</P>
<P>
   But Piniella's contemptuous impatience and volatility with
youngsters, and his record with pitching, are of little virtue
where the franchise has chosen to live: in a vast, pitcher-friendly
ballpark that was built at extraordinary cost based on owner
promises of contention _ not auditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome expectations _ it's a good thing,'' said Piniella
recently. ``This is a baseball town now.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Woodward can be proud of their roles in making it such.
</P>
<P>
   But a two-season flop and a seven-season failure to find,
develop and keep good pitching make Piniella and Woodward, with a
dubious assist from ownership, a baseball version of the Kingdome _
good for the time, and a victim of change.

SEGUI'S FEELINGS FOR M'S STILL RUN DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Since trading David Segui, the Mariners have tried
eight different players at first base. For temporary replacements,
they have turned to regular catcher Dan Wilson, second baseman
David Bell and right fielder Jay Buhner. Privately, they admit to a
serious need at the position.
</P>
<P>
   How about David Segui?
</P>
<P>
   He's a free agent at the end of the season _ and amenable to the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, in town for the first time since his July 28 trade to
Toronto, turned pensive when the subject was broached before
Tuesday night's game at Safeco Field. He spoke slowly and quietly,
carefully measuring each word. He talked about loyalty to the Blue
Jays, while at the same time admitting to deep, emotional ties to
the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been traded before, but it's never been as hard as it has
been here,'' said Segui, now with his fifth big league team.
``Toronto has first crack, but Seattle is a very close second, if
they're interested. I love playing for Lou (Piniella). I feel like
part of the city and the community. I'm still baffled why we didn't
get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners traded Segui for then-minor league relievers Tom
Davey and Steve Sinclair. The team said the reasons for the deal
were: 1) the club had an obvious need for pitching help; and 2)
Segui appeared difficult to re-sign in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the veteran player said the only thing he was pushing
hard for was a contract extension covering four years, and he might
have considered taking less. In four years, Segui, 32, plans to
retire and be a full-time parent to his two young kids in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to sign a three-year deal and have to find
another team for one year,'' he said. ``My dad finished his career
with the Mariners and I wanted to do the same. I had valid reasons
for a four-year deal. But three would have been OK.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Mariners apparently were willing to make a fourth
year possible if Segui met certain playing time criteria, according
to a source.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners wouldn't comment on Segui, but don't appear to be
interested in reacquiring him.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, who maintains a Seattle residence, says Mariners fans
have treated him better than anyone else. He received countless
letters from them after the trade. People stopped him on the street
Tuesday to tell him they missed him. Signs at Safeco Field Tuesday
night offered similar messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as players, really appreciate that,'' he said. ``We're
human beings. It's easy to forget that. My time in Seattle was all
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   REINFORCEMENTS: With Class AAA Tacoma finishing its season
Monday, the Mariners called up three more players Tuesday, pitchers
Brett Hinchliffe and Sinclair and outfielder Shane Monahan. All
were with the M's earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   To rejoin the club, the trio had to fly from New Orleans to
Memphis to Seattle, arriving at the ballpark at 5:30 after
Monahan's wife drove them from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE FARM: Top prospect Ryan Anderson finished his third pro
season with a flourish, striking out 12 and permitting just three
hits over seven inning in Class AA New Haven's 6-3 victory over
Binghamton. The 6-foot-10 lefty compiled a 9-13 record.
</P>
<P>
   At Class A Wisconsin, normal catcher Craig Kuzmic played all
nine positions in a 3-2 win over Beloit. Kuzmic, 22, finished up on
the mound in the ninth inning, using knuckleballs only to strike
out the game's last batter and earn the save. He was 1-for-4 at bat
with a run scored.

FRUSTRATED CAREW TAKES WOES PERSONALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels management has made it clear
that nobody's job is safe after this season, that everyone will be
evaluated. Including a seven-time batting champion.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Carew is in his eighth season as the Angels' hitting coach,
and despite the kind of year the team's had, he hopes it isn't his
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I want to be back, but it's out of my control,''
Carew said. ``I'm not going to go around and worry about it or
think about it. It's their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Carew calls this season his most frustrating as a coach. That's
because Carew takes his hitters' failures personally, like he's the
one in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   And there has been a lot of failure. Going into Tuesday's game
against the White Sox, the Angels offense ranked last in the
American League in batting average, runs, hits, total bases,
doubles, stolen bases, slugging percentage and on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still keep working,'' Carew said. ``It doesn't stop me from
doing what I'm supposed to do. It's why we are teachers _ when it
gets tough, you don't back off. It's just been one of those years
where things didn't click.''
</P>
<P>
   __ My name is. . .: The Angels had a few new faces in the
clubhouse Tuesday, as the team promoted catchers Bret Hemphill and
Steve Decker, pitcher Steve Mintz and outfielder Jeff DaVanon.
</P>
<P>
   DaVanon was one of the three minor-leaguers acquired in the deal
that sent Omar Olivares and Randy Velarde to the Oakland A's.
DaVanon hit .326 with six homers and 19 RBIs in 34 games for
Triple-A Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's culture shock in a lot of ways,'' said DaVanon, 25.
``It's a whole different world. Everything's a little better. Here
it's unbelievable. Everything is first class.''
</P>
<P>
   DaVanon's father was an infielder for the Angels in 1973. The
elder DaVanon, who hit .245 in 41 games in '73, gave his son some
advice: ``He told me to take a deep breath before my first
at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Reinforcements: A couple more of the Angels' minor-league
coaches joined the major-league staff Tuesday, as Leon Durham and
Tom Kotchman arrived in time to help out with pregame workouts.
Durham was a coach at Triple-A Edmonton and Kotchman was the
manager at Single-A Boise.
</P>
<P>
   __ Slow recovery: Tim Salmon, still bothered by a strained lower
back, started at DH for the second game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no hurry to put him back in the outfield,'' interim
manager Joe Maddon said. ``We'll check on a daily basis to see how
he feels. We just want to have his bat in the lineup.''

L.A. CITY COUNCIL APPROVES END RUN FOR NFL TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV AND STEVE DILBEK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a week before Los Angeles must submit a plan
for bringing professional football to the city, the City Council
has left open the prospect of using public money to improve parking
at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Despite broad criticism of public financing of the deal, the
council Tuesday rejected on a 6-8 vote an effort to require voter
approval of using any tax money to help draw a National Football
League team to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The debate renewed bitter rivalries, as Councilman Joel Wachs
vowed to revive an initiative drive to require a public vote if any
tax dollars are spent on a football team. A similar conflict
erupted over the use of taxes to build the Staples Center, and
Coliseum supporters are proposing the same financial arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public has higher priorities for their tax
dollars, whether it's books in schools or more police officers,''
said Wachs, who had first suggested the initiative during debate
over the Staples Center. ``I don't think they want it going to
billionaire sports owners.''
</P>
<P>
   But Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose district includes the
Coliseum, said the council action means members are open to
negotiations with the NFL over the use of public money as long as
it is limited to incremental tax revenue generated by the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying we are willing to negotiate to complete a deal
to bring professional football back to Los Angeles,'' Ridley-Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Voting in favor of a public vote were council members Hal
Bernson, Laura Chick, Nate Holden, Mike Hernandez, Joel Wachs and
Rita Walters. Voting against it were John Ferraro, Mike Feuer, Ruth
Galanter, Jack Goldberg, Cindy Miscikowski, Alex Padilla, Nick
Pacheco and Mark Ridley-Thomas. Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. was
absent.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL set Sept. 15 as a date for Los Angeles to come up with a
specific proposal. The owners are scheduled to meet a week later.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league would not comment on
the council's action Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the expansion committee has been appraised of that and
any other details and developments, we'll have something to say on
Thursday,'' Aiello said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL expansion committee is scheduled to meet in Washington,
D.C., on Thursday morning to review the expansion situation in Los
Angeles. Three high-ranking members of the NFL met privately last
week in Southern California with each of the four groups vying for
the area franchise _ the Coliseum, Carson, Anaheim and Hollywood
Park _ to get an update on each site's expansion situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were doing a lot of listening and asking a lot of
questions to get an understanding of what's there, so they can
report at the expansion meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carson project was originally championed by former Hollywood
superagent Michael Ovitz, who later developed plans for the
Coliseum when the league selected Exposition Park as its Los
Angeles expansion site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is, until we hear from the NFL that it has
officially abandoned the Coliseum, that is where our focus
remains,'' said Ovitz spokesman Mark Fabiani. ``And we have not
heard that from the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ovitz group was not invited to participate in the NFL's
meeting with Carson officials last week.
</P>
<P>
   The new Coliseum plan involves what is called incremental tax
financing to pay for construction of a new parking structure. That
means any new tax revenue generated by a professional football team
would be used to pay off bonds issued to build more parking.
</P>
<P>
   Sufficient parking is a key requirement for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   While the council did not reject the tax revenue proposal, its
members also refused to say they fully support the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the council was saying was to let's take a look at this
and let it come back to us to examine,'' Ridley-Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Other council members heard a different message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying to the NFL, we welcome you here to play in the
Coliseum, but don't look for any public money,'' Chick said. ``This
is not only about public dollars, but also a firm belief we should
be spending our time, energy and our dollars on fixing what's
broken in this city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time to send this strong message to the NFL: It's
time to stop playing games and start playing ball in the
Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernson said he didn't believe the council should close any
doors.
</P>
<P>
   What we're doing with the NFL is negotiating ``and one of the
tools is being able to play a good game of poker,'' Bernson said.
``It is very clear the public is against using any tax money to
bring the NFL to Los Angeles. They should shoulder their costs and
not shake us down.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to recognize is that this is no longer about
sports. It's about business.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said he is concerned about the council taking an action
that would preclude other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want us to shut off dealing with an array of
permutations that could come before us,'' Feuer said. ``There might
be something that would be to the city's advantage and we should
look at it.''

COOPER'S DEBUT ROCKS WHITE SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Years from now, Brian Cooper won't easily
forget what happened with the first batter he faced in his
major-league debut with the Anaheim Angels on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton belted a 1-2 pitch from Cooper into the
right-field seatsfor a 1-0 Chicago White Sox lead. But it's what
Cooper did AFTER giving up the homer that will be memorable for the
25-year-old right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper didn't allow another run the rest of the evening, going
seven innings to earn the victory in the Angels' 14-1 win before
16,867 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who went to Glendora High School, Citrus College and
USC, gave up four hits, struck out three and walked four as the
Angels won their second in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the win, the Angels were mathematically eliminated from
postseason play because the Boston Red Sox, who lead the AL
wild-card race, also won Tuesday. Last season, the Angels were not
eliminated until the second-to-last day of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper got help from the Angels offense, which hasn't been very
supportive of its pitchers this season. The hitters did the bulk of
their damage in two innings _ they scored six in the fourth inning
and six more in the eighth. White Sox starter Mike Sirotka (8-13)
got the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad led the Angels offense with four of their 12 hits.
Jim Edmonds and Garret Anderson had two hits apiece and Tim Salmon
hit his 13th homer of the year, a three-run blast in the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper might have been rattled a bit after allowing the leadoff
homer to Singleton, walking the next hitter. But he settled down
from there. He helped himself defensively, starting 1-6-3 double
plays in both the third and fifth innings. Edmonds saved a run for
Cooper in the first inning, diving and catching a sinking liner to
center field hit by Paul Konerko with a runner on second.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had a losing record and an ERA over seven last season at
double-AMidland, causing him to wonder about his baseball future.
But the development of a changeup keyed a rise through the
organization this season and was big in Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   He retired the side in order only once _ the sixth _ but allowed
only three White Sox baserunners to get into scoring position after
Singleton's homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels broke the game open in the fourth inning. Edmonds
opened with a single and Sirotka walked both Salmon and Mo Vaughn
to load the bases. Troy Glaus drove in the first run of the inning
with a sacrifice fly and Anderson followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Trent Durrington doubled home a run, Gary
DiSarcina singled in two more and Erstad added an RBI single to put
the Angels up, 7-1.

   LOS ANGELES -- Guess who's coming to dinner?
</P>
<P>
   That's going to be Wall Street's newest game following Viacom
Inc.'s stunning announcement of a $34 billion buyout of CBS Corp.
on Tuesday. The pact should trigger a wave of deals among media
conglomerates, analysts believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a question of eat or be eaten,'' said Marvin
Roffman, a principal with Philadelphia-based Roffman Miller
Associates, which owns more than $5 million of Viacom stock. ``What
you have is a wonderful combination of software and hardware. This
deal is saying that if you're going to compete, you need tremendous
vertical integration.''
</P>
<P>
   Viacom will be attempting to fit its powerful brands -- led by
MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount -- to CBS, parent of the leading
U.S. television network and owner of more than 160 radio stations.
The combined company would own 35 TV stations, including six
markets where it would possess two stations in each.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal works, CBS gains more control over content while
Viacom adds much greater distribution options and both can compete
more effectively against rivals. Analysts said the spark to the
merger agreement, which would leave CBS shareholders with 55
percent ownership of Viacom, stemmed from the Federal
Communications Commission's decision last month to lift a ban that
prohibited a single person or entity from owning more than one TV
station in a market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viacom and CBS are the first companies to take advantage of
the new FCC rule, which is a real tide change,'' said Barry Hyman,
an analyst with Ehrenkrtantz King Nussbaum. ``You're going to see a
whole round of linkups. Whenever the rules change, that leads to
mergers and acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bannister of Edward Jones agreed, noting that Viacom
Chairman Sumner Redstone and CBS head Mel Karmazin both indicated
that the merged company plans to seek acquisitions. She also
emphasized that media conglomerates increasingly will be looking to
take advantage of the explosive growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see more consolidation,'' Bannister
said. ``What you're seeing is a lot of these changes driven by
technological advances such as digital cable and Internet. So in
this case, you have strong brands that people recognize and strong
content, which is why people go on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   That trend will lead to higher valuations being placed on
entities that can deliver first-rate TV and movies to a specific
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Content and creativity is increasingly going to be the driving
force in the entertainment industry, which is a red flag for any
company whose asset value is in a broadcast network,'' said Kevin
Skisloock of Laguna Research Partners. ``Looking at the last 20
years, it's very clear that we'll continue to see that trend. Cable
made it very cheap to gain access to an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said the problems faced by The Walt Disney Co. in
the wake of its 1996 buyout of Capital Cities/ABC, such as lagging
ratings and difficulties in integrating operations, were clearly
not a deterrent to Redstone and Karmazin striking a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on Wall Street are willing to overlook the weakness in
the Disney deal as an aberration,'' Hyman said. ``There's nothing
in the CBS-Viacom deal that doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, then, every other major media/entertainment
conglomerate is likely looking for partners. What's unknown is
who's buying and who would be willing to sell.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many analysts believe General Electric Co. might
seek a deal to beef up NBC, now the only major network not directly
linked to a studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think GE will sell,'' Roffman said. ``They will be the
acquirer because they're interested in getting bigger. You're going
to have to be like a juggernaut to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hyman said NBC is a prime takeover target for Time Warner
Inc., which has seen its status soar in the four years since it
bought Turner Broadcasting for $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying NBC may make more sense as time goes on,'' he said.
``Right now, people want TV stations and this deal changes the
scope of things. So midsize operators of TV stations such as Young
Broadcasting, Granite Broadcasting and Paxson Communications are
probable acquisition targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister, on the other hand, said GE is not likely to move
immediately on NBC but added, ``They are probably starting to take
a hard look at their position because eventually they have to come
to some kind of agreement in order to ensure that they get good
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said other players in upcoming deals might include media
mogul Barry Diller, who lost out to Redstone in 1994 in an attempt
to buy Paramount, through his USA Networks; Seagram Co., which is a
part-owner of the USA Network and now the world's largest music
company thanks to its buyout of PolyGram; and Disney, which could
decide to sell ABC.

made it very cheap to gain access to an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said the problems faced by The Walt Disney Co. in
the wake of its 1996 buyout of Capital Cities/ABC, such as lagging
ratings and difficulties in integrating operations, were clearly
not a deterrent to Redstone and Karmazin striking a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on Wall Street are willing to overlook the weakness in
the Disney deal as an aberration,'' Hyman said. ``There's nothing
in the CBS-Viacom deal that doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, then, every other major media/entertainment
conglomerate is likely looking for partners. What's unknown is
who's buying and who would be willing to sell.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many analysts believe General Electric Co. might
seek a deal to beef up NBC, now the only major network not directly
linked to a studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think GE will sell,'' Roffman said. ``They will be the
acquirer because they're interested in getting bigger. You're going
to have to be like a juggernaut to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hyman said NBC is a prime takeover target for Time Warner
Inc., which has seen its status soar in the four years since it
bought Turner Broadcasting for $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying NBC may make more sense as time goes on,'' he said.
``Right now, people want TV stations and this deal changes the
scope of things. So midsize operators of TV stations such as Young
Broadcasting, Granite Broadcasting and Paxson Communications are
probable acquisition targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bannister, on the other hand, said GE is not likely to move
immediately on NBC but added, ``They are probably starting to take
a hard look at their position because eventually they have to come
to some kind of agreement in order to ensure that they get good
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said other players in upcoming deals might include media
mogul Barry Diller, who lost out to Redstone in 1994 in an attempt
to buy Paramount, through his USA Networks; Seagram Co., which is a
part-owner of the USA Network and now the world's largest music
company thanks to its buyout of PolyGram; and Disney, which could
decide to sell ABC.

PROFESSOR _ AND IMMIGRANT _ ARGUES FOR TOUGHER SCREENING OF
IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Borjas was 8 years old when Fidel Castro's tanks rolled
into Havana. Three years later, his family, having lost their small
factory making men's pants, fled to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Borjas, 48, is now a professor of public policy at Harvard
University, specializing in immigration. He's also an advocate of a
policy that would have prevented his own family from coming here.
He makes his case in his new book, ``Heaven's Door'' (Princeton,
$27.95).
</P>
<P>
   The book is neither an argument to close the nation's doors nor
to throw them wide open. It's an argument to screen applicants for
age, language and work skills. In contrast, the current immigration
system, set up in 1965, is based almost entirely on whether
applicants have family members in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 1965 reforms began what Borjas calls the Second Great
Migration _ the first being the influx of 1885-1914. In the new
wave, he writes, a high proportion of immigrants have been
unskilled. On balance they do not take the jobs of Americans; the
jobs multiply to employ the hands willing to work. But more of
those jobs are at the bottom end.
</P>
<P>
   And that's good for a lot of people. The San Diego couple who
hires a nanny at $200 per week can afford to work more hours. The
manufacturer who would have moved to Mexico now has affordable
employees. In Seattle, we employ foreigners to make our lunches and
stay up all night in convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   There's a cost to this. In the past 25 years, the gap between
the top and bottom in incomes has widened dramatically.
Immigration, says Borjas, is not the only reason for this, but he
calculates that it ``may account for nearly half the decline in the
relative wage of high school dropouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Borjas argues that the United States would be better off
attempting to select a better-educated class of applicants, as
Canada does. This, he allows, would change the ethnic mix of
immigrants. It would be attacked for being discriminatory. But all
systems of screening applicants are discriminatory, he writes,
including the one we have now.
</P>
<P>
   Under Borjas's proposal, for example, the United States would
end up admitting more Canadians and fewer Mexicans _ simply because
the average Canadian immigrant has 13.8 years of schooling, and the
average Mexican 7.6. The average Canadian immigrant earns 24
percent more than the average American; the average Mexican earns
39 percent less.
</P>
<P>
   Huge differences also exist in the different groups' use of
welfare. After 10 years in the United States, 5 percent of East
Indians are receiving some kind of government assistance; 9 percent
of Britons, 20 percent of Haitians, 21 percent of Russians, 34
percent of Mexicans and 58 percent of Dominicans.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences are normal. They are based, Borjas says, on
``ethnic capital'' _ the group's know-how, attitudes and values
handed down through generations. Among immigrants, half of the
first generation's earning-power differential is passed to their
kids, and half of the second generation's differential is passed to
their kids. ``Ethnicity matters in economic life, and it matters
for a very long time,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Any change in the mix of these groups would change the U.S.
labor market, helping certain industries and hurting others. To
take a local example, without Mexican immigrants who would pick
Washington state's apples? Well, Borjas argues, maybe high-wage
America shouldn't be growing apples.
</P>
<P>
   He writes, ``Does it make sense for the United States to be in
the business of exporting hand-harvested fruits and vegetables?''
</P>
<P>
   Oops. He just lost Central Washington. (But there are
alternatives: Growers in the Canadian Okanagan employ
French-Canadian youths.)
</P>
<P>
   After piling up all his evidence, Borjas allows that immigration
policy ``cannot be based on the evidence alone.'' All policies have
winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   This book assumes that the people who count are native-born
Americans, because they make the political decisions. It proposes a
policy that arguably would make them better off economically.
</P>
<P>
   And while screening could pay Americans a dividend, Borjas
allows that it would still miss two-thirds of the difference
between the highly productive immigrant and the merely average.
That's because two-thirds of the difference between individuals is
due to ``unknown factors.''

HOMERS HIGHLIGHT M'S VICTORY OVER JAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two of the premier power hitters in the American
League homered in the fifth inning at Safeco Field Tuesday night.
For sheer grandeur, Shawn Green's blast outdid Ken Griffey Jr's.
But for significance in the Mariners'
</P>
<P>
   7-4 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, Griffey's mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's two-run, opposite-field home run came with two outs,
extended the Mariners' lead and gave the center fielder sole
possession of the American League home run lead with 43.
</P>
<P>
   Green's homer in the top of the inning, however, was the one
39,709 fans may remember best. Facing M's rookie Gil Meche (6-4),
the Blue Jays right fielder crushed his 37th of the year off the
windows of the Hit It Here Cafe in right. The official measurement
_ 395 feet _ seemed low, but the blast made Green the first player
to homer off the stadium restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never played here before, so I didn't know it was
special,'' said Green, who has never homered off the Hard Rock Cafe
at Toronto's SkyDome. ``I noticed in batting practice that balls to
the gaps didn't go anywhere. I thought people were exaggerating,
but it is a pitcher's park.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but that hasn't kept Griffey from hitting 10 home runs
at Safeco. His shot Tuesday night followed a sacrifice fly by David
Bell that had given the Mariners a 4-3 lead. It also made Toronto
lefty David Wells Griffey's all-time favorite home run server.
Wells has surrendered seven of Griffey's 393 career homers, more
than any other pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Griffey stood out on defense. He made all three
putouts in the inning, finishing with an over-the-shoulder Willie
Mays special to rob Shannon Stewart at the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing he does amazes me anymore,'' said left fielder Charles
Gipson. ``I've seen him change his batting stance and hit a home
run. I've seen him turn around and hit right-handed in batting
practice and hit a home run. I've seen him make catches over his
shoulder. I've seen him steal a lot of bases. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' other Mr. Everything lately has been Edgar
Martinez, who celebrated Player of the Week honors by going 3-for-4
to raise his average to .342, his highest since mid-April. The
designated hitter batted .500 last week, with four homers and nine
runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   His first hit Tuesday night was a one-out single in the second,
and Jay Buhner followed by reaching on an error. After a Mike
Blowers strike out, Russ Davis came to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Davis hit the first Safeco home run on July 17 and added another
homer in Kansas City July 29. But he had none in August, enduring
the first homerless month in his four-year Mariners career. Tuesday
night, he buried Wells' first pitch deep into the M's bullpen for a
three-run homer, tying his career high of 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all hands,'' said hitting coach Jesse Barfield. ``A
lot of guys complain about balls not carrying well here, but a line
drive's a home run anywhere in the world. ... You hit it on a line,
it'll go.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run was evidence of the quiet progress Davis has made
recently. The third baseman was batting .227 on Aug. 29, but is
13-for-31 (.419) since.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' 3-0 lead was in danger in the fourth. Former
Mariner David Segui, who was cheered in his first game at Safeco
Field since being traded July 28, hit a leadoff double. From left
field, former teammate Gipson wagged a finger at Segui, playfully
warning him not to test his arm.
</P>
<P>
   But with two outs, Segui tried to score on a single by Darrin
Fletcher. Gipson, who recently missed seven weeks with a separated
shoulder, threw him out at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my shoulder got hurt, I know people have been
second-guessing my arm,'' Gipson said. ``I was waiting for an
opportunity. It had to be an old friend in David, but I'll have
bragging rights tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Also owning bragging rights soon: Jose Mesa. The Mariners closer
saved his 32nd game with a perfect ninth inning, and his next save
will equal Mike Schooler's 10-year-old club record for saves in a
season.

TIME TO PULL PLUG ON WOODY ... AND LOU, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Despite the fact that they are 56-year-old natives of
Florida who played in World Series and were Yankees general
managers ousted by George Steinbrenner, Lou Piniella and Woody
Woodward are not twins separated at birth.
</P>
<P>
   But after seven years together as baseball commanders of the
Seattle Mariners, it has become difficult to distinguish which of
them gets the credit and which gets the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Though they long have been friends and colleagues, in recent
times they have quietly suggested that the other is more
responsible for the club's dearth of quality pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella is irked by criticism that he's hard on young pitchers,
claiming he hasn't been given enough major league arms. Woodward is
persuaded that the talent has been sufficient, but the pitchers
have been underused or unappreciated, as evidenced by the success
of so many after leaving Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they can agree on privately is that they've been
stymied by an ownership largely unwilling to provide resources to
compete at baseball's top level.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ownership, the manager or the general manager has had
the greater role in Mariners travails, what is indisputable is
that, despite the club's prominence in local sporting culture, it
has won more than 85 games in a season only once in the seven-year
regime of Woodward and Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's 11-year term is the longest among current major
league GMs. The tandem tenure with Piniella is exceeded only by GM
John Schuerholz and manager Bobby Cox with the Braves and GM John
Hart and manager Mike Hargrove with the Indians _ clubs with
considerably more to show for themselves this decade, even before a
possible World Series meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, meanwhile, have won one playoff game since '95 and
are going nowhere next month.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989 under Woodward (he arrived at midseason of 1988), the
Mariners have won 49 percent of their games. Piniella is at 52
percent since his appointment in '93 _ not bad by major league
standards, but weak considering the team's company.
</P>
<P>
   Only after baseball subdivided in 1994 to provide the Mariners
with just three mostly average rivals in the American League West
did the club win division titles, in 1995 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   Results in '98 and so far in '99 have amounted to a squandering
of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The prime culprit: A failure to develop, keep or acquire
pitching sufficient for contention.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the failure is the move from the Kingdome to the
Guilty Pleasure, a new ballpark friendliest to the aspect of
baseball where the Mariners historically have been poorest.
</P>
<P>
   The decade of pitching flops and this season's abrupt
reinvestment in arms for the new ballpark mandate more switches
this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners should begin with a new manager and general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners need baseball leadership with some history and
touch with pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Though the club's sudden stockpiling of young arms has turned
the season into one long audition _ a club-record 27 pitchers used,
including 14 rookies, with more to come _ the sudden overload isn't
as impressive as it looks, for two reasons:
</P>
<P>
   -- No pitcher from the farm system has developed into a
significant contributor in Seattle since Erik Hanson (1988-93);
</P>
<P>
   -- Other than being forced to deal superstars Ken Griffey Jr. or
Alex Rodriguez, the Mariners have few position players at any level
to fill holes created by the trades for pitching or losses from
attrition. That means they will have to trade pitching for
pitching, because the free-agent market this off-season is thin.
</P>
<P>
   Think about this: The Mariners last week had to bring back Mike
Blowers, cut from his Japanese team, to play first base _ the
eighth player to do so since David Segui's July trade, prompting
more thoughts of Abbott &AMP; Costello routines instead of wild-card
chances.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise storehouse is depleted, because so many trades
have failed to fill voids, while creating their own.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's losing record when it comes to pitching deals and
Piniella's inability to bring out much from young or average
pitchers have left the Mariners dealing from weakness as the club
approaches the latest pivot point in club history _ the attempt
this winter to keep Junior and A-Rod in Seattle long-term.
</P>
<P>
   Trading either or both superstars becomes a stronger temptation
for a club in need of multiple fixes. The problem is that such a
deal means sacrificing either the greatest player of his era in
Griffey, or Rodriguez, perhaps baseball's glamor answer to Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   By this off-season, the team can't get well enough fast enough
to make much more than promises to the two stars. And failure to
resolve the Griffey and Rodriguez situations by Opening Day 2000
will cast a bleakness over the season far worse than the
debilitating Randy Johnson trade watch of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and his top aide, vice-president of player development
Roger Jongewaard, have been solid spotters of young pitching
talent. But a glance around the major leagues reveals many of them
are pitching respectably elsewhere: Dave Burba, Shawn Estes, Mike
Hampton, Matt Mantei, Joe Mays, Jim Mecir, Jeff Nelson, Ron Villone
... the list is long and painfully familiar to Mariners fans.
</P>
<P>
   Over the holiday weekend, Boston reliever Derek Lowe put up two
saves against the Mariners, while catcher Jason Varitek homered
three times as the wild card-leading Red Sox won three of four
games. They were traded from Seattle in July 1997, for much
lamented relief pitcher Heathcliff Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the veterans from outside the organization whose
stays in Seattle ended for reasons other than being a decent major
league pitcher: Mike Jackson, Sterling Hitchcock, Andy Benes, Terry
Mulholland, Omar Olivares, Tim Belcher. They remain solid
contributors, the kind so long missing here that the Mariners this
season were forced to put the bulk of their starting rotation upon
three rookies.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, all teams have former players who flourish
elsewhere. Some amount of baseball success can be attributed to
right place, right time, or just plain luck, as opposed to
managerial brilliance or talent-sniffing acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the talent drain was not the responsibility of Woodward
and Piniella, but budget decisions from ownerships petrified by
baseball's economics.
</P>
<P>
   Well-funded teams such as the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers and Braves
can afford to squander talent occasionally because the cupboard is
plentiful. But for most of their 23 years, the Mariners have posed
themselves as a have-not, usually surrendering their top homegrown
talent to richer clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, despite an impressive fan base and a lucrative new
park, trades this season have unloaded so much salary that the
current payroll value is under $40 million, well into the bottom
half of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, spending on player salaries is no guarantee of a
championship, as flops this season by the Dodgers, Angels, Orioles
and Rockies attest. But the old bromide still prevails _ not
spending heavily virtually guarantees no championship. Remember,
this year's low-budget darlings, the A's and Reds, haven't won
anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners have spent money, it hasn't been done wisely.
The nadir of the Woodward-Piniella regime was last year's bullpen,
which had the AL's highest payroll and its highest earned-run
average, and became a national baseball joke. To improve the 'pen
this year, more resources were exhausted, and it's still
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Mariners have had their No. 1 starter go
haywire in three of the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Johnson was lost for much of the year with a back
injury. In 1998, it was his head. The decision not to lock him up
with a long-term deal distracted The Big Unit into an 8-10 record
before he was traded to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Jeff Fassero flopped, a victim of elbow surgery and
a contract-year brain cramp. Part of Fassero's trouble that
preceded his waiver was, in his own words, a fear of failing to
fill Johnson's role as the ace _ yet another casualty of the Big
Unit botch.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mariners bosses are rightfully proud of the performance
of the players acquired for Johnson, the fact is they still don't
have a proven No. 1 pitcher, and probably won't unless they trade
Griffey or Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   In the Johnson mess and some other pitching failures, Piniella
has been as much victim as perpetrator. And this year, if he had
full seasons from Rodriguez, Carlos Guillen, Jay Buhner, Butch
Henry, Mark Leiter and Paul Abbott, the Mariners would be much
closer in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what team doesn't have injuries? And what divine
baseball grace says the Mariners deserved improbably creditable
years from rookie starters Freddy Garcia, John Halama and Gil
Meche?
</P>
<P>
   They all came to Seattle as almost ready-made major leaguers.
Will they stay that way?
</P>
<P>
   That is the ultimate question dictating Piniella's fate. He's on
his fourth pitching coach in seven years, having flailed almost
helplessly trying to make average pitchers out of Ken Cloude, Bob
Wolcott, Dave Fleming, Salomon Torres and a host of other
youngsters who have flickered in Seattle, then flamed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw strikes,'' Piniella always demands. Well, no kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Piniella's umpire outbursts that are so ejectibly amusing also
reflect much of the way he works with his pitchers _ emotionally,
not analytically. Too many good arms have come and gone through the
organization to suggest it's merely coincidence that none have
flourished here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the club's sudden investment in pitching, and the good
fortune of three talented rookies, the staff ERA remains the worst
in the AL, as well as club history. Lately, production from the
cannibalized offense has slumped.
</P>
<P>
   This call for big change is not made easily. Piniella and
Woodward aren't dumber now than when they were hailed in 1995. A
champion as player and manager, Piniella has more than 1,000 career
victories with three clubs, handles well the difficult tasks of
managing the clubhouse and the media and remains a popular figure
here for many.
</P>
<P>
   The travails of other top managers such as Davey Johnson, Jim
Leyland and Tony La Russa suggest again there is no formula, system
or personality type that assures managerial success.
</P>
<P>
   But Piniella's contemptuous impatience and volatility with
youngsters, and his record with pitching, are of little virtue
where the franchise has chosen to live: in a vast, pitcher-friendly
ballpark that was built at extraordinary cost based on owner
promises of contention _ not auditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome expectations _ it's a good thing,'' said Piniella
recently. ``This is a baseball town now.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Woodward can be proud of their roles in making it such.
</P>
<P>
   But a two-season flop and a seven-season failure to find,
develop and keep good pitching make Piniella and Woodward, with a
dubious assist from ownership, a baseball version of the Kingdome _
good for the time, and a victim of change.

SEGUI'S FEELINGS FOR M'S STILL RUN DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Since trading David Segui, the Mariners have tried
eight different players at first base. For temporary replacements,
they have turned to regular catcher Dan Wilson, second baseman
David Bell and right fielder Jay Buhner. Privately, they admit to a
serious need at the position.
</P>
<P>
   How about David Segui?
</P>
<P>
   He's a free agent at the end of the season _ and amenable to the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, in town for the first time since his July 28 trade to
Toronto, turned pensive when the subject was broached before
Tuesday night's game at Safeco Field. He spoke slowly and quietly,
carefully measuring each word. He talked about loyalty to the Blue
Jays, while at the same time admitting to deep, emotional ties to
the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been traded before, but it's never been as hard as it has
been here,'' said Segui, now with his fifth big league team.
``Toronto has first crack, but Seattle is a very close second, if
they're interested. I love playing for Lou (Piniella). I feel like
part of the city and the community. I'm still baffled why we didn't
get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners traded Segui for then-minor league relievers Tom
Davey and Steve Sinclair. The team said the reasons for the deal
were: 1) the club had an obvious need for pitching help; and 2)
Segui appeared difficult to re-sign in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the veteran player said the only thing he was pushing
hard for was a contract extension covering four years, and he might
have considered taking less. In four years, Segui, 32, plans to
retire and be a full-time parent to his two young kids in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to sign a three-year deal and have to find
another team for one year,'' he said. ``My dad finished his career
with the Mariners and I wanted to do the same. I had valid reasons
for a four-year deal. But three would have been OK.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Mariners apparently were willing to make a fourth
year possible if Segui met certain playing time criteria, according
to a source.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners wouldn't comment on Segui, but don't appear to be
interested in reacquiring him.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, who maintains a Seattle residence, says Mariners fans
have treated him better than anyone else. He received countless
letters from them after the trade. People stopped him on the street
Tuesday to tell him they missed him. Signs at Safeco Field Tuesday
night offered similar messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as players, really appreciate that,'' he said. ``We're
human beings. It's easy to forget that. My time in Seattle was all
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   REINFORCEMENTS: With Class AAA Tacoma finishing its season
Monday, the Mariners called up three more players Tuesday, pitchers
Brett Hinchliffe and Sinclair and outfielder Shane Monahan. All
were with the M's earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   To rejoin the club, the trio had to fly from New Orleans to
Memphis to Seattle, arriving at the ballpark at 5:30 after
Monahan's wife drove them from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE FARM: Top prospect Ryan Anderson finished his third pro
season with a flourish, striking out 12 and permitting just three
hits over seven inning in Class AA New Haven's 6-3 victory over
Binghamton. The 6-foot-10 lefty compiled a 9-13 record.
</P>
<P>
   At Class A Wisconsin, normal catcher Craig Kuzmic played all
nine positions in a 3-2 win over Beloit. Kuzmic, 22, finished up on
the mound in the ninth inning, using knuckleballs only to strike
out the game's last batter and earn the save. He was 1-for-4 at bat
with a run scored.

RED SOX DRAW FIRST BLOOD
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-A'S-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By GORDON EDES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The polite thing would be to say that the
Oakland A's blinked first when faced with their moment of truth
against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But that wouldn't begin to describe how completely the A's came
unhinged Tuesday night at the sight of the Red Sox, who pounced at
the first scent of weakness in this wild-card showdown en route to
a 5-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, playing their first meaningful game in seven seasons,
had hoped to take on the look of a playoff-bound team. Instead,
they showed up with shirttails untucked, shoes scuffed, and flies
at half-mast against the Sox, who took a four-game lead in the
wild-card race with 23 games left.
</P>
<P>
   The A's were as completely undressed as the naked intruder who
performed handstands on the field in the ninth inning while wearing
nothing but a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone started yelling, so I expected that somebody was
running on the field, but I didn't expect that,'' said Derek Lowe,
who registered his third save on this trip. ``I got the heck out of
the way. You don't know what people like that are going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was karaoking, making these noises, backpedaling, all kinds
of things. But he may have calmed me down. I'd just thrown four
balls in a row, and they may have been getting some momentum. That
took it away from them. I got to throw a few extra warmup pitches,
got out of my rut, and cleared my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one too many adult beverages, right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland shortstop Miguel Tejada dropped a popup hit by leadoff
man Jose Offerman, the first in a dumbfounding series of mistakes
that led to five Boston runs in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox failed to score after that inning, leaving five runners
on base in the last three innings, but won behind Tim Wakefield and
another collaborative bullpen effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, a season-best 19 games over .500 after winning for the
fourth time in five games on this 12-game excursion, are now as
close to the first-place Yankees (5 1/2 games) as they are to
fading wild-card contender Toronto, which lost to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   There was one ominous note for the Sox. Shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra was replaced in the eighth inning by rookie Donnie
Sadler. He was reported to have sustained a bruised left ankle; he
fouled a pitch off his ankle on his first at-bat. An inning before
being removed, while Jimy Williams was making a pitching change,
Garciaparra had trotted in from his position and talked at length
with the Sox manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fouled that ball off his foot . . . but he'll be OK,''
Williams said. ``Their team doctor came and checked him. We'll try
to use some common sense tomorrow the best we can.'' Don't be
surprised to see Garciaparra sit Wednesday afternoon. With an off
day Thursday he would have two days off prior to the Yankees series
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first inning was over, A's right fielder Matt Stairs
had overthrown the cutoff man twice, both times putting runners in
scoring position. Third baseman Olmedo Saenz threw wide of first
baseman Jason Giambi, pulling him off the bag on Wilton Veras's
infield hit. Tejada jugged a feed on a force play at second,
erasing any chance at a double play.
</P>
<P>
   And A's starter Gil Heredia, who threw a complete-game win
against the Sox three weeks ago in Fenway Park and issues fewer
walks per nine innings than any pitcher in the American League,
walked Troy O'Leary and hit Mike Stanley in succession.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia also gave up an RBI double to Reggie Jefferson, who had
knocked in just four runs since the All-Star break but was
nominated by Williams to replace the slumping Brian Daubach; an RBI
single to Garciaparra, who has hit in 10 straight games; and an RBI
single to Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Veras also was credited with an RBI on his infield hit. The Sox
sent 10 batters to the plate, the first time they batted around in
the first inning since June 26, when they scored 11 runs against
the White Sox in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, restored to the rotation when the Sox decided there
would be no miracle from Ramon Martinez this season, took full
advantage of his five-run cushion, striking out seven of the
overeager A's in the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, who had a runner on second and no out in the first and
runners on first and second with no out in the second and failed to
score either time, finally broke through in the fourth against
Wakefield, who walked the first three batters to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   After a discussion with pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, Wakefield
kept the damage to a minimum. Ben Grieve hit a sacrifice fly for
one run, and ex-Sox batterymate Mike Macfarlane singled home
another, but Wakefield retired Rich Becker on a bouncer to second
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield stranded Randy Velarde on third in the fifth, and
breezed through a 1-2-3 sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia, saddled with four unearned runs in the first inning,
checked the Red Sox until departing with one out and one on in the
seventh. Third-base umpire Mike Everitt lent unwitting assistance
to Heredia's cause when he ruled that left fielder Grieve had made
a shoestring catch of O'Leary's sinking liner, when in fact the
ball bounced at least a half-foot in front of Grieve's glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had two runners on in the third inning, but Offerman
lined out to end the threat. They had two on with one out in the
seventh, but reliever Tim Worrell retired Stanley on a fly ball and
struck out Varitek.

 LEVI STRAUSS HIRES NEW CEO FROM OUTSIDE ITS GENE POOL  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For only the second time in its 146-year
history, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. has tapped a nonfamily member to run
the venerable San Francisco company.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Haas, 57, the great-great-grandnephew of company founder
Levi Strauss, said Tuesday that he will relinquish his chief
executive title on September 27 to Philip Marineau, a highly
regarded PepsiCo executive. Haas will remain chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau, 52, who is credited with making substantial inroads
against Coca-Cola as the head of Pepsi's North America operations,
joins Levi's at a difficult time. The jeans maker is expected to
post a net-loss year because of higher-than-expected costs related
to plant closures, according to sources close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Global sales, which fell 13 percent in 1998 and 4 percent in
1997, are expected to decline steeply again this year _ between 10
and 12 percent, one source said. That would bring 1999 sales to
$5.6 billion or less, a precipitous fall from the company's 1996
peak of $7.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's said in January that it was looking for a new chief
operating officer who also might hold the president's title to
replace then-president and COO Peter Jacobi. Haas had planned to
groom the incoming executive for two years and then retire, he said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Marineau, who was CEO and president of Pepsi's $11 billion
North America division, refused to come aboard for anything less
than the top post. ``I've done enough training,'' Marineau said in
a telephone interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said Tuesday that he is proud of his accomplishments, which
include include ``10 years of unprecedented profitability and
shareholder value creation,'' the introduction of the Dockers and
Slates brands and progressive workplace policies such as
domestic-partner benefits. Still, with the downturn in the last two
years, he is leaving day-to-day management of the company with a
besmirched record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given his absolute druthers, I think he would rather have
waited two years and turned it around'' himself, said one person
close to Haas. But the chance to hire Marineau was too good to pass
up. ``I think Bob had to swallow hard and say, `OK, let's make him
CEO,' '' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an admission by the board of the company and
perhaps Bob Haas himself that it is best for him to be in an
oversight capacity and let an operator from outside . . . be in
charge of making the day-to-day decisions,'' said Isaac Lagnado,
president of New York's Tactical Retail Solutions, a consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Lagnado and others credited Haas with leading the company
through a successful leveraged buyout in 1985 and a second stock
buyback in 1996 that put the company's ownership in even fewer
hands. When Haas came aboard, sales totaled just $2.6 billion. The
real problems didn't start until two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the company's reversal of fortunes, ``people who
invested in the company during the original buyout still have made
10 to 20 times their money,'' noted board member Warren Hellman, a
San Francisco investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his tenure, Haas was ``an outstanding CEO,'' Hellman
said. ``Ultimately you can judge a CEO not only on the job he does
but on how well he chooses a successor.''
</P>
<P>
   As a private company, Levi's executive-recruitment efforts were
hampered by its inability to provide stock options. But Marineau is
getting a very sweet pot, said people close to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is able to turn this around, he will be quite a wealthy
guy _ even wealthy by Internet standards,'' said one person close
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau will be paid an annual salary below $1 million; with
bonuses, his annual compensation will hit seven digits, a source
said. The real payoff, if Marineau manages a strong turnaround,
will come in three to five years, when he stands to receive tens of
millions of dollars in cash incentives tied to earnings and other
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The only other nonfamily member CEO was Robert Grohman, who ran
the company _ not very successfully _ from 1981 to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said he has no regrets about hiring someone outside the
family. No other family members are in active management of the
company, although Levi Strauss' descendants exercise firm control
over the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue to me is not about family versus nonfamily,'' Haas
said. ``The issue is about competency. This is a large, complex,
global business and just because your DNA pool happens to have Levi
Strauss as an ancestor really isn't a qualification for running
this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Marineau was chosen because he is a ``strong brand-builder,
somebody who has had experience in situations like this in renewing
the luster of strong brands,'' Haas said.
</P>
<P>
   Haas also described Marineau as a team-builder who will run
Levi's in the humane fashion it is famous for.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier stint at Quaker Oats Co., Marineau boosted sales
of Gatorade by more than 50 percent, and held off advances from
rival sports drinks introduced by Coke and Pepsi, said Manny
Goldman, beverage research coordinator for Merrill Lynch Global
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really pays attention to the details,'' said Goldman, who
has followed Marineau's projects for some 15 years. ``At Gatorade
he took something and made it into a fabulous brand. In the case of
Pepsi there was a complete turnaround,'' with Pepsi now gaining on
Coke for top market share in supermarket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he has a super opportunity to take this wonderful brand
(Levi's) and do something with it,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Marineau will have to quickly learn the ins and outs of
the rag trade, one analyst says Marineau's earlier consumer-product
experience is relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Reiter, president of Herbert Mines Associates, a New York
headhunter specializing in retail, said Marineau's experience is
relevant because Levi's ``needs to reinvent themselves, and
beverage companies are continually reinventing themselves.''

P.J. LOCKS HORNS WITH MOOSE'S
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ In the shadows and back alleys of North Beach,
they're whispering tales of P.J. the Pirate.
<P>
   P.J. Carlesimo haunts North Beach by night and has for the last
couple years _ ever since he started coaching the Oakland (aka:
Golden State) Warriors and found himself in need of frequent
unwinding, decompression and/or detoxification.
</P>
<P>
   Carlesimo is the coach who was choked by one of his players,
Latrell Sprewell, creating the only nonboring basketball news to
come out of Oakland in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   P.J.'s M.O., FYI, is to hold court at frequent, semi-impromptu
late-night dinner outings with many pals in N. Beach restaurants,
drowning his basketball sorrows in marinara.
</P>
<P>
   Now he and a few friends are in the process of buying Adolfo's,
a hip restaurant that wasn't quite hip enough to stay in business
and went arrividerci about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So P.J.'s bringing it back to life, but naturally he needs
people to run the place, so he snatched the GM from Moose's
restaurant, a former college chum, and P.J. eventually might wind
up spiriting away some other key Moose troops.
</P>
<P>
   Good restaurant help is hard to come by, and some say Moose's
antlers are glowing red over the defections.
</P>
<P>
   One Moose loyalist has a suggested name for P.J.'s new joint:
Machiavelli's.
</P>
<P>
   (Another suggestion: If P.J.'s restaurant needs someone to kill
the chickens, Sprewell's the man.)
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE IT wouldn't be fair to suggest that D.A. Terence Hallinan
adopt as his re-election campaign slogan: ``Keeping our jails
crime-free.''
</P>
<P>
   But a recent Chronicle story points out that Hallinan has the
lowest batting average among county D.A.s in terms of putting away
bad guys and gals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing his failing score at convictions,'' says Regan McMahon,
``makes me wonder if he shouldn't have been sent to mandatory
summer school for prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan, still fuming over The Chronicle story (and he hasn't
even seen the cheap shots printed above), was overheard at
McCormick &AMP; Kuleto's the other day, talking about publishing a
weekly D.A. newsletter detailing his criminal-fanny kicking.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND SCHOOLS meltdown update: Amazing as it seems, some
Oakland public school teachers opt to seek teaching jobs elsewhere,
at fancy schools where they have stuff like textbooks and toilet
paper.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, often these sinking-ship-jumper-offers, even if
they apply early, don't get hired elsewhere until July or August,
whereupon they resign their Oakland jobs, leaving Oakland
shorter-handed than it already is.
</P>
<P>
   My spies say George Musgrove, Oakland's interim superintendent
of schools, warned his teachers last week that everyone who resigns
after July 1 faces punishment. Musgrove will ask the state Board of
Education to suspend that person's teaching credential for one
year.
</P>
<P>
   That'll teach teachers not to apply in Oakland. And it will also
do wonders for the state's drastic teacher shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Cute kicker: A few Oakland teachers who resigned in May and June
might also get their credentials yanked for a year because the
woman in personnel who handled resignations resigned, and none of
the letters of resignation can be found.
</P>
<P>
   That's right: The dog ate their letters of resignation.
</P>
<P>
   OVERHEARD by keen-eared Bob Lacey, at the next lunch table at
the Miramar Beach Restaurant in Half Moon Bay:
</P>
<P>
   He: ``Did you read the article in today's Chronicle about
Attention Deficit Disorder?''
</P>
<P>
   She: ``Not all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Rimshot, please.)
</P>
<P>
   TIGER WOODS has inspired a legion of minority youngsters to take
up golf, and at Harding Park Monday I chatted with one of those
people.
</P>
<P>
   The bright young Asian American man told me he took up the sport
seriously two years ago after watching Tiger win the Masters, and
now he says he's close to breaking 80.
</P>
<P>
   The young man looked familiar. Sure enough, it was Michael Yaki,
the boyish S.F. supervisor, who helped the city set up Tiger's
two-day coaching clinic for inner-city kids.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the photo-op-type staginess of the event, once Tiger
ditched the suits and got down in the driving-range trenches with
the kids from the 'hood, it was hard to be a cynical observer.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger spent time with the kids, really showed 'em stuff. It was
a touching scene.
</P>
<P>
   I'd hate to saddle Tiger with a goody-goody image, but in sports
he is the anti-Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   As for supervisor Yaki's claim that he is close to breaking 80:
Big deal. I don't play much golf, but I've already broken way more
than 80 clubs.

 BUSH BLASTED FOR COMMENT ON IMMIGRANT COSTS  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who came to
California last week to strengthen his hand among Latinos, is now
facing fallout over his claim that the federal government has no
role in paying back states for costs of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The statement not only stirred up anger from at least one rival
presidential candidate _ but also immigration experts who said
Bush's statements appear counter to his own actions as the governor
of Texas, a border state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in an interview with The Chronicle last week, was
specifically asked if he would reimburse California for the
estimated billions of dollars the state spends annually on services
and education for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said the GOP front-runner. Asked for a reason, Bush
said, ``Because that's not a federal role, in my judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats both expressed surprise, noting that
Texas _ under Bush's own administration _ has tried to recover such
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Former California Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, waged a
three-year court battle to force the federal government to
reimburse California for $15 billion to cover the accumulated costs
of providing a public school education, medical care and other
services to 1.7 million illegal immigrants. In 1997, a lower court
ruled that the issue was a ``political question'' to be resolved by
the Congress and the president; the U.S. Supreme Court let that
decision stand.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mueller, communications director for GOP rival presidential
candidate Steve Forbes, seized on Bush's comments Tuesday, saying,
``Clearly, Gov. Bush doesn't seem to understand the problems _ or
where that responsibility lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Forbes) believes that defending the borders of the U.S. is a
federal responsibility _ so there is a responsibility to reimburse
states like California feeling the impact of illegal immigration,''
said Mueller. ``Based on Mr. Bush's record as governor, apparently
what he's saying is what's good for the people of Texas is not good
for the people of California.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Democratic Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa
was equally critical. ``It's hard to believe that Gov. George W.
Bush would hold the taxpayers of California responsible for
services provided to undocumented immigrants as a result of
decisions made beyond their control by the federal government,'' he
said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign declined official comment Tuesday. But Bush
supporters in California pointed out that the governor has had very
strong positions on border control issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefits aspect is not as simple as `will you or won't you
reimburse?' There are three areas: incarcerate, medicate and
educate,'' one supporter said. ``The California Legislature has
made decisions on what benefits, if any, they will subsidize. ...
It's not just a federal issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted in The Chronicle interview that Texas has a more
effective border control effort with its successful program called
Operation Hold the Line; he also said he does not support federal
benefits to illegal immigrants, except in emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments nonetheless underscored some potential political
pitfalls for the GOP front-runner, who has promised a strong
campaign in California and is scheduled to return to Silicon Valley
in late September. The Texas governor has made strong Latino
outreach a cornerstone of his campaign and has repeatedly
emphasized good relations with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But critics noted Bush's statements, in an interview Thursday
before his appearance at the Latin Business Association, appeared
to conflict with statements made earlier in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, his press secretary, Karen Hughes, issued a statement
regarding Bush's support of a legal appeal by Texas Attorney
General Dan Morales to recover $1.34 billion spent by his state on
incarceration and education of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair to the taxpayers of Texas to stick them with the
bill when the government fails to enforce immigration laws,''
Hughes said to reporters then.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wilson lost his battle in the courts, U.S. Senator Dianne
Feinstein has ``fought long and hard for more funding,''
specifically through the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program,
which reimburses states for the costs of incarcerating criminal
aliens, said her spokesman, Howard Gantman, Tuesday. ``It has been
an important issue to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Gantman cited a letter from border state legislators to the U.S.
Senate in July of this year _ signed by both Republican U.S.
senators from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm _ urging
the federal government to deliver a full appropriation of $500
million to states to pay for services to illegal immigrants held
for various criminal convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Trounstine, director of communications for California
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, said while California `has not taken a
position seeking reimbursement for the cost of education...(the
state) has a very strong position seeking reimbursement of hundreds
of millions for the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants..held
in county and state facilities while they're awaiting
deportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Stein, executive director of the Washington-based Federation
for American Immigration Reform, called Bush's statements ``totally
irresponsible ... (because) that sort of policy creates a
groundswell of antagonism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, immigration is the federal responsibility _
whether it is to control the border or assist communities in
handling the impact,'' said Stein. ``If states are given no
protection and no financial support for the costs, then the federal
government has no incentive to control the borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comment also ``sets the tone for what the immigrant
rhetoric is going to be for (Bush's) administration,'' said Luis
Arteaga, who heads the California-based Latino Issues Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Voters deserve to know ``what his position is on immigration _
legal and undocumented _ and what really he sees for the federal
government, and whether he's willing to pay up,'' said Arteaga.

MAYOR RE ELECTED BY WIDE MAR GIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza cruised to an easy re-election
Tuesday, with unofficial results showing him scoring a sweeping
victory over chief rival Randy Pullen.
</P>
<P>
   Pullen, a real estate consultant who formerly had supported
Rimsza, appeared to benefit from hotelier Steve Cohn's mocking
attacks on the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, voters stuck with the incumbent. With all
the votes counted, unofficial results gave Rimsza 59 percent of the
vote to Pullen's 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very gratifying,'' Rimsza said Tuesday night at a
celebration at his house in northeast Phoenix. ``We tried to focus
on the positive things for Phoenix, and it's exciting to see the
voters appreciated it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was applauded by a crowd that included his friend,
Richard Olsen, a Realtor, wearing a painted-on white mustache.
</P>
<P>
   The mustache was a joking reminder of signs put up by Cohn
featuring Rimsza with a milk mustache and the slogan ``Got
Milked?'' _ a reference to Cohn's view that Rimsza had backed a
hotel deal that was bad for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that (the painted mustache) to put a smile on Skip's
face,'' Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Pullen asserted that he ran a `hard, good campaign`` and that
his poor showing in mail-in vote totals indicated he lost because
he ran out of time to overcome Rimsza's name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the numbers tell me is once we got the message to the
people, they were responding,`` Pullen said.
</P>
<P>
   Two minor candidates in the mayoral race, Patrick Dardis, owner
of a small vending machine company, and longtime activist Anthony
Abril, were lagging far behind the two front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Pullen got his biggest boost not by scoring
ideological points on Rimsza but from hotel owner Cohn's relentless
anti-Rimsza publicity machine.
</P>
<P>
   But voters weren't won over by his message, choosing instead to
retain Rimsza, a former real estate salesman who joined the City
Council in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn, an owner of the Crowne Plaza hotel downtown, leaped into
action against Rimsza after the mayor piloted a city deal to help
build and finance a downtown Marriott that Cohn says would ruin his
business.
</P>
<P>
   After Cohn funded a petition drive for a referendum on the
issue, Rimsza and the council dropped the first deal, then voted
8-1 on June 30 to seal a second Marriott deal with an ``emergency
clause,'' which prohibits a public vote.
</P>
<P>
   The move kicked up public protests, also helped along by Cohn.
</P>
<P>
   He funded a new petition drive for a public vote on the hotels,
two lawsuits and several hundred of the ``Got Milked?'' signs. Cohn
also paid for a radio ad urging residents to vote for anyone but
Rimsza.
</P>
<P>
   Pullen jumped into the race minutes after the June vote, calling
the use of the emergency clause ``a subversion of the public
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Pullen's candidacy surprised just about everyone, particularly
since Pullen, 50, had been part of Rimsza's ``in'' crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Phoenix business insider, Pullen even had made a $300
donation to the mayor's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pullen opposed the Marriott vote, he himself had sought
city help for a hotel project earlier this year, when he and two
partners unsuccessfully sought $5 million in city incentives to
build a $50 million Jacksonian Hotel near Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Pullen's campaign began poorly when he released a list of
impressive movers and shakers that he said were supporting him,
only to have many of the biggest names on the list angrily deny
that they favored Pullen.
</P>
<P>
   Pullen said he ``misunderstood the level of their support.''
After that, much of his support appeared to come out of his own
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Pullen's campaign explored two themes: excessive crime in
Phoenix and Rimsza's arrogant use of the emergency clause to stop
public votes on big-ticket items, such as the Marriott and the
controversial Sumitomo Sitix plant in northeast Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Pullen pledged that the emergency clause would not be used
improperly on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders have long stated that a third large downtown hotel
is the key to successful redevelopment. Pullen contended that the
city must expand Civic Plaza, giving it enough room for major
national conventions, to guarantee enough business for three
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Pullen also asserted that crime in Phoenix remains out of
control. He blames mostly an influx of drugs and dealers, saying
that a stronger, more organized effort is needed to root them out,
including more and better-equipped police with more power to
determine the best ways to clean up the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, he said, the city needs more and better-equipped
police officers with greater leeway to use effective methods to
clean up the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza was elected mayor in 1994 in a special election after
former Mayor Paul Johnson resigned to run for governor. Rimsza was
re-elected in 1995 to a full four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza sees himself as CEO of a vast corporation, successfully
delivering services smoothly and efficiently to his customers.
</P>
<P>
   He vigorously defended his support of the emergency clause,
saying that a public vote, with an uncertain outcome, could have
killed the deal for a hotel critical to the downtown's future.
</P>
<P>
   Rimsza campaigned on his goals for the next four years: saving
open space, improving public transit and equipping the police
department with a crime-fighting computer network. &QL;

   1. JUDE LAW : LAW OF THE LAND British actor Jude Law has a
penchant for dark, challenging roles, playing an alcoholic cripple
in ``Gattaca'' and a hustler in ``Midnight in the Garden of Good
and Evil.'' He may finally find mainstream fame with his next role,
alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett in ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley.'' By James Fallon. From Women's Wear Daily.
750 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 2. LL
COOL J : FROM THE STREET TO THE SCREEN His name is James Todd
Smith, but fans know him as LL Cool J - one of rap's
longest-running stars (15 years and over 20 million CDs sold,) and
an emerging actor. His stage name, taken as a teenager, stands for
Ladies Love Cool James. In ``Deep Blue Sea,'' he plays an amiable
shark-fighting chef, but the biggest role he's undertaken is in the
just-released drugs and crime movie, ``In Too Deep,'' in which he
plays an evil millionaire who goes by the name of God. In this
film, the ladies will not love cool James, nor will the men. It may
seem unlikely that LL Cool J should play such a hard character as
he is one of the hip-hop world's good guys. By Jim Sullivan. BPI.
1,300 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
JAPANESE POCKET MONSTERS TAKE OVER AMERICA'S YOUNG The new Japanese
invention for children proves equally intriguing to parents : It
sends 3- to 11-year-olds bounding out of bed at the crack of dawn,
eager to start the day. It's not a high-tech alarm clock. It's a
``Pokemon'' which is short for ``pocket monster.'' ``Pokemon''
finished the 1998-99 season as the No. 1 children's show in the
United States. The animated series concerns the quest to capture
all 150 species of pocket monsters, which range from fuzzy and cute
to things that look like escaped mutants from ``Star Wars.''
``Pokemon'' has achieved its hit status without displays of
bloodshed or weaponry, or even sophisticated animation. By Laurel
Graeber. 1,300 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
ALESSANDRO NIVOLA BUILDS CAREER THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY Actor
Alessandro Nivola made a big splash as Nicolas Cage's brother in
the action hit ``Face/Off.'' Now he has three major films on the
way. In ``Best Laid Plans,'' he and teen queen Reese Witherspoon
play lovers in jeopardy. Nivola follows that with ``Mansfield
Park,'' based on the Jane Austen novel, and then makes his singing
debut for director Kenneth Branagh in the ambitious musical version
of Shakespeare's : ``Love's Labours Lost.'' By Joshua Mooney. BPI.

<P>
   5. NOAH WYLE : FROM 'ER' TO KOSOVO Noah Wyle, ``E.R.'s'' dashing
Dr. John Carter, spent the first two weeks of his summer in Kosovo
as a guest of the group Doctors of the World. Wyle visited refugee
camps and observed medical teams at work, spending most of his time
in one tent city where six doctors cared for about 12,000 refugees
fleeing ethnic purging. ``It was unbelievable. I've never seen such
acts of heroism in aid of such acts of senseless brutality. I came
back shaken to the core,'' says Wyle. By Christopher Loudon. 1,200
words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
KEVIN BACON GOES SUPERNATURAL Kevin Bacon has never had a psychic
experience but he's not a firm disbeliever. ``I'm totally open to
it,'' he says. ``If there are spirits out there that want to
contact me ... I'll sign autographs.'' His scary new movie ``Stir
of Echoes'' is the latest and creepiest in a series of horror films
this summer. Bacon performs one manic, over-the-top sequence which
is drawing comparisons to Jack Nicholson's work in ``The Shining.''
By Ian Spelling. 900 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 7.
HEATHER LOCKLEAR VS. THE TELETUBBIES Heather Locklear, one of the
most famous blondes in Los Angeles, says she can't compete with the
children's TV show ``Teletubbies''. The greatest challenge of TV's
favourite vixen (''Melrose Place,'') is dealing with her young
daughter's insistence on watching the Teletubbies. By C. Pearlman.
1,100 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 8.
SUDDENLY SINGLE : A TOUGH YEAR FOR BROOKE SHIELDS ``It's been one
of the roughest years of my life,'' says actress Brooke Shields. In
the last few months she has survived a series of difficult personal
experiences which, in combination, might have felled a less
balanced individual. By Ivor Davis. 1,300 words + photo. (N/A Great
Britain and Australia.)
_____________________________________________________________ 9.
KEVIN COSTNER For the love of a game called acting, Kevin Costner
insisted that director Sam Raimi let him fall apart in his new
baseball movie ``For Love of the Game, `` in which he plays an
aging superstar baseball pitcher who, during the course of one
final game, reflects on his life, his love and his losses. In many
ways, Costner is like his character, a man who appears to have it
all. Although he is a superstar millionaire with all the trappings
of success, Costner says there are still many days when he feels
very alone. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo.

There will be an avalanche of millennium T-shirts, caps, movies,

non-story about a concocted event that isn't going to change
anything. By DONALD G. SMITH.

   MILLENNIAL-DATE (San Ramon, Calif.) _ OK, I get the point.
Despite the big hoopla over the next New Year's Eve, I am now fully
aware that the new millennium doesn't actually begin until 2001.
The purists who insist on the 2001 date don't care that the rest of
the world is caught up in millennium fever, or that we are excited
because we will soon get to write a 2 instead of a 1. They don't
care that we want to party. By EILEEN MITCHELL.

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA: Donations from Ohio ease life on South Dakota
reservation
 &HT;    (With photos, locator map.)
 &HT;    By Cathy Mong
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEYENNE RIVER RESERVATION, S.D. _ Dianna Longbrake was admiring
a pair of Reeboks that fit her almost perfectly and looked like
new. ``We were up at 6 a.m. waiting for this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The jogging shoes were just one of the finds Longbrake was
celebrating this week among miles of rolling prairie at the home of
Delores Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first day of the Miami Valley (Ohio) Council for
Native Americans clothing distribution, compliments of generous
Ohioans.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the man who brought the donations from suburban
Ohio to the South Dakota reservation involves many spiritual as
well as physical journeys. Guy Jones, the Dayton-area council's
director and a native of the reservation, led the caravan of trucks
and cars that arrived Sunday with hundreds of bags of clothing and
school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Although residents here are among the poorest in the country, it
is an area rich in pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is put it all on the ground,'' Jones said.
``Everything has to touch the ground first. Once it touches the
ground, we no longer own it. Being that it doesn't belong to
anyone, it isn't charity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need these things,'' said Longbrake, a teacher's
aide at Takini School, which serves children from Bridger, Red
Scaffold and Cherry Creek, S.D. ``This is how we stay afloat.''
Takini, translated, means ``survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the clothing she will choose from among the piles will
outfit her three sons for the entire school year.
</P>
<P>
   Longbrake said that while making ends meet is a challenge, it is
the life she and her husband have chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out of something, you just do without,'' she said.
``You pay bills and whatever is left is what you have. McDonald's
is a treat,'' and it's a two-hour trip to the nearest one, in
Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   She said her family is not ``into the hassle, the fast pace'' of
mainstream America, ``but there are things we take for granted,
like the river, the clean air.''
</P>
<P>
   Survival can be difficult, but Celastis Belt said she and her
husband wouldn't live anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I'm born and this is where I'm raised,'' she
said. Even so, the 58-year-old admitted it would be nice to be able
to buy enough propane for heating and to pay her electric bill.
</P>
<P>
   She said her focus is more on fulfilling her spiritual rather
than materialistic needs. ``The Bible says, `Ask in my name and you
shall receive it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Belt said the southern portion of the reservation is neglected
by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. That is due in part to its
sparse and widely dispersed population. There are fewer than 8,000
people on the 3,500-square-mile reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's distribution was very small in comparison with those
coming up in Eagle Butte and McLaughlin. That doesn't matter to
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched as a boy tried on a coat,'' Jones said. ``As long as
one person found something he needed, that's what we're doing this
for.''
</P>
<P>
   'They want to be Indian'
</P>
<P>
   This is the seventh year the caravan, led by Jones, a
43-year-old Lakota Indian, has set up distribution sites to some of
the nation's most isolated and neediest people.
</P>
<P>
   On Pine Ridge Reservation, about 90 miles south of the Cheyenne
River Reservation in the Badlands, per capita income is about
$3,100; it averages $4,478 on all other reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is the Ohioans who feel the benefit of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people teach us what it is to give,'' said Arlene
Mendenhall, 60, a five-year volunteer with the council. ``It is a
very humbling experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakota, more commonly known as Sioux, are deeply connected
to their land. It is one of the reasons the Ohioans return year
after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have nothing,'' Mendenhall said. ``Coming from our
culture, you just can't understand why they stay. Then you get to
know them, and you get to know they want to hold on to what they
have. They want to be Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   Delores Buffalo hosted the weary Ohio travelers at her home in a
valley alongside the Cheyenne River in Bridger.
</P>
<P>
   They pitched tents and lived among the 30 or so families there.
Buffalo's daughter, Mary, helped with the cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Buffalo, 38, lives in Philip, about 40 miles south of
Bridger. The 1,000 or so people in town sometimes get on her
nerves, so she and 2 1/2-year-old daughter Amanda climb in their
1978 Ford LTD and pay a visit. ``There, at my mother's house, you
can hear the coyotes at night. You can hear the owls.''
</P>
<P>
   The truckloads of donations make the difference for people
living in such sparsely populated places as Little Eagle, Promise,
and Messiah, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   People like Mary Buffalo, who used the donations to clothe
Amanda all year and only recently had to buy additional shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I receive my SSI check for $500 on the 1st of the month, and
by the 2nd, we're maybe setting with $40 in the bank,'' Mary
Buffalo said.
</P>
<P>
   That's after paying $125 for her two-bedroom apartment, which is
government subsidized, and other monthly bills. Food stamps cover
the groceries, but shopping in Philip is more expensive than
driving 86 miles to Sioux Falls.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Buffalo isn't complaining. ``My mother and father
taught us to appreciate what we have. I lived by that,'' she said.
``If you don't have the money for it, let it go. Someday, if you
are to have it, you will get it. Don't wish for more than you
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Buffalo's moving to Philip placed her among people who did
not necessarily like having her there, despite the town's proximity
to reservations. ``I have faced discrimination but I've fought my
way up to where I feel like an equal. These people know me for my
anger,'' she said. ``I don't back down. I am comfortable with who I
am, a full-blooded Sioux Native American woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing attitudes Guy Jones, who leads these treks from Ohio
back home to the reservation every year, has logged a leap or two
on his own personal journey, shedding anger, fear, shame and guilt,
which he calls the stepping stones of prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like people,'' Jones said. ``I wouldn't have been
talking to you 20 years ago. The reason I hated (whites) was
because I was shameful of who I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is married to a black woman, Angela Jones, a caseworker at
an addiction center and a Jefferson Twp. , Ohio, trustee. They have
one son, Dakota, 10.
</P>
<P>
   Jones left the reservation after graduating high school in 1974;
at school, he had been one of only a few non-white students. He had
attended Indian schools in early grades but made the decision to
enroll in the public school in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating he took odd jobs in 37 states, changing light
bulbs in a Texas stadium, driving cattle in Oklahoma. ``I felt the
need to experience the world,'' he said. ``I saw the good side of
America, I saw the bad side of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones made friends with all peoples, he said. ``I was on my way
East, on a bus, and I had a two-hour layover in Dayton. I met a man
and it was the first time a white person was civil to me,'' Jones
said. It was 1981. ``I thought, if there's one, there's gotta be
another.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was in Dayton that he learned of contributions that
his culture made to civilization. ``I thought, this is a good area
to do something. I can change some stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones will resign Sept. 30 as executive director of the
organization he founded, but he has no intention of walking away
from the group or its focus on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to expand what is going on,'' Jones said. ``I want the
next generation to be able to sustain itself and be a part of the
economic growth so many see in this country. Maybe by taking
computers, by taking books to the reservation, we will open the
mind of a child. If you open a child's mind, then someday, maybe, I
won't have to make this trip.''

 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA: Donations from Ohio ease life on South Dakota
reservation
 &HT;    (With photos, locator map.)
 &HT;    By Cathy Mong
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEYENNE RIVER RESERVATION, S.D. _ Dianna Longbrake was admiring
a pair of Reeboks that fit her almost perfectly and looked like
new. ``We were up at 6 a.m. waiting for this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The jogging shoes were just one of the finds Longbrake was
celebrating this week among miles of rolling prairie at the home of
Delores Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first day of the Miami Valley (Ohio) Council for
Native Americans clothing distribution, compliments of generous
Ohioans.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the man who brought the donations from suburban
Ohio to the South Dakota reservation involves many spiritual as
well as physical journeys. Guy Jones, the Dayton-area council's
director and a native of the reservation, led the caravan of trucks
and cars that arrived Sunday with hundreds of bags of clothing and
school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Although residents here are among the poorest in the country, it
is an area rich in pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is put it all on the ground,'' Jones said.
``Everything has to touch the ground first. Once it touches the
ground, we no longer own it. Being that it doesn't belong to
anyone, it isn't charity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need these things,'' said Longbrake, a teacher's
aide at Takini School, which serves children from Bridger, Red
Scaffold and Cherry Creek, S.D. ``This is how we stay afloat.''
Takini, translated, means ``survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the clothing she will choose from among the piles will
outfit her three sons for the entire school year.
</P>
<P>
   Longbrake said that while making ends meet is a challenge, it is
the life she and her husband have chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out of something, you just do without,'' she said.
``You pay bills and whatever is left is what you have. McDonald's
is a treat,'' and it's a two-hour trip to the nearest one, in
Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   She said her family is not ``into the hassle, the fast pace'' of
mainstream America, ``but there are things we take for granted,
like the river, the clean air.''
</P>
<P>
   Survival can be difficult, but Celastis Belt said she and her
husband wouldn't live anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I'm born and this is where I'm raised,'' she
said. Even so, the 58-year-old admitted it would be nice to be able
to buy enough propane for heating and to pay her electric bill.
</P>
<P>
   She said her focus is more on fulfilling her spiritual rather
than materialistic needs. ``The Bible says, `Ask in my name and you
shall receive it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Belt said the southern portion of the reservation is neglected
by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. That is due in part to its
sparse and widely dispersed population. There are fewer than 8,000
people on the 3,500-square-mile reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's distribution was very small in comparison with those
coming up in Eagle Butte and McLaughlin. That doesn't matter to
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched as a boy tried on a coat,'' Jones said. ``As long as
one person found something he needed, that's what we're doing this
for.''
</P>
<P>
   'They want to be Indian'

 &HT;    Terminator gene protects seed company's investment
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. _ Gene-altered crops represent a giant new
market for seed companies, but they also pose a vexing business
problem.
</P>
<P>
   How is a company to protect its investment when seeds grow into
plants that produce more seeds?
</P>
<P>
   Today, farmers who buy commercial seeds altered to resist pests,
herbicides or viruses must sign papers agreeing not to collect and
save seeds for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Seed companies aggressively remind farmers that it's illegal to
save gene-altered seeds, which are patented.
</P>
<P>
   But a more foolproof method is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   A Mississippi seed company and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture are jointly developing technology for what is referred
to in the industry as the ``terminator gene.''
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, it sterilizes seeds, ensuring that farmers will come
knocking for more seed each planting season.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Rissler, senior staff scientist for the Union of Concerned
Scientists, calls the technology ``an elegant little piece of
genetic engineering'' that allows a seed to develop normally, while
killing the embryo that would germinate and grow into a plant.
</P>
<P>
   This new genetic technology _ officially called the Technology
Protection System _ is not expected to be ready for commercial use
until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But Rissler and others worry that it will put control of the
seed market in the hands of a few large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto Co., a pioneer in the gene-altered seed business, is
buying Delta and Pine Land Co., which holds the patent on the
terminator technology with the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists warn that the trait for seed sterility might travel,
via pollen, making the seeds of neighboring plants sterile.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers just don't like the idea.
</P>
<P>
   As Kevin O'Dare, an organic farmer in Vero Beach, puts it: ``Man
and seeds go back a long time.''

 &HT;    Fliers paying price for lower fares
 &HT;    By Tom Blackburn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Have a good flight?
</P>
<P>
   This summer, it was better not to ask.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers were nasty. The flight attendants were surly. The
gate agents were brusque. And the bad news was, your flight was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   So what did you expect to get for low fares? A stateroom and a
valet?
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years into the era of airline deregulation _ the United
States will observe the anniversary but not celebrate it on Oct. 24
_ the flying public is in the clutches of Procrustes and Hobson.
</P>
<P>
   Procrustes was a mythical Greek who seized passersby and either
stretched their bodies or trimmed their legs to fit them into his
bed. Hobson was a real British livery-stable owner who made his
customers take the horse nearest the door, regardless of which one
they wanted to rent.
</P>
<P>
   Seat size differs slightly from airline to airline and by type
of plane, but Procrustes works for all of them. Seats are less than
17 inches wide and 31 to 34 inches apart. They don't recline as far
as they used to. If they did, you'd be looking up the nostrils of
the passenger behind you. And he would spill coffee on you as he
tried to get it to his lips without moving elbows locked to his
ribs by his seatmates.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're thinking of using the restroom, forget it. Flight
attendants block the aisle with the drink cart while they pass out
trail mix. The restroom probably is occupied anyway. The coach
cabin on the new Boeing 737-800 has two toilets for 140 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   An obstructive cart set off Patricia Lemerise of Miami on Aug.
5. She got into a shouting match with flight attendants, so police
in Boston met her at the gate and carted her off to jail for five
hours. American Airlines banned her for life. ``The customer is
always right'' is inoperative.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hobson decides whether, when and what you eat on a flight.
Canny passengers bring their own provisions and leave behind sticky
or suspicious-looking substances that there isn't time to clean up
when planes have to be turned around quickly for their next leg.
</P>
<P>
   Procrustean seats and hunger are only the middle stage of a
journey that starts with standing in lines and ends with a 1-in-200
chance that the luggage is lost or damaged. Business travelers may
fly 200 times in a year or two, making it even money that sometime
they will be in Detroit while their clothes fly on to Denver. Mr.
Hobson also picks out your airline for you. It's Delta 90 percent
of the time if you fly from Cincinnati, U.S. Airways 87 percent of
the time from Pittsburgh and Northwest 82 percent of the time from
Minneapolis-St. Paul. Those are their hubs, and they defend them
from interlopers. If you don't like it, drive.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists long ago showed that hostile behavior arises when
rats are frustrated and crowded. Even laboratory rats eat something
better than trail mix.
</P>
<P>
   If people were of uniform size and behaved as ducks do in a
shooting gallery, loading 150 or 200 of them aboard an airplane
would be easy. But they aren't. They have needs and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger blocking the aisle while pushing a 200-pound bag
that clearly won't fit into the overhead rack once attended a
business meeting in yesterday's underwear because his checked bag
was lost. The mother pushing the two-seat stroller that won't fit
anywhere needs to get two small children from Gate C29 to Gate A27
in 30 minutes for the connecting flight if her plane is on time.
Which it may not be.
</P>
<P>
   More than three flights in 10 arrived late in June. One day in
May, in one airport (Newark), Continental burned off 31,000
passenger hours with takeoff delays. In this long summer of
waiting, the Federal Aviation Administration has been updating its
flight radar, with predictable glitches. The airlines would like to
blame the FAA for everything. But Europe's airlines and airports
have been experiencing the same delays, an ocean away from the FAA
radar.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's balky radar or stormy weather, the hub-and-spoke
system magnifies delays. There may be clear skies between South
Florida and Dallas-Fort Worth. But if Mr. Hobson decides the only
way to get there is by changing in Atlanta to a flight that
originates in Chicago, you need to be concerned about Chicago's
weather. That's the case whether you hope to fly in that plane or
are on another flight waiting for inbound passengers from Chicago
to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have anxieties about travel in general or flying in
particular, and when the nicotine-addicted fliers lost their
pacifiers on smoke-free planes and airports, it added to tensions
that would exist under the best conditions. Air travel these days
doesn't offer the best conditions, which would be a stateroom and a
valet.
</P>
<P>
   Deliver us from the wrath of cranky and rerouted passengers,
cried flight attendants last year. Their prayer was heard. Now the
airlines allow their personnel to cop an attitude before the
passengers start. In Philadelphia, gate agents practically dare
anyone to try to board before they call his row number.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the airlines boarded 641 million passengers, most of
them repeaters, of course. But eight in 10 American adults have
flown, up from 65 percent in 1979, when the federal government
stopped telling airlines where they must fly and what they could
charge. Passenger miles more than doubled. More significantly,
planes flew 62.97 percent full in 1979 but at 70.86 percent of
capacity last year.
</P>
<P>
   That means the middle seat in the row is more likely to be
occupied. In surveys, passengers tend to be happier with their
flight when that seat is empty. The first 1,000-passenger airplane
is on the drawing boards (at Airbus). No word yet on how all those
passengers will be assembled and herded in and around the nation's
airports, or where they will be stacked when flights are delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Airports have opened more shops and restaurants to help trapped
travelers while away the hours. But none of that gets them from
here to there. Airlines still advertise the mystique of flying, but
they are common carriers with vulgar customers and the amenities of
a Bolivian intra-city bus.
</P>
<P>
   That's what passengers get, however, for a decision that usually
starts with low fares. If you call an airline or travel agent, what
do you mention? The lowest available fare. What do company travel
offices look for? The lowest available fare. Several Internet sites
promise they'll have the lowest available fare; no site specializes
in seeking the best food or the widest seats. Competition in the
industry means: the lowest available fare.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation does keep fares low _ if you live in the right
places and fly to the right destinations. A landmark study found
that fares in constant dollars are lower today than after President
Carter signed the deregulation law for 21 of 25 routes over 800
miles and 14 of 15 routes over 1,100 miles. But in 16 of 25
markets, fares actually have increased for flights under 700 miles.
Low fares are common from New York to Palm Beach International
Airport. Trips with less demand _ say, West Palm Beach to
Tallahassee _ often cost more than flights of twice the distance.
It's the difference between bus service and cab fare.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines lost money holding down fares after deregulation.
That's not common knowledge. But lately, investment advisers, in
the course of advising on computer stocks, have nervously pointed
out that running airlines, and railroads before them, hasn't been
very profitable. As with computer stocks, profits were made
building, selling or merging. Profitable hospitality and shipping
businesses have been created around airlines, but making money by
flying passengers proved difficult.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, the major airlines that make up the Air Transport
Association had lost a cumulative $4.867 billion since 1947. They
became profitable again in 1995. To get profits, they cut down on
space, on meals, on personnel and even cut down on air. Yes, they
reduced air circulation by half on their planes in the mid-1980s,
increasing vagrant germs while banning sidestream smoke. They
learned to match smaller planes with less-traveled routes and run
them through hubs instead of offering direct flights. That makes
passengers do part of their trip by foot from concourse to
concourse.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines that are making money aren't about to change any of
that. If cheap is the goal, Procrustes &AMP; Hobson set the standards
of hospitality. The airlines can afford to wait until everyone gets
tired of hearing everyone else talk about how miserable their
flight was.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him: q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com

   Q: The September issue of GQ magazine mentions former presidents
and their football careers. It states that Jimmy Carter was a
college football player. I know he attended Georgia Tech and the
Naval Academy, but I didn't know he played football. What can you
tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: Carter attended Georgia Southwestern College and Georgia Tech
and graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946. It was at the academy
where his ``short-lived football career'' occurred, said Carrie
Harmon, spokeswoman at the Carter Presidential Center. He was on
the ``under-140-pound team,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the eye surgery Atlanta
Braves pitcher Greg Maddux had?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maddux, who was nearsighted, underwent laser eye surgery on
July 9 at Emory Vision Correction Center. It enabled him to shed
both the glasses he often wore off the field, and the contacts he
wore while pitching. He was back on the mound less than 48 hours
after the surgery, pitching against the Boston Red Sox in a game he
won, allowing one run in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux said he had the procedure done for personal reasons, not
in hopes that it would improve his pitching, but in fact he said
he's now more comfortable on the mound. He added that until the
surgery, he pitched in contacts because they gave him better
peripheral vision than glasses. But he said the contacts were
constantly irritating his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is George W. Bush, the frontrunner for the Republican
presidential nomination, George W. Bush Jr.? If he doesn't use the
Jr., is it intended to confuse older voters into thinking he is
George Bush Sr.?
</P>
<P>
   A: He isn't a junior, so there's no ulterior motive. His full
name is George Walker Bush. His father's full name is George
Herbert Walker Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An item about Sen. Strom Thurmond's recent release from a
hospital said he was accompanied by his wife, Nancy. I thought they
were divorced. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're separated, not divorced, but remain on ``friendly
terms,'' said John DeCrosta, Thurmond's spokesman. At last report
the senator lived in Washington and Nancy Thurmond lived in Aiken,
S.C. Thurmond (R-S.C.) married his first wife, Jean Crouch, in
1947. She died of a brain tumor in 1960. He married Nancy Moore, a
former Miss South Carolina, in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, 96, who had successful surgery for an enlarged
prostate, was released Aug. 30 from Walter Reed Army Medical Center
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The newspaper recently listed three singers who will be
inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame this month. Can you do
a favor for country music fans and list all the members?
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad to. The first Hall of Famers _ Jimmie Rodgers, Fred Rose
and Hank Williams _ were elected in 1961. Here are the others, by
decade:
</P>
<P>
   1960s: '62, Roy Acuff; (none in '63); '64, Tex Ritter; '65,

</P>
<P>
   The three for this year, to be inducted Sept. 22 during the
telecast of ``The 33rd Annual CMA Awards'' of the Country Music
Association, are Dolly Parton, Conway Twitty and Johnny Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The shutdown of the Russian space station Mir made me wonder:
Whatever happened to Buran, the Soviet version of America's space
shuttle?
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report the VKK, or Vozdushno Kosmicheskiy Korabl, was
being used as a tourist attraction in Moscow's Gorky Park. It was
opened as a flight simulator there in 1996, with ``passengers''
paying $35 for a 40-minute simulated flight complete with space
food. Buran (meaning Siberian snowstorm) actually was the name of
the maiden orbiter, but was transplanted to the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The crewless craft, which used an expendable booster instead of
main engines, was launched into space for the first, and last, time
Nov. 15, 1988. Controlled by autopilot, it made two orbits before
landing at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Beginning in
1989, shortages of funds caused long delays in further development
of the Buran program, and in 1993 work on the program ended.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that movie ratings have been changed several times
over the years. When did they start, and what have they been?
</P>
<P>
   A: The voluntary rating system replacing the old Hays Production
Code was introduced on Nov. 1, 1968. It called for four rating
categories: G (general audiences, all ages admitted); M (mature
audiences, all ages admitted, but parental guidance suggested); R
(restricted, with children younger than 16 not admitted without an
accompanying parent or adult guardian, later raised to children
younger than 17, but varying in some jurisdictions); and X (no one
younger than 17 admitted).
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association of America said it discovered
early on that most parents regarded M as sterner than R, so to
remedy the misconception, M was changed to GP (meaning general
audiences, parental guidance suggested). That was subsequently
changed to PG: parental guidance suggested.
</P>
<P>
   More adustments followed. In 1984, PG was split into PG and
PG-13, with the latter indicating films with a higher level of
intensity than PG. In 1990, a further revision was adopted to
provide explanations of why a film was rated R, and after that
explanations were added in the PG and PG-13 categories. When the X
category was changed that same year to NC-17 (no children 17 or
younger), it also was accompanied by an explanation. The ratings
are still G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the religious affiliations of our early presidents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let's take the first 10: George Washington, Episcopalian;
John Adams, Unitarian; Thomas Jefferson, no specific denomination;
James Madison and James Monroe, both Episcopalian; John Quincy
Adams, Unitarian; Andrew Jackson, Presbyterian; Martin Van Buren,
Dutch Reformed; and William Henry Harrison and John Tyler, both
Episcopalian.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long is protection afforded past presidents and their
wives or widows? May they refuse this protection if they choose to,
especially a widow?
</P>
<P>
   A: Secret Service protection is provided for the life of an
ex-president, as well as for a widow. While either a former
president or a widow certainly could refuse it, the only one who
actually has done so is Richard Nixon, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. He added that in 1998, President Ford
lobbied to stop a move in Congress to limit the period of Secret
Service protection and some of the retirement perks available to
former presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I occasionally see references in the news to a ``land-grant
university.'' Exactly what is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a school endowed under the Morrill (or Land-Grant) Act
of 1862, which was sponsored by Rep. Justin Morrill (R-Vt.). Under
the act, Congress granted every state 30,000 acres of land for each
senator and representative it had in Congress. The land was to be
sold, the proceeds invested, and the income used to create and
maintain a college for agriculture and the mechanical arts.
</P>
<P>
   The act came about because in the mid-1800s people had clamored
for colleges to teach the finer points of farming and
manufacturing. When it was passed, the act added military science
and tactics to the proposed farming and manufacturing curriculum.
Altogether, the states and territories received 11.3 million acres
of land. Congress added money to its gifts through the Second
Morrill Act of 1890 and an amendment in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   While not all states used the land-grant money as planned by the
act, with some giving money to state universities to finance new
agricultural and mechanical departments and a few giving the money
to private colleges, the education value of the land-grant program
is considered invaluable. Today, all states and Puerto Rico receive
federal grants to help support land-grant universities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that the woman in Antarctica who discovered a
lump in her breast, necessitating an emergency drop of medical
supplies, is the only doctor there. During my last tour of duty in
Antarctica in 1972, there was a doctor at Pole Station and at
McMurdo. Does McMurdo no longer have a doctor in the
``winter-over''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both McMurdo and South Pole stations still have physicians,
said Peter West of the National Science Foundation. But there are
several practical reasons why one doctor can't assist the other.
First, the two stations are roughly 800 miles apart. Land travel
between them is impossible because no roads exist, and the stations
are separated by the transantarctic mountain range. Second,
aircraft operations aren't conducted during the austral, or
southern, winter because of the extreme cold and the effects of the
temperatures on hydraulic and other critical systems. Third,
there's total darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns about the weather conditions, and because
air traffic control and accompanying electronic aids to aircraft
navigation are extremely limited, no landing of an aircraft has
ever been attempted at the Pole during the austral winter in the
history of the U.S. program. The recent drop of supplies was
accomplished by an aircraft flying from Christchurch, New Zealand.
It was accompanied by a tanker for mid-air refueling.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation, by the way, operates the U.S.
Antarctic Program with logistical assistance from the Air Force,
the Air National Guard, and Antarctic Support Associates, a private
contractor in Colorado.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is the emergency number 911 used nationwide?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It's the system to reach Emergency Medical Services in
nearly half the United States, but the telephone number can vary
from community to community, according to a spokesman at the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The winner of the $116 million Big Game jackpot Aug. 3
actually got $60 million because he chose Cash Option. What
happened to the other $56 million?
</P>
<P>
   A: The advertised jackpot for Big Game is its estimated
annuitized value over 26 years, or the total cumulative amount a
winner would receive if he or she took the prize in annual payments
over that period. When Big Game jackpots are paid out over 26
years, the first annual payment is cash. For the remaining 25
years, the lottery buys U.S. government treasury securities, which
earn interest and mature annually. That annual return is the amount
winners receive each year.
</P>
<P>
   If Thomas ``Randy'' Kerfoot of Chattanooga, Tenn., the Big Game
winner Aug. 3, had elected to have his prize money spread over 26
years, it would have totaled $116 million. But he chose to have the
prize paid immediately, so he got $60 million (actually reduced to
$40 million after taxes).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent editorial column reported on a judge who overturned
rules of the Federal Communications Commission regarding privacy of
telephone records. What is the name of the judge, and what is the
address?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Denver. The two who voted to overturn the FCC rules are
Judge Deanell Reese Tacha and Judge David M. Ebel. Judge Mary Beck
Briscoe was the dissenter. You can write to any of them at this
address: U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, Byron White
U.S. Courthouse, 1823 Stout St., Denver, CO 80257.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The hoarding of pennies and subsequent shortage in some
places have been widely reported . Apparently some merchants are
having problems. Since lots of people consider pennies a nuisance
anyway, has any consideration been given to simply removing them
from circulation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although this issue comes up occasionally, the Treasury
Department says it has no plans to stop production of pennies. Even
if it wanted to do so, such a change in the nation's monetary
system would require congressional authorization.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense of keeping the 1-cent piece, the U.S. Mint cites
a 1976 study of possible consequences if their production were to
be halted and the coins removed from circulation. Problems, the
study concluded, would be a potential inflationary impact and
possible difficulties collecting sales taxes. A majority of state
revenue collection departments, retail companies and commercial
banks strongly objected to the idea of eliminating the penny.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Ann Stock, at one time the Clinton White
House social secretary? I haven't seen her name in the news lately.
</P>
<P>
   A: Stock left her White House position in 1997 after 4 1/2 years
to become vice president of institutional affairs at the Kennedy
Center in Washington. She was replaced by Capricia Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Stock's latest project, outside of her Kennedy Center duties,
dovetails nicely with her background at the White House, which
included overseeing some 2,000 social events, ranging from intimate
teas to South Lawn picnics to state dinners. She and Walter Scheib,
whose experience includes being executive chef at the White House,
have compiled a cookbook, which isn't yet out. Royalties from the
book will benefit a nonprofit organization in the same way Hillary
Clinton's book, ``It Takes a Village,'' did, she told The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The book is said to include recipes and party-planning tips
focusing on what Stock described as the Clinton White House's
``fresh, uniquely American style of food and entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the baseball standings in the sports pages, Atlanta was
listed as being 3 1/2 games ahead of New York. Where does the half
game come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Half-game differences in standings occur when teams have
played an uneven number of games. For instance, if the Braves were
84 and 50 (a total of 134), and the Mets were 80 and 53 (a total of
133), the Braves would have a 3 1/2-game lead. For each game won or
lost, a team either gains or slips a half game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any danger in using a cell phone while filling your
gas tank? I recently overhead a station attendant telling someone
not to talk on his phone.
</P>
<P>
   A: Fires at gas stations ignited by sparks from cell phones have
been reported, but they appear to be nothing more than the latest
urban myth. No such fires have been substantiated, said Shawn
Steward of BellSouth Cellular Corp. ``There's no way it would be
possible for a cell phone to create sparks that would ignite
gasoline vapors,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some gas station chains apparently plan to put a
warning label on some of their pumps ``basically to cover
themselves in case something could happen,'' Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle reported recently that some Canadian
newspapers had reported an incident in a tiny mining community in
British Columbia. According to the story, a man was torched when a
spark from his phone ignited gas fumes while he was filling up. In
the typical manner of urban myths, reports quickly surfaced about
similiar incidents in Indonesia, Finland and Australia. But all
appear to be hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   David McKinney, spokesman for the Shell/Texaco marketing
consortium Equilon Enterprises, told the Chronicle that his company
will not post warnings to cell phone users. ``We have no reason to
believe it's a safety issue,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the American flag is flown with the flag of another
country, on what side of the Stars and Stripes does the other flag
go?
</P>
<P>
   A: When the viewer is facing the flags, the U.S. flag should be
on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the strongest earthquake recorded since the beginning
of the use of the Richter scale?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sources disagree. According to The Weather Almanac, the
largest earthquakes of record were rated at magnitude 8.9. But the
almanac observes that magnitude determinations may vary with the
observatory, equipment and methods of estimating. For example, the
Alaska quake of March 27, 1964, was described variously as 8.4, 8.5
and 8.6 by different stations.
</P>
<P>
   World Almanac 1999, meanwhile, lists a magnitude 9.2 for the
1964 Alaska quake, and 9.5 for a series of quakes in Chile in May
1960 . World Almanac also lists these other major earthquakes:
April 1905, Kangra, India, 8.6; August 1906, Valparaiso, Chile,
8.6; December 1920, Gansu, China, 8.6; March 1933, Japan (site not
specified), 8.9; and August 1950, Assam India, 8.7. The magnitude
numbering system named for American seismologist Charles Richter
wasn't developed until 1935, so earthquakes before that are
estimations based on intensity data.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Articles on the 1993 Branch Davidian incident near Waco,
Texas, said 80 members of the sect, including leader David Koresh
and 20 children, died in the fire that consumed the compound. Isn't
it true that some of the people died from gunshots?
</P>
<P>
   A: Apparently three people, all children, died from gunshots.
But there may never be clear answers about the exact number because
so much of the evidence was destroyed in the April 19, 1993, fire.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the fire, a Justice Department official, Carl
Stern, said three bodies had gunshot wounds, raising speculation
that the cult members had shot themselves or were shot by other
cultists. Then a report issued in October 1993 by the Justice
Department confirmed the same figure, saying three children had
been shot fatally in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Straw polls or straw votes are in the news lately. Can you
explain the meaning?
</P>
<P>
   A: A straw vote is an opinion poll, an unofficial vote taken to
ascertain the relative strength of political candidates or the
general trend of opinion on a given issue. The book ``Picturesque
Expressions: A Thematic Dictionary'' explains the ``straw'' part of
the term by saying that in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the
United States, informal polls were taken by handing out a piece of
straw to each of the voters, who would break the straw to signify a
``nay'' vote, or leave it intact to signify approval.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat cynical evaluation of the validity of a straw vote
was offered by O. Henry in 1913: ``A straw vote only shows which
way the hot air blows.'' A straw vote can have consequences,
however. In the nonbinding Aug. 14 Republican straw vote in Iowa,
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander's poor showing prompted him
to drop out of the presidential race.

   Q: The September issue of GQ magazine mentions former presidents
and their football careers. It states that Jimmy Carter was a
college football player. I know he attended Georgia Tech and the
Naval Academy, but I didn't know he played football. What can you
tell me?
</P>
<P>
   A: Carter attended Georgia Southwestern College and Georgia Tech
and graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946. It was at the academy
where his ``short-lived football career'' occurred, said Carrie
Harmon, spokeswoman at the Carter Presidential Center. He was on
the ``under-140-pound team,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the eye surgery Atlanta
Braves pitcher Greg Maddux had?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maddux, who was nearsighted, underwent laser eye surgery on
July 9 at Emory Vision Correction Center. It enabled him to shed
both the glasses he often wore off the field, and the contacts he
wore while pitching. He was back on the mound less than 48 hours
after the surgery, pitching against the Boston Red Sox in a game he
won, allowing one run in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux said he had the procedure done for personal reasons, not
in hopes that it would improve his pitching, but in fact he said
he's now more comfortable on the mound. He added that until the
surgery, he pitched in contacts because they gave him better
peripheral vision than glasses. But he said the contacts were
constantly irritating his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is George W. Bush, the frontrunner for the Republican
presidential nomination, George W. Bush Jr.? If he doesn't use the
Jr., is it intended to confuse older voters into thinking he is
George Bush Sr.?

name is George Walker Bush. His father's full name is George
Herbert Walker Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An item about Sen. Strom Thurmond's recent release from a

were divorced. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're separated, not divorced, but remain on ``friendly
terms,'' said John DeCrosta, Thurmond's spokesman. At last report
the senator lived in Washington and Nancy Thurmond lived in Aiken,
S.C. Thurmond (R-S.C.) married his first wife, Jean Crouch, in
1947. She died of a brain tumor in 1960. He married Nancy Moore, a
former Miss South Carolina, in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Thurmond, 96, who had successful surgery for an enlarged

in Washington.

   Q: The newspaper recently listed three singers who will be

</P>
<P>
   Q: The shutdown of the Russian space station Mir made me wonder:
Whatever happened to Buran, the Soviet version of America's space
shuttle?
</P>
<P>
   A: At last report the VKK, or Vozdushno Kosmicheskiy Korabl, was
being used as a tourist attraction in Moscow's Gorky Park. It was
opened as a flight simulator there in 1996, with ``passengers''
paying $35 for a 40-minute simulated flight complete with space
food. Buran (meaning Siberian snowstorm) actually was the name of
the maiden orbiter, but was transplanted to the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The crewless craft, which used an expendable booster instead of
main engines, was launched into space for the first, and last, time
Nov. 15, 1988. Controlled by autopilot, it made two orbits before
landing at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Beginning in
1989, shortages of funds caused long delays in further development
of the Buran program, and in 1993 work on the program ended.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that movie ratings have been changed several times
over the years. When did they start, and what have they been?
</P>
<P>
   A: The voluntary rating system replacing the old Hays Production
Code was introduced on Nov. 1, 1968. It called for four rating
categories: G (general audiences, all ages admitted); M (mature
audiences, all ages admitted, but parental guidance suggested); R
(restricted, with children younger than 16 not admitted without an
accompanying parent or adult guardian, later raised to children
younger than 17, but varying in some jurisdictions); and X (no one
younger than 17 admitted).
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association of America said it discovered
early on that most parents regarded M as sterner than R, so to
remedy the misconception, M was changed to GP (meaning general
audiences, parental guidance suggested). That was subsequently
changed to PG: parental guidance suggested.
</P>
<P>
   More adustments followed. In 1984, PG was split into PG and
PG-13, with the latter indicating films with a higher level of
intensity than PG. In 1990, a further revision was adopted to
provide explanations of why a film was rated R, and after that
explanations were added in the PG and PG-13 categories. When the X
category was changed that same year to NC-17 (no children 17 or
younger), it also was accompanied by an explanation. The ratings
are still G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What were the religious affiliations of our early presidents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let's take the first 10: George Washington, Episcopalian;
John Adams, Unitarian; Thomas Jefferson, no specific denomination;
James Madison and James Monroe, both Episcopalian; John Quincy
Adams, Unitarian; Andrew Jackson, Presbyterian; Martin Van Buren,
Dutch Reformed; and William Henry Harrison and John Tyler, both
Episcopalian.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long is protection afforded past presidents and their
wives or widows? May they refuse this protection if they choose to,
especially a widow?
</P>
<P>
   A: Secret Service protection is provided for the life of an
ex-president, as well as for a widow. While either a former
president or a widow certainly could refuse it, the only one who
actually has done so is Richard Nixon, said Pete Sepp of the
National Taxpayers Union. He added that in 1998, President Ford
lobbied to stop a move in Congress to limit the period of Secret
Service protection and some of the retirement perks available to
former presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I occasionally see references in the news to a ``land-grant
university.'' Exactly what is that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a school endowed under the Morrill (or Land-Grant) Act
of 1862, which was sponsored by Rep. Justin Morrill (R-Vt.). Under
the act, Congress granted every state 30,000 acres of land for each
senator and representative it had in Congress. The land was to be
sold, the proceeds invested, and the income used to create and
maintain a college for agriculture and the mechanical arts.
</P>
<P>
   The act came about because in the mid-1800s people had clamored
for colleges to teach the finer points of farming and
manufacturing. When it was passed, the act added military science
and tactics to the proposed farming and manufacturing curriculum.
Altogether, the states and territories received 11.3 million acres
of land. Congress added money to its gifts through the Second
Morrill Act of 1890 and an amendment in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   While not all states used the land-grant money as planned by the
act, with some giving money to state universities to finance new
agricultural and mechanical departments and a few giving the money
to private colleges, the education value of the land-grant program
is considered invaluable. Today, all states and Puerto Rico receive
federal grants to help support land-grant universities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that the woman in Antarctica who discovered a
lump in her breast, necessitating an emergency drop of medical
supplies, is the only doctor there. During my last tour of duty in
Antarctica in 1972, there was a doctor at Pole Station and at
McMurdo. Does McMurdo no longer have a doctor in the
``winter-over''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both McMurdo and South Pole stations still have physicians,
said Peter West of the National Science Foundation. But there are
several practical reasons why one doctor can't assist the other.
First, the two stations are roughly 800 miles apart. Land travel
between them is impossible because no roads exist, and the stations
are separated by the transantarctic mountain range. Second,
aircraft operations aren't conducted during the austral, or
southern, winter because of the extreme cold and the effects of the
temperatures on hydraulic and other critical systems. Third,
there's total darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Because of concerns about the weather conditions, and because
air traffic control and accompanying electronic aids to aircraft
navigation are extremely limited, no landing of an aircraft has
ever been attempted at the Pole during the austral winter in the
history of the U.S. program. The recent drop of supplies was
accomplished by an aircraft flying from Christchurch, New Zealand.
It was accompanied by a tanker for mid-air refueling.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation, by the way, operates the U.S.
Antarctic Program with logistical assistance from the Air Force,
the Air National Guard, and Antarctic Support Associates, a private
contractor in Colorado.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is the emergency number 911 used nationwide?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It's the system to reach Emergency Medical Services in
nearly half the United States, but the telephone number can vary
from community to community, according to a spokesman at the
Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The winner of the $116 million Big Game jackpot Aug. 3
actually got $60 million because he chose Cash Option. What
happened to the other $56 million?
</P>
<P>
   A: The advertised jackpot for Big Game is its estimated
annuitized value over 26 years, or the total cumulative amount a
winner would receive if he or she took the prize in annual payments
over that period. When Big Game jackpots are paid out over 26
years, the first annual payment is cash. For the remaining 25
years, the lottery buys U.S. government treasury securities, which
earn interest and mature annually. That annual return is the amount
winners receive each year.
</P>
<P>
   If Thomas ``Randy'' Kerfoot of Chattanooga, Tenn., the Big Game
winner Aug. 3, had elected to have his prize money spread over 26
years, it would have totaled $116 million. But he chose to have the
prize paid immediately, so he got $60 million (actually reduced to
$40 million after taxes).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent editorial column reported on a judge who overturned
rules of the Federal Communications Commission regarding privacy of
telephone records. What is the name of the judge, and what is the
address?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Denver. The two who voted to overturn the FCC rules are
Judge Deanell Reese Tacha and Judge David M. Ebel. Judge Mary Beck
Briscoe was the dissenter. You can write to any of them at this
address: U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, Byron White
U.S. Courthouse, 1823 Stout St., Denver, CO 80257.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The hoarding of pennies and subsequent shortage in some
places have been widely reported . Apparently some merchants are
having problems. Since lots of people consider pennies a nuisance
anyway, has any consideration been given to simply removing them
from circulation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although this issue comes up occasionally, the Treasury
Department says it has no plans to stop production of pennies. Even
if it wanted to do so, such a change in the nation's monetary
system would require congressional authorization.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense of keeping the 1-cent piece, the U.S. Mint cites
a 1976 study of possible consequences if their production were to
be halted and the coins removed from circulation. Problems, the
study concluded, would be a potential inflationary impact and
possible difficulties collecting sales taxes. A majority of state
revenue collection departments, retail companies and commercial
banks strongly objected to the idea of eliminating the penny.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of Ann Stock, at one time the Clinton White
House social secretary? I haven't seen her name in the news lately.
</P>
<P>
   A: Stock left her White House position in 1997 after 4 1/2 years
to become vice president of institutional affairs at the Kennedy
Center in Washington. She was replaced by Capricia Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Stock's latest project, outside of her Kennedy Center duties,
dovetails nicely with her background at the White House, which
included overseeing some 2,000 social events, ranging from intimate
teas to South Lawn picnics to state dinners. She and Walter Scheib,
whose experience includes being executive chef at the White House,
have compiled a cookbook, which isn't yet out. Royalties from the
book will benefit a nonprofit organization in the same way Hillary
Clinton's book, ``It Takes a Village,'' did, she told The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The book is said to include recipes and party-planning tips
focusing on what Stock described as the Clinton White House's
``fresh, uniquely American style of food and entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the baseball standings in the sports pages, Atlanta was
listed as being 3 1/2 games ahead of New York. Where does the half
game come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: Half-game differences in standings occur when teams have
played an uneven number of games. For instance, if the Braves were
84 and 50 (a total of 134), and the Mets were 80 and 53 (a total of
133), the Braves would have a 3 1/2-game lead. For each game won or
lost, a team either gains or slips a half game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any danger in using a cell phone while filling your
gas tank? I recently overhead a station attendant telling someone
not to talk on his phone.
</P>
<P>
   A: Fires at gas stations ignited by sparks from cell phones have
been reported, but they appear to be nothing more than the latest
urban myth. No such fires have been substantiated, said Shawn
Steward of BellSouth Cellular Corp. ``There's no way it would be
possible for a cell phone to create sparks that would ignite
gasoline vapors,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some gas station chains apparently plan to put a
warning label on some of their pumps ``basically to cover
themselves in case something could happen,'' Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle reported recently that some Canadian
newspapers had reported an incident in a tiny mining community in
British Columbia. According to the story, a man was torched when a
spark from his phone ignited gas fumes while he was filling up. In
the typical manner of urban myths, reports quickly surfaced about
similiar incidents in Indonesia, Finland and Australia. But all
appear to be hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   David McKinney, spokesman for the Shell/Texaco marketing
consortium Equilon Enterprises, told the Chronicle that his company
will not post warnings to cell phone users. ``We have no reason to
believe it's a safety issue,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the American flag is flown with the flag of another
country, on what side of the Stars and Stripes does the other flag
go?
</P>
<P>
   A: When the viewer is facing the flags, the U.S. flag should be
on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the strongest earthquake recorded since the beginning
of the use of the Richter scale?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sources disagree. According to The Weather Almanac, the
largest earthquakes of record were rated at magnitude 8.9. But the
almanac observes that magnitude determinations may vary with the
observatory, equipment and methods of estimating. For example, the
Alaska quake of March 27, 1964, was described variously as 8.4, 8.5
and 8.6 by different stations.
</P>
<P>
   World Almanac 1999, meanwhile, lists a magnitude 9.2 for the
1964 Alaska quake, and 9.5 for a series of quakes in Chile in May
1960 . World Almanac also lists these other major earthquakes:
April 1905, Kangra, India, 8.6; August 1906, Valparaiso, Chile,
8.6; December 1920, Gansu, China, 8.6; March 1933, Japan (site not
specified), 8.9; and August 1950, Assam India, 8.7. The magnitude
numbering system named for American seismologist Charles Richter
wasn't developed until 1935, so earthquakes before that are
estimations based on intensity data.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Articles on the 1993 Branch Davidian incident near Waco,
Texas, said 80 members of the sect, including leader David Koresh
and 20 children, died in the fire that consumed the compound. Isn't
it true that some of the people died from gunshots?
</P>
<P>
   A: Apparently three people, all children, died from gunshots.
But there may never be clear answers about the exact number because
so much of the evidence was destroyed in the April 19, 1993, fire.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the fire, a Justice Department official, Carl
Stern, said three bodies had gunshot wounds, raising speculation
that the cult members had shot themselves or were shot by other
cultists. Then a report issued in October 1993 by the Justice
Department confirmed the same figure, saying three children had
been shot fatally in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Straw polls or straw votes are in the news lately. Can you
explain the meaning?
</P>
<P>
   A: A straw vote is an opinion poll, an unofficial vote taken to
ascertain the relative strength of political candidates or the
general trend of opinion on a given issue. The book ``Picturesque
Expressions: A Thematic Dictionary'' explains the ``straw'' part of
the term by saying that in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the
United States, informal polls were taken by handing out a piece of
straw to each of the voters, who would break the straw to signify a
``nay'' vote, or leave it intact to signify approval.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat cynical evaluation of the validity of a straw vote
was offered by O. Henry in 1913: ``A straw vote only shows which
way the hot air blows.'' A straw vote can have consequences,
however. In the nonbinding Aug. 14 Republican straw vote in Iowa,
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander's poor showing prompted him
to drop out of the presidential race.

 &HT;    Tips for cooking
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cooking sausage is so basic that instructions should not be
needed.
</P>
<P>
   But some recipes give instructions that are wrong. Or at least
not right for sausages such as those made by Kroeger &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike commercial sausages from the supermarket, the Kroeger
brothers' sausages, both the fresh and the smoked, are not
precooked _ with the exception of the Cincinnati-style brat.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mike Kroeger says, don't prick the sausages. Flavorings
will just ooze out.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests either cooking his sausages one of two ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ On the grill, brown the sausages over heat then move to the
side to finish cooking indirectly. This takes about 15 to 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put sausages in a skillet with water, bring to a boil and cook
until the water evaporates, about 10 minutes. Then let the sausages
brown in their own fat, which takes about another 5 minutes.

 &HT;    LINKS TO THE PAST: Company continues a 5-generation family art
of making sausage
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ No matter that warm, summer-like days may linger
through September. Patio dining is passe for the rest of the year.
The appetite calendar has flipped from hamburgers on the grill to
sausage.
</P>
<P>
   It's a funny thing about Dayton, Ohio, with its mostly German
roots. The sausage-makers, along with the brewmeisters, have all
but vanished. But to the south, in Cincinnati, a city with a
similar heritage _ and a Porkopolis nickname _ the art of making
sausage is still revered.
</P>
<P>
   Doubt it? Visit Cincinnati's Findlay Market, 110 W. Elder St.
While many of the meat vendors there sell sausages they purchase,
Kroeger &AMP; Sons Meats dominate the sausage scene, turning out as
many as 60 varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Mike and Mark Kroeger are the fifth generation practicing the
art of charcuterie. They grew up with hands-on experience under the
tutelage of their immigrant father Paul, a master sausage-maker who
opened his shop in Findlay Market in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   When they were boys, they dropped their school books as soon as
they got home and headed to the garage, where their father had set
up a sausage kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go home and help Dad. That was the way it always was,''
says Mike.
</P>
<P>
   The sausages they made then were traditional German varieties _
fresh metts (called bratwurst in much of the rest of the country),
smoked metts and their version of bratwurst _ the mild, finely
ground pork and veal sausage native to Northern Germany and
synonymous with Cincinnati. They made lunchmeats and even head
cheese, using all the odds and ends and trimmings. But it was a
secondary business, a way to use every scrap from the meat-cutting
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us it has changed,'' says Mike. Since they took over the
business in 1994, making sausage has become their primary industry,
with meat sales second. And they no longer use trimmings, instead
ordering special ingredients for their links.
</P>
<P>
   Mike, 33, and Mark, 28, stepped in when their father became too
ill to continue. They saw sausage-making as a special niche. But in
the early years of their stewardship, they amassed debt and needed
to establish a cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   That's when they developed their first specialty sausage, the
Vidalia Onion Sausage, a juicy selection with big chunks of onion
and Parmesan cheese in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was born out of necessity,'' Mike says.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a surefire winner.
</P>
<P>
   To this day it is the best-selling sausage in a lineup that also
includes two popular versions of andouille and a coarse
Chicago-style Italian sausage. Others include both fresh and smoked
kielbasa, smoked bierwurst and four kinds of venison sausage. The
brothers also make seasonal sausages such as bockwurst, weiswurst,
duck sausage and even a corned beef sausage made for St. Patrick's
Day. And in a nod to the fat-phobic consumers, they offer about a
dozen varieties made with chicken breast.
</P>
<P>
   All are made in old-world style, which means the brothers don't
use binders, colors, extenders or artificial preserves. No dried
milk or water is added. And, in a nod to new-world tastes, they
emphasize leanness.
</P>
<P>
   Not all their experiments have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest failure was a soy-based vegetarian sausage,'' Mike
says. The texture was so bad they didn't even try to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   But the specialty sausages put them in the black again, and they
went from making 200 to 300 pounds a week to 900, then to 1,300
pounds. They still run out on busy Saturdays and are in the market
for equipment to expand their capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Next up in their plans is getting licensed to sell wholesale.
When that happens, probably next spring, Kroeger sausages might be
available a little closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Contact Kroeger and Sons Meats at (513) 651-5543.

 &HT;    Cincinnati landmark is making a comeback
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ In its heyday, Findlay Market was ``a happening
place,'' says Mike Kroeger, who still sells sausage in the market
house.
</P>
<P>
   The market in Cincinnati's Over The Rhine district dates to
1852. Despite a renovation of the market house 25 years ago, the
decline of the neighborhood took its toll. Vendors in the
deteriorating buildings around the market house closed. Quality
slipped to bare basics and suburbanites no longer made the trip
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Kroeger said, the city made a commitment and a revival
began. Buildings were acquired and restored. Long-term plans call
for temporarily moving market house vendors into the renovated
storefronts after the first of the year, then expanding the market
house to allow year-round produce stands. Farmers sell home-grown
produce on Saturdays in a new open-air market shed in the parking
lot. The renovation eventually will extend to the other side of the
market square.
</P>
<P>
   The change is being felt inside the market house, as well, where
the vendors who stayed are adding specialties. While vendors
selling traditional meats dominate the market, this also is the
place to find everything from Goetta to rabbits, breast of lamb to
Cajun bacon and, of course, a wide variety of sausage. At the
Krause meat stand, imported deli meats are the draw.
</P>
<P>
   Well-established merchants such as Silverglades offer imported
cheese at one end of the market house and a vast array of olives at
the other.
</P>
<P>
   The international cheese selection, cut to order, ranges from
French Gaperon and Vermont Goat's Milk Blue Cheese to English
Stiernmeister, Irish Smoked Blarney and Dutch Goat's Milk Gouda.
</P>
<P>
   The Elder Street storefronts still house a few vendors,
including the Heist Poultry shop, which dates to 1850, and
Mediterranean Imports, a spice-and-nut house that is a good place
to find pine nuts priced as low as $6.50 per pound for Chinese
imports and up to $17.99 for Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the market house, the buildings are mostly
boarded up, but the Saigon Market remains, and Mr. Pig's barbecue
draws a steady line of hungry shoppers. While the market has
limited hours, all the vendors are open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday
and 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday. It is most active _ and
crowded _ on Saturday when produce in the market shed is an added
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   FINDLAY MARKET is open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday and from 6
a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Directions: Take Interstate 75 to the Western Avenue/Liberty
Street exit; the first cross street at the bottom of the ramp is
Findlay Street. Turn left and go about 10 blocks. The entrance into
the parking lot is between Elm and Race streets. On Wednesday and
Friday there is usually parking available on the nearby streets.

 &HT;    TASTE OF WINE: A little bit of this and that
 &HT;    (EDS: Note italics and email address _ replace (at) with
ampersand.)
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Tips 'n' sips to tide us through the approaching
autumn:
</P>
<P>
   _ Dorothy J. Gaiter and John Brecher, who co-author a wine
column for The Wall Street Journal, have come up with an intriguing
idea. They've proclaimed Sept. 18 ``Open That Bottle Night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as though every person in America has one special
bottle, with special memories, hidden away somewhere, waiting for
that one perfect moment to open it,'' they write. But too often,
that moment never comes. And too many of those ``special'' wines
were never meant to be aged a long time anyway. They're not getting
any better. And (ITALIC) you (END ITALIC) aren't getting any
younger.
</P>
<P>
   Gaiter and Brecher's advice: ``Don't wait for a special occasion
to open the wine. Make the wine itself the special occasion.
Prepare a feast around the wine, open it and toast the terrific
person who gave you the bottle'' or the circumstances around which
you received it.
</P>
<P>
   That way, they reason, the wine just might be wonderful no
matter how it tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a darn fine idea to me. The Journal columnists
invited readers to share their stories of the wine and occasion. We
can do the same. Even if your ``Open That Bottle Night'' isn't
Sept. 18, let me know how it went by e-mailing me at
markfisher(at)coxohio.com or dropping me a line at Mark Fisher,
Dayton Daily News, 45 S. Ludlow St., Dayton Ohio 45402. We'll share
the best stories in a future column.
</P>
<P>
   _ From the ``Don't-delve-too-deeply-into-the-family-tree''
department:
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay and other prestigious grape varieties that make some
of the noblest wines of France _ from such places as Champagne and
Burgundy _ originated from a peasant grape variety scorned by most
winemakers for centuries and once banned from France, according to
a genetic researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Meredith, a professor at the University of California,
Davis, told the Associated Press that her research concluded 16
premier wines of France were originally produced by the genetic
pairing of the classic Pinot variety with the obscure, humble
Gouais blanc grape, apparently a black sheep of sorts in the
viticultural circles.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used classic DNA profiling techniques now widely
used to link parents and children, or to connect a suspect with
specimens from a crime scene. Meredith is the senior author of a
study that appeared Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Wine experts were said to be ``surprised and amused'' that wines
held in such high regard, such as chardonnay and gamay noir, had
such humble origins, the AP said.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the heartland of America, we don't drink prestige,
right? We drink wine, no matter what side of the genetic tracks the
grapes were born on. Even, sometimes, chardonnay. With that in mind
. . .
</P>
<P>
   Wine of the week: Penfolds 1998 Koonunga Hill Semillon
Chardonnay, $7.99. This lip-smacking white wine from southeastern
Australia will make Indian summer easier to endure. It's a blend of
68 percent semillon and 32 percent chardonnay, fresh, fruity, not
overly oaked, with everything in the proper balance and a decent
price to boot. Why yes, you may freshen my glass.

   AIRLINE-ANNIVERSARY _ Have a good flight? This summer, it was
better not to ask. The passengers were nasty. The flight attendants
were surly. The gate agents were brusque. And the bad news was,
your flight was canceled. Twenty years into the era of airline
deregulation _ the United States will observe the anniversary but
not celebrate it on Oct. 24 _ the flying public is in the clutches
of Procrustes and Hobson. (Blackburn, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   EDITORIAL-CLEMENCY _ FALN clemency controversy ought to be a
lesson to the Clintons. As long as Hillary is politicking for U.S.
Senate seat, Clinton enemies will attach the darkest motives to any
action Bill takes with implications for New York, including the
possibility of clemency for Jonathan Pollard. Clinton should leave
such decisions to his successor. (Atlanta Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   EDITORIAL-TIMOR _ The violence in East Timor is no less a case
of ethnic cleansing than the earlier horrors of Bosnia and Kosovo.
U.S. caution on intervention is understandable, but we should be
putting far heavier pressure on Indonesia than we are now. If
Jakarta won't clamp down on thugs, then it should other countries
to do so. (Atlanta Constitution)

<P>
   EDITORIAL-CAMPAIGN _ The need for campaign-finance reform.
(Atlanta Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WALMART-COMMENT _ The coming of Wal-mart in England won't
destroy the villages and countryside because rules over there will
prevent the chain from destroying main streets of small towns.
England has much tighter control over development, slowing down
sprawl. (Page, Atlanta Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Everybody loves to give pregnant
women advice, wanted or not. Everybody loves to throw pregnant
women showers, willing or not. So I suppose it was inevitable that
somebody would find a way to combine the two. Recently, I attended
a baby shower at which advice-giving took the place of shower
games. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

 &HT;    September dates let you try the unusual
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   September has finally arrived and with it some special dates
that may inspire you to even greater heights in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some, along with related Internet sites we hope will
spark your culinary imagination.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Today: In 1850, California was admitted to the Union, bringing
with it the beginnings of famed California cuisine. Interestingly,
one of the first recorded cookbooks to be published in California
was ``How to Keep a Husband or Culinary Tactics.'' You can find the
historic recipe for boiled orange pudding from this rare book at
marketreport
</P>
<P>
   .com/historical1.htm. For a wonderful snapshot of just what this
rich and varied cuisine of California is all about, see
www.windjammer.net/users/isg
</P>
<P>
   /coloma/sesquin.htm. Also see the California Cuisine Food
Pyramid at www.avoinfo.com
</P>
<P>
   /nutrition/nutr58.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Today also is the birthday of fast food giant Col. Harlan
Sanders. To pay homage to the man who changed America's
chicken-eating habits, you could go to KFC for a bucket or you
could try to crack his secret by trying the copycat recipe at
southernfood.about.com/library/ccrec
</P>
<P>
   /blcc34.htm?pid &QC; 2757&AMP;cob &QC; home.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sept. 11-20: The Jewish High Holy days of Rosh Hashana and Yom
Kippur are celebrated. For the story and traditions associated with
these days, plus traditional recipes, see www.holidays
</P>
<P>
   .net/highholydays/.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sept. 13: Say Happy Birthday to Hershey founder Milton Hershey
by visiting the chocolate company's Web site and maybe coaxing
yourself into making a fabulous chocolate desert. See
members.aol.com/acalendar/September
</P>
<P>
   /Hershey.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sept. 16: This is Mexican Independence Day. For the story of
Mexican Independence, see www.mexonline.com/person1.htm. And for
some mouthwatering south-of-the-border recipes, see Big Mama at
www.mexconnect.com
</P>
<P>
   /mex/sml/gwbigmamaindex.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sept. 22: The birthday of the ice cream cone. Like many
Italian immigrants who came to America in the late 1800s, Italo
Marchiony operated a pushcart. His portable lemon ice business
became so successful that he soon had a fleet. On Sept. 22, 1903,
he applied for a patent for a cone-shaped mold that he made out of
paper to hold his tasty delicacy. One year later, at the St. Louis
World's Fair, Syrian pastry concessionaire Ernest Hamwi was making
a wafflelike, cone-shaped Persian pastry called ``zalabias'' when
he gave some to a nearby ice cream vendor who had run out of
dishes. The rest is history. For more on ice cream cones, see
www.fspronet.com/iccone.html. If you want to try your hand at the
original zalabia, see a recipe from a Middle Eastern cookbook at
www
</P>
<P>
   .eskimo.com/(tilde)jefffree/recipes/zalabia
</P>
<P>
   .htm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sept. 26: The birthday of John Chapman, aka American folk hero
Johnny Appleseed. Chapman was known to wear a cooking pot for a hat
as he preached throughout Indiana and Ohio in the early 19th
century and planted apple seeds for settlers who would follow. For
a lovely poem that evokes the spirit of September and Johnny
Appleseed, see www.zoomnet.net/(tilde)petecol/septemb.html.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sept. 29: This is Michaelmas. Top off the month with a grand
feast that honors the Archangel Michael, the patron saint of
artists, grocers, knights, mariners, policemen, soldiers and the
sick. Celebrated since the sixth century, the feast's centerpiece
traditionally is goose. British legend has it that in 1588 Queen
Elizabeth I was dining on goose on this day when she learned of the
defeat of the Spanish Armada, after which she decreed that
``hereafter goose shall be eaten on this day.'' Tradition also
dictates that the bones be made into Michaelmas broth to be eaten
the next day. Angel food cake is a must for some Episcopalians.

 &HT;    Pleat foil into a pan for these cookies
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tricia Caudell's request for the Accordion Cookies her
mother used to make was kindly answered by Joan D. Mattson of
Grayson, Ga., who sent a copy of the original that won Pillsbury's
top $25,000 prize in 1958. Gerda Roderer of Berkeley, Calif., won
the money and the honors with her family recipe four years after
moving to the United States from France.
</P>
<P>
   We tested the unusual cookies, which are baked in a ``pan'' made
of accordion-pleated aluminum foil, and found they lived up to
Caudell's memory: ``When they're cooked, they are crunchy on the
outside, soft on the inside ... similar in taste to madeleines.''
</P>
<P>
   The original directions suggest varying the flavoring used. We
tested with toasted hazelnuts and dipped one end of the cooled
cookie in a chocolate glaze.

<P>
   Cooking time: 25 minutes per sheet
</P>
<P>
   Cooling time: 10 minutes per sheet
</P>
<P>
   Folding the foil for a pleated temporary pan is the trickiest
part of this recipe. Tear off a piece a yard long, fold it in half
lengthwise, then pleat in 1-inch folds, like a fan. That leaves 16
spaces for cookies (don't use those on the ends), so you'll need to
bake in three batches. After removing the first batch, simply turn
the foil over to bake the second. After that, you can turn the
lengthwise fold inside out and refold, wash the foil or start over
with a clean sheet.

<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar

</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In large mixing bowl, cream butter
and sugar. Blend in eggs, vanilla and salt and mix well. Add flour
and nuts, if using, and mix thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Fold 1 yard of heavy-duty foil in half lengthwise. Fold double
foil crosswise into 1-inch pleats to make an accordion-pleated pan.
Place on a baking sheet and spray with cooking spray.
</P>
<P>
   Drop a rounded teaspoonful of dough into each fold of the foil.
(Dough will spread during baking.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake about 25 minutes, until golden brown. Cool 10 minutes.
Remove cookies; turn foil over for next batch.

 &HT;    Striking a balance with Thai fare
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the bar at Tamarind, the superb Thai restaurant in
Atlanta, stand half a dozen bottles of beer, the six of them
representing the house's selections. One is Amstel Light, another
Sweetwater Ale and still another Sweetwater 420 Ale. There's
Heineken and Heineken Dark _ lagers both _ there's the distinctive
but little-known Thai lager called Singha.
</P>
<P>
   As selections go, it's neither wide nor unusual. But then, what
does one drink with Thai food?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you want something that will cleanse the palate and
not compete with the spices,'' says Jim Peck of Mac's Beer &AMP; Wine.
Sensible advice, but why not seek out something that complements
rather than competes?
</P>
<P>
   Thai cuisine, delicate and yet intensely peppery, has no obvious
partners. Its roots are Chinese and Indian, but the defining
touches _ lemon grass and lime, coriander and ginger root _ are
indigenous to Southeast Asia. So, too, are the peppers, among the
hottest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   At Tamarind, the menu gives fair warning: From one pepper to
four, you are advised whether a dish merely delivers ``a
stimulating `kick' to lips and tongue'' or whether ``management
accepts no responsibility for side effect.''
</P>
<P>
   A party of us ate at Tamarind recently, and no four-pepper
dishes were on the menu. Two peppers (``will set the lips and
tongue tingling'') was as hot as it got. Yum-Ped-Yang _ one pepper
_ is roast boneless duck with chili peppers, onions, cashew nuts,
lemon juice, pineapple chunks and sliced apples, and no wine in my
experience could mate with such a dish.
</P>
<P>
   But Singha, for mysterious reasons, harmonizes as if ordained by
nature, cleansing the palate with satisfying dryness.
</P>
<P>
   There is no particular reason why it should. It's not a ``Thai''
beer, after all, but a pale lager originally formulated by a German
brewmaster living in Thailand in the 1930s. It has the body of a
Dortmunder Export but crispness of a German-style pilsner, and a
surprising hoppiness (40 International Bitterness Units) for a
lager.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the hoppiness or the broader hop/malt profile that somehow
did the trick?
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the Heinekens, dull beers with or without food, would
have done it. And I don't see any point to light beer, so Amstel
Light would have been out of the question. That leaves the two
Sweetwaters, one an English-style bitter that won a silver medal at
the Great American Beer Festival two years ago and the other an
extra pale ale.
</P>
<P>
   The flagship Sweetwater Ale is quite a different beer from
Singha, yet it complements spicy dishes nicely. An English-style
bitter has an edge of hoppiness, but also a touch of malty
sweetness, less than a Scotch ale's and more than a pale ale's.
Paired with Thai dishes, the hops aren't enough to compete with the
peppers (they know better), but the malt has almost a soothing
effect.
</P>
<P>
   With beer as with wine, no one style is best, but some clearly
work better than others _ and others don't work at all. It doesn't
have much to do with the caliber of the beer.
</P>
<P>
   An assertive and justly celebrated beer such as Anchor Liberty
would not have made a happy marriage with those Thai chiles, one
strong personality clashing with another. On the other hand, a
bland mass-market lager would have been overwhelmed. The Sweetwater
420, an extra pale ale that makes no effort to dominate the palate,
has a clean, crisp companionability with most dishes, including
spicy ones. And a beer such as Redhook ESB would have much the same
effect as Sweetwater Ale, a bit of hoppiness balanced by a malty
backbone. So, too, would Dogwood's Breakdown IPA, a beer that has
more in common with a bitter than an IPA.
</P>
<P>
   Tuppers' Hop Pocket Pils, for my money the best pilsner
available in the United States (and better than any I've had in
Germany), might have complemented these dishes in the same way as
the Singha, the cleanness of a sturdy lager that's happy to get
along but isn't going to be pushed around. Then again, the Hop
Pocket is a big, complex beer, more assertive than the Singha, and
the last thing you want over dinner is a tug of war.
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   The lagers of Germany are more numerous and better known, but
those of the Czech Republic occupy a special place. These are the
original pilsners, the straw-gold, dry style whose barely
recognizable descendants have spread to every corner of the globe.
The pre-eminent Czech beer, Pilsner Urquell (the name means
``Original Pilsner''), was first brewed 140 years ago and today is
as famous among lagers as Guinness Stout is among ales.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other Czech pilsners than Pilsner Urquell, just as
there other stouts than Guinness. Louny, brewed in the town of the
same name, is lighter-bodied than its better-known compatriate, but
it has the roundness and soft mouth feel you expect from a Czech
beer. You won't find many beers whose hops and malt are in better
balance.
</P>
<P>
   A Czech pils is not as dry or as crisp as a German pils, and its
nose will usually be more floral from Saaz hops. Staropramen,
another Czech beer, is drier than Pilsner Urquell but less complex.
Louny falls somewhere between the two, and combines the best
qualities of each.
</P>
<P>
   And there's something more: Pilsner Urquell is a beer I seldom
buy anymore. I've had too many that were oxidized and stale. The
Louny I've sampled has been remarkably fresh for imported beer. It
may be the most pleasant surprise among imports to arrive in the
Atlanta market in years.

   WRESTLING-FOOTBALL: What many people don't appreciate about
Ernie ``Big Cat'' Ladd, biggest player in the old American Football
League, eater of up to 124 pancakes in one sitting, was his ability
to execute a flying head scissors. A flying head scissors isn't
easy for a 6-foot-9-inches hulk weighing 319 pounds. ``I knew all
the moves,'' says Ladd from his home in Franklin, La. ``I learned
to drop kick. Now, with the flying head scissors, you see a lot of
little guys doing it, but not many my size.''

DAMN THE MILLENNIUM NAYSAYERS, THERE'S A PARTY AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EILEEN MITCHELL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN RAMON, Calif. _ Despite the big hoopla over the next New
Year's Eve, I am now fully aware that the new millennium doesn't
actually begin until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Western calendar starts with Year 1, and not Year
0, the 21st century and the Third Millennium do not begin until
January 1, 2001,'' explained the science-fiction writer Arthur C.
Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, if you can't trust Artie, who wrote ``2001: a Space
Odyssey,'' who can you trust?
</P>
<P>
   But this fact has also been stated repeatedly through frequent
letters to newspapers. These are letters from obviously brilliant
people eager to let the rest of us dim bulbs know how stupid we are
when we refer to the year 2000 as the New Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   They don't care that the rest of the world is caught up in
millennium fever, or that we are excited because we will soon get
to write a 2 instead of a 1. They don't care that we want to party.
</P>
<P>
   We know who these people are.
</P>
<P>
   They're Smarty-pants.
</P>
<P>
   We met them in pre-school. They were the 4-year-olds who
snitched to their classmates that there's no such thing as the
Easter Bunny or Tooth Fairy. At Christmas they were the kids who
yanked on Santa's beard and announced in a loud know-it-all voice
that Santa was just a mythological figure based on the life of St.
Nicholas, a Turkish man from the 4th century who was recognized for
his generosity to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   At Halloween these kids always chose practical costumes like
nurses or cops. Dare suggest a Mr. Spock or Yoda costume and they
would wrinkle their little noses and snort with contempt:
``Puhleeze, those characters are just make-believe!''
</P>
<P>
   Generally recognized as killjoys the world over, Smarty-pants
are easily identified the minute they open their mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Dare to wish upon a shooting star in the presence of a
Smarty-pants, and you will quickly be informed that a shooting star
is nothing but a gassy, fiery streak in the sky produced by the
passage of a meteor.
</P>
<P>
   And from Thanksgiving dinner, that turkey wishbone? The remnant
of an innocent animal slaughtered for a holiday that wrongly
celebrates intruders who took over the land of an indigenous
people.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever experienced that eerie feeling of deja vu? It
isn't evidence of reincarnation, a Smarty-pants will explain with a
roll of the eyes. It's merely a synchronization of thought waves
produced by synapses that have simply preceded the actual event.
</P>
<P>
   As for astrology, don't even hint about your horoscope.
</P>
<P>
   Smarty-pants will explain that astrology is the fraudulent
attempt of conniving hucksters to interpret the influence of the
heavenly bodies on human affairs. Can you say sucker?
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, Smarty-pantses the world over will be sitting on
their sofas or watching the newest rental videos. Maybe they'll
tune in to Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve _ but only to
observe all those fools celebrating the wrong occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Third Millennium starts next year!'' they'll smugly say to
no one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us will dance in the streets and wish on a star,
rejoicing in what we perceive to be a momentous event. And glad
that Smarty-pants stayed home.

YEAR 2000: MUCH ADO ABOUT NADA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DONALD G. SMITH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA, Calif. _ Here is something that troubles me about
1999. As we advance further into summer and fall, the feeling of
unease is going to increase because of the inevitable millennium
overhype.
</P>
<P>
   I believe the whole thing is a gigantic crock, unworthy of
serious discussion, but the hype continues. There will be an
avalanche of millennium T-shirts, caps, movies, bumper stickers,
songs, television specials and anything else that can turn a fast
buck.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium is manufactured news, a non-story about a
concocted event that isn't going to change anything. It is destined
to become the acme of inanity, an applied vulgarity exceeding the
combined intensity of a year-end automobile clearance, a Hollywood
funeral and a televangelist moving in for the kill. There is
nothing to look forward to because the crescendo will become more
tasteless as the year progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Elections, wars and natural disasters are legitimate news
because they change our lives. Even the seasons are worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   We dress and act differently, adapt our living patterns, even
change our attitudes. What is going to change when the clock ticks
off the seconds leading us out of 1999? Nothing. Absolutely
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We will all be one day older, the sun will still rise in the
east, the freeways will be jammed at the rush hour, dogs will chase
cats, and small children still won't eat their vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The point that all of the millennium buffs miss in that time is
endless and completely out of our control. Our attempts to label
and measure it are good for record-keeping and maintaining some
kind of order in human affairs, but there is no magic to any
particular date.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium business is a lot of blue steam, but this is not
going to register with those who believe that a power greater than
our own has given divine sanction to a man-made statistic.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the end of one millennium and the consequent
beginning of another is no more blessed than the minimum wage or
the distance from home plate to the pitcher's mound. Jan. 1, 2000,
is no more or less of a date than Jan. 12 or April 17. It is merely
an artificial label for something that is going to happen with or
without the bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet parties are planned _ and great celebrations to acknowledge
something that has no more significance than a license plate
number.
</P>
<P>
   What are these people celebrating? What is going to change after
the clocks tick off the millennium? Will the sun shine any
brighter? Will anyone be better looking, or smarter, or better able
to handle yesterday's problems? I think not.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``Much Ado About Nothing'' in modern dress, and those who
hope for something good to come from it are going to be profoundly
and permanently disappointed. They will not understand why nothing
happened.
</P>
<P>
   For my part, I will close my eyes on the night of Dec. 31 in the
spirit of one who goes to bed with a toothache. There is always the
hope that it will be gone in the morning.

LOUISIANA `KINGFISH' MADE INDELIBLE MARK ON HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ Wednesday was the 64th anniversary of the
assassination of Huey P. Long, the ``Kingfish'' who ruled
Louisiana, hoped to be president and remains one of the most
compelling and controversial politicians this country has ever
known.
</P>
<P>
   Called a Bolshevik by some, fascist by others, the Kingfish
continues to be important even today as a classic case study of the
populist outsider coming to power.
</P>
<P>
   Huey (he consistently called himself ``Huey'' _ never ``Mr.
Long'') was born in 1893 in rural Winn Parish in north-central
Louisiana and spent his young manhood as a traveling salesman. Then
he became a lawyer at 21 after studying for just eight months. At
25 he was already in politics, a railroad commissioner taking the
side of the poor against the public utilities and large
corporations, especially Standard Oil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, as the anti-``plutocrat'' candidate, he successfully
ran for governor, his catchy slogan, ``Every Man a King, but No One
Wears a Crown,'' making him irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Long was despised and adored. His accomplishments
were legion. And he did, as promised, aid the poor _ and not only
poor whites, which was hardly the usual case in the South.
</P>
<P>
   He paved roads, built highways and bridges, supplied free
textbooks and founded a medical school; he set up night schools to
teach literacy, and he refurbished classrooms. He improved workers'
compensation. He even reformed the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   But he did all this at a price. He installed a political machine
whereby all state appointments, from judge to janitor, were
bestowed by his direct order. He skimmed 5 percent off the top of
every state employee's salary and put the money into a ``deduct
box'' to be spent at his personal whim. He hired and fired at will,
and he made it known that anyone who crossed him would never be
forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he established a fiefdom which replaced democratic
institutions and the rule of law with personal power. On one level,
it worked, but it worked at a terrible cost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, Long ran as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate. But he
didn't take his seat until 1932, when his own man was safely
installed as governor. By then the Depression was in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Long proposed spreading ``the wealth of the land among all the
people.'' He soon was attacking President Franklin D. Roosevelt,
who had taken office in 1933, for not moving fast enough with the
New Deal. FDR responded by giving federal patronage to Long's
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Long vowed to give FDR ``unshirted hell.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1934, he decided to make his move.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Long announced the ``Share Our Wealth'' plan (SOW),
a scheme to end the Depression by redistributing all America's
wealth so every family would have at least $3,000, plus a radio.
</P>
<P>
   Response was extremely favorable; SOW clubs sprang up
everywhere. Then Long went back to Louisiana. Although no longer a
state official, he rammed through the legislature dozens of laws _
an audacious performance, which, thanks to SOW, the entire nation
observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in old-fashioned American democracy,'' Long said.
``Only we've got to change it around some.''
</P>
<P>
   People started to buzz. In the spring of 1935, a poll showed the
Kingfish might get more than 10 percent of the vote in a national
election _ not enough to win the presidency but enough to help
Roosevelt lose it in the 1936 elections. FDR, rattled, initiated
some radical SOW-like legislation of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not good enough!'' Long roared in a series of well-publicized
filibusters.
</P>
<P>
   He took to the road and the airwaves. He was a charismatic
speaker; large audiences of potential voters responded with money
and cheers. Rumors of a third-party nomination started to spread.
</P>
<P>
   With Long's popularity soaring, Roosevelt continued to toss New
Deal money to his opponents, who by now were calling for a federal
investigation of the Kingfish's one-man rule. The senator, enraged,
returned to Louisiana and called for a special legislative session
to consolidate his power by kicking the New Deal out of Louisiana;
the state would use state money only for public improvement, and
his foes would be impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Told this was unconstitutional, he replied tersely, ``I don't
give a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Others did. Among his more minor demands was revision of a
judicial district housing an enemy judge who was gerrymandered out
of his place on the bench. The judge's son-in-law, Dr. Carl A.
Weiss, 29, waited for Long, who was surrounded by bodyguards, to
come out of the governor's office in the state capitol on Sept. 8,
1935. According to the official but still-controversial reports by
the Louisiana state police, Weiss shot Long once in the abdomen _
and was himself cut down in a fusillade fired by the bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss died. And so, 30 hours later, did the Kingfish. He was 42.
</P>
<P>
   What does Huey Long's life teach us? There are, after all, many
who argue that skirting the law may be justified if the outcome is
noble, and among Long's achievements are certainly some we would
all call noble. But the price was high. Achievement is no
substitute for democracy, and dictatorship is dictatorship no
matter how well it works.

THE END OF HITS, RUNS AND AN ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was the bottom of the 10th inning with two
outs and two men on. Several thousand people in Candlestick Park
looked to Giants infielder Bill Mueller for a game-ending run.
</P>
<P>
   He went down on a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon windstorm _ typical and symbolic of the 36-year-old
Candlestick Park _ had been in full blow for nearly an hour. The
first peanut shells had been levitated into eye-gouging projectiles
at 4:02 p.m., and I'd found myself wishing for sandbags to anchor
my scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   Red dirt from the Giants bullpen mound _ just three rows below
our box seats _ periodically pounded our eyes, teeth and pores.
</P>
<P>
   I stole a glance to the left at my friend Loysie, then to the
right at my friend Terri. My heart sank. It was nearly 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   We had been watching baseball for more than three hours. All of
us had places we needed to be. But Loysie and Terri sat like
statues in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   The truth stared me in my dirt-covered face: I may have spent
close to a decade covering professional baseball as a sportswriter,
but, compared to these two women, I barely qualify as an A-league
fan.
</P>
<P>
   Leave when the score is tied? When the San Francisco Giants
could win No. 13 out of their last 16 played? With the silly
expansion team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, still 6 1/2 games in
front? Not Loysie. Not Terri.
</P>
<P>
   I had come to the Giants-Phillies game just to watch a few
innings and to say goodbye to baseball at Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of them were cold, I'd spent many a night and day
in the ugly concrete stadium. I had some memories, felt a wisp of
sadness that, next season, pretty little Pac Bell Park in downtown
San Francisco would make baseball fans forget Candlestick on even
its best days.
</P>
<P>
   Loysie and Terri will likely be there for the last Giants game
ever at the 'Stick _ Loysie especially since she and her husband
John have had season tickets since 1983. Both women had rearranged
their schedules this day so they could duck out of work early and
root for the home team; Loysie had set up extended daycare for her
two kids.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to marketing surveys and demographic analyses, baseball
executives are super-savvy these days about the makeup of what is
known at their ``fan base.'' But sometimes I wonder if they fully
appreciate the individual devotion and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   When I sat up in the press box, it was easy to lump the fans
into a stomping, faceless horde that could not hear an organ run
without screaming ``Charge!'' Often, I reminded others that ``fan''
is short for ``fanatic,'' and what did THAT say about the kind of
lives such people lead?
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Terri and Loysie _ knowing that neither of them
needs to get a life because both have big, demanding, complex ones
_ I felt bad about all those smirking put-downs. Being a baseball
devotee may not be my cup of beer, but it sure agrees with a few
million other folks.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God, though, for Jeff Kent, who blasted a two-run homer
just over the right field fence in the bottom of the 11th, to beat
the Philadelphia team, 5-3. As I'd learned a couple of innings
before, Loysie had actually sat in her car outside the hospital
when she was in labor with her first baby, refusing to go in until
she heard the end of the Giants game on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   It was a regular season game.

THE GOLD RUSH YIELDS TO LAND ROVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The topic was ``Has the Bay Area lost its
edge?'' as Michael Krasny put it. His KQED radio talk show on
Tuesday was about whether artists and bohemians can survive here
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Short answer: No.
</P>
<P>
   Longer answer: Only if they issue stock in a hot new Internet
start-up called sfboho.com.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, we don't even think about an artistic cutting edge
anymore, if the Bay Area was ever on it. ``Edge'' now refers to
things technological. Clearly, many people are on edge about our
new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on a different edge, whether you like it or not,'' said
a caller to the show who gave his name as Jeff. ``It began in the
'80s as developers built high-rises and began filling up the cities
and suburbs with a different kind of people. ... A city is only as
good as the people in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we've got some very good Web designers, on-line investors
and upscale restaurateurs. Many dress like bohemians when they're
showing off.
</P>
<P>
   Most callers to Krasny's show weren't very sentimental about the
beats, hippies and musicians who made San Francisco famous. The
show quickly became a cry from aging hearts for all the other
things the Bay Area has lost.
</P>
<P>
   Affordable rents. Homes you can buy without making a mint in the
stock market. A middle class. A working class. Decent public
schools. Weird characters. A sense of fun. Neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
   Artists have felt the loss of these things as much as anyone,
and yuppies have taken all the lofts. Guidebooks may describe the
North Beach or South of Market neighborhoods as bohemian haunts,
but they've gone the way of Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   An artist named Steven called in from West Oakland, saying it's
the only diverse place he can live for under $25,000 a year, and
he's nervous it's going upscale. ``How many artists can find new
enclaves?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only other artist calling in was Gillian, who said, ``You're
talking like we're some kind of magic bullet (for cultural life). I
keep moving from warehouse to warehouse. I get up in the morning. I
have to pay my bills.''
</P>
<P>
   You can guess what appalled most callers.
</P>
<P>
   Greed. The Silicon Valley cult of becoming a millionaire by age
28. Mansions built to the lot lines. SUVs. Incredibly high rents
and home prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area, love paying the rent or leave it.
</P>
<P>
   Ann from Mountain View said she grew up in Palo Alto in the '50s
and '60s when that city had a diversity and democracy unheard of
nowadays. Butchers lived next door to scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disconcerting to me that I can't afford to move back
to the town I grew up in,'' she complained. ``It's really sad.
There's this kind of Silicon Valley arrogance that's driving people
out.''
</P>
<P>
   A caller named Marnie also lives in that former orchard known as
``the Valley of Heart's Delight.'' She said her neighbor's heart's
delight is building a 5,800-square-foot monster house next to her
small home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What ever happened to the virtue of modesty?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic modesty has disappeared in the '90s the way sexual
modesty did in the '60s. Being immodest was more fun in the good
old days.
</P>
<P>
   As a guest on the show, I wanly pointed out that the Bay Area
was built on greed for gold in the middle of the last century,
benefiting a few rich people to the detriment of the many.
</P>
<P>
   Things hadn't changed much. But rich people back then had much
more interesting displays of wealth. And the Land Rover hadn't been
invented.
</P>
<P>
   A caller named Adam said greed is an unavoidable human quality.
``I don't go around saying, `Palo Alto used to be this way.' I'm
Native-American, and my ancestors were slaughtered. That's just
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few people talked about how the Bay Area has been turned
into a theme park for tourists and the rich, with the poor and
working class pushed out or against the wall.

   Grace Hughes, a trustee of the Marin County Foundation and a
guest on the show, talked about the ``Carmelization'' of Marin,
saying, ``Even our gas stations are cute.''

</P>
<P>
   The astounding thing to me was that even callers in their 30s
and early 40s complained about how much the Bay Area has changed. I
thought that was the one job old people had to themselves, with no
threat of being replaced by younger people.

<P>
   A man named David who came to San Francisco in the 1980s, the
decade of the junk bond, complained about the rampant materialism
of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out here to play,'' he said. ``I came here to stay out
late at night, meet weird characters and hopefully become one
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's just another guy calling a radio talk show. Krasny
pointed out that maybe David came to San Francisco for the theme
park.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but it was a different theme park back in the good old days
_ even the good old days of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The admission fee wasn't $2,000 a month. If you were this high,
you could take the rides _ and high on anything, not just high on
greed.

   But what can you do? My motto is, ``No yuppie ever wrecked my
life except me.''

SORE LEGS, CALVES MAY MEAN MORE THAN ARTHRITIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Some 8 million Americans, most of them over the
age of 50, have peripheral vascular disease, or PVD, which is
characterized by intense pain in the legs and calves. Many people
confuse the symptoms with arthritis, muscle spasms or being out of
shape.
</P>
<P>
   But PVD is potentially more dangerous than many of the aches and
pains that people associate with aging.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the disease is caused by the same hardening of
the arteries that occurs when people suffer from heart disease only
it affects the arteries in the legs.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate result is pain as the legs gasp for air. Left
untreated, PVD can require amputation, or in extreme causes, be
fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know about it,'' said Dr. John Fulco, a
vascular interventional radiologist at St. Clare's Hospital in
Schenectady. ``There's a lot of misconceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, more than 500 hospitals across the country are
hosting free screenings to identify people at risk for the disease.
The screenings are part of a national awareness campaign known as
``Legs for Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Legs for Life' is designed to catch peripheral vascular
disease early, when it is very treatable,'' said Dr. Rodney Raabe
of the Society of Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology,
which is sponsoring the event.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has heart disease should be screened for PVD, but
others at risk include people who smoke, have diabetes, high blood
pressure or high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disease shows up most commonly as pain in the legs,
sometimes it will occur as lower back or buttocks pain.
</P>
<P>
   The legs may also feel numb, tingling, cold or swollen.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you'll notice a sore or an ulcer that just won't heal.
Other times, the pain will come at night in bed, when your foot or
toe turns a lobster red.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will wake the patient up,'' Fulco said. ``They get relief
by sitting up and hanging the leg over the bed.''
</P>
<P>
   When caught early, PVD can often be treated through lifestyle
changes or oral medications that actually help the red blood cells
squeeze through damaged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kyran Dowling at the Albany Medical Center stresses the
importance of exercise for those who are still well enough.
</P>
<P>
   Regular walking can ease the symptoms of PVD by improving
circulation in the legs and creating new ways for the oxygen to
travel around the blockages and into the muscles and tissues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole body benefits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For people with more serious disease, physicians can use some of
the same techniques they use to treat heart disease, including
opening up the blocked vessels with balloon catheters or stents.
</P>
<P>
   One out of every five patients with PVD may require bypass
surgery to reroute blood flow around the blockage. Since having PVD
and heart disease increases your risk of stroke and heart attack,
the best strategy remains prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop smoking, get regular exercise and if you're diabetic,
you've got to keep your diet under control,'' Fulco said.

FOR PATRIOTS, KEY ROOKIE IS WOODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Attention has been focused on the other
Patriots rookies. Perhaps Michael Bishop has been most in the
spotlight, then Andy Katzenmoyer and next Sean Morey. Even Tony
George has grabbed his share of attention.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most important rookie of all has gone about his
job quietly and with little attention. The seventh-rounders have
Patriot fans arguing and debating, but their first pick in the
first round, center Damien Woody, absolutely must succeed. And so
far, Woody seems well on his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to see the whole picture now,'' said the rookie
from Boston College, ``and at the start of training camp, I didn't
see that.''
</P>
<P>
   No team in the NFL can do very well without a strong offensive
line, and Woody will be the anchor of the Patriots' unit. It is
daunting for a rookie, even more so for a center who must recognize
opponents' schemes and make blocking calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're counting on Woody, and he has to come through for us,''
said coach Pete Carroll. ``We're not counting on him to do
extraordinary things but just do a regular journeyman's load and
start building. He's done well enough that we feel OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Woody has been doing great,'' said his neighbor at left guard,
Heath Irwin. ``He's really come along incredibly through camp.
We're not too worried about Woody in there. I think it's working
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Woody has been seeing vanilla defenses from the four
opponents in exhibition games. It all changes Sunday with the start
of the regular season, when new games and tricks and ploys and
stunts will be thrown at Woody by the Jets, seeking to confuse the
youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can help him with some calls,'' said Irwin. ``But
pretty much everybody on the line knows where the calls are going,
and if he does call something that may not be right at the time or
maybe something that he hasn't seen, it can be changed by somebody
else. But Woody has been doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody had been eased into the Patriots' system, with help from
his coaches, of course, but also teammates on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never let my confidence fall,'' said Woody. ``They've
been helping me out a lot and it's made the transition (from
college) a lot easier for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Woody knows all too well, ``People are counting on me to
make the right calls and do the right thing. I think I'm in pretty
good shape right now as far as grasping the offense and mentally
I've really progressed a lot since the first day of camp. And
physically I think I'm doing OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the blocking calls ``is going a whole lot better now,''
the rookie went on. ``Things are coming to me now. I'm seeing the
whole defense and I credit a lot of that to (line coach Dante
Scarnecchia) and doing a lot of film work on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody knows the Jets will be coming at him with some ``funky
schemes, but that's sort of good in a way because I can anticipate
it,'' he said. ``I'll be able to jump on what they're trying to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, for instance, Woody came to practice an hour early
``and I went to watch films (of the Jets) by myself for an hour,
both from their preseason and from last year. And I'm starting to
get a feel for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, said Woody, ``I think I'm ready for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the quiet rookie will mean more to the Patriots than any
loud debates about other rookies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Beatles once owned the music charts 30 years ago, Harry
Potter books now dominate the Amazon.com bestseller list, holding
the list's top three spots at times over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before the third book in the series, ``Harry Potter
and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' went on sale at US bookstores today
(Sept. 8).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' says Terri Schmitz,
owner of the Children's Book Shop in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Created by author J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter may be more than a
fictional boy wizard whose adventures beguile children and adults
alike; the Potter books are also an Internet phenomenon, one that
may change the way books are marketed and sold, and one that has
given some British Internet booksellers an advantage over
brick-and-mortar rivals in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Cambridge, Mass., WordsWorth Books is ready for ``Harry
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.''
</P>
<P>
   WordsWorth is treating the book's release in much the same way
that other retailers once promoted the debut of a Michael Jackson
album or of Windows 95. For the first time in its history, plans
called for WordsWorth to open just after midnight to handle an
expected crush of Harry Potter fans.
</P>
<P>
   But some US readers already have the book, which has been
available in Rowling's native Britain for several months. They
bought their copies from on-line bookstores based in England, such
as the the British Web site run by Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Any US retailer that sold ``The Prisoner of Azkaban'' before the
official release date could be penalized. But such legal restraints
don't apply to purchases made by Americans at British on-line
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Some Harry Potter sales have been diverted from the
book's American publisher and US retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could mean an incredible loss of sales for us,'' says
WordsWorth general manager Sanj Kharbanda, though he still expects
the new Harry Potter to be a big seller for the store.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, publishers bought rights to a book country by
country, and a book could have more than one publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, a publisher had a monopoly on a book within a certain
territory. But thanks to the Internet, a book can be almost
instantly available anywhere in the world, and readers in one
country can buy it from a Web site in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Territorial rights no longer mean what they used to,'' says
Wayne ``Rusty'' Drugan, executive director of the New England
Booksellers Association. ``Either the law has to change, or
practices have to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has changed the playing field,'' laments chief
executive Avin Mark Domnitz of the American Booksellers
Association. The Internet is changing ``all the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter's success has been so extraordinary it's hard to
say what lasting impact it may have on international publishing and
on books that don't inspire similar zeal among readers.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like the Harry Potter phenomenon has ever happened
before, notes executive director Caron Chapman of the Association
of Booksellers for Children.
</P>
<P>
   Written by a first-time author who only a few years ago was the
British equivalent of a welfare mother, Harry Potter stories
``caught everyone by surprise,'' Chapman says.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen again, she says. Better planning and more
foresight should prevent a recurrence of sales leaking away from US
retailers to British Web sites, she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Rowling's series _ ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone,'' ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,''
and now ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' _ have been
published by Scholastic Inc. of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago Scholastic was hinting about possible lawsuits
over Internet sales, but now it downplays the impact of Americans
buying Harry Potter books from British on-line retailers supplied
by Rowling's British publisher.
</P>
<P>
   At most, Americans bought 30,000 copies of the first two Harry
Potter books from British Web sites; taken in the context of more
than 3.5 million copies sold by Scholastic in the United States,
that's a mere pin prick, the company insists.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, stories about Americans hunting Harry Potter books down
on the Internet only add to the boy wizard's mystique and help
create a marketing buzz that boosts Scholastic's sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every book publisher should have such a problem,'' says
Scholastic executive vice president Barbara Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   It's the lag time between a book's British release and its US
release that gives British Web sites their opening. That lag time
was a year for the first Harry Potter book, seven months for the
second, and two months for the third.
</P>
<P>
   Four more Harry Potter books are planned, and those future books
will be released almost simultaneously in Britain and the United
States, Scholastic says.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Amazon.com makes no apologies for selling copies
of Harry Potter to US consumers at its British Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is comparable to an American tourist shopping at a
London bookstore, then bringing a book back home, says Amazon.com
spokesman Paul Capelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is operating in a global economy, and the Internet
is changing how things are done,'' Capelli says. ``As a retailer,
we operate within the law and do what's right. We will continue to
look to serve our customers as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Internet has changed Harry Potter, Harry Potter has
changed the economics of selling children's books.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter has transformed Rowling into the rarest of writers,
an author of children's books who generates sales that a Tom Clancy
or a Stephen King might envy.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter has ``crossed gender and age,'' even adults are
enchanted, says Kharbanda of WordsWorth Books.
</P>
<P>
   Such best-selling authors as Clancy and King drive sales at
bookstores with a largely adult clientele. But a children's
bookstore relies more on perennials, parents buying childhood
favorites for their own kids _ ``Make Way for Ducklings,'' maybe,
or E.B. White's ``Charlotte's Web.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Charlotte's Web'' was the last book before Harry
Potter to spend more than a few weeks on the bestseller list,
according to the New York Times, and ``Charlotte's Web'' was a
bestseller in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   For bookstores aimed at children, the new Harry Potter book
should be a godsend. But because of the Internet, it doesn't seem
to be working out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically everyone I talk to already has the third book,''
says Schmitz of the Children's Book Shop.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, independent stores have been under siege,
first from superstores such as a Barnes &AMP; Noble with their coffee
bars and music sections. Then came the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon.com and superstores have really taken a toll,'' Schmitz
says.
</P>
<P>
   Superstores can offer lower prices, but Schmitz tries to offer
more expertise. Every member of her staff is a specialist in
children's literature, she says.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that formula has held up, but it doesn't help when some
Internet booksellers get first crack at selling a blockbuster such
as Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kharbanda, WordsWorth inspires nearly the same
devotion from its customers as Rowling does from her readers.
</P>
<P>
   But when British copies of ``The Prisoner of Azkaban'' can be
had on the Internet before the book goes on sale at US bookstores,
that devotion can be put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Kharbanda says, ``Even customers who've been totally loyal to
Wordsworth just couldn't wait.''

BURNOUT NO CONCERN WITH BRUINS COACH

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There's a cliche in sports that goes something like
this: When a coach heads into his third year behind the bench with
one team, there is a danger that players will stop listening to him
at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Ask coaches, general managers, and players where that adage
comes from, and no one knows. Is it because the shelf life of
coaches seems to get shorter and shorter? Is it because the
pressure and the money seem to be increasing all the time in an
industry in which the players have more and more power and the
coaches less and less?
</P>
<P>
   Pat Burns is heading into his third year with the Bruins. In his
first season, little was known about the brand-new squad, which was
full of kids. The team was coming off its worst season in 30 years,
and Burns, with a four-year contract, was doggedly determined to
turn it around. Last fall, Burns went into training camp with key
players _ top scorer Jason Allison, valuable defenseman Kyle
McLaren, and up-and-coming forward Anson Carter _ out of the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the holdout bug struck again; No. 1 goalie Byron
Dafoe is out in California, while left wing P.J. Axelsson and
defenseman Hal Gill are cooling their heels at their respective
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Burns recognizes this as an annual event and, just as he said
last year, he'll coach the players he has.
</P>
<P>
   When he was told that Indiana Pacers coach and former Celtic
legend Larry Bird planned to call it quits after three years, Burns
had a classic comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Bird's rich; I'm not,'' said Burns. ``So sorry, Larry,
I'd like to go for a long time. People have said (a certain number
of) years _ I've even said four years _ maybe was enough. Who
knows, if you're doing the proper things? The guys you have to
satisfy are ownership and management. When I hear that players
turned off, I'm wondering sometimes if it's not somebody else who
turned off. I get along fine with management here. Our ownership is
a great ownership because they don't meddle. I'd like to stay here
a long time. I'm starting the third year of a four-year deal, so
let's see what happens next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden practically
chortled when asked if he was worried about his players turning a
deaf ear to Burns's instruction at any point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of hard to tune out,'' said Sinden. ``I don't think
you can turn that switch. He gets their attention very easily. I'm
not worried about that with him. That's one of the reasons he got a
four-year contract. That's a long contract for a coach. I'm
thankful I have him to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   So once again, Burns will take a patchwork quilt into the
exhibition season, trying out new faces with varying degrees of
talent and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we get into a situation where not everybody is here
again,'' said Burns. ``Am I comfortable? No, I'm not that
comfortable. We're going to have to see what kind of team we're
going to be able to put out on the ice. When you lose guys like Tim
Taylor (who went to the Rangers) and P.J. Axelsson, they were a big
part of our penalty killing, and it was No. 1 in the NHL. Dave
Ellett is gone (as the result of a buyout), and Ken Baumgartner is
behind the bench with me (as an assistant). All of a sudden, I look
down the bench, and they're not there anymore. We have to fill that
void.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest void continues to be in net. Dafoe remains out of
camp, and the news hasn't been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goaltending is 75 percent of your team, and when you don't
have it, it's 100 percent of your team,'' said Burns. ``We'll give
some opportunities to guys like (John) Grahame and Robbie Tallas.
They're going to have to do it. Our penalty killing had a lot to do
with Byron last year, too. And Hal Gill is another one. Everybody
seems to forget that we had six or seven guys walk out of this
hockey team who have not been replaced yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As pointed as Burns was about his lack of a cohesive lineup, he
said he won't be getting involved in the front office's business.
He'll make the most of what he has, although if September turns
into October and November and Dafoe is still absent, it's hard to
believe Burns could hold his tongue. However, in Day 3 of training
camp in suburban Wilmington, Burns was putting a brave and
pragmatic face on things.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to move on. There's nothing you can do about it,'' he
said. ``You can't let it distract you. You have to go out and try
to find a way to win. That's my job, no matter who's in front of
me.''

`GET REAL' GETS DOWN IN DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
GET REAL 
Starring: Jon Tenney, Debrah Farentino, Christina Pickles, Anne
Hathaway, Eric Christian Olsen, Jesse Eisenberg 
On: Fox, Ch. 25 
Time: Wednesday at 9 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' means to turn the family TV series into a
self-conscious, postmodern joke. Sure, Fox's spiffy new family
dramedy (a famedy?) relies on some very conventional TV storylines,
from Mom and Dad's strained marriage to 15-year-old Kenny's high
school crush. But the show eagerly reinvents these plot cliches
with the help of an arsenal of stylistic devices, including
relay-race voiceovers, allusions to other TV shows, and teens who
break the fourth wall to chat with viewers. It's an aggressively
innovative hour that has some of the spirit and non-gravitational
charm of 'toon-coms like ``Family Guy'' and ``The Simpsons,'' and
it will appeal to fans of the surrealistic tweaking that David E.
Kelley and ``Ally McBeal'' have made so popular.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind ``Get Real'' is that the best way to capture the
media-steeped chaos of an American family (white and affluent, of
course; this is network TV) is to be as boldly self-aware and
eccentric as possible. In the first few minutes of the premiere
episode, as the Green family chaotically readies itself for morning
lift-off, the characters say little as we hear their thoughts in
voiceover that leaps from character to character. We're smack
inside their group consciousness, from Mary Green's sexual fantasy
about her husband's business partner to 17-year-old Meghan's
musings on ``Get Real'' itself: ``I know what you're thinking: This
is another one of those smartass shows where the kids talk to the
audience like on `Dawson's Creek,' which, actually, come to think
of it, I'm not even sure does voiceovers.'' It's one of the
season's more engaging opening sequences.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere goes on to serve as a primer in the Greens of L.A.,
a family that is in as much turmoil as its mid-renovation kitchen.
Parents Mary and Mitch are too busy to deal with the death of
intimacy in their marriage; the usually overachieving Meghan
doesn't want to go to college; 16-year-old Cameron is a womanizing
narcissist; and young Kenny just wants to glimpse a woman's
breasts. The show has the same blueprint as ``My So-Called Life,''
with the moving back and forth between high school and home,
between class cliques and family issues. But, as Meghan rightly
tells us, ``Get Real'' is not as ``sturmy'' as ``My So-Called
Life,'' and its angst is almost always undercut by comedy and
irony. When Cameron is in a car accident and the show could be
headed into shmaltz, Meghan slyly notes, ``You think we're going to
kill my brother in the first episode?''
</P>
<P>
   The dramedic tone extends to Mary and Mitch's inability to
discipline their children. In one scene, Mary checks in on Cameron,
who's still sleeping. She stands beside his bed and pulls down the
sheet, and there he is _ naked beside one of his high school
girlfriends. ``Mom, this is Gaby,'' he says with a yawn, and
feckless Gaby reaches out her arm and says ``Hey Mrs. Green.'' And
as Gaby reaches to shake hands, the makers of ``Get Real'' amplify
the clinking sound of the many bracelets on her arm, a flourish
that drives home the sheer absurdity of the moment. It's a small
touch, but it's the sort of effect that ``Get Real'' uses to
maintain its buoyant atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``Get Real'' too smart for its own good? Are there too many
sex jokes? Yes, some of the hip references are dated (did they give
Kenny his name in order to fit in a ``South Park'' bit?) and there
may be one too many breast bits. But ``Get Real'' is nevertheless
an ambitious, energetic venture, one that could develop into
something unique if it doesn't tire itself out too soon.

   FIELD _ In the movie ``Field of Dreams'' the ghost of Shoeless
Joe Jackson emerges from a stand of corn and asks: ``Is this
Heaven?'' No such luck, Costner responds. But in the end the film
implies that the hereafter would have a hard time beating foul
lines stretching into a Midwestern cornfield. Fans charmed by the
movie's romance with baseball and farm life have come here ever
since, chasing ground balls and nostalgia on base paths. But this
piece of Iowa is Heaven no more. The field's caretakers _ Becky and
Don Lansing own the most of the infield and right field, Rita and
Al Ameskamp hold deed to left and center fields _ can't seem to get
along. In a conflict perhaps as American as the game the field
celebrates, the Lansings and Ameskamps peddle souvenirs out of
competing shacks and regularly settle scores at county zoning panel
meetings. ``It's a shame,'' said Don Lansing. ``It takes away from
the field and the fun for the fans.'' Scott Canon. 32. Photos.

<TEXT>
<P>
   `Good morning, class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Mr. Nyh-hann.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To start our school year we'll take our annual back-to-school
quiz. Because I know some of the answers and you don't, I'll tell
you. But after today, it's your job to find the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, doing corridor duty, I heard a lot of you grumble about
the facilities here. How many here can guess the average age of a
school building in the United States? Approximately 42 years. A lot
of them are twice that. How many factories could stay in business
if they had to operate in a building built before your parents were
born? Not many, is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many kids like you walk into those buildings every school
day? About 52 million, depending on the incidence of sniffles,
oversleeping, or hooky.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of you with younger brothers and sisters, how many
more classroom seats will be needed in the next seven years? About
2.3 million, to accommodate the baby boom and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many new teachers will be needed over the next 10 years to
teach this growing population of pupils? Almost as many _ 2.2
million. Why do we need so many new teachers? Lots of teachers will
retire, get burned out, or leave teaching for higher-paying or less
stressful jobs doing something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is burnout a problem? Because in a lot of classrooms,
there are 28 or 29 or 30 or even more students. The bigger the
class, the harder the teacher's job of getting each kid to do his
or her best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do some teachers quit and look for other jobs? Because
there's a lot of stress involved in standing before five or six
classes a day, doing hallway or cafeteria duty, meeting with kids
after school, dealing with parents, writing, and reading the notes
that fly back and forth, then correcting homework and tests and
papers at night or on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it harder to teach than it used to be? Parents aren't
home as much. So kids are a lot more rambunctious as a rule.
There's a lot less discipline in the home. A lot of kids _ almost
half _ live with only one parent at home, because of divorce or
separation _ or even no parent in the house. A lot of families have
both parents out working, sometimes at two jobs apiece. The kids
watch TV, eat junk food, hang out. Crime experts say kids who get
in trouble tend to get in trouble between 3 and 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I don't want to embarrass anybody by asking which of you
comes from a family with no health insurance, so don't raise your
hand. How many children and teens lack insurance? Eleven million.
Half of them should be on Medicaid, which helps poor families, or
the Children's Health Insurance Program, which Congress passed two
years ago. But some states changed welfare rules, so uninsured kids
fell through the cracks. Till 1996, if your family was on welfare,
you automatically got Medicaid coverage, too. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``With anybody working who wants a job, and this booming
economy, is education less important than it used to be? It would
be a huge mistake for you to believe that. Two out of three working
Americans earn less than $40,000 a year, which does not go very far
if you want a house, a car, a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now get out your pencil and paper and write these numbers
down. We're going to divide all 280 million Americans into five
groups of the same size, that's 20 percent of the population in
each fifth. The bottom fifth each year has to live on $8,800 per
household after taxes. That's $169 a week _ for everything. How
well can a family live on just $24 a day?
</P>
<P>
   ``The next lowest fifth live on $20,000 a year _ that's $55 a
day. If you put $20 worth of gas in your car, take someone to a
movie for $15, then go to McDonald's afterword, you're broke _ no
money for anything else that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The middle fifth live on $31,400 a year, that's $86 a day.
That's better _ but you better have health insurance for you and
your family. The second-highest fifth have $45,100 a year, good for
$123 a day. Most all of them have health insurance. Then there's
the fattest fifth, the 20 percent on top. They all have health
insurance, but a lot of them don't go to public schools either,
they go to private school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That household gets along on $515,000 a year, which works out
to $1,411 per day, which is the same as getting about $59 per hour.
In other words, the top fifth of households have as much money to
spend in three hours as the bottom fifth have to last a whole week.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that, boys and girls, is economics, and economics is what
determines who teaches you, how well, in what kind of a building,
for how much in taxes, and what kind of earning power you kids will
have in turn when you go to make a living. If it sounds
complicated, don't worry. You'll get to be very familiar with how
this works over the next 50 years. Try to remember this simple
rule: `You get what you pay for.' That's all for this first class.
Take a break. You'll need it. So do I.''

COMPANIES GET CREATIVE OVER LABOR SHORTAGE

 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- After seven years of a robust economy and unemployment
at record lows, the labor market is drying up in virtually every
sector, from unskilled laborers to information technology
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is so profound that local employers of every size
are going to extraordinary lengths to find workers. Raytheon Co. is
relaxing its button-down culture and deploying a squad of
executives, including its chief executive officer, to attract
employees, while Internet start-ups offer bounties and prizes for
referrals that lead to hires. Some Massachusetts restaurants
routinely bring in temporary workers from overseas to fill hiring
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   The worker drought has hit every region of the country. In
Nebraska, there is a shortage of meat packers. In Ohio, consumer
products giant Procter &AMP; Gamble has resorted to using a recruiting
firm to scour retirement homes in search of workers, some of whom
have been hired for entry-level jobs even though they are in their
70s and 80s. In Silicon Valley, the epicenter of the high-tech
revolution, bidding wars are common for talented software
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just getting tighter and tighter, and it is going to
continue,'' said Ryan Mason, Ohio area manager for Manpower Inc.,
the national recruiting firm assisting Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The labor market is so tight that some economists say a recent
small decline in labor demand from a peak in 1998 may not signal a
slowing of the economy, but rather a surrender of sorts by
employers who have given up trying to fill jobs because qualified
applicants are too few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Dellaria Salons. With about 20 hair salons
in New England, the chain has the business and the credit to open
as many as 10 more stores, but is going ahead with just two because
staffing more than that is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of recruiting. We offer a 401(k), life insurance,
medical insurance, and our average hairdresser after two years
makes $35,000 to $40,000 a year plus gratuities,'' said Nino
Micozzi, president of Dellaria Salons. If they were available, he
says, he could hire 100 stylists ``tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are not available, Micozzi says.
</P>
<P>
   Without stylists to cut hair, Dellaria is losing potential
business. The company estimates that each week about 1,800 people
are turned away from its 23 salons. With haircuts averaging $35,
the company may be forfeiting more than $3 million a year in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are higher for edocs Inc., a Natick start-up that
develops and markets Internet-based billing and document
transaction systems, a market niche that analysts say could reach
$40 billion in revenues by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, the company has doubled in size to about 100
employees but needs to hire another 80 employees by year's end _ a
considerable challenge given the tough competition for qualified
personnel in information technology.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using newspaper and radio ads, edocs officials
are considering running ads in movie theaters and are passing the
word around in area churches that the company is hiring.
</P>
<P>
   For every successful referral made by an employee, their spouse,
or a company vendor, the reward is $5,000. And the company, which
raised $22 million in venture capital funding in the last year, has
a pool of prizes, including two first-class tickets to Hawaii, that
it will give away in a drawing for employees who brought new
workers to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Growth is critical to the success of edocs, which offers new
employees a competitive salary, good benefits _ including unlimited
paid personal days _ and stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure is not an option for us,'' said cofounder and
executive vice president Jim Moran. ``We will search high and low.
We have more people involved full time in recruiting right now than
we do in marketing. This is so key to us because without them we
won't grow as fast as we want and won't dominate the marketplace
without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even established corporate giants are trying to be as nimble as
possible in pursuit of employees. Raytheon, which hopes to hire
7,000 people worldwide and bring on an additional 2,000 employees
straight out of college, has introduced flexible work hours and
casual dress _ not just on Friday but all week long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize how tight the market is and how competitive it is
and we are trying to make Raytheon as attractive as possible,''
said spokesman David Polk from the company's Lexington
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to routine college recruiting, 90 key executives
have been assigned to strengthen ties with campuses to woo the best
and brightest. Each executive focuses on a single school. ``We make
it part of their job to build relationships with faculty, staff,
and students,'' said Polk. Raytheon chairman and CEO Daniel P.
Burnham is not excluded. His campus? The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say the hiring challenge facing Raytheon and
thousands of other companies is not likely to ease soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor market will stay tight as long as the domestic
economy keeps growing,'' said William C. Dunkelberg, chief
economist for the National Federation of Independent Business,
which represents about 600,000 small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, where meat-packing jobs and many other unskilled
jobs are going unfilled, it is the same story. ``I don't see the
job market demand easing because this is a national phenomenon,''
said F. Charles Lamphear, director of the Bureau of Business
Research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. ``There are
shortages all around the country and noticeable shortages in
attractive areas like the information management field. I think it
will go on for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   With jobs so plentiful and labor in such short supply, there is
concern in Washington and on Wall Street that wages will rise and
spark inflation, since price increases tend to follow payroll
increases. But a surprising benefit to the prolonged economic
prosperity, economists say, is that productivity gains have offset
much of the need to raise prices dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, a Brandeis University
professor of social and economic policy, said there is also another
reason wage inflation has been held in check. ``Workers in the
1990s are aware of how easily they can be replaced, either by
technology, by lower-wage workers elsewhere in the country, or by
workers in other nations eager to offer their services for a
fraction of the prevailing wage in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, anecdotal evidence suggests many workers at all levels
of the economy are reaping the benefits of a tight labor market _
demanding and receiving signing bonuses, stock options, more time
off, and better work schedules. Meanwhile, businesses seem locked
in a struggle to find and keep workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dan'l Webster Hearth 'n Kettle Management Group, with two
inns and eight restaurants from Weymouth to Cape Cod, has
increasingly relied on workers from Jamaica to help it through its
peak season. This year the number reached 30 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year we have to bring more and more,'' said Frank
Catania, vice president of the company. ``We bring them here in May
and they stay until November. They work as cooks, dishwashers,
chambermaids; a couple are bakers.'' Their prevailing wage is set
by the Department of Labor, with dishwashers earning about $8.50 an
hour and cooks $11 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, businesses move quickly to grab workers when
companies in their industries fail. Last month, Boston-based
SpeechWorks International Inc., a computer software company,
learned that a Canadian software firm had collapsed. SpeechWorks
spent $50,000 to fly 40 software engineers from the defunct firm to
Boston, where they were treated to dinners and harbor cruises _ all
in an effort to hire them. The company has yet to say how many
engineers have come on board.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the need for workers overcomes their apparent lack of
knowledge in a particular field. When Caldor declared bankruptcy
recently, the Massachusetts Extended Care Federation, a nursing
home association, wrote to the chief executive officer of the
Connecticut-based retailer expressing interest in helping laid-off
Caldor workers ``find their way into new careers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the supercharged economy of the 1990s, such stories are
common. But perhaps no employer faces a more daunting challenge
than the US Census Bureau. The bureau's goal is to attract 3
million applicants and from that pool hire hundreds of thousands of
temporary workers to help take the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Some human resource managers think the goal is laughable, but
Janet Cummings, the bureau's assistant division chief for
recruiting, said the bureau will do what many employers have done
to fill the positions: pay top dollar. The going rate in New York
City will be as much as $18.50 per hour.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge by Red Hat Software Inc.'s red-hot stock price and
press clippings, one might conclude that software gigagiant
Microsoft Corp. is in for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat is the little North Carolina company that has run up a
$5.6 billion market capitalization by peddling a version of Linux,
the increasingly popular low-cost computer operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But mention Red Hat and Linux to Aubrey Edwards, group product
manager for Microsoft's forthcoming Windows NT upgrade Windows
2000, and he seems almost on the verge of stifling a yawn. ``When
you look at the hype versus the reality today,'' says Edwards,
``there is a big disconnect.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he is whistling in the dark. But then, Microsoft has been
here before.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Java? That was the radical new technology of four years
ago, an upstart product that threatened to smash Windows once and
for all.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the labs of Sun Microsystems Inc. and intended at first
to run cable TV controller boxes, Java wasn't an operating system
like Windows or Linux. Instead it was a much broader system that
challenged some of the most basic principles of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, computer software is very closely linked to the
hardware running it. The Windows operating system is specifically
designed to work with computers that contain Intel Corp.
processors. Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh machines use the
PowerPC chip, a different type of processor made by Motorola and
IBM. Windows software can't work with a PowerPC chip, and Mac
software won't talk to an Intel Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   Java attempts to get around all this by creating a ``virtual
machine,'' a piece of software that can run on all kinds of
different computers, from palm-sized data organizers to room-sized
mainframes.
</P>
<P>
   Java programs run in the virtual machine, and so in theory,
never again would programmers have to write different versions of
the same program for every different type of computer. ``Write
once, run everywhere,'' was the battle cry of Java advocates; Sun
even copyrighted the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, companies that had been battered by competition from
Microsoft embraced Java as a way to get back into the game. Corel
Computer Corp. said it would rewrite its WordPerfect office
software suite entirely in Java, so it would run on any computer.
Lotus Development Corp. announced eSuite, a set of lightweight
office software programs in Java, for use on corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   And even Microsoft in late 1995 agreed to license the Java
technology from Sun.
</P>
<P>
   (That license agreement spawned a bitter and still-pending
lawsuit between the two companies, with Sun claiming Microsoft is
trying to make unauthorized modifications to Java.)
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate dream for many computer users was software that
would render Windows irrelevant and shrink the power of Microsoft
forever.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't worked out that way. Corel killed its Java office
suite, and while Lotus officials refuse to provide confirmation,
several computer-industry publications have reported that eSuite is
also getting the ax.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's difficult to find any major Java programs on
business or home desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, says Sun's vice president of software marketing,
George Paolini. ``It hasn't happened because it hasn't needed to
happen,'' he says. ``There's no reason to rewrite an entire office
suite in Java.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially not when it turned out that Java programs
consistently ran much slower than programs written in the
traditional way. Java also had built-in limitations that made the
programs safer to run on corporate networks, but also less useful.
For example, Java was originally designed to prevent users from
saving files to a computer's hard drive _ a good security
precaution, but worse than useless for word processing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Java was touted as a key tool in another heavily hyped
movement toward ``network computers.'' Instead of keeping software
on each machine, people would use small, cheap computers that would
get all their software from a central server. Java is well-suited
to this approach.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad nobody wanted to buy network computers. Their
unpopularity was yet another blow to the Java movement. ``I think
that this network computing idea will be a major success, but it
may be years before it becomes a major success,'' says Rick Ross,
president of the Java Lobby, an organization of Java programmers.
``A lot of companies will go bankrupt waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Java is far from dead.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, there are still thousands of software
developers cobbling together Java programs, but for purposes quite
different than the overthrow of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Programs such as WordPerfect and other word processors are
called ``client'' applications, and are run by ordinary users. Java
hasn't caught on in that arena. But it turns out Java is a good way
to write programs that run on servers, the powerful machines that
work behind the scenes, running corporate networks and the
Internet. Server-based Java programs make it easy to exchange data
among many types of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Novera Software Inc. in Burlington, Mass. is one of many firms
that make Java software tools to help companies link up their
networked databases. ``It's an excellent language in which to work
to integrate disparate back-office applications,'' says Novera
cofounder Tim Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly there's no need to mourn for Java's fate. But its
success as a sort of welding tool for computer networks is a long
way from the early visions of Java partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Microsoft executives and they'll tell you that a similar
fate awaits Linux. Charles Fitzgerald, director of business
development in Microsoft's software development unit, says the
Linux hype has already peaked. ``Cold hard reality is coming to
bear,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald points to recent benchmark tests by the research firm
Mindcraft Inc., which found Windows NT performs a variety of tasks
faster than Linux. And he says Linux is notoriously complex and
hard to use, making it a poor choice for any but the most
sophisticated users. And Microsoft's Edwards says that Linux lacks
many advanced capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are categories where Linux is a strong
competitor,'' Fitzgerald admits. For example, he says it makes a
good server for delivering World Wide Web pages. But Fitgerald says
Linux still isn't ready for the heavy-duty tasks that Windows 2000
is designed to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Troan, director of engineering at Red Hat, freely admits
that the buzz over Linux has gotten a bit too loud as the price of
his company's shares has been bid up from 14 on the first day of
trading last month to 84 1/8 at the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Troan says Linux has already avoided one of Java's biggest
mistakes. The first releases of Java were crude and buggy. ``People
set it up as though the first release of immature technology was
going to go out and take over the world,'' Troan says. Linux, on
the other hand, came to public attention after years of buffing and
bug-fixing. Linux was running successfully on thousands of
computers long before the media hype began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably an adolescent now, instead of a toddler,''
Troan says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Java experience suggests that it's too early to say
what Linux will do when it grows up.

HENDERSON GETS THE CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Olympic softball team for 2000 will include eight
veterans from the 1996 gold-medal squad and at least one newcomer
whose name you might recognize: Danielle ``Harry'' Henderson, who
struck out 1,343 batters during her just-concluded All-American
career at the University of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still can't believe it,'' said Henderson Tuesday in San
Diego, where she and her new Olympic teammates will compete this
weekend in the US Olympic Cup. ``Press conferences, team meetings,
practices: I don't know when it's going to hit me. Maybe when I
come home.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Henderson, from Commack, N.Y., is now an
assistant coach at her alma mater, to which she expects to return
Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Olympians coming back to defend their title in Sydney
will be Dot Richardson, the 37-year-old second baseman and
orthopedic surgeon. The seven remaining veterans are outfielders
Laura Berg and Leah O'Brien-Amico, first baseman Sheila Douty, and
pitchers Christa Williams, Michele Smith, Lori Harrigan, and Lisa
Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the team will be Henderson, outfielder Christie
Ambrosi, third baseman Jennifer Brundage, shortstop Crystl Bustos,
infielder Jennifer McFalls, and catchers Stacey Nuverman and
Michelle Venturella.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member squad was announced Monday by the Amateur Softball
Association/USA Softball.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Henderson was a member of the US national team that
won gold at the Pan American Games, pitching two perfect games
while going 3-0, allowing just one hit and striking out 42 in 17
innings.
</P>
<P>
   For Elaine Sortino, the UMass softball coach under whom
Henderson compiled a 108-35 record and set an NCAA record last
season with 105 consecutive scoreless innings, it was a long night
waiting for the news after the three-day Olympic Trials ended
Saturday in Midland, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very, very hopeful,'' said Sortino, ``but in the
back of my mind I knew she has only been pitching since her junior
year of high school. In terms of years, she's really a neophyte.
Every week when she was here, you saw her get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   When the phone call from Henderson finally came at 4:15 a.m.
Sunday, recalled Sortino, the player's first words were ``Coach,
will you be mad if I don't come back to work for two weeks?''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. ``We're so proud,'' said Sortino, who confessed she
still gets goose bumps just thinking about it. ``What else could
you do in our game that's better than being a pitcher on the
Olympic team?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Henderson, who capped her brilliant career at UMass by
winning the Honda Award as the nation's top collegiate softball
player, being the only new pitcher to be added to the roster from
'96 ``doesn't make me nervous, it makes me honored to be on the
same staff as players I've looked up to for so long. I'll be able
to learn a lot from them.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Big weekend for Smyers
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Karen Smyers of Lincoln, Mass. will be one of six women
competing for Team USA at the Triathlon World Championship this
weekend in Montreal, by virtue of her recent third-place finish at
the North American Championships. The 1.5K swim-40K bike-10K run
will be contested at the 1976 Olympic rowing venue . . . Among the
finalists for the Women's Sports Foundation 1999 Sportswoman of the
Year are New Englanders A.J. Mleczko of Nantucket, a member of the
1998 gold-medal Olympic ice hockey team and 1999 national-champion
Harvard squad, and swimmer Jenny Thompson, a five-time Olympic
relay gold medalist and native of Dover, N.H., who last month broke
the world record for the 100-meter butterfly. Marla Runyan, the
1500-meter runner who made the World Championships final last month
despite being legally blind, is also among the 21 finalists, along
with Mia Hamm, Marion Jones, Juli Inkster, and Chamique Holdsclaw.

TENACIOUS REDSTONE SAVORS BIGGEST DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was classic Sumner Redstone. In front of a big media
audience, he rambled on with obvious enthusiasm and unbridled
superlatives Tuesday about the benefits of his latest and biggest
deal of all.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone, the man who once told the world that content was king,
explained why it was a master stroke to combine his Viacom Inc.
with CBS Inc. and its distribution empire in a deal valued at $37.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, most investors seemed to buy the story.
Shares of both Viacom and CBS traded higher on news of the merger
of the communications giants.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone is many odd things for a man worth $10 billion or so, a
serial name-dropper prone to inflating stories of triumph and
grabbing every chance to jab competitors, large or small.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the package also includes seemingly boundless
energy and optimism that would be remarkable in any person but is
truely striking for a 76-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with shrewdness and vast experience, that tenacious
personality has helped Redstone build a string of Boston-based
drive-in movie theaters into one of the world's largest media and
entertainment conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Newton resident who lives mostly in New York now,
Redstone is famous for a nonstop work schedule that stretches into
practically every waking hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him for over 30 years, and he's as motivated or
more motivated than at any time in his life,'' said George Abrams,
a Viacom director and Redstone's personal attorney for more than
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more success he's had, the more he wants to continue,''
said Abrams. ``I think Sumner will be running the company five
years from now, and 10 years from now if he can.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably not what Mel Karmazin has in mind. The CBS chief
will become second in command at Viacom and the explictly
identified successor to Redstone when he no longer runs the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone's two closest deputies, Philippe Dauman and Thomas
Dooley, will give up their management posts at Viacom. His two
children, both directors of Viacom, have not held senior management
jobs at the company and were never seen as corporate heirs to their
father's job (daughter Shari Redstone runs National Amusements in
Dedham, which owns the family Viacom stock and operates Showcase
Cinemas, among other things).
</P>
<P>
   Redstone built a remarkable local reputation long before he
became a national and then global media figure. Growing up poor, he
graduated first in his class at Boston Latin and made it through
Harvard in 2 1/2 years. After a brief career as a lawyer, he
returned to his father's theater business.
</P>
<P>
   The famous local story that testified to Redstone's iron will
involved his survival during the 1979 fire at the Copley Plaza
hotel, where he hung on to a third-floor windowsill. Flames burned
his right hand until a fire-engine ladder rose to save him. Burned
on 80 percent of his body, Redstone took a year to recover from his
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, he made it to a national stage and went deep
into debt by spending $3.4 billion for Viacom Inc., a hodgepodge of
cable television assets that included some gems like MTV and
Nickelodeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the guts to go out and leverage up on Viacom when most
people thought he was crazy,'' said investment manager Mario
Gabelli, whose company is the largest institutional investor in
Viacom stock.
</P>
<P>
   But that was nothing compared to the $10 billion Viacom spent to
outduel Barry Diller in a contest to buy Paramount in 1993. Even
Redstone concedes he paid more than he expected because of the
bidding contest, but he insists that the deal eventually turned
into a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone's $8.4 billion acquisition of video rental giant
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. in 1994 wasn't the highest-priced
piece of the Viacom empire, but it nearly turned out to be the most
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the deal, Blockbuster was stumbling badly, and
analysts wondered if developing technology like video on demand
would kill the operation. Redstone flew to Dallas and personally
helped redirect Blockbuster toward a revenue-sharing arrangement
with film studios that put more tapes in the stores and helped
revive business.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom spun off part of Blockbuster to the public to reduce debt
last month. The company that Viacom bought for $5.4 billion plus
debt has a current stock market value of about $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom's merger with CBS is Redstone's biggest deal of all.
While many Walt Disney Co. shareholders rumble about their troubles
as owners of the ABC network, Viacom investors generally like the
CBS deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very positive event for CBS and Viacom
shareholders,'' said Roland Gillis of Putnam Investments, the
Boston mutual fund company that invests extensively in media
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Says Gabelli: ``It gives him scale to compete against the giant
companies being put together globally.''
</P>
<P>
   Insiders like Abrams think Redstone will be around for years to
come, as Viacom integrates the CBS business and expands the
company's reach overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for him to retire. He still has a vision of
what's possible out there,'' said Abrams.

PROTECTED SPECIES IN US STILL FAIR GAME IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ In the United States, the gray wolf is a protected
species, guarded by tough federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the creature is vermin. Hunters are free to blast
away at the beasts on whim, and they do.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, US game biologists using radio collars to track
gray wolves in Montana were horrified when a trio of females loped
across the line to establish dens in Alberta. Each found a mate,
gave birth to cubs, and settled in. Within 16 months, all of the
female wolves, their offspring, and their mates had been killed by
Canadian ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Such contradictions are commonplace along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Among international wildlife groups, Canada is notorious for its
failure to pass a federal endangered species law similar to one
enacted in the United States more than a quarter-century ago.
Mexico has broad federal protections for threatened species,
leaving Canada as North America's wildlife renegade.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling the pressure, both domestically and from abroad, the
country's new environmental minister, David Anderson, pledged last
month to push for strong legislation that will place special
emphasis on guarding breeding and ranging habitat, such as forest,
wetlands, prairies, and coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has been down this road before. Although Anderson is
personally respected by environmentalists, there is cynicism as to
whether a federal government that has shown a historic
unwillingness to confront the issue can buck opposition from the
country's extremely powerful forestry, mining, and agricultural
industries _ as well as from provincial legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot get our act together in this country on the
most fundamental of problems,'' said David Schindler, a renowned
wildlife biologist and profesor of ecology at the University of
Alberta. ``Far be it from Canada to stop loggers or miners or
farmers from the innocent pursuit of destroying our natural
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country so vast and pristine that many of its citizens have
difficulty comprehending that hundreds of native animal and plant
species are in genuine danger, Canadian environmentalists find
themselves fighting battles that their American counterparts won a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Nixon brought in a darned good law in the US, and
Pierre Trudeau refused,'' said Elizabeth May, executive director of
the Canadian branch of the Sierra Club, referring to the former
Canadian prime minister. ``That's been the story ever since. Mexico
can do it, Australia can do it, but good, green Canada can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, more than 600 scientists from Canadian
universities, research centers, and even the government's own
wildlife agencies signed a strongly worded letter to Prime Minister
Jean Chretien imploring federal Parliament to enact meaningful
endangered species legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada's endangered species are too imperiled, too close to
extinction, and too precious to be held hostage to lobbyists,
political manipulation, or simple ignorance,'' the letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   In cases like the gray wolf, opponents of a federal species law
argue that the animal may be endangered in the United States, but
healthy populations survive in Canada and do not deserve rigorous
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The grizzly bear, abundant in Alberta and British Columbia only
a decade ago, is now in decline, according to many wildlife
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grizzly is going down rapidly in Alberta,'' said
Schindler. ``Mainly because of huge intrusion into habitat by
logging, oil, and gas companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Even wolves are having problems. In the Bow Valley of Banff
National Park, one of the most famous symbols of Canada's raw
beauty, not a single successful litter of wolves survived this
year; all of the young creatures were killed by cars or met other
misfortune from humans.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has 339 species in serious danger of disappearing,
according to wildlife experts, from the Peary caribou to the piping
plover. The federal government lists these animals and plants as
endangered but has no broad laws to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the creatures, such as the northern cricket frog or the
Eskimo curlew _ an Arctic bird _ haven't been seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   Others, from the Vancouver Island marmot on Canada's far west
coast to the American marten in Newfoundland, on the country's
easternmost edge, are down to a few hundred animals.
</P>
<P>
   At least on paper, there are often local regulations or
provincial laws to guard Canada's threatened animals or plants
against hunters or trappers, or _ in the case of plants and insects
_ against harvesters and collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such laws are often toothless, and that the real
danger to most Canadian wildlife is not the hunter's bullet but the
developer's bulldozer, the logger's chainsaw, and the farmer's
pesticides and plow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is habitat, not the individual animal,'' said
Lindsay Rodger, species recovery manager for World Wildlife
Fund-Canada. ``If we can't protect the spaces where endangered
animals live and breed, we can't protect the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still open season on almost any creature in the provinces
that have no endangered species laws, such as British Columbia,
Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland. ``Canadians love peregrine
falcons,'' one leading environmentalist joked darkly. ``They taste
as good as bald eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   In provinces with such laws, protections amount to no more than
legal lip service. Ontario, the most populous province _ where
species such as the Acadian flycatcher, aurora trout, and Lake Erie
water snake cling to the edge of survival _ has brought
prosecutions only five times in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Prince Edward Island, warning signs and fences skirt the sand
dunes that provide nesting grounds for the piping plover, a
melodious shore bird fast disappearing from its widely scattered
breeding ranges. But bicyclists, hikers, and other beachgoers at
spectacular Cavendish National Park regularly intrude on the grassy
knolls. Park officials claim to be helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the only authority we have is to put up signs
saying it's bad to hurt the birds,'' said one uniformed ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a bigger threat comes from mining, forestry, and the
petroleum industry, which are mainstays of the economy, especially
in western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, these industries have discovered a public relations
problem related to habitat destruction _ something most American
natural resources companies recognized decades ago. But logging and
mining outfits insist they cannot afford to support a federal
endangered species act unless they get compensation. Farmers also
want federal paybacks for not plowing under habitat, a demand that
gets more sympathy from environmentalists than from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Provincial governments insist that land management falls under
their jurisdiction, and that federal protection for wildlife
represents a slap against Canadian-style home rule.
</P>
<P>
   A less obvious problem, but one cited repeatedly by wildlife
experts, is psychological.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is so vast and so relatively unspoiled that environmental
protection has never carried the sense of public urgency that it
does in the United States or Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Canada is frozen barrens or tundra, as inhospitable to
most animals and plants as to humans. Most, although not all, of
the country's seriously endangered species inhabit the
200-mile-wide band along the US border that is also home to most of
Canada's cities, factories, and farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, Canadians are blinded by the country's amazing
natural riches,'' Schindler said. ``It's hard to recognize the
slippage. But all the dangers are there.''

THE GREAT CABLE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A slowly bubbling national debate over whether and how
high-speed cable modem connections to the Internet should be
regulated promises to be a jackpot for lawyers and spinmeisters.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the wholesome proconsumer slogans being tossed around _
``Open access'' versus ``Hands off the Internet!'' _ some of the
nation's biggest, richest corporations are waging an epic battle
for billions of dollars in the 21st century economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a proposed November 2000 ballot question that would
require cable giants such as MediaOne to make their lines available
to all Internet service providers cleared a key hurdle in the Bay
State when Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly gave its supporters
the OK to start collecting signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits over the ballot question seem certain. But in the
meantime, expect to see increasing efforts to make ``open access''
a public issue _ particularly as state and local authorities rule
on transferring ownership of community cable franchises from
MediaOne to AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``As consumers, we should all want this debate to occur,'' said
Boyd Peterson, a telecommunications analyst with The Yankee Group
in Boston. ``The end result will be that the pressure is going to
increase on all the companies involved to roll out these high-speed
broadband services faster.''
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the debate are the Internet service providers
such as America Online, GTE, Baby Bells, and numerous smaller
firms, which all seek access to the high-speed cables beginning to
reach into millions of American homes. On the other are the
companies developing fast cable modem connections, particularly
AT&AMP;T, which is spending $100 billion to take over MediaOne and
cable giant TCI, and sees its rivals as freeloaders. Both sides
have ample funds to throw at advertising campaigns and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne's RoadRunner and similar services offered in some
communities by RCN, Adelphia Cable, and FrontierVision promise
people an always-on connection to the Internet that can download
Web pages and other data up to 50 times faster than the standard
telephone modem.
</P>
<P>
   Already, MediaOne's inroads making RoadRunner available to more
than 1 million homes in Massachusetts and New Hampshire _ 70,000 of
which have signed up _ have pushed Bell Atlantic to promise to make
its faster Digital Subscriber Line service available throughout
eastern Massachusetts by year end.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wireless telephone companies and satellite owners are
working at a torrid pace to perfect their own systems to provide
people with high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Either on the state ballot next November, in hearings before
local licensing boards, or perhaps in the Legislature,
Massachusetts residents and officials will have to decide which of
the following statements they agree with:
</P>
<P>
   --In the 1999 economy, Internet access should be regulated the
same way as access to the public telephone network. Cable firms
that have been handed local monopolies to build lucrative networks
can reasonably be required to make deals for ISPs to use those
lines to reach customers, just as Bell Atlantic has had to open
phone lines to rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Or:
</P>
<P>
   --Cable investors have risked billions of dollars upgrading
one-way television lines to carry two-way Net traffic, with no
guarantee they won't be croaked by DSL or wireless and satellite
links. Allowing freeloaders to hijack that investment is an illegal
seizure of private property and will chill investment in all
efforts to build faster Internet links.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Massachusetts ballot question, sponsored by Boston
venture capitalist J. Christopher Grace, would require companies
including MediaOne to allow ISPs to make deals to resell RoadRunner
access to their ports, on ``commercially reasonable terms . . . no
less favorable'' than what MediaOne offers to its affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's effort is modeled on local open-access provisions
enacted earlier this summer in Portland, Ore., and Broward County,
Fla., both of which AT&AMP;T has gone to court to overturn. Canada's
national regulators have also required open access to cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the fight has led to the creation of lavishly funded
lobbying groups on both sides, Hands Off the Internet, whose
backers include AT&AMP;T and Americans for Tax Reform, and the OpenNET
Coalition, started by AOL and now backed as well by MCI WorldCom,
Mindspring, and U S West.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Republican political consultant Charles
Manning is pressing the case for AT&AMP;T and Hands Off the Internet.
Grace's allies include former state consumer affairs chief Paula W.
Gold and publicist Thaleia Tsongas Schlesinger.
</P>
<P>
   The bonanza for the lawyers involved has only just begun. Just
in jousting over whether the open-access question should be
certified for the ballot, attorneys Thomas Kiley for the New
England Cable Television Association and Saul Schapiro for Grace
filed four rounds of letters with Reilly totalling 79
densely-argued pages.
</P>
<P>
   Showing how creatively and aggressively cable firms will seek to
fight the issue, Kiley even cited a 1924 Supreme Judicial Court
case upholding a Boston newspaper's right to refuse state
government advertising as a precedent for forbidding ``open
access'' to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, the ranking
Democrat on the House telecommunications subcommittee, last week
spoke out for ``open, nondiscriminatory broadband access,'' saying
it is the key to fostering even greater Internet growth and price
competition for subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the argument has not swayed the chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission, William E. Kennard, who argues
that the best regulation for the Internet is no regulation, and
allowing a mish-mash of local access policies could create chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot regulate against problems that have yet to
materialize in a market that has yet to develop,'' said Kennard,
who notes that barely 1 million of the 40 million US internet users
have access to broadband links.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some consider cable to have a lead at this time, it is
premature to conclude either that such a lead will last or that its
current position amounts to a monopoly,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he agrees with top investment bankers who have
argued that FCC regulation of cable Internet connections ``would
chill investment in cable modem service, which in turn would reduce
the competitive pressure on local phone companies and others who
are currently investing in alternative means.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL, with 17 million customers, and other Internet service
providers fear that in time, cable companies could knock them out
of business. They say few people who have the choice would take a
56-kbs telephone connection when they could get a much faster link
through cable.
</P>
<P>
   RoadRunner customers can get an AOL account for an extra $10 a
month or subscribe to any other ISP. But the Oregon federal judge
who upheld Portland's open-access rule, Owen M. Panner, observed in
his ruling that ``few subscribers would pay twice for similar
services.''
</P>
<P>
   And in time, cable rivals fear companies such as AT&AMP;T and
MediaOne would restrict where Web surfers can go, forbidding them,
for example, from downloading movies over the Internet that would
cost $5 to see on a cable pay-per-view channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it creates an unequal playing field, a lack of
consumer choice, and ultimately higher prices for the consumer''
trying to get on the Internet, said J. Scott Marcus, chief
technology officer at GTE Internetworking in Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies say requiring them to let any ISP who wants to
hook up to their system could overwhelm limited transmission
capability and even force them to dump television channels to
accommodate demand. Critics call those technological concerns
vastly overblown, and GTE said a trial with a cable system it owns
in Clearwater, Fla., proves open access is doable.
</P>
<P>
   The cable companies' view of their Internet links could well be
compared to Ronald Reagan's on the Panama Canal: ``We built it, we
own it, it's ours, and we're not going to give it away.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's general counsel, Jim Cicconi, recently said AOL and its
allies are acting as if they ``can sit on the sidelines and let
someone else spend hundreds of billions of dollars and then reap
the gains with no investment cost. Our response is, if AOL wants a
cable network, it can go invest in one itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grace said, ``Do we in Massachusetts want 10 or 15 cables
running to every house? Is that their vision of Massachusetts, that
every street is being dug up all the time by companies trying to
install more wires? It just doesn't make any sense.''

<P>
   CHESTER, Vt. _ Rocking her granddaughter to sleep, Jayne
Gallagher could hear the raspy, televised voice of Vermont's
governor above the infant's soft breathing: ``Vermont has long been
known as the least diverse state in the nation. That is rapidly
changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Howard Dean's words last year, part of a plea for
enlightened attitudes after several race-related incidents, must
have stirred something in Gallagher, who is white, because soon she
was overseeing an unusual merger of two very different worlds _ one
white and rural, the other African and war-torn.
</P>
<P>
   From the small town of Chester, where residents can drive along
country roads all their lives without encountering a black person,
Gallagher started the Ethiopian Adoption Project. Dozens of
families from across the whitest state in the nation have agreed to
adopt 60 children orphaned by Ethiopia's war with neighboring
Eritrea. Gallagher expects the first group of children to begin
arriving in Vermont by December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought: What a loving way to diversify Vermont,'' Gallagher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission of mercy, though, has rekindled an emotional debate
over whether children are hurt when they are adopted across racial
and cultural lines. To Gallagher, it matters only that the
children, who have seen their parents die in what is being dubbed
as the world's bloodiest war, have a home and love.
</P>
<P>
   But Rudolph Smith, president of the Association of Black Social
Workers, fears that Ethiopians being brought to live in a culture
as white as Vermont will be stripped of their self-identity.
``Ethiopia is an African culture with black Africans, and Vermont
is a lily, lily white state,'' he said. ``You are going to have a
whole bunch of black children running around who don't know who
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's black population of an estimated 3,102 in 1997, which
has never tipped over 1 percent, could easily fit in Boston
University's Walter Brown Arena with room to spare. But as the
state experiences a small but noticeable increase of black and
Asian residents within the past decade, it has also begun to
grapple with race-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be easy,'' said Joe Kroll, whose adopted Korean
daughter Mei Lin, now 22, gives speeches on how hard it was to grow
up in a white world and retain her self-identity.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll, executive director of the North American Council of
Adoptable Children, based in St. Paul, said Vermont parents will
struggle with protecting their children and teaching them to
embrace their own culture. ``The sign of a successful interracial
placement is if the child has a strong and healthy self-esteem and
identity toward their own culture or race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite skepticism, even from adoption agencies that warned that
white families do not normally adopt African children, Gallagher
received dozens of responses within days of placing ads in the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Chatot was one of those callers. For three years,
Chatot and her husband, Paul, a nurse, have wanted to adopt a
child, but finances have prevented them from doing so. But shortly
after Chatot, 40, the mother of two teenagers, read in the
newspaper about Gallagher's efforts and the low cost of the
adoption, she accompanied Gallagher on a plane to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was the right thing to do,'' said Chatot of her
plans to adopt a 4-year-old Ethiopian boy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chatot, Gallagher, and school officials say they do not
see the color of a person's skin, Smith and even multiracial
adoption proponents say it is because they never had to: Most of
the schools in Chester have few if any minority children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermont is not Utopia. There is a resistance and the lack of
acknowledgment that it could be racist,'' said one white mother
whose adopted daughter is black.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of her
daughter being taunted more, said the child has had problems in the
school district. She said the family is considering moving from
Windsor County to a more diversified area.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Asian students have always stood out in Vermont.
Nearly 15 years ago, when 18 black basketball players from Boston
got off a bus at Green Mountain Union High School in Chester, it
sent dozens of white children to the school window in awe, said Jim
Collins, one of the school's administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said her goal is to find adoptive families in Ethiopia
for the 20,000 orphans. Meanwhile, communities such as Chester,
Norwich, Brattleboro, and White River Junction, as well as some New
Hampshire towns, are working to bring a piece of Ethiopia to
northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   International festivals are being planned, a local therapist has
volunteered to counsel the families, and local Ethiopians have
agreed to make frequent visits to provide lessons on the African
culture, such as how to cook injera, an Ethiopian staple that
resembles a spongy bread.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 23 of nearly 60 Vermont families _ professionals,
working-class, and single parents _ have completed a state and
immigration process to adopt 29 children. Gallagher, who has used
her own money to set up the program and for travel, has a local
adoption agency called Adoption Advocates Inc. as the international
license holder. She is awaiting a license from The Children and
Youth Administration in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Ethiopian government spokesman, Ethiopians
prefer that their children remain within their own culture. ``But I
think we have to look at it from the interest of the babies. In
Ethiopia we have one policy: Adoptions are done for children that
do not have any choices,'' said Tsegay Wolde-Georgis of the
Ethiopian Embassy in Washington. ``The option between being adopted
by a loving family, whoever he is, and being a street child is a
very easy answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Christie, the only black school administrator in
Vermont and a resident of White River Junction, said racism can be
subtle and the old ways of thinking can be hard to shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably be difficult for them,'' he said. But
Collins, the administrator who may soon have two Ethiopians at the
high school, which has only one black student registered this fall,
thinks it will help open the minds of the isolated rural students
who often hold stereotypes of people different from them.
</P>
<P>
   When Chatot, who works for a pregnancy program, traveled to
Ethiopia, she said the only difference she saw between Vermont and
Ethiopia was the extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The children, who are living in an orphanage in Tigre, have
survived bombings but have watched their parents become victims of
the war. To remind herself of their plight, Gallagher brought the
tattered clothing of some of the orphans who struggle daily to keep
warm and fed.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, where many families make their living from farming,
the next day's meal can be as close as the backyard chicken coop.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, a fat child would be more discriminated against
than a person of a different race,'' said Gallagher, who will take
in two teenage boys.
</P>
<P>
   While that statement might seem naive in a country seemingly
obsessed with race, state officials such as Kathy Huit of the
governor's office said the comment embraces the accepting spirit
that has long been part of Vermont's history, the first state to
ban slavery in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermont has prided itself on its history of tolerance,'' she
said. ``And the governor is making sure we look at the issue of
diversity. He's made it his commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Vermont can be accepting, but there is still that
element of ignorance,'' Christie said. The adoptive parents ``will
need support.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently he had several students prosecuted at Randolph Area
Vocation Center, where he is the administrator, for spray-painting
racial epithets on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Christie, whose wife is white, has 26 years of living in Vermont
to teach him how to survive in an all-white environment. He picks
his battles, and matter-of-factly drives three hours to his native
Hartford, Conn., to buy black hair-care products. Those skills were
passed along to his daughter, and he hopes Vermonters will pass
them to the new immigrants.

UPN BOSS ISN'T WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dean Valentine is upbeat. He's confident. He's spewing numbers.
A lot of other people may be thinking ``Dead Man Walking,'' but
Valentine is having no part of it.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the theory that UPN, the network that Valentine
heads, is about to disappear in Viacom Inc.'s planned acquisition
of CBS Corp. Viacom is the parent company of UPN, Paramount
Television Group, Paramount Pictures and other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom still says that unless the government has a
fairly major change of heart, UPN will be the biggest casualty.
That's because no one _ not even corporate giants like Sumner
Redstone of Viacom and Mel Karmazin of CBS _ can own two television
networks. The rules call for divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   So what's it going to be _ the Tiffany Network or UPN, the
country's sixth-ranked network in a four-network race? Both, says
Valentine, ever the optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mel and Sumner are incredibly enthusiastic about the prospect
of owning two TV networks,'' Valentine said. ``They want this thing
to work. They're going to go to Washington and get a waiver.
They're committed to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would the Federal Communications Commission tell two people
who just merged $36 billion that the rules no longer apply to them?
Chances are they won't. But Valentine has an interesting theory on
why they will: Diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC, he said, wants television to better reflect the ethnic
makeup of the country. If you just woke up from a coma, you may not
be aware that this fall's TV season will look like ``The Waltons''
got themselves cloned. UPN is the only network that has launched
truly ethnic shows this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only one committed to that, the only one with
diversity in our programming, the only one committed to ethnic
casting. We're going to let that network die?'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   While UPN has certainly led the field in that area, the networks
got a proper scolding from the NAACP recently and are, in droves,
reworking many of their fall shows in an effort to provide minority
parts. Too little too late, surely, but the FCC may take that as
good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if it allows Viacom-CBS to own two networks, that could
be a dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Valentine said he's excited about what his network is
primed to do, citing the fact that UPN is already making huge
ratings turnarounds in total viewers and prime demographics, with
only two of its five nights rolled out for the fall season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a buzz on Madison Avenue,'' he said, noting
that advertisers like the fact that UPN is going after young males,
primarily with action shows, wrestling and guy-oriented comedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real need for what we're providing,'' Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though some may doubt a need for ``WWF Smackdown,'' the deal
makes a lot of sense for CBS, which couldn't draw a young audience
if it ran an all-nude ``Touched By An Angel.'' With UPN as a
partner, CBS would then be much better represented demographically.
And that means a lot more money. And money is why this whole thing
got started.
</P>
<P>
   There are not going to be any answers soon about the
ramifications of this deal. But UPN certainly looks to be the
biggest casualty of the merger. Despite the early ratings success
that Valentine noted, UPN is still bleeding money in a very bad
way.
</P>
<P>
   The question for viewers is this: Can you do without ``Moesha''
or ``Dilbert''? Can the television industry afford to lose a
network that has the most African-American programming?
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is not worried about the future of his network. He
sees wrestling in the picture _ going strong, gaining viewers. He
sees ``Shasta McNasty'' debuting at the end of the month (and he
says it'll be a hit). And he sees a wide range of ethnically
diverse shows in the UPN tradition. Where others can't see a
future, he sees a need.

MUSEUM TAPS CAPE   COD'S FRENCH CONNECTION

<P>
   ORLEANS, Mass. _ The electrician's pipe and tobacco sit on a
roll-top desk as though he might retrieve them at any minute. The
old brass and wood instruments, with such odd names as
galvanometer, remain perfectly undisturbed. The yellowed calendar
is still turned to Nov. 26, 1959, when the place closed for good.
</P>
<P>
   For 68 years, employees of the Compagnie Francaise des Cables
Telegraphiques telegraphed news to and from France, from stock
trades to the German invasion of France, from this modest white
clapboard house. On overwhelmingly Anglophile Cape Cod, it was a
rare French outpost, and the raison d'etre of a tiny French
community here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still go in there and almost visualize my father sitting
behind the table tapping away,'' said Lucien Ozon, a retired police
lieutenant whose father, Clement, was a telegraph operator in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But the ham radio operators, descendants of the cable men, and
other volunteers who keep the French Cable Station Museum going
can't seem to interest the world in their quirky story. With no aid
from governments or nonprofit foundations, they get by on a minimal
budget, attracting just a few hundred visitors a year, far fewer
than the Marconi Wireless Station down the road in Wellfleet that
helped put the telegraph station out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest problem is just getting people to know we're
here,'' said Jerry Downs, chairman of the museum board and the
grandson of a 19th-century station operator, an Englishman named
Thomas Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the French connection in Orleans is a bigger deal on
the tiny island of St. Pierre in Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence _
part of France despite its location _ than it is here. Thirteen
cable station workers came from St. Pierre, and when Orleans
residents visited the island in 1988, the mayor and other
dignitaries turned out to greet them.
</P>
<P>
   Now the museum is trying to raise its US profile, doubling
membership to 156 over the last year, attracting its first
corporate sponsor, and trying to convince anyone that will listen
that it is the steward of an important chapter in
telecommunications history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the high-tech industry of its day,'' Downs said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the French trailed their English rivals in a technology
race in 1879 when the French cable company completed a
trans-Atlantic telegraph cable from Brest, France, through St.
Pierre, to North Eastham. Initially, the only trained cable
operators were English, forcing the French to hire them. But within
a few years, the cable station was importing staff from St. Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   The cable company moved to downtown Orleans in 1891 after
workers' families complained that Eastham was too isolated. Four
cable men's homes were relocated to Orleans, becoming the
cornerstone of a French community of 40 or 50 people with such
names as Norgeot, Deschamps, and Ozon who still trace their roots
to St. Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   Ozon acknowledges that the French community here does little to
promote its heritage aside from the trip to St. Pierre. But he said
they are proud of the station's role in history and proud of the
French tricolor flag flying in front of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested in it now than I was 47 years ago, when I
first came here'' from St. Pierre as a child, Ozon said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the Morse code messages transmitted from the station were
as important as the Internet is today, providing a secure line
during World War I for US commanders to communicate with President
Wilson and bringing word that Charles Lindbergh had completed his
solo trans-Atlantic flight to Paris in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   During the German invasion of France in 1940, French telegraph
operators got off one last message from Brest as German sailors
approached: ``Here Come the Bosch. God help us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the emergence of radio and wireless telegraphs eroded the
importance of cables. On Nov. 26, 1959, the Orleans crew signed off
for good with a ``Happy Thanksgiving'' and the operators walked out
the door without so much as tidying up the place.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the station sat empty, in part because of President
Charles de Gaulle's determination not to sell French assets. Museum
guide Laurence Gray, an engineer by profession, was turned down by
the French cable company in the 1960s when he inquired about buying
some of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   DeGaulle ``said no French territory is going to be sold to an
American as long as I am alive,'' Gray recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Even after de Gaulle's death in 1970, however, Orleans residents
didn't want the building, repeatedly voting down money for the
purchase at Town Meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, 10 people came up with $40,000 to buy the station,
beating out an oil company that wanted to build a gas station, and
started the museum in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Today, aside from vintage photos, news clips, and assorted other
memorabilia, the cable station is virtually unchanged from its last
day of operation. The typewriter that rendered letters into Morse
code still works, as does the grandfather clock; the screws and
wires still sit in drawers carefully labeled in French and English.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strict orders from the boss: Don't move anything,''
Gray said, referring to Downs. ``I would like to clean the place
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the museum couldn't afford to do much more than clean
the place up anyway. It relies on member dues and the occasional
inheritance, and Downs said the group spends so little money that
he doesn't even prepare an annual budget. Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with the telecommunications junkies who can
make sense of equipment labeled with descriptions such as
``potentiometer divider for capacitance test.'' In a world where
communications is changing rapidly, they marvel at a place that
stays the same.
</P>
<P>
   But Downs wants a larger audience, the kind of people who read
Yankee Magazine or want an indoor activity for rainy summer days,
but they are hard to reach without money for publicity or
professional management.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pride in their roots, many descendants of the cable
men have not pitched in at the station. Ozon says he is too busy
with his limousine business to be involved, while his brother,
Clement, admits he has not been in the station since it closed.
</P>
<P>
   As the volunteers reduce their museum hours for the fall, they
are grateful for the 360 or so visitors so far this year but are
convinced that they should be more popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not state of the art,'' said museum volunteer
Henry Fales, sniffing the musty air. ``But you know what's nice
about it? This is one of the few museums you can come in and smell
the stuff.''

PARKER HEROINE MOVES EASILY INTO HIS TERRITORY

FAMILY HONOR 
By Robert B. Parker 
Putnam, 322 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can't call Robert B. Parker's newest private eye a gumshoe
because she prefers to wear black ankle boots; or, to accessorize
her suit, she will pick out a ``fabulous pair of matching heels.''
Sonya ``Sunny'' Randall _ cute, 5 foot 6, blond, 32, and at 115
pounds weighing in at about half of what Spenser does _ favors a
double-breasted blue pinstripe suit, white shirt open at the
throat, and tiny silver hoop earrings along with the ankle boots
when she's paying a formal call. Where to carry her Smith &AMP; Wesson
.38 Special presents a fashion problem; her solution is a speed
holster at the small of her back, under her jacket. You might say
she looks a little like Helen Hunt, who asked for a series, got
``Family Honor,'' and will play Sunny in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in her debut adventure, Sunny Randall remarks that
it would be nice if she weighed 200 pounds and used to be a boxer,
and Parker's readers will know she is not speaking theoretically.
The form and formula of ``Family Honor'' are the ones Parker has
honed through 26 Spenser novels and the two leadoff novels of a
series featuring recovering alkie Jesse Stone sleuthing around the
North Shore. There are good guys and bad guys and troubled
characters caught between them. You know there will be excellent
food, more dubious pop psychology, familiar Boston locations and
traffic patterns, and lubricious conversation between sexual soul
mates, not to mention some pretty spicy carrying-on. There will be
a code of honor that does not coincide in every particular with the
code of law. Sunny will need to be smart and tough, quick on the
draw with tongue and gun, and she is. She can hold her own with
Spenser in the sexual appetite department, and about her only
failing is that she can't cook worth a damn.
</P>
<P>
   Her back story is a bit unusual. Her father's a retired cop and
her hapless, hopeless mother whines at her. Her ex-husband is the
straight son of a mob boss. She still loves the guy, and he loves
her, but they haven't found a way of making it work. In the
meantime, a temporary expedient, if that's what you want to call
it, comes along in the form of a hunky Boston cop named Brian who,
Sunny notices, has ``thick black hair and a cute butt and a
wonderful smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunny wants to be an artist and is taking painting classes at
the Museum School. She's had a show at a gallery on South Street
(the Globe's art critic called her ``a primitivist with strong
representational impulses''). To support herself, Sunny followed in
her father's footsteps, but decided not to stay in uniform; now
she's starting her own business.
</P>
<P>
   The case is one Spenser would know how to handle, because he's
handled it at least twice before. Millicent Patton _ the troubled
teenage daughter of politically ambitious, wealthy, and repellent
parents _ has run away from home and is hooking behind the Hynes
Convention Center, like a character in ``Taming a Seahorse.'' Once
temporarily rescued by Sunny, she must be rehabilitated _ a process
that parallels the emotional rebirth of Spenser's surrogate son
Paul over several novels beginning with ``Early Afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Millicent knows too much about what some very bad people are up
to, and she is therefore in extreme danger, and so is Sunny.
Resourceful as Sunny is, she needs help; fortunately she has it on
hand. Spenser has Susan to discuss therapeutic issues with; Sunny
can turn to her friend Julia. Spenser has Hawk as buddy and backup,
and Sunny has not only Richie, her ex, but Spike, a gay pal who is
part owner of a restaurant called Beans &AMP; Rice near Quincy Market.
Spike can cook, works out wearing his karate black belt, knows all
the words to show tunes, and if he ever meets Spenser, will be able
to compete not only with body blows but with withering repartee.
One would like to know more about Spike's back story, and one day
we probably will.
</P>
<P>
   It all works out as you know it will but never exactly how you
think it might, which is one enduring source of satisfaction in
reading Parker. The bad guys are not just professional crooks but
also smug therapists and headmistresses of tony schools. This is
another source of satisfaction. ``She was tall and slim and fluty
with a prominent nose and the kind of clenched-molar WASP drawl
that girls used to acquire at Smith and Mount Holyoke,'' Sunny says
of Miss Plum, the headmistress. ``She was wearing one of those
hideous print-prairie dresses that are equally attractive on girls,
women, and cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Parker is traveling across familiar territory that he
mapped out himself, he moves with practiced ease, and the
psychologizing seems better integrated than it has on previous
occasions. And long before the end of ``Family Honor'' it's clear
that he has another winner, and now he can juggle three ongoing
series. Actually, to be politically correct, he should launch a
fourth featuring Hawk and Spike, and then, to cap his career, a
mega-novel featuring Spenser, Stone, Sunny, Hawk, and Spike that
reveals that one of them has been the supervillain behind
everything all along (it would have to be Spenser, because Sunny
was only 3 years old when Spenser's first recorded case appeared,
in 1971). Naturally such a book would have to be published
posthumously, and no reader of Parker can tolerate the idea that he
might predecease the rest of us. Still one can fancy the idea that
Sunny might one day learn to cook, and Spenser may puzzle Susan by
showing up wearing a tiny silver hoop earring. . . .

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   VATON, South Africa _ He'd rise early to catch the morning
light. It would just start rolling, waves and waves of it. It could
look so beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Then he'd march off into the awful pain of it all.
</P>
<P>
   The little kids being shot.
</P>
<P>
   The tanks smashing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The hordes of people being lined up and handcuffed because they
didn't have their passbooks. The police would grab you right from
the trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wake up very early and come to the train stations,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he'd rush into it having forgotten his own passbook _
the little book every black was forced to carry when traveling _
but he had to get his pictures. And when he was ghosting himself
into position, scuffing his knees, clutching his cameras and then
shooting, all the scariness and the numbing fear of it seemed to
just fall away.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world called it apartheid. To him, it was just life.
It was right outside the front door.
</P>
<P>
   He got Nelson Mandela _ sipping tea, grinning at home, just a
man _ before he vanished, sight unseen, and started rattling
history.
</P>
<P>
   He got Robert F. Kennedy atop an auto, extending a hand, leaning
from the hood of a car right there in Soweto. There's a skyful of
sky in the photo. It looks as if Kennedy has just dropped from the
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Click.
</P>
<P>
   He got two young black boys lying in the dirt in front of a
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Just two dead black boys to the white government.
</P>
<P>
   Click.
</P>
<P>
   Actually he couldn't get that photo published, at least not
right away. Just too explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he had to blink the blood out of his own eyes. Yet
another ruffian from the security forces had slapped him with a
baton. The only thing to do was pull himself up, wipe away the
blood, and aim.
</P>
<P>
   Click, click.
</P>
<P>
   He got Muhammad Ali in the jungle and thought he was in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Alf Kumalo. He might be the greatest living
photographer in all of South Africa. The Italians think so.
Leonardo Arte publishers, based in Milan, has just published a
collection of his work. Its five decades worth of work. A man's
pictures; a man's life. Its titled, simply, ``Alf Kumalo.''
</P>
<P>
   Itala Vivan, a professor at the University of Milan who, along
with Enrico Dodi, has championed Kumalo _ has written a rather
eloquent forward to the book, the text of which is in Italian and
English. ``A more moving history book, perhaps, than any ever
written in words,'' she writes, ``moving as only images can be, by
the immediacy with which they strike the consciousness and their
deceptive physicality, their disquieting materiality.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The photographer's 70 years old now. He moves like a man walking
through water. But he's always moved slowly, say those who knew him
in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   A good amount of his work in the past was for The Star, in
Johannesburg. But he's a photographer for hire now, retired from
magazines and newspapers. Weddings are not beneath him. The bills
have to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   He spent a good deal of his youth in Alexandra, one of the
harshest of this country's townships. ``The worst gangsters came
from Alexandra,'' he remembers. ``They were called the Spoilers.''
</P>
<P>
   The white government rolled into Alexandra one day in the early
'60s and snatched up 20 of the Spoilers. Hanged every one of them
from the gallows over in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   Kumalo's father was a builder, his mother a maid. There was
plenty of love in that house, but not one camera. After high school
he got a job as a clerk for a car company. ``That was a very good
job in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Photography intrigued him, so he bought a cheap camera. He
taught himself by reading instructions printed inside boxes of
film. ``I would follow the directions as to how much sunlight you
needed,'' he remembers. A lot of the photos were ruined. He was
learning. He bought an exposure meter. But natural light fascinated
him more than anything. So he tossed the meter. ``Even now,'' he
says, ``I don't like using flash very much. If I have to, I prefer
to bounce flash. You bounce it off the ceiling and use it.''
</P>
<P>
   He saved up enough money from his clerk's job to take a gamble.
The gamble was to quit and begin freelancing.
</P>
<P>
   There was a section of Johannesburg called Sophiatown. It was
all black. It was straw hats and satin skirts and horn blowing. It
was high culture. Sophiatown was the pre-Mandela Johannesburg that
the world never quite noticed. Kumalo took his cameras to
Sophiatown. He snapped musical events. He snapped folk at the
racetrack. He snapped lovers idling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a great market for private pictures,'' he says.
``Every Sunday I was occupied _ weddings, parties, social
functions.''
</P>
<P>
   He wore lovely tweeds, single-breasted suits. ``When I took up
photography, photographers used to dress in suits,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He found newspapers hard to crack. Then someone at one
publication, the Bantu World, saw his pictures and printed them. So
he cracked his way inside. ``To see your name in the paper was
very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 the National Party, a whites-only party, came to power.
It eventually split the country racially. Families were torn apart.
Blacks were sent on long voyages to other parts of the country.
Blacks were frequently detained for long periods without trial.
There were protests, but then men and women and children would
vanish. The darkness had begun. And it would deepen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were young journalists,'' recalls Aggrey Klaaste, who
met Kumalo in the late 1940s in Soweto, ``apartheid was just
becoming a force. They had a prohibition against liquor. We drank
to defy the law. Many who drank were some of the best writers in
the country. There was a kind of Harlem Renaissance. Those guys
really put the booze away. Throughout all of this, Alf never
touched the stuff. We said, `Come on Alf, drink.' He didn't. He
took all the insults and just did his work.''
</P>
<P>
   His work was in the fields, exposing children working at hard
labor.
</P>
<P>
   His work was in the townships during the midnight raids.
</P>
<P>
   His work was sneaking into the mines to report on mine
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   He'd be walking around, and sometimes the trucks would appear, a
swirl of dust and police. The police would start checking
passbooks. He'd be arrested. There were times when, soon as the
officers would turn their backs, he'd walk away. He'd be dressed
beautifully. He looked like a preacher. You had to be cool. It took
nerves of steel.
</P>
<P>
   The African National Congress _ black men, Indians, women, a few
whites _ intended to fight apartheid in the courts. One of its
chief recruiters was Walter Sisulu. He brought in a young lawyer by
the name of Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   So the brewing had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Kumalo got himself a job at Drum magazine. Drum was avant-garde.
It had a wondrous team of writers and photographers. There were
poets who carried thick American novels under their arms. Jim
Bailey, liberal and white, founded Drum.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Kumalo, like every other black journalist and photographer
in South Africa, found himself in the thick of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible country, in terms of apartheid,'' he says,
``but you could walk anywhere with your cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   He won a car in a photography contest in 1963. It was an Austin
Cambridge. It was beautiful. He rolled everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And he started hanging out with the young Nelson Mandela. It was
just a hunch. ``We didn't have too many lawyers,'' he says of
Mandela. ``I followed him more than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela started secretly raising money for the ANC. The
authorities went looking for him. He was here one moment, there the
next, impossible to find. Finally, a group of ANC officials were in
and out of court on charges of treason for five years, beginning in
1956.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great story to cover,'' says Kumalo. ``I actually
took a leave to cover it. That's why I still have my pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   They were finally acquitted in 1961.

   TAKE-BOS  
 VATON, South Africa: ... in 1961.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They started calling Nelson Mandela ``the black pimpernel.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1961 ANC court victory was huge, but the National Party
would not relent. They brought more charges. They hunted Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 he was tried again, along with other ANC stalwarts _
Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Ahmed Kathrada, and Raymond Mhlaba among them.
Kumalo was there every day. He'd escort Mandela's mother to court.
Then he would go to work, clicking away.
</P>
<P>
   He got Winnie Mandela outside the courtroom _ looking elegant,
though pained _ wearing something flowery, wearing a felt hat,
carrying a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela and the others were convicted. Kumalo's photographs of
the trial were published around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC stalwarts escaped the gallows, but not a lifetime on the
rocks at Robben Island, the country's infamous penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela disappeared. Unseen and unheard from, he would turn into
myth.
</P>
<P>
   Kumalo kept shooting. ``He was very brave and resilient,'' says
Itala Vivan, the Italian professor who has steeped herself in South
African history of the period.
</P>
<P>
   For years and years, the world did not condemn South Africa's
misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the incredible thing,'' says David Hazelhurst, an
editor at Drum in those early years who worked alongside Kumalo.
``You didn't have world support.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazelhurst watched every day as the National Party tightened its
grip. Just to survive, a photographer had to be crafty. ``It was
incredible to me to work with someone like Alf Kumalo,'' he says.
``He's got charm but an iron courage behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumalo was arrested at a demonstration in 1963. A policeman told
him to hold the damn cameras so that he could make another arrest.
Kumalo, handcuffed, bravely started clicking. He got the photos
published too.
</P>
<P>
   He wore shirts with a hidden pocket at the bottom of them. When
roughed up by police for his film, he'd hold his hands on the
camera and let slip out a meaningless role of film from under his
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   He kept negatives in several safe houses in and around Soweto.
He doesn't know how many might have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``People actually wanted me to leave photography for politics,''
Kumalo says. ``But I said, `What I'm doing _ documenting lives _ is
politics.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There were many arrests over the years. His first one was for
being caught in Johannesburg at night without his passbook. He was
with two colleagues. He wanted to whip the white policeman; his
friends thought he was crazy. After three days they were released.
</P>
<P>
   He loaded the cameras and started aiming again.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freedom was one big dream for the black South African
journalists. For many, getting to America was another. One of the
gifted young photographers who made it out was Ernest Cole.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, after several months of waiting, Kumalo got a visa for
America. You never knew why you were given a visa, or, if turned
down, why you were denied.
</P>
<P>
   He landed in New York City. ``America just blows your mind.''
Harlem sucked him in. He walked everywhere. He knocked on doors. He
knocked on the door of Gordon Parks, the great photographer and
film director. ``He gave me all kinds of books,'' Kumalo says of
Parks.
</P>
<P>
   He would travel in and out of America more than once during the
eclectic '70s. He was a maniac for jazz and tracked down Ornette
Coleman, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald. He snapped away. He got
to Louis Armstrong. He found the pianist Oscar Peterson giving a
concert in Central Park. ``Meeting those guys to me was very
special. I had read about them and they seemed out of reach. It was
lovely.''
</P>
<P>
   He knocked on the door of Miles Davis's Riverside Drive
apartment. A notice was on the door. It said if it's about
business, call the office. ``But I was so keen to see the guy I
pressed the bell. A lady appeared and said, `Can't you read?' ''
Kumalo told the lady to tell Davis that he had come all the way
from South Africa, and that he brought greetings from Hugh
Masekela, the South African musician. Davis sent back a note: ``You
and Hugh Masekela can go to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Miles was Miles.
</P>
<P>
   But the photographer moved on. In that noisy naked city, there
were a thousand people to see, a thousand photos to take.
</P>
<P>
   He got Ali fighting at Madison Square Garden in 1974. (He also
shot the celebrated Ali-Foreman battle that year in Zaire. ``It was
great,'' he says. ``It was an event put totally together by blacks.
I felt very proud. I had two seats for the fight. One at ringside,
and one up in the stands.'')
</P>
<P>
   He hung out with Aretha Franklin when she was giving a weeklong
concert at the Apollo in Harlem. Fell in love with Aretha.
</P>
<P>
   He found Ernest Cole, the South African exile, a boon buddy from
Johannesburg, and a great photographer in his own right, in Harlem.
They went out shooting together. They stopped in front of some
police officers. A fire in a building was raging. Kumalo started
snapping. He got close to a police officer with a gun hanging out
and thought he could get some kind of artsy shot of the gun.
``Ernest says to me, `Man, the police will shoot you here quicker
than they will in South Africa.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He went to Louisville _ uninvited and unannounced _ got himself
a room at the Y and photographed the funeral of civil rights leader
Whitney Young.
</P>
<P>
   He went down to Atlanta, to Martin Luther King Jr.'s church, and
started clicking.
</P>
<P>
   When Kumalo returned to South Africa, he could feel the anger as
never before. His country was about to erupt.
</P>
<P>
   He photographed the dead in Soweto during the 1976 student
uprising. In the end, more than 600 died.
</P>
<P>
   He got Steve Biko, the martyr, at one of those secret meetings
that could have gotten you whipped and jailed just for attending.
</P>
<P>
   The police raided the photographer's house in Soweto on several
occasions. One raid resulted in a three-year prison sentence _
something about taking unauthorized photos. The charges were
dropped on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes other photographers would follow Kumalo. They'd tell
one another they wanted to be there when he got killed, because
those were the days when photographers got killed. ``Alf would go
to the hostels and the police would chase him,'' says Klaaste,
Kumalo's colleague from the 1940s. ``He was absolutely brave.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He still prefers shooting in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   He still uses the Nikon F3.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to open a photography studio in Soweto. A place the
kids can come for training.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old war-torn country. It's rife with aches and pains.
And yet: ``I'm happy I was born here,'' Kumalo says, standing in
the garden of his fine home, 20 miles outside of Johannesburg, a
camera around his neck. A mere six years ago he would have been
arrested for being in this neighborhood at night. ``I'm happy I'm
African.''
</P>
<P>
   He's married to Modiegi, his second wife. In all, there are
eight children.
</P>
<P>
   He's never had an exhibition in America. He wishes for one.
</P>
<P>
   After the opening of his exhibiton in Milan, the curators _
Noris Lazzarini and Monica Fresco _ took Kumalo out to eat. His
photos that were hanging in the hall were normal, small
exhibition-size photos. While he was dining, Kumalo's photos were
replaced with life-size reproductions.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing around the exhibition hall upon his return, he was
stunned. He couldn't move. All the hard, blinding, desperate years,
right in front of him. His country's life; his own life. The old
photographer started weeping.

CAR PHONES AND DRIVING DON'T MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As my wife and I enjoyed an evening stroll along Massachusetts
Avenue in Cambridge, we stepped off a curb to cross a street. Just
then, a driver with a cell phone in her ear and babbling like Elmer
Fudd zipped around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   The driver was aimed straight at us. She was talking in such a
rant that we instantly judged that she did not see us. We knew that
in a split second, she would go through us.
</P>
<P>
   We fled backwards to the curb. The yakking woman blew past us. I
shouted ``Get that cell phone out of your ear!'' It was I who felt
like Elmer Fudd, since the wascally wriver could not possibly have
heard me with one ear on the phone and the other insulated by her
rolled up window. That did not stop me from wishing if I could have
gwabbed her scwewy phone wight then, I would have bwown it up into
a million little pwastic chips.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness that such feelings were tempered last week when
the Cleveland suburb of Brooklyn, Ohio, began issuing tickets for
making cell calls in moving cars. Brooklyn Mayor John Coyne may not
have heard my cry of phone rage, but he is definitely hearing an
angry communique from an America that does not need this particular
tool of ``progress.'' He decided it was time to shut off the cell
phones when he witnessed an elderly driver being rear-ended by a
yakking cell-phone driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're telling people is that if you're going to give the
gift of gab, get to the side of the road,'' Coyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have experienced the benefits of car phones. Once, a
good Samaritan called the AAA to come tow a car I was riding in
that broke down on the highway. I have made last-minute changes in
plans with various friends by reaching them on their car phone. I
have used their cell phones while riding to call my office. Tempted
by these experiences, my wife and I tried out a cell phone last
summer. We returned it not out of high morals but because the
service did not reach the area we wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications industry, which is seeing to it that 80
million Americans will have cell phones by next year, loves to
remind you that you-could-be-stranded-and-freezing-to-death.
Advocates of a car in every garage and a cell phone in every palm
say car phones are the abused whipping toy of politcally correct
safetyphobes. The advocates say cell phones are no more evil than
eating a bag of potato chips in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, people can be killed from turning to holler at a child
or looking down into the bag for that last chip. But those are all
accidents born of a momentary lapse in judgement. Cell phone calls
go for minutes, even hours. On balance, the good may not be the
price we are paying both physically and spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the New England Journal of Medicine published a
study that found car cell-phone use to be so distracting and
absorbing, it is as risky as driving drunk. The study found that
using cell phones quadrupled the risk of getting in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Study author Donald Redelmeier once listened on as one of his
patients had an accident while talking to him from his car.
Redelmeier, fretting about his role in the accident, said ``It
brought new sting to the cliche of `physician, do no harm.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The anecdotes of auto accidents involving cell-phone use has
become a 30-car pileup. There are stories of people slamming other
cars and emerging from the wrecks, even through sunroofs, still on
the phone. There are stories of otherwise wonderful citizens who
became slaughterers because their cell phone call to the hair salon
distracted them from a stop sign.
</P>
<P>
   There is the man who died in a collision with a truck after
calling a pay-per-minute adult entertainment service. Speaking of
pileups, there is the cell-call driver who hit a car, which in turn
hit a car ahead of it. The man with the cell phone got out, ran
past the car he hit and tried to tell the driver of the third
vehicle that the car in the middle was at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the issue of safety, the use of the car cell phones is
symbolic of a nation so overworked that the freeway has become the
great American conference call and where parents cannot get from
jobs to child care pickups without the car call that keeps everyone
from having a coronary. They are a contradiction in a country where
people complain about the decline of education, but seem to take
less and less time to shut up and reflect.
</P>
<P>
   We bemoan the lack of Internet privacy, yet freely cough up
privacy in a last bastion in our car-centered culture. They are a
hilarious symbol of status, with young adults from suburb to ghetto
pack flip-top pieces as part of a self-important lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Besides wondering how many of them can count past the 9 on the
keypad, when is the last time you saw a really rich dude or dame
driving their own car and dialing their own number?
</P>
<P>
   I am not saying kill the cell phone. If someone wants one in his
car for an emergency, fine. Just keep the phone in the trunk with
the jumper cables and tire jack. Other than that, I am all for
banning them while driving. The last thing we need is another
danger on our already harrowing roads that gives us drivers as
incoherent as, and as errant in aim as Elmer Fudd.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Beatles once owned the music charts 30 years ago, Harry
Potter books now dominate the Amazon.com bestseller list, holding
the list's top three spots at times over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before the third book in the series, ``Harry Potter
and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' went on sale at US bookstores today
(Sept. 8).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' says Terri Schmitz,
owner of the Children's Book Shop in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Created by author J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter may be more than a
fictional boy wizard whose adventures beguile children and adults
alike; the Potter books are also an Internet phenomenon, one that
may change the way books are marketed and sold, and one that has
given some British Internet booksellers an advantage over
brick-and-mortar rivals in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Cambridge, Mass., WordsWorth Books is ready for ``Harry
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.''
</P>
<P>
   WordsWorth is treating the book's release in much the same way
that other retailers once promoted the debut of a Michael Jackson
album or of Windows 95. For the first time in its history, plans
called for WordsWorth to open just after midnight to handle an
expected crush of Harry Potter fans.
</P>
<P>
   But some US readers already have the book, which has been
available in Rowling's native Britain for several months. They
bought their copies from on-line bookstores based in England, such
as the the British Web site run by Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Any US retailer that sold ``The Prisoner of Azkaban'' before the
official release date could be penalized. But such legal restraints
don't apply to purchases made by Americans at British on-line
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Some Harry Potter sales have been diverted from the
book's American publisher and US retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could mean an incredible loss of sales for us,'' says
WordsWorth general manager Sanj Kharbanda, though he still expects
the new Harry Potter to be a big seller for the store.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, publishers bought rights to a book country by
country, and a book could have more than one publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, a publisher had a monopoly on a book within a certain
territory. But thanks to the Internet, a book can be almost
instantly available anywhere in the world, and readers in one
country can buy it from a Web site in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Territorial rights no longer mean what they used to,'' says
Wayne ``Rusty'' Drugan, executive director of the New England
Booksellers Association. ``Either the law has to change, or
practices have to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has changed the playing field,'' laments chief
executive Avin Mark Domnitz of the American Booksellers
Association. The Internet is changing ``all the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter's success has been so extraordinary it's hard to
say what lasting impact it may have on international publishing and
on books that don't inspire similar zeal among readers.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like the Harry Potter phenomenon has ever happened
before, notes executive director Caron Chapman of the Association
of Booksellers for Children.
</P>
<P>
   Written by a first-time author who only a few years ago was the
British equivalent of a welfare mother, Harry Potter stories
``caught everyone by surprise,'' Chapman says.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen again, she says. Better planning and more
foresight should prevent a recurrence of sales leaking away from US
retailers to British Web sites, she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Rowling's series _ ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone,'' ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,''
and now ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' _ have been
published by Scholastic Inc. of New York.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago Scholastic was hinting about possible lawsuits
over Internet sales, but now it downplays the impact of Americans
buying Harry Potter books from British on-line retailers supplied
by Rowling's British publisher.
</P>
<P>
   At most, Americans bought 30,000 copies of the first two Harry
Potter books from British Web sites; taken in the context of more
than 3.5 million copies sold by Scholastic in the United States,
that's a mere pin prick, the company insists.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, stories about Americans hunting Harry Potter books down
on the Internet only add to the boy wizard's mystique and help
create a marketing buzz that boosts Scholastic's sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every book publisher should have such a problem,'' says
Scholastic executive vice president Barbara Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   It's the lag time between a book's British release and its US
release that gives British Web sites their opening. That lag time
was a year for the first Harry Potter book, seven months for the
second, and two months for the third.
</P>
<P>
   Four more Harry Potter books are planned, and those future books
will be released almost simultaneously in Britain and the United
States, Scholastic says.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Amazon.com makes no apologies for selling copies
of Harry Potter to US consumers at its British Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is comparable to an American tourist shopping at a
London bookstore, then bringing a book back home, says Amazon.com
spokesman Paul Capelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is operating in a global economy, and the Internet
is changing how things are done,'' Capelli says. ``As a retailer,
we operate within the law and do what's right. We will continue to
look to serve our customers as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Internet has changed Harry Potter, Harry Potter has
changed the economics of selling children's books.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter has transformed Rowling into the rarest of writers,
an author of children's books who generates sales that a Tom Clancy
or a Stephen King might envy.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter has ``crossed gender and age,'' even adults are
enchanted, says Kharbanda of WordsWorth Books.
</P>
<P>
   Such best-selling authors as Clancy and King drive sales at
bookstores with a largely adult clientele. But a children's
bookstore relies more on perennials, parents buying childhood
favorites for their own kids _ ``Make Way for Ducklings,'' maybe,
or E.B. White's ``Charlotte's Web.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Charlotte's Web'' was the last book before Harry
Potter to spend more than a few weeks on the bestseller list,
according to the New York Times, and ``Charlotte's Web'' was a
bestseller in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   For bookstores aimed at children, the new Harry Potter book
should be a godsend. But because of the Internet, it doesn't seem
to be working out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically everyone I talk to already has the third book,''
says Schmitz of the Children's Book Shop.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, independent stores have been under siege,
first from superstores such as a Barnes &AMP; Noble with their coffee
bars and music sections. Then came the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon.com and superstores have really taken a toll,'' Schmitz
says.
</P>
<P>
   Superstores can offer lower prices, but Schmitz tries to offer
more expertise. Every member of her staff is a specialist in
children's literature, she says.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that formula has held up, but it doesn't help when some
Internet booksellers get first crack at selling a blockbuster such
as Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kharbanda, WordsWorth inspires nearly the same
devotion from its customers as Rowling does from her readers.
</P>
<P>
   But when British copies of ``The Prisoner of Azkaban'' can be
had on the Internet before the book goes on sale at US bookstores,
that devotion can be put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Kharbanda says, ``Even customers who've been totally loyal to
Wordsworth just couldn't wait.''

MUSEUM TAPS CAPE   COD'S FRENCH CONNECTION

 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLEANS, Mass. _ The electrician's pipe and tobacco sit on a
roll-top desk as though he might retrieve them at any minute. The
old brass and wood instruments, with such odd names as
galvanometer, remain perfectly undisturbed. The yellowed calendar
is still turned to Nov. 26, 1959, when the place closed for good.
</P>
<P>
   For 68 years, employees of the Compagnie Francaise des Cables
Telegraphiques telegraphed news to and from France, from stock
trades to the German invasion of France, from this modest white
clapboard house. On overwhelmingly Anglophile Cape Cod, it was a
rare French outpost, and the raison d'etre of a tiny French
community here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still go in there and almost visualize my father sitting
behind the table tapping away,'' said Lucien Ozon, a retired police
lieutenant whose father, Clement, was a telegraph operator in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But the ham radio operators, descendants of the cable men, and
other volunteers who keep the French Cable Station Museum going
can't seem to interest the world in their quirky story. With no aid
from governments or nonprofit foundations, they get by on a minimal
budget, attracting just a few hundred visitors a year, far fewer
than the Marconi Wireless Station down the road in Wellfleet that
helped put the telegraph station out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest problem is just getting people to know we're
here,'' said Jerry Downs, chairman of the museum board and the
grandson of a 19th-century station operator, an Englishman named
Thomas Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the French connection in Orleans is a bigger deal on
the tiny island of St. Pierre in Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence _
part of France despite its location _ than it is here. Thirteen
cable station workers came from St. Pierre, and when Orleans
residents visited the island in 1988, the mayor and other
dignitaries turned out to greet them.
</P>
<P>
   Now the museum is trying to raise its US profile, doubling
membership to 156 over the last year, attracting its first
corporate sponsor, and trying to convince anyone that will listen
that it is the steward of an important chapter in
telecommunications history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the high-tech industry of its day,'' Downs said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the French trailed their English rivals in a technology
race in 1879 when the French cable company completed a
trans-Atlantic telegraph cable from Brest, France, through St.
Pierre, to North Eastham. Initially, the only trained cable
operators were English, forcing the French to hire them. But within
a few years, the cable station was importing staff from St. Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   The cable company moved to downtown Orleans in 1891 after
workers' families complained that Eastham was too isolated. Four
cable men's homes were relocated to Orleans, becoming the
cornerstone of a French community of 40 or 50 people with such
names as Norgeot, Deschamps, and Ozon who still trace their roots
to St. Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   Ozon acknowledges that the French community here does little to
promote its heritage aside from the trip to St. Pierre. But he said
they are proud of the station's role in history and proud of the
French tricolor flag flying in front of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested in it now than I was 47 years ago, when I
first came here'' from St. Pierre as a child, Ozon said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the Morse code messages transmitted from the station were
as important as the Internet is today, providing a secure line
during World War I for US commanders to communicate with President
Wilson and bringing word that Charles Lindbergh had completed his
solo trans-Atlantic flight to Paris in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   During the German invasion of France in 1940, French telegraph
operators got off one last message from Brest as German sailors
approached: ``Here Come the Bosch. God help us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the emergence of radio and wireless telegraphs eroded the
importance of cables. On Nov. 26, 1959, the Orleans crew signed off
for good with a ``Happy Thanksgiving'' and the operators walked out
the door without so much as tidying up the place.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the station sat empty, in part because of President
Charles de Gaulle's determination not to sell French assets. Museum
guide Laurence Gray, an engineer by profession, was turned down by
the French cable company in the 1960s when he inquired about buying
some of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   DeGaulle ``said no French territory is going to be sold to an
American as long as I am alive,'' Gray recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Even after de Gaulle's death in 1970, however, Orleans residents
didn't want the building, repeatedly voting down money for the
purchase at Town Meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, 10 people came up with $40,000 to buy the station,
beating out an oil company that wanted to build a gas station, and
started the museum in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Today, aside from vintage photos, news clips, and assorted other
memorabilia, the cable station is virtually unchanged from its last
day of operation. The typewriter that rendered letters into Morse
code still works, as does the grandfather clock; the screws and
wires still sit in drawers carefully labeled in French and English.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have strict orders from the boss: Don't move anything,''
Gray said, referring to Downs. ``I would like to clean the place
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the museum couldn't afford to do much more than clean
the place up anyway. It relies on member dues and the occasional
inheritance, and Downs said the group spends so little money that
he doesn't even prepare an annual budget. Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with the telecommunications junkies who can
make sense of equipment labeled with descriptions such as
``potentiometer divider for capacitance test.'' In a world where
communications is changing rapidly, they marvel at a place that
stays the same.
</P>
<P>
   But Downs wants a larger audience, the kind of people who read
Yankee Magazine or want an indoor activity for rainy summer days,
but they are hard to reach without money for publicity or
professional management.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pride in their roots, many descendants of the cable
men have not pitched in at the station. Ozon says he is too busy
with his limousine business to be involved, while his brother,
Clement, admits he has not been in the station since it closed.
</P>
<P>
   As the volunteers reduce their museum hours for the fall, they
are grateful for the 360 or so visitors so far this year but are
convinced that they should be more popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not state of the art,'' said museum volunteer
Henry Fales, sniffing the musty air. ``But you know what's nice
about it? This is one of the few museums you can come in and smell
the stuff.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PHILADELPHIA _ Lucky for the Astros the division championship isn't
determined on style points.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti hit a tie-breaking two-run single in the ninth
inning Tuesday night as the Astros won their fifth straight game,
beating the Philadelphia Phillies 8-6 before a crowd of 12,934 at
Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros increased their lead in the National League Central
to three games over second-place Cincinnati, which split a
doubleheader at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In what is developing into a nasty trend, the Astros spotted the
Phillies an early four-run lead for the second straight game. But
instead of needing runs in bunches, the Astros slowly chipped away
at the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 6-5 lead, their first of the game, in the
seventh, fell back into a tie a half-inning later and finally
needed some late-inning heroics from Caminiti and the bullpen to
improve to 5-0 on the current seven-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning covers up a lot of things. Tonight it covered up an
awful lot,'' said Astros manager Larry Dierker, whose club stranded
15 runners. ``I wouldn't nominate it for best game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Phillies used seven pitchers and issued 11 walks
in losing for the 11th time in their last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind by four runs in the third inning, the
Astros scored in five of the last six innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Craig Biggio reached on a fielder's choice and
Matt Mieske hit a bloop single to shallow center field off Wayne
Gomes (4-5). One out later, Caminiti singled to right field for the
game-winning runs.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Powell (5-4) pitched 1 innings for the victory, and Doug
Henry got three outs for his 80th career save and first of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hitting for Daryle Ward in the seventh inning, Ryan
Thompson hit his first home run of the season, putting the Astros
ahead 6-5 with his shot off Amaury Telemaco. It was the second
consecutive game the Astros had taken a lead on a pinch-hit homer,
following Russ Johnson's three-run blast that beat the Phillies on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia tied the game when reliever Jay Powell walked Kevin
Jordan with the bases loaded in the bottom of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies outfielder Bobby Abreu went 2-for-3, which included his
20th home run of the season, and drove in four runs. Ricky
Gutierrez went 2-for-4 with two RBIs for the Astros. Tony Eusebio
and Caminiti also had two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia built a four-run lead in the third inning with four
hits off Astros righthander Chris Holt, who left the game after
five innings with stiffness in his back. Marlon Anderson led off
with a single to left field, advanced to second on a wild pitch and
scored on a single by Alex Arias. Later in the inning, Doug
Glanville beat out an infield single, and two batters later, Abreu
launched a three-run homer to straightaway center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sliced the lead in the fourth when Derek Bell hit a
two-out double and Phillies righthander Mike Grace walked Ward and
Eusebio to load the bases. Gutierrez lined a two-run single to
center field to pull the Astros within 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, the Astros capitalized on a walk and two errors
for their third run of the game. Biggio drew a leadoff walk and
stopped halfway to second on an attempted steal. But Phillies
catcher Mike Lieberthal overthrew second base, and Biggio scored
easily when Glanville let the ball roll to the wall in center
field. The bad throw snapped a 100-game errorless streak for
Lieberthal, the longest by a catcher this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falling behind on both nights 4-0 isn't the way we want to be
playing the last month, but with the character of this team we know
we have a job to do,'' Gutierrez said. ``The last two games, we
showed we can come back from a deficit and don't panic. We just
take it inning by inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros fell behind 4-0 after four innings Monday before a
six-run sixth inning rallied them to a 6-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia added a run in the fifth on back-to-back doubles by
Rob Ducey and Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't pick my pitches right, especially to Abreu,'' said
Holt, who allowed five runs and eight hits over five innings. ``You
take away that (third) inning, and things are completely different.
Bottom line is we won the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros twice loaded the bases off Phillies reliever Steve
Schrenk in the sixth inning, coming away with two runs to tie the
score at 5. Gutierrez singled, Carlos Hernandez reached on a
fielder's choice, and Biggio walked. Bill Spiers, pinch hitting for
Stan Javier, hit an RBI single, and Jeff Bagwell followed with a
sacrifice fly to right field.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Thompson sent a bases-empty homer to left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want the guys to believe in me,'' said Thompson, who
was recalled from the minors over the weekend. ``I don't want there
to be any question marks as to my heart and desire to win. I just
want to help this team and do whatever it is I can do. That's my
only concern. Nothing less, nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 1-2-3 sixth inning, Astros reliever Trever Miller,
pitching for the first time since Sept. 1, loaded the bases in the
seventh. Glanville and Kevin Sefcik hit singles, and Abreu walked
to load the bases. Powell entered the game and walked Jordan to
push across the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Astros' bullpen has allowed only two runs in its last
14 innings.

<P>
   OTTAWA _ In the United States, the gray wolf is a protected
species, guarded by tough federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the creature is vermin. Hunters are free to blast
away at the beasts on whim, and they do.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, US game biologists using radio collars to track
gray wolves in Montana were horrified when a trio of females loped
across the line to establish dens in Alberta. Each found a mate,
gave birth to cubs, and settled in. Within 16 months, all of the
female wolves, their offspring, and their mates had been killed by
Canadian ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Such contradictions are commonplace along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Among international wildlife groups, Canada is notorious for its
failure to pass a federal endangered species law similar to one
enacted in the United States more than a quarter-century ago.
Mexico has broad federal protections for threatened species,
leaving Canada as North America's wildlife renegade.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling the pressure, both domestically and from abroad, the
country's new environmental minister, David Anderson, pledged last
month to push for strong legislation that will place special
emphasis on guarding breeding and ranging habitat, such as forest,
wetlands, prairies, and coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has been down this road before. Although Anderson is
personally respected by environmentalists, there is cynicism as to
whether a federal government that has shown a historic
unwillingness to confront the issue can buck opposition from the
country's extremely powerful forestry, mining, and agricultural
industries _ as well as from provincial legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot get our act together in this country on the
most fundamental of problems,'' said David Schindler, a renowned
wildlife biologist and profesor of ecology at the University of
Alberta. ``Far be it from Canada to stop loggers or miners or
farmers from the innocent pursuit of destroying our natural
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country so vast and pristine that many of its citizens have
difficulty comprehending that hundreds of native animal and plant
species are in genuine danger, Canadian environmentalists find
themselves fighting battles that their American counterparts won a
generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Nixon brought in a darned good law in the US, and
Pierre Trudeau refused,'' said Elizabeth May, executive director of
the Canadian branch of the Sierra Club, referring to the former
Canadian prime minister. ``That's been the story ever since. Mexico
can do it, Australia can do it, but good, green Canada can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, more than 600 scientists from Canadian
universities, research centers, and even the government's own
wildlife agencies signed a strongly worded letter to Prime Minister
Jean Chretien imploring federal Parliament to enact meaningful
endangered species legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada's endangered species are too imperiled, too close to
extinction, and too precious to be held hostage to lobbyists,
political manipulation, or simple ignorance,'' the letter stated.
</P>
<P>
   In cases like the gray wolf, opponents of a federal species law
argue that the animal may be endangered in the United States, but
healthy populations survive in Canada and do not deserve rigorous
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The grizzly bear, abundant in Alberta and British Columbia only
a decade ago, is now in decline, according to many wildlife
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grizzly is going down rapidly in Alberta,'' said
Schindler. ``Mainly because of huge intrusion into habitat by
logging, oil, and gas companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Even wolves are having problems. In the Bow Valley of Banff
National Park, one of the most famous symbols of Canada's raw
beauty, not a single successful litter of wolves survived this
year; all of the young creatures were killed by cars or met other
misfortune from humans.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has 339 species in serious danger of disappearing,
according to wildlife experts, from the Peary caribou to the piping
plover. The federal government lists these animals and plants as
endangered but has no broad laws to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the creatures, such as the northern cricket frog or the
Eskimo curlew _ an Arctic bird _ haven't been seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   Others, from the Vancouver Island marmot on Canada's far west
coast to the American marten in Newfoundland, on the country's
easternmost edge, are down to a few hundred animals.
</P>
<P>
   At least on paper, there are often local regulations or
provincial laws to guard Canada's threatened animals or plants
against hunters or trappers, or _ in the case of plants and insects
_ against harvesters and collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such laws are often toothless, and that the real
danger to most Canadian wildlife is not the hunter's bullet but the
developer's bulldozer, the logger's chainsaw, and the farmer's
pesticides and plow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is habitat, not the individual animal,'' said
Lindsay Rodger, species recovery manager for World Wildlife
Fund-Canada. ``If we can't protect the spaces where endangered
animals live and breed, we can't protect the animal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still open season on almost any creature in the provinces
that have no endangered species laws, such as British Columbia,
Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland. ``Canadians love peregrine
falcons,'' one leading environmentalist joked darkly. ``They taste
as good as bald eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   In provinces with such laws, protections amount to no more than
legal lip service. Ontario, the most populous province _ where
species such as the Acadian flycatcher, aurora trout, and Lake Erie
water snake cling to the edge of survival _ has brought
prosecutions only five times in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Prince Edward Island, warning signs and fences skirt the sand
dunes that provide nesting grounds for the piping plover, a
melodious shore bird fast disappearing from its widely scattered
breeding ranges. But bicyclists, hikers, and other beachgoers at
spectacular Cavendish National Park regularly intrude on the grassy
knolls. Park officials claim to be helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the only authority we have is to put up signs
saying it's bad to hurt the birds,'' said one uniformed ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a bigger threat comes from mining, forestry, and the
petroleum industry, which are mainstays of the economy, especially
in western Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, these industries have discovered a public relations
problem related to habitat destruction _ something most American
natural resources companies recognized decades ago. But logging and
mining outfits insist they cannot afford to support a federal
endangered species act unless they get compensation. Farmers also
want federal paybacks for not plowing under habitat, a demand that
gets more sympathy from environmentalists than from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Provincial governments insist that land management falls under
their jurisdiction, and that federal protection for wildlife
represents a slap against Canadian-style home rule.
</P>
<P>
   A less obvious problem, but one cited repeatedly by wildlife
experts, is psychological.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is so vast and so relatively unspoiled that environmental
protection has never carried the sense of public urgency that it
does in the United States or Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Canada is frozen barrens or tundra, as inhospitable to
most animals and plants as to humans. Most, although not all, of
the country's seriously endangered species inhabit the
200-mile-wide band along the US border that is also home to most of
Canada's cities, factories, and farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, Canadians are blinded by the country's amazing
natural riches,'' Schindler said. ``It's hard to recognize the
slippage. But all the dangers are there.''

PHILADELPHIA _ If ugly could build a house, what the Astros and
Phillies constructed Tuesday night would have been so big that Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs could each have their own bedroom,
though Dopey might have to sleep on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of performance that doesn't show up in the
highlight reels, just the standings. It was the kind of game that
doesn't win awards for raw appearance but may win, thanks to true
grit, division titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you win games just because you know how,'' said
Astros manager Larry Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   Which is another way of saying the Astros have a pedigree of
back-to-back National League Central titles that mean more than
mere decorative banners to hang from the rafters, while the
Phillies are a truck with no brakes that is rolling backward down a
hill.
</P>
<P>
   Through a season of the unexpected catastrophe and a long summer
of one physical disaster after another, there have been plenty of
nights when Dierker has shown up at the ballpark, looked at the
lineup cards for both teams and had a hard time making a judgment
about which side had more talent from which to draw.
</P>
<P>
   But more often than not, his sprained, broken, bruised, beat-up
Astros have found a way, which is why they are sitting on a
three-game lead over the Cincinnati Reds instead of stewing in a
broth of their own misfortune and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence can mean everything in the world,'' Dierker said.
``If you go out there and take the field for two straight years and
you play like you're better than the other guys, that attitude has
a way of getting inside you and staying there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when injuries crop up, even when things conspire to take
pieces out of your lineup, the guys who remain there believe they
can win just because that's what they've grown accustomed to
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   So they fall behind the Phillies by a 4-0 margin for the second
consecutive night and, rather than start to look for excuses, the
Astros search and eventually discover a way to mine a slag heap of
15 runners left on base for an 8-6 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure won't nominate it for best game of the year,'' Dierker
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be more typical than anybody wants to let on.
</P>
<P>
   Here was another night when Chris Holt, the poster boy for
buzzard's luck, had good stuff and was firing his pitches with
decent velocity but was victimized by one three-run homer by Bobby
Abreu that put him into a hole.
</P>
<P>
   Here was another night when Jeff Bagwell continued his recent
penchant for not making the most of his opportunities to clear the
bases. He came up with the bases loaded in the sixth inning and
could drive home only one run with a sacrifice fly. He came up
again with runners on second and third in the ninth inning and,
after one mighty swing when he nearly screwed himself down into the
batter's box against the Phillies' Wayne Gomes, struck out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros survived because Ken Caminiti immediately
followed Bagwell with a single to drive home Craig Biggio and Matt
Mieske with the winning runs, and all the ugliness was left for the
Phillies to wallow in. It's funny how a team nobody seems to think
is playing particularly well is suddenly in the midst of a
five-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to keep our heads together and win each game
as it comes,'' Biggio said. ``This is different from last year. A
year ago, we went out there every night and just beat people's
heads in. Now we're finding that we have to scrap and hustle. It's
different.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's the same, because the Astros have been there at the top
of the standings twice before and play like they are always going
to find a way. And on the other side, the Phillies are playing like
Wile E. Coyote, wondering when the next stick of dynamite is going
to blow up in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight it's Mike Hampton vs. Curt Schilling in a sterling
pitching matchup, the kind the Astros will likely encounter in the
playoffs. This one was more the cheap, bold brass that has carried
the Astros through this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was very much an example, I thought, of two teams with
similar talent going for them, but one is still fighting to win and
the other has given up the fight,'' Dierker said. ``There is an
expectation to succeed on our part, and there's a sense of dread on
their part. They don't know about all of our problems, and we don't
seem to care.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies probably didn't know that neither Billy Wagner nor
Jose Cabrera was available to Dierker out of the bullpen after
their stints Monday night. And the Phillies probably didn't know
Bagwell has been struggling mightily to drive in runs of late. All
they know is that the Astros are in first place and they must be
doing something to deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Which they are. Surviving.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ Some very strange things come out of Richard Williams'
mouth, as well as from the mouths of his two famous offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Williams might be a tad off the wall _ often to the
point of bouncing off same _ and even if daughters Venus and Serena
have grown cocky beyond the level of their accomplishments to date,
there's nothing dysfunctional about this all-American family, the
new first family of women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age Williams sisters, halfway to claiming half the
spots in the U.S. Open semifinals for themselves, possess an
extreme amount of admiration and affection for each other, as well
as for their parents. Richard, Venus, Serena and mom, Oracene, are
so close they have a tendency to keep the proverbial wagons
circled, shutting everyone else out, which causes problems for them
in tennis circles.
</P>
<P>
   However, given a choice of the many unsavory alternatives on
exhibit in women's tennis, it's hard to get overly chagrined by the
madness in Daddy's admittedly unconventional, nonconforming
methods. (Richard, to cite one example, has been known to root for
his daughters' opponents.) At 18 and 17, respectively, Venus and
Serena are physically healthy, emotionally happy and competitively
hellbent upon becoming queens of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Venus whipped up on Barbara Schett 6-4, 6-3 Tuesday night to
reach the U.S. Open semifinals for the third year in a row. Serena
takes her shot today against Monica Seles, whom she has beaten in
both of their previous meetings. There's a better than decent
chance one or the other will plant her flag on the summit Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If Pops is crazy, it's the harmless variety. Who's the better
parental model, Williams or, say, a Stefano Capriati?
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Capriati was the original heiress to the throne before
the Williamses were out of grade school in a treacherous place
called Compton, Calif. She, not Lindsay Davenport, should have been
the first American-born female to win a major title since Chris
Evert. In 1991, at 16, Capriati twice served for a spot in the
final at Flushing Meadow, only to lose to Seles in a brutal,
bare-knuckled brawl of a match that served as a precursor to what
women's tennis looks like at the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Capriati had it all. Except the right kind of parental
support.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano pushed, prodded, exploited and browbeat. He asked too
much of and gave too little to his kid, who was exactly that, a
kid. While he wasn't physically abusive, his ham-handed methods
left Jennifer covered with welts that are still visible on her
psyche in 1999 as she attempts to recapture, against increasingly
long odds, what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   She went out of the current tournament on Labor Day, again
beaten by Seles in a straight-sets battle that provided brief
flashbacks of their aforementioned long-ago war. But Capriati's
lost years, those spent in open, self-destructive rebellion against
the demands of a stage father, have exacted an expensive toll.
</P>
<P>
   Her once-huge all-court game is nothing special anymore, not
compared to that of the Williamses, Davenport or Martina Hingis,
and her potential for reaching the higher plane they occupy is
minimal despite a 30-pounds-lighter physique and a measure of
renewed competitive fire.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati can't finish a news conference anymore, never mind a
big match. She left Monday's in tears after reading a bizarre,
meandering prepared statement that was intended to put her unhappy
past behind her but led only to the kind of questions she believed
the statement would deter. When asked if she considered the press
an ``adversary,'' she broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I didn't have to talk about this all the time,''
she said, before being led away by a tour attendant into the arms
of Stefano.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, he's still in the picture, for better or worse (and we
have our suspicions). Nearby, Jennifer's mother and Stefano's
ex-wife, Denise, was weeping. The Capriatis' marriage collapsed, in
large part, because of Stefano's boorish behavior and the
consequences thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Those who live in a fishbowl have to realize the fish around
them have been known to bite. Also, you can shoot the messenger,
but you can't kill it. While Richard Williams frequently loses
sight of these self-evident truths himself, it's never to the
personal detriment of his daughters _ except to make them less
popular with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   As if they care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he says is very well thought out and intends a
certain result,'' contends Kevin Davis, the family's agent and
legal counsel for 11 years. ``Ninety-nine times out of 100, he gets
that result. Don't ever underestimate Richard.''
</P>
<P>
   And who said the circuit is supposed to be one big, happy family
anyway? It's more important to be part of a big, happy real family,
and that the Williamses definitely are. Bravo for them.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ In a century that has witnessed
great achievements and horrendous tragedies, no event has had a
more far-reaching impact than World War II, which began 60 years
ago this month. A major lesson of that war: Our own well-being is
dependent on that of other nations. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

   CONGRESS-SPEND (Washington) _ Congress returns to work on

New York City Health Department officials had been encouraging
doctors to make about cases with a perplexing diagnosis. The Queens
doctor told them that she had two elderly patients showing unusual
forms of muscle weakness and disorientation. She thought it might
be Guillain-Barre syndrome, a form of progressive paralysis, or
botulism, the deadly food toxin. It also sounded like encephalitis,
but it did not fit the profile for Eastern equine, the type
occasionally seen here. That call, on Aug. 23, set in motion
intensive medical sleuthing that is expected to continue for weeks

AMERICAN SEEKS MORE EAST COAST BUSINESS WITH RENO INTEGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ American Airlines, which recently acquired Reno
Air and its 25 aircraft, is expanding its north-south service on
the West Coast in the hopes of selling more lucrative tickets to
the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   American added the flights this week to increase its presence on
the West Coast and give more flight opportunities to customers _ as
well as take a slice out of United Airlines' market.
</P>
<P>
   American's $124 million acquisition of Reno Air took effect Aug.
31.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Air flies nine daily nonstops from San Francisco to Los
Angeles and five more to Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   American is adding 32 flights a day from San Jose to Las Vegas,
Nev.; Los Angeles; Portland, Ore.; Reno, Nev.; and Seattle. It is
also serving Anchorage, Alaska, via Seattle. In addition, American
now has 32 daily flights to nine destinations from Reno Air's
former hub, Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our own customers have been telling us for some time they want
one airline network to provide all of their travel needs,''
American spokesman Tim Smith said from the airline's headquarters
at Fort Worth, Texas. ``We have wanted to capture that business
that goes north and south, along with the business we had been
getting _ the longer haul (to the East Coast and) to Japan and
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The process has not been seamless. American and its unionized
pilots, members of the Allied Pilots Association, have squared off
over details of integrating the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots object to American's plan to pay Reno's pilots higher
rates as they are retrained by American. The union believes the
contract guarantees that the pilots should be paid more from the
purchase date.
</P>
<P>
   This led the pilots to call in sick over several days in
February, leading to the cancellation of 6,700 flights and
inconveniencing 670,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The sick-out cost American $225 million in pretax profit. It
also caused a federal judge in Dallas to levy a fine of $45 million
against the union, which has $38 million in assets, for ignoring
his order to tell pilots to return to their cockpits during the job
action.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go to the airline if the union loses its appeal
of the order.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the integration of Reno Air adds 182 more daily flights
to American's schedule, as well as nearly 2,100 employees. There
were no layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest impact is in San Jose, where American took over
Reno's nine flights to Los Angeles, eight to Orange County, five to
San Diego, three to Reno, three to Seattle, two to Portland and one
to Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
   The new flights are an addition to the service American has long
offered from the San Francisco Bay Area _ to Dallas, Chicago, New
York, Boston, Miami and Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Reno Air was made with the understanding that
the routes themselves will not be significant money-makers, said
Glenn Engel, an airline industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger issue is this issue called presence. What they're
fighting for is the east-west flying, but it helps to be in the
north-south market to get a larger share of the east-west flying,''
Engel said.
</P>
<P>
   The new north-south routes ``in no way, shape or form are
positioned to be a shuttle service,'' said Leo Loane, American's
regional sales manager for Northern California, in a reference to
the United Shuttle, the dominant short-haul carrier at the San
Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is a major United hub, with 250 daily departures
(there are 20 from San Jose and 16 from Oakland). The 78 daily San
Francisco-Los Angeles United Shuttle flights are flying at 68
percent capacity this year, UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins said from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with American strengthening its presence in the market,
Engel said, it will be interesting to see if and how fares are
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passengers still want the cheapest fare,'' he said. ``So, all
things being equal, if American is not offering a fare that is
competitive with the other players, they will choose the other guy.
If all things are equal, they will want to stick with one
carrier.''

 &HT;    For opera lovers and others, fine easy listening
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Classical''? Debatable. The three tenors, together and singly,
are virtual pop icons. Their third ``Concert of the Century,''
recorded at the Eiffel Tower in 1998, is a pleasant blend of the
familiar (''Granada,'' sung by Pavarotti) and the not. The tenors
have just about run out of opera standards, so they've gone back
into the archives for arias from ``Maristella'' (Giuseppe Pietri,
sung by Carreras) and Spanish zarzuela (Domingo, of course). There
are two ``theme'' medleys packed with incompatible tunes (e.g.,
Schubert's ``Serenade'' and ``You'll Never Walk Alone'' from
``Carousel''). Conductor James Levine now gets equal billing and
his photo on the cover _ both undeserved. He must have a good
agent. As for Pavarotti's recital, it's a straight voice-and-piano
program recorded live June 8, 1989, at an 1847 theater in
Barcelona. The tenor was in lovely voice at the time, and the
program is filled with treasures. What a pleasure to hear the
Bellini songs (often given to students as practice pieces) in such
creamy and idiomatic Italian. And where else can you hear Pavarotti
sing Mozart (``Un'aura amorosa'' from ``Cosi Fan Tutte'')? The CD
ends with ``O sole mio'' and ``Una furtiva lagrima,'' the Caruso
standard, which should send everyone home happy.

   It slips in quietly like a thief who's discovered the unlocked
sliding door in the back of your house. Lulled by the simple piano
(``Streets Raised Me''), church organs (``Allustrious'') and light
taps on the drum head (``Spread Love''), you figure this couldn't
be as menacing as its name, so you get comfortable. Then, in a
conversational tone that varies so little in delivery it's almost
soothing, rappers Prodigy and Havoc calmly relay balanced tales of
choking more people than Latrell Sprewell (``I'm Going Out''),
``packing nothing but the big guns'' (``Where Ya From'') and
``dump(ing you) under a bridge in a cardboard box'' (``Can't
(Expletive) Wit''). An alarm finally goes off, but who do you call?
After all, it's just ``Murda Muzik.''

   Going strong at 69, jazz composer and reed wizard Sam Rivers has
reactivated his career in the midst of a seeming retirement to
central Florida. His important Blue Note albums of the 1960s _
``Fuschia Swing Song'' and ``Dimensions and Extensions'' _ still
sound bold and tuneful today. But it's as a big-band visionary that
Rivers is featured on this new release, his first for a domestic
major label. The results, a sprawling 70-minute performance
featuring 14 of New York's top players and Rivers' Orlando-based
rhythm section, are enjoyable if somewhat less than legendary. The
liberally assigned solos and polyphonic free-for-alls often spark
with a colorful array of voices. Other bonuses include the trombone
section of Ray Anderson, Joseph Bowie and Art Baron, which is
especially gutsy, and Rivers' soprano saxophone, which frequently
bends melody to Middle Eastern tonalities. Yet the session feels
compromised in two regards. Rivers' structural concept calls for
repeated use of massive unison riffs, which become shrill and
predictable. Doug Mathews' electric bass, which makes more sense in
Rivers' range-roving trio, gets to be a drag, as well, though when
the inspiration flows, it's easy enough to overlook.

   Chicago brothers John and Frank Navin must have spent their
early years soaking up all the Burt Bacharach and Carpenters music
they could find. The brothers then spent most of the '90s toiling
in obscurity, forming a band and honing their shimmering pop songs
while the rest of the world was feeling the noise of grunge.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ``Plano,'' the band's sophomore release, was a
beautiful collection of smart melodic pop-craft and sharp lyrical
observations and one of the year's best. ``Pedals'' suffers in
comparison, but it scores points for artistic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The songwriting prowess is still evident, as are the decidedly
'60s horn and string charts (some courtesy of the High Llamas' Sean
O'Hagan, a definite kindred spirit). The difference comes with
production by Gastr del Sol's Jim O'Rourke and appearances by other
members of the Chicago post-rock pantheon. The combination of
seemingly conflicting styles works surprisingly well, but it's not
as immediate as ``Plano.'' It's a grower.

 &HT;    A cool sonic landscape
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the main reasons the Athens, Ga., music scene bears close
watching these days is the four-piece rock band Macha. The group
thrives on an unusual fusion of sounds, taking as its primary
influence the Indonesian form known as gamelan _ literally, an
ensemble of tuned percussion instruments whose glimmering
repetitions can cast a floating, hypnotic spell. It's an enthusiasm
that Macha shares with several generations of globe-trotting field
recordists, bohemians in search of the ecstatic all-night groove
and classical composers looking for alternatives to Western
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike, say, composers Steve Reich or Anthony Davis, Macha
frontman Joshua McKay plays in rock clubs. He also came of age in
the 1980s, when ideas about what could constitute rock music became
more flexible, liberated by post-punk experimentation. Macha revels
in this musical interzone, laying a thick, dubby foundation of
drums and bass for the ear-tickling percussive textures that ripple
across the surface of its songs. The arcane instrumentation
(hammered dulcimer, Moog, toy zither and such) keeps things
interesting. But what's cool about ``See It Another Way,'' Macha's
second album, is the things that would be interesting anyway: McCay
and his cohorts (brother Mischo, Wes Martin and Kai Riedl) have
created a sonic landscape as vivid as a waking dream. Lyrics like
random thoughts drizzle down _ ``I had to love your criminal
mind,'' or ``Drop your strong black hair/My favorite trap'' _ and
turn into little tunes and evaporate as temple bells chime. No rock
album this year has sounded so inviting or been as quietly
intoxicating.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On an insufferably muggy afternoon in July, with the thermometer
pushing 90 degrees and ozone alerts filling the airwaves, Alexander
Bregstein was in a foul mood.
 &HT;    He was furious, in fact, for reasons that would become clear
only later.
 &HT;    Working on just three hours of sleep, and having spent the last
eight hours minding a bunch of preschool kids in his summer job as
a camp counselor, Alexander was itching to kick back and relax.
 &HT;    So there he was, lying on his back in the weight room of his
gym, head down on an incline bench, earphones pitching three-figure
decibels of the rock band Finger Eleven into his ears as he gripped
an 85-pound weight in each hand and then, after a brief pause to
gather himself, muscled them into the air with focused bursts of
energy. Each lift was accompanied by a sharp exhalation, like the
quick, short stroke of a piston.
 &HT;    The first thing you need to know about Alexander is that he is
16 years old, bright, articulate and funny in that self-deprecating
and almost wise teen-age way. However, about a year ago, Alexander
made a conscious decision that those weren't the qualities he
wanted people to recognize in him, at least not at first.
 &HT;    He wanted people to see him first, and what they see these days
are thick neck muscles, shoulders so massive that he can't scratch
his back, a powerful bulge in his arms and a chest that has been
deliberately chiseled for the two-button look _ what Alexander now
calls ``my most endearing feature.''
 &HT;    He walks with a kind of cocky gravity-testing bounce in his step
that derives in part from his muscular build but also from the
confidence of knowing he looks good in his tank top and baggy
shorts.
 &HT;    As his spotter, Aaron Anavim, looked on, Alexander lifted the
85-pound weights three more times, arms quivering, face reddening
with effort. Each dumbbell, I realized as I watched, weighed more
than I did when I entered high school. Another half-dozen
teen-agers milled around the weight room, casting glances at
themselves and one another in the mirror.
 &HT;    They talked of looking ``cut,'' with sharp definition to their
muscles, and of developing ``six-packs,'' crisp divisions of the
abdominals, but of all the muscles that get a workout in rooms like
these, the most important may be the ones that move the eyes in
restless sweeping arcs of comparison and appraisal.
 &HT;    ``Once you're in this game to manipulate your body,'' Alexander
said, ``you want to be the best.'' While we talked between sets of
Alexander's 90-minute routine, his eyes wandered to the mirror
again and again, searching for flaws, looking for areas of
improvement. ``The more you lift,'' he admitted, ``the more you
look in the mirror.''
 &HT;    In this weight room, in a gym in a northern New Jersey suburb,
the gym rats have a nickname for Alexander: Mirror Boy. That's a
vast improvement over the nicknames he endured at school not long
ago.
 &HT;    ``I know it sounds kind of odd to have favorite insults,'' he
told me with a wry smile, munching on a protein bar before moving
on to his next set of lifts, ``but Chunk Style always was kind of
funny.''
 &HT;    And kind of appropriate. Until recently, Alexander carried
nearly 210 pounds on a 5-foot-6 frame, and when I asked if he was
teased about his weight, he practically dropped a dumbbell on my
feet.
 &HT;    ``Oh! Oh, man, was I teased? Are you kidding?'' he said in his
rapid, agreeable patter. ``When I was fat, people must have gone
home and thought of nothing else except coming in with new material
the next day. They must have had study groups just to make fun of
people who were overweight.''
 &HT;    He even got an earful at home. ``My parents _ God bless them,
but they would make comments all the time. My father would say, 'If
you eat all that, you'll be as big as a house.' And I'm, like:
'Dad, it's a little late for that. What am I now? A mobile home?'''
 &HT;    The day of reckoning came in April 1998, during a spring-break
vacation in Boca Raton, Fla. As his family was about to leave its
hotel room to go to the beach, Alexander, then 15, stood in front
of a mirror and just stared at the spectacle of his shirtless
torso.
 &HT;    ``I remember the exact, like, moment in my mind,'' he said.
``Everything about that room is burned into my head, every little
thing. I can tell you where every lamp was, where my father was
standing, my mother was sitting. We were about to go out, and I'm
looking in this mirror _ me, with my gut hanging over my bathing
suit _ and it was, like: Who would want to look at this? It's part
of me, and I'm disgusted! That moment, I realized that nobody was
giving me a chance to find out who I was because of the way I
looked.''
 &HT;    And so Alexander decided to do something about it, something
drastic.
 -0- 
 &HT;    There is a kind of timelessness to a teen-ager's battle with
body image, but in most accounts the teen-ager is female and the
issue is anorexia or bulimia. Yet as any psychologist knows, and as
any sufficiently evolved adult male could tell you, boys have
body-image problems too.
 &HT;    Traditionally, boys have felt pressure to look not thin, but
rather strong and virile, which increasingly seems to mean looking
bulked up and muscular. Hearing Alexander give voice to his
insecurities and imagined physical flaws, reminded me all over
again of my own tortured passage through adolescence, my own
dissatisfaction with a body that seemed punitively untouched by any
growth spurt and my own reluctant accommodation with certain
inalienable facts of nature.
 &HT;    Like me, Alexander had been teased and harassed about being
short in stature. Like me, he had struggled to overcome his
physical shortcomings as a member of the high-school wrestling
team. Unlike me, he also battled a severe weight problem, but at a
similar moment in life, we had both looked in the mirror and hadn't
liked what we'd seen.
 &HT;    Still, a lot has changed since I was 15. Consider the current
batch of cold messages from the culture at large. The new anabolic
Tarzan. Aggressive advertising campaigns showing half-naked men in
which the Obsession could just as easily be about your own very
toned body as about someone else's. And Littleton. (Buried beneath
a ton of prose about gun control was the report that Eric Harris
apparently felt dissatisfied with his height, repeatedly
complaining that he was smaller than his brother.)
 &HT;    You would never know that for the past quarter-century, feminist
thought and conversation has created room for alternatives to
traditional masculinity, in which toughness is equated with
self-worth and physical stature is equated with moral stature.
 &HT;    A number of psychologists with whom I spoke returned to the same
point again and again: The cultural messages about an ideal male
body, if not new, have grown more insistent, more aggressive, more
widespread and more explicit in recent years.
 &HT;    Since roughly 90 percent of teen-agers who are treated for
eating disorders are female, boys still have a way to go. Young
girls have suffered greatly from insecurity about appearance and
body image, and the scientific literature on anorexia and related
body-image disorders depicts a widespread and serious health
problem in adolescent females.
 &HT;    But to hear some psychologists tell it, boys may be catching up
in terms of insecurity and even psychological pathology. An
avalanche of recent books on men and boys underlines the nature of
contemporary boyhood in America. A number of studies in the past
decade _ of men, not boys _ have suggested that ``body-image
disturbances,'' as researchers sometimes call them, may be more
prevalent in men than previously believed and almost always begin
in the teen-age years.
 &HT;    Two years ago, Harrison G. Pope Jr., of Harvard Medical School,
and his colleagues published a modest paper called ''Muscle
Dysmorphia: An Underrecognized Form of Body Dysmorphic Disorder''
in a relatively obscure journal called Psychosomatics. The study
described a group of men and women who had become ``pathologically
preoccupied'' by their body image and were convinced that they
looked small and puny, even though they were bulging with muscles.
 &HT;    The paper got a lot of attention, and it led to an even more
widely publicized study earlier this year from the same lab
reporting how male action-figure toys such as GI Joe and the ''Star
Wars'' characters have bulked up over the years.
 &HT;    Recent figures on cosmetic surgery indirectly confirm the
anecdotal sense that men are going to greater extremes to improve
their appearances. Women still account for about 90 percent of all
procedures, but the number of men undergoing cosmetic surgery rose
about 34 percent between 1996 and 1998, with liposuction being the
most sought service.
 &HT;    ``Basically, men in general are getting the same medicine that
women have had to put up with for years, which was trying to match
an unattainable ideal in terms of body image,'' says Pope, who has
focused his studies on college-age men just past adolescence.
 &HT;    The confusions that arise in young males as they try to
reconcile the traditional masculine values of their fathers, for
example, with a postfeminist culture that celebrates sensitivity
and openness have created a ``national crisis of boyhood,''
according to some psychologists _ as well as a boomlet of academic
interest in boys and a burst of popular literature on the subject.
 &HT;    In addition to ``Raising Cain,'' there is William S. Pollack's
``Real Boys,'' Michael Gurian's ``Wonder of Boys'' and James
Garbarino's ``Lost Boys,'' as well as a spate of books and
magazines about male fitness.
 &HT;    Many of these books were inspired by the groundbreaking research
in the 1970s and '80s by Carol Gilligan, of Harvard's Graduate
School of Education, who charted the psychological and moral
development of adolescent girls. Now Gilligan and Judy Chu, her
research associate, are listening to boys' voices too. And one of
the most eagerly awaited books this fall is ``Stiffed,'' an account
of the ``masculinity crisis,'' by Susan Faludi, author of
``Backlash.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    For boys in the midst of the exotic and uncontrollable
incongruence of puberty, growing up in an internal world flooded
with hormones and an external world flooded with idealized male
images, the pressures may be tighter than ever before.
 &HT;    In seventh and eighth grades, Alexander Bregstein didn't fit in.
``I was picked on in every single class,'' he recalled. ``It was
beyond belief. They would do things like hide your bag, turn your
bag inside out, tie your shoelaces together. Some of the stuff I
just can't repeat, it was so awful.''
 &HT;    They called him Fat Boy -- thought he was lazy, that something
was wrong with him. He knew it wasn't true, but he also realized
that his physical appearance made him a social outcast and a target
_ neither of which is a good thing to be in early adolescence.
 &HT;    It was during his sophomore year, getting ``the daylights
pounded out of him'' in wrestling and gaining even more weight,
that Alexander began what he calls, with justification, his
``drastic transformation.''
 &HT;    He started by losing 30 pounds in one month. For a time, he
consumed only 900 calories a day, and ultimately got down to 152
pounds. He began to lift weights seriously, every day for three
months. He started to read magazines like Flex and Men's Fitness.
He briefly dabbled with muscle-building supplements like creatine.
He got buff, and then beyond buff.
 &HT;    By the time his sophomore year in high school began, Alexander
had packaged his old self in a phenomenally new body, and it has
had the desired effect. ``My quality of social life changed
dramatically when I changed my image,'' he said.
 &HT;    He still maintained friendships with the guys in the computer
lab, still programmed, still played Quake with dozens of others.
But he worked out at the gym at least five times a week. He shifted
his diet to heavy protein. He pushed himself to lift ever-heavier
weights.
 &HT;    When I asked him if he ever felt tempted to try steroids during
his effort to remake his physical image, he denied using them, and
I believe him. But he wasn't coy about the temptation.
 &HT;    ``When someone offers you a shortcut,'' he replied, ``and it's a
shortcut you want so bad, you're willing to ignore what it might be
doing to your insides. I wanted to look better. Who cares if it's
going to clog up my kidneys? Who cares if it'll destroy my liver?
There was so much peer pressure that I didn't care.''
 &HT;    After Alexander finished his workout that hot July day, we
stopped to get something to drink at the gym's cafe. ``I feel
pretty good right now,'' Alexander admitted, ``and I was furious
when I went in there.''
 &HT;    It turned out that the night before, he had a conversation with
a girl that took a decidedly unsatisfying turn at the end.
 &HT;    I'm not so worried about kids like Alexander _ he clearly has
demonstrated both the discipline to remake his appearance and the
psychological distance not to take it, or himself, too seriously.
 &HT;    But there will be many other boys out there who cannot hope to
match the impossibly raised bar of idealized male body image
without resorting to the physically corrosive effects of steroids
or the psychologically corrosive effects of self-doubt. Either way,
the majority of boys will be diminished by chasing after the golden
few.
 &HT;    Moreover, this male preoccupation with appearance seems to
herald a dubious, regressive form of equality _ now boys can become
as psychologically and physically debilitated by body-image
concerns as girls have been for decades. After all, this vast
expenditure of teen-age male energy, both psychic and kinetic, is
based on the premise that members of the opposite sex are attracted
to a retro, rough-hewn, muscular look, and it's a premise that
those who study and write about boys have noticed too.
 &HT;    ``While girls and women say one thing, some of them continue to
do another,'' Pollack says. ``Some of them are still intrigued by
the old male images, and are attracted to them.''
 &HT;    Because he's a perceptive kid, Alexander recognizes how
feckless, how disturbing, how crazy this all is. ``I tell you, it's
definitely distressing,'' he said, ``the fact that as much as girls
get this anorexic thing and they're going through these image
things with dolls and stuff, guys are definitely doing the same.''
 &HT;    True, he admitted, his social life has never been better. ``But
in a way it depresses me,'' he said, before heading off to a party,
``that I had to do this for people to get to know me.''

anecdotal sense that men are going to greater extremes to improve
their appearances. Women still account for about 90 percent of all
procedures, but the number of men undergoing cosmetic surgery rose
about 34 percent between 1996 and 1998, with liposuction being the
most sought service.
 &HT;    ``Basically, men in general are getting the same medicine that
women have had to put up with for years, which was trying to match
an unattainable ideal in terms of body image,'' says Pope, who has
focused his studies on college-age men just past adolescence.
 &HT;    The confusions that arise in young males as they try to
reconcile the traditional masculine values of their fathers, for
example, with a postfeminist culture that celebrates sensitivity
and openness have created a ``national crisis of boyhood,''
according to some psychologists _ as well as a boomlet of academic
interest in boys and a burst of popular literature on the subject.
 &HT;    In addition to ``Raising Cain,'' there is William S. Pollack's
``Real Boys,'' Michael Gurian's ``Wonder of Boys'' and James
Garbarino's ``Lost Boys,'' as well as a spate of books and
magazines about male fitness.
 &HT;    Many of these books were inspired by the groundbreaking research
in the 1970s and '80s by Carol Gilligan, of Harvard's Graduate
School of Education, who charted the psychological and moral
development of adolescent girls. Now Gilligan and Judy Chu, her
research associate, are listening to boys' voices too. And one of
the most eagerly awaited books this fall is ``Stiffed,'' an account
of the ``masculinity crisis,'' by Susan Faludi, author of
``Backlash.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    For boys in the midst of the exotic and uncontrollable
incongruence of puberty, growing up in an internal world flooded
with hormones and an external world flooded with idealized male
images, the pressures may be tighter than ever before.
 &HT;    In seventh and eighth grades, Alexander Bregstein didn't fit in.
``I was picked on in every single class,'' he recalled. ``It was
beyond belief. They would do things like hide your bag, turn your
bag inside out, tie your shoelaces together. Some of the stuff I
just can't repeat, it was so awful.''
 &HT;    They called him Fat Boy -- thought he was lazy, that something
was wrong with him. He knew it wasn't true, but he also realized
that his physical appearance made him a social outcast and a target
_ neither of which is a good thing to be in early adolescence.
 &HT;    It was during his sophomore year, getting ``the daylights
pounded out of him'' in wrestling and gaining even more weight,
that Alexander began what he calls, with justification, his
``drastic transformation.''
 &HT;    He started by losing 30 pounds in one month. For a time, he
consumed only 900 calories a day, and ultimately got down to 152
pounds. He began to lift weights seriously, every day for three
months. He started to read magazines like Flex and Men's Fitness.
He briefly dabbled with muscle-building supplements like creatine.
He got buff, and then beyond buff.
 &HT;    By the time his sophomore year in high school began, Alexander
had packaged his old self in a phenomenally new body, and it has
had the desired effect. ``My quality of social life changed
dramatically when I changed my image,'' he said.
 &HT;    He still maintained friendships with the guys in the computer
lab, still programmed, still played Quake with dozens of others.
But he worked out at the gym at least five times a week. He shifted
his diet to heavy protein. He pushed himself to lift ever-heavier
weights.
 &HT;    When I asked him if he ever felt tempted to try steroids during
his effort to remake his physical image, he denied using them, and
I believe him. But he wasn't coy about the temptation.
 &HT;    ``When someone offers you a shortcut,'' he replied, ``and it's a
shortcut you want so bad, you're willing to ignore what it might be
doing to your insides. I wanted to look better. Who cares if it's
going to clog up my kidneys? Who cares if it'll destroy my liver?
There was so much peer pressure that I didn't care.''
 &HT;    After Alexander finished his workout that hot July day, we
stopped to get something to drink at the gym's cafe. ``I feel
pretty good right now,'' Alexander admitted, ``and I was furious
when I went in there.''
 &HT;    It turned out that the night before, he had a conversation with
a girl that took a decidedly unsatisfying turn at the end.
 &HT;    I'm not so worried about kids like Alexander _ he clearly has
demonstrated both the discipline to remake his appearance and the
psychological distance not to take it, or himself, too seriously.
 &HT;    But there will be many other boys out there who cannot hope to
match the impossibly raised bar of idealized male body image
without resorting to the physically corrosive effects of steroids
or the psychologically corrosive effects of self-doubt. Either way,
the majority of boys will be diminished by chasing after the golden
few.
 &HT;    Moreover, this male preoccupation with appearance seems to
herald a dubious, regressive form of equality _ now boys can become
as psychologically and physically debilitated by body-image
concerns as girls have been for decades. After all, this vast
expenditure of teen-age male energy, both psychic and kinetic, is
based on the premise that members of the opposite sex are attracted
to a retro, rough-hewn, muscular look, and it's a premise that
those who study and write about boys have noticed too.
 &HT;    ``While girls and women say one thing, some of them continue to
do another,'' Pollack says. ``Some of them are still intrigued by
the old male images, and are attracted to them.''
 &HT;    Because he's a perceptive kid, Alexander recognizes how
feckless, how disturbing, how crazy this all is. ``I tell you, it's
definitely distressing,'' he said, ``the fact that as much as girls
get this anorexic thing and they're going through these image
things with dolls and stuff, guys are definitely doing the same.''
 &HT;    True, he admitted, his social life has never been better. ``But
in a way it depresses me,'' he said, before heading off to a party,
``that I had to do this for people to get to know me.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In November last year, unnamed CIA officials told The New York
Times that in 1995 they had compiled a large dossier on Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister. They sent the
material to Vice President Al Gore, co-chairman of the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, in which much of the
government-to-government business between the two countries was
handled.
 &HT;    It came back, said the officials, with what was described as ``a
barnyard epithet'' scrawled on it. The lesson they reportedly took
away was that evidence of high-level corruption was not wanted.
 &HT;    Thus, when they established that a German businessman had been
asked for $1 million to see Chernomyrdin, they did not circulate
the report.
 &HT;    But Chernomyrdin was for years a key interlocutor with Gore, the
man who seeks to prolong Democratic rule in the White House.
Dismissed by Boris Yeltsin as prime minister in March 1998,
Chernomyrdin is back now as president of Gazprom, the energy
monopoly he created and partially privatized and whose huge
revenues, vast holdings and large exemptions from taxes make it a
state within the Russian state.
 &HT;    Gore was deeply involved in Russian policy through the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which dealt with economic, security
and scientific issues. He was a strong advocate of more aid and
assistance to Russia, harshly criticizing the World Bank and IMF's
reluctance to lend. He exhorted American business to invest in the
country and lauded Chernomyrdin, whose personal fortune, held
abroad, is estimated by Russian security sources in the billions of
dollars _ an allegation he denies.
 &HT;    When this checkered record is eventually held up to the light
during a presidential campaign, Gore will have much to answer for.
Already, these issues are boiling up in political circles. U.S.
politicians such as Curt Weldon, a Republican representative from
Pennsylvania, now barrage the administration with questions and
criticisms on their handling of Russia.
 &HT;    For most of this decade, Russia has been consumed by the quest
to become a free, democratic, capitalist state. Billions of dollars
of aid have poured into its reforms. Bitter struggles have been
waged between Russia's free-market radicals and their Communist or
nationalist foes, most significantly in 1993, when armed struggle
broke out between the Parliament and Yeltsin. Great privations have
been visited on the country in the name of necessary sacrifice.
Yet, many now ask, what has changed for the better?
 &HT;    Russians, free to get rich, are poorer. The wealth of their
nation has shrunk _ at least that portion of the wealth enjoyed by
the people. The top 10 percent is reckoned to possess 50 percent of
the state's wealth; the bottom 40 percent, less than 20. Somewhere
between 30 million and 40 million people live below the poverty
line _ defined as about $30 a month.
 &HT;    Russia's gross domestic product has shrunk every year of its
freedom, except perhaps one _ 1997 _ when it grew, at best, by less
than 1 percent. Unemployment, officially nonexistent in Soviet
times, is now officially 12 percent and may really be 25 percent.
Men die, on average, in their late 50s; diseases such as
tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer
malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.
 &HT;    The West's involvement in Russian reform was deep and early.
Even before the reforms began, the big names in Western economics
were debating how they should be managed. ``There was a debate
about institutions and infrastructure back in 1990,'' says Joseph
Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, whose earlier work
on imperfect information and markets has put him in line for a
Nobel prize.
 &HT;    ``I remember talking to a conference in Prague in 1991 on the
theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards
themselves?') in a situation of rapid privatization. There were
already differences between us then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary. ``They thought you needed to pursue
privatization rapidly and that infrastructure would follow,''
Stiglitz says. ``It was a divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation following his success in
breaking Bolivia's 24,000 percent inflation rate. In Warsaw in
1989, he explained market economics to the Solidarity activists
about to be thrust into power. That December, the first
post-Communist government was quailing before price liberalization.
 &HT;    Late at night in the office of Poland's finance minister, Sachs
had got on the phone and harangued American officials until they
promised to nudge the IMF into providing $1 billion in support for
the Polish currency. His myth as the economic liberator was born,
and with it a mechanism known as ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    This was shorthand for a raft of measures _ price
liberalization, budget stabilization, a slashing of subsidies _
undertaken more or less simultaneously to ``shock'' the economy
into a therapeutic, market-driven recovery. The young reformers in
Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs and his mechanism their way
forward.
 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who had worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    Sachs, on a leave of absence from Harvard, had installed himself
and his team in the Finance Ministry _ where he spent a large part
of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had been
embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall. Both men
proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and impatiently,
and Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed the IMF and the
World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to government as acting prime minister. But he needed
much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any other
Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy; however,
the release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with its effect
of wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough
_ without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
was to observe later, any therapy. The shock was such that by April
1992 the slender parliamentary majority the government commanded
for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has characterized
Russian reform ever since _ a guerrilla struggle with a hostile,
often violently hostile, legislature. The reformers had hoped that
the West would back them as soon as they took office. But it did
not. This, for many insiders, was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in. When South Korea ran into
difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six months. And what
did go in were loans that now have to be paid back or export
credits tied to goods from the country giving the credits. The
intellectual effort was not inadequate; no people were better
placed than the reformers to make the changes. The problem was the
financial scale.''
 &HT;    Here, at the very beginning of reform, is an early charge that
we lost Russia _ and it is made by the economic radicals, East and
West. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision; Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed for
this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with him and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War. The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it
wasn't going to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was
the Russians themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do,
the absence of a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency. After Yeltsin won the 1993 battle with Parliament
by bringing in the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on
Russia policy to Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of
congratulations that is still interpreted by the opposition as
glorying in the blood of those who died as the Parliament building
was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending. So long as Yeltsin was president
and a few reformers remained in government, the official view in
the West was that reform was on track and our money was keeping it
so. The officials knew what was happening, but the West was locked
into a desperate struggle to preserve reform and to keep the
Communists out of power. They would not give up as long as ``our
guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    ``The IMF should have shown more guts in resisting political
pressure,'' one official said. ``The big mistake was not realizing
soon enough that the reformers lacked the levers of power to do
what they had agreed and to keep on lending. We should have been
tougher.''
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say that this is the Russia we
have lost _ lost through our own actions and mistakes. Lost because
we pursued agendas that were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost
because we encouraged and supported precisely those men in the
government dacha, who were hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    Some of the people who are making these charges want the
critique to be part of the election campaign of George W. Bush. It
is already becoming one of the most charged foreign-policy debates
in America.
 &HT;    The case that we lost Russia begins with America's insistence on
exporting the free market to Russia and takes in everything up to
the NATO bombing of Serbia, an act that seems to have completed
Russia's retreat from Washington. The claim that we have lost
Russia, in short, is a proxy for Clintonite failure to reshape
Russia as an idealized America.
 &HT;    In Russia, the charge is that the New Russian reformers, abetted
by the West, have destroyed the country's economy while enriching
themselves. Many of those who make these charges (and who would
like to see those they judge guilty locked up) will be candidates
for the Duma (parliamentary) elections in December.
 &HT;    And this critique may well be a major plank in the platform of
one or more contenders for Yeltsin's mantle in the presidential
elections next July. At the end of a century in which Russia has
been raped by Bolsheviks, the country now seems to have been raped
by capitalists. The stakes in this debate are very high.
 &HT;    The main foreign-policy adviser to George W. Bush, Condoleezza
Rice, former provost of Stanford University, is pressing to make
the charge that the Clinton-Gore administration lost Russia a major
part of the presidential campaign.
 &HT;    Rice, who will shape Bush's policy and probe Gore's weak spots,
poses a special danger for the Democrats _ she has been an expert
on Russia for decades. Rice admits to the difficulty of the
transition from Soviet communism, that the fault lies largely with
the Russians. She also acknowledges the hazards of retrospective
wisdom.
 &HT;    ``When all that's said,'' she says, ``you are left with a policy
that leaned very far toward accepting the mere rhetoric of reform.
It didn't recognize how mercurial Yeltsin is. It didn't react to
the fact that an awful lot of money has been siphoned off. This
gave a false sense of security to the Russians. They felt that no
matter what reforms they didn't do, they would get the IMF money.
No matter what behavior they showed, they would get friendship. ...
What we now face in international politics is a Russia more
dangerous than it has been, because it is coming apart. And so one
must ask, given what we tried to do and hoped for in 1991, What
went wrong? How could it have happened? What is our
responsibility?''
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us. The NATO action in
Kosovo has produced a bitter reaction, the more so for emphasizing
to the Russians their relative weakness.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies _ as Rice advises _ would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration.'' Its re-entry into
the world is indeed a vast endeavor, he says, but one to which we
are if not central, not marginal either.
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation. Russia never was ours to lose. It must find
itself; until then, we can do little more than watch, offering an
occasional bit of encouragement from the sidelines.

 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who had worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    Sachs, on a leave of absence from Harvard, had installed himself
and his team in the Finance Ministry _ where he spent a large part
of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had been
embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall. Both men
proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and impatiently,
and Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed the IMF and the
World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to government as acting prime minister. But he needed
much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any other
Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy; however,
the release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with its effect
of wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough
_ without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
was to observe later, any therapy. The shock was such that by April
1992 the slender parliamentary majority the government commanded
for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has characterized
Russian reform ever since _ a guerrilla struggle with a hostile,
often violently hostile, legislature. The reformers had hoped that
the West would back them as soon as they took office. But it did
not. This, for many insiders, was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in. When South Korea ran into
difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six months. And what
did go in were loans that now have to be paid back or export
credits tied to goods from the country giving the credits. The
intellectual effort was not inadequate; no people were better
placed than the reformers to make the changes. The problem was the
financial scale.''
 &HT;    Here, at the very beginning of reform, is an early charge that
we lost Russia _ and it is made by the economic radicals, East and
West. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision; Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed for
this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with him and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War. The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it
wasn't going to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was
the Russians themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do,
the absence of a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency. After Yeltsin won the 1993 battle with Parliament
by bringing in the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on
Russia policy to Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of
congratulations that is still interpreted by the opposition as
glorying in the blood of those who died as the Parliament building
was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending. So long as Yeltsin was president
and a few reformers remained in government, the official view in
the West was that reform was on track and our money was keeping it
so. The officials knew what was happening, but the West was locked
into a desperate struggle to preserve reform and to keep the
Communists out of power. They would not give up as long as ``our
guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    ``The IMF should have shown more guts in resisting political
pressure,'' one official said. ``The big mistake was not realizing
soon enough that the reformers lacked the levers of power to do
what they had agreed and to keep on lending. We should have been
tougher.''
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say that this is the Russia we
have lost _ lost through our own actions and mistakes. Lost because
we pursued agendas that were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost
because we encouraged and supported precisely those men in the
government dacha, who were hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    Some of the people who are making these charges want the
critique to be part of the election campaign of George W. Bush. It
is already becoming one of the most charged foreign-policy debates
in America.
 &HT;    The case that we lost Russia begins with America's insistence on
exporting the free market to Russia and takes in everything up to
the NATO bombing of Serbia, an act that seems to have completed
Russia's retreat from Washington. The claim that we have lost
Russia, in short, is a proxy for Clintonite failure to reshape
Russia as an idealized America.
 &HT;    In Russia, the charge is that the New Russian reformers, abetted
by the West, have destroyed the country's economy while enriching
themselves. Many of those who make these charges (and who would
like to see those they judge guilty locked up) will be candidates
for the Duma (parliamentary) elections in December.
 &HT;    And this critique may well be a major plank in the platform of
one or more contenders for Yeltsin's mantle in the presidential
elections next July. At the end of a century in which Russia has
been raped by Bolsheviks, the country now seems to have been raped
by capitalists. The stakes in this debate are very high.
 &HT;    The main foreign-policy adviser to George W. Bush, Condoleezza
Rice, former provost of Stanford University, is pressing to make
the charge that the Clinton-Gore administration lost Russia a major
part of the presidential campaign.
 &HT;    Rice, who will shape Bush's policy and probe Gore's weak spots,
poses a special danger for the Democrats _ she has been an expert
on Russia for decades. Rice admits to the difficulty of the
transition from Soviet communism, that the fault lies largely with
the Russians. She also acknowledges the hazards of retrospective
wisdom.
 &HT;    ``When all that's said,'' she says, ``you are left with a policy
that leaned very far toward accepting the mere rhetoric of reform.
It didn't recognize how mercurial Yeltsin is. It didn't react to
the fact that an awful lot of money has been siphoned off. This
gave a false sense of security to the Russians. They felt that no
matter what reforms they didn't do, they would get the IMF money.
No matter what behavior they showed, they would get friendship. ...
What we now face in international politics is a Russia more
dangerous than it has been, because it is coming apart. And so one
must ask, given what we tried to do and hoped for in 1991, What
went wrong? How could it have happened? What is our
responsibility?''
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us. The NATO action in
Kosovo has produced a bitter reaction, the more so for emphasizing
to the Russians their relative weakness.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies _ as Rice advises _ would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration.'' Its re-entry into
the world is indeed a vast endeavor, he says, but one to which we
are if not central, not marginal either.
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation. Russia never was ours to lose. It must find
itself; until then, we can do little more than watch, offering an
occasional bit of encouragement from the sidelines.

 By JULIA REED  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It is a hot summer Sunday in the Hamptons, and I am spending the
day with Barbara Smith, the restaurateur and cookbook author, the
host of a nationally syndicated television show, ``B. Smith, With
Style,'' and the editor in chief of an upcoming magazine, that will
bear her brandlike name.
 &HT;    Her house in Sag Harbor, with its stunning views of the water,
its enormous deck and two kitchens, is therefore more than just a
house; it's also a set. But today it is a bit of a mess.
 &HT;    Outside, huge pots are filled with nasturtiums that are
predominantly dead. Inside, Smith, who is preparing for a photo
shoot, runs between the bathroom, where she is doing her own
makeup, and the basement, where she is ironing her own clothes.
 &HT;    ``At the restaurants I call myself the producer, the director,
the casting agent and the star,'' she says.
 &HT;    Lunch consists of cheeses her husband and business partner, Dan
Gasby, has apparently just run out and bought, garnished with some
slightly withered cherry tomatoes, some mostly brown seedless
grapes and an incongruous bowl of seaweed salad. There is nothing
else edible in her refrigerator _ when I check the contents, I find
a jar of French's mustard, a bottle of Wish-Bone Ranch salad
dressing, a bottle of Wish-Bone Fat Free Caesar, beer, bottled
water and a case of Champagne.
 &HT;    It seems that the woman who is struggling to build an empire by
telling people what to cook, how to entertain, how to fix up their
homes and how to become more fashionable is too busy right now to
do it herself _ which is part of her charm.
 &HT;    You can't quite imagine Smith's East Hampton neighbor Martha
Stewart putting out less than pristine (or even store-bought)
tomatoes or, for that matter, ironing her own clothes. Stewart
gives off an air of impenetrable perfection with a whiff of
privilege _ which is not part of her charm.
 &HT;    Smith is more like Everywoman _ except she also happens to be
black. And her success, so far, has reflected the growing influence
of the black professional class. In 1997, black consumers spent
nearly $500 billion annually on goods and services, 54 percent more
than they had in 1990. And the number of black households earning
$100,000 or more nearly doubled from 1988 to 1998, from 220,400 to
414,500.
 &HT;    A writer like Terry McMillan can land on the best-seller list,
as she did with her 1992 novel, ``Waiting to Exhale,'' by appealing
largely to a black (female) audience. All of which may help explain
why American Express Publishing is putting out B. Smith Style, the
magazine, in late October, and why Random House, the same week, is
releasing ``B. Smith: Rituals and Celebrations,'' part of a
four-book deal.
 &HT;    Smith is already a star in the black community. A former model
who began using her initial in the 1970s when she phoned in for
appointments at the prestigious Wilhelmina agency, she was the
second African-American to grace the cover of Mademoiselle
magazine, in 1976.
 &HT;    In the mid-1980s, she became a partner in a Manhattan
restaurant, B. Smith, and now owns two more outright _ one at Union
Station, in Washington, and the other on the wharf in Sag Harbor.
Her book ''B. Smith's Entertaining and Cooking for Friends,''
published in 1995, was among the first on entertaining by a black
author.
 &HT;    ``Her restaurants are the black '21' clubs, the places to see
and be seen,'' says Lawrence Otis Graham, author of ``Our Kind of
People: Inside America's Black Upper Class.'' ``People know that if
they go there, they're going to run into the right people, the
black folks you know from the Links and the Boule and Jack and
Jill,'' the exclusive black clubs. When Graham was researching his
book, he found that ``everybody knew her restaurant. Everybody
watched her show.''
 &HT;    Although Smith has been saddled with the unfortunate, if
inevitable, moniker ``the black Martha Stewart, `` her own plan is
not just to capitalize on her core constituency but also to broaden
it. The model is less Martha than Oprah, the original crossover
figure, who also promises to be her biggest competition.
 &HT;    Smith's TV show, which is entering its third year in 207 markets
nationwide, has an audience that is 75 percent white and 25 percent
black. It was this statistic that helped convince Smith and Gasby
that they could find a partner for a new magazine. Convincing
others, however, hasn't been so easy.
 &HT;    ``There is the assumption,'' Gasby says, ``that because Barbara
is black, she will only appeal to blacks. People follow what she
does; she's beautiful; she's got charisma. And then you sit and
talk to executives and you get the sense they're thinking: 'But
she's black. I don't know if she's going to appeal to a wider
group.' And you say, 'She's done it in the restaurant business, on
the TV show.' You have to say the same thing 50 times differently _
this is not a black magazine.''
 &HT;    Both Smith and Gasby have said they believe that Stewart tried
to stop their show from getting into production. ``We had a deal
with Warner, and that dried up,'' Gasby says. ``Then we had a deal
with CBS, and that dried up.'' (Time Warner has a minority share in
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, and a division of CBS syndicates
Stewart's show.) Television executives deny the charge, and Stewart
has replied by wishing Smith well.
 &HT;    ``It's like climbing Mount Everest,'' Smith says. ``You get
really tired of it and you think to yourself, So when does it stop?
But it doesn't stop.''
 &HT;    Hearst ultimately agreed to produce Smith's show, but took a
pass on backing her magazine three times on the grounds that the
timing wasn't right. Last fall, American Express finally took a
flier on Smith. Then Hearst announced in July that it would publish
Oprah's new magazine, which, like Smith's, will be about life
style.
 &HT;    But Oprah's will carry a more bankable (and proven) name on its
masthead. Smith was furious. As she puts it, ``The timing's not
right _ until we get a really rich black woman, someone with a name
and dough.''
 &HT;    Rich Fairfield, vice president for strategic planning and new
media at American Express, says that he's not worried about Oprah.
``That just shows again that this is a good idea.''
 &HT;    Still, American Express is not exactly pouring money into
Smith's venture. The magazine's editor, Julie Bain, formerly of The
Wine Enthusiast, has only two full-time staff members. The first
issue is a newsstand holiday preview. ``The earliest you'd see a
second magazine,'' Fairfield says, ``would be April.'' And then
only if the first is successful. All of which steps up the pressure
on Smith.
 &HT;    ``We see her as a mainstream force,'' says Pamela Cannon,
Smith's Random House editor, who describes Smith as ``glamorous and
approachable and _ perhaps most important _ not just Afrocentric.''
The company is promoting the book heavily on television and sending
Smith to four times the number of cities than the norm for a
lifestyle title.
 &HT;    On the cover, she's decked out in a tight floral cheongsam,
lighting candles on the beach. There are sections on Juneteenth and
Kwanzaa and also on the Chinese New Year. ``She's really
crossover,'' Cannon says.
 &HT;    Black commentators don't necessarily disagree. ``I call that
kind of black woman a super-fabulous white woman,'' says Hilton
Als, an author and a critic. ``She has no real allegiance to the
black culture.'' He says her appeal is found in the market's
assessment of her as ``safe and manageable. She's not Toukie
Smith,'' the louder, larger, more flamboyant former restaurateur.
 &HT;    Certainly, Smith does not fit into the more traditional image of
black caterers and restaurateurs like Sylvia Woods of Sylvia's, in
Harlem, or Leah Chase of Dooky Chase, in New Orleans. Those women
made national names for themselves by dishing out country and
Creole meals like fried chicken or gumbo. ``It's more like Zsa Zsa
Gabor in the kitchen,'' Als says.
 &HT;    But this is precisely why some members of the black elite see
Smith as no less than their liberator. ``She has given the black
upper classes permission to come out of the closet,'' Graham says.
``Everybody in our crowd really watches her show because we live
like this. Until now, we felt as though we had to apologize for the
fact that we had nice homes and nice things.''
 &HT;    Smith, like many middle-class professionals, straddles two
worlds: the one she came from and the one she currently inhabits.
Herein lies her real appeal. Her most powerful message is her own
story, which she tells just about wherever she goes, about the
small-town girl in western Pennsylvania whose mama was a maid and
whose daddy was a steelworker _ ``the original Martha Stewart and
Bob Vila.''
 &HT;    They grew everything themselves, had plenty of food on the table
and plenty of family around to eat it. Even then, she says, her
experience was multicultural.
 &HT;    ``The town was Greek and German and Polish and
African-American,'' she says. ``We weren't Catholic, but if it was
Friday, we had to have fish.'' On Friday nights, her father served
his homemade root beer and fresh buttered popcorn, and they'd all
sit in front of the TV to watch the fights. She learned to cook and
to clean, to grow peonies and change the slipcovers in the summer.
In the summer, she and her three brothers were packed into the
family car for trips to the only black swimming pool nearby.
 &HT;    But Smith wanted to venture farther. She persuaded her father,
who had seen a bit of the world when he was a first lieutenant in
the Army and stationed in Europe, to let her go to modeling school
in Pittsburgh, where she boarded with a caterer.
 &HT;    By the time she was 19, she was in New York leading her own
classes in modeling, pounding the pavement and, she says,
entertaining. ``Nobody turns down an invitation in New York. You
cook; you invite; they come. No matter how small the apartment.''
 &HT;    Now she is 50, with a big Manhattan apartment near her Times
Square restaurant and a house in an exclusive black section of Sag
Harbor, where she lives with Gasby and his 13-year-old daughter,
Dana. Along the way, she says, there were ``some hard knocks.''
 &HT;    Among them was a not entirely successful singing career, in
which she sang in a reggae band with Deborah Harry and hired
Freddie Jackson as a backup singer in her own short-lived nightclub
act. (``I always had a good eye for talent.'')
 &HT;    There was the painful first marriage that was annulled (``he
misrepresented himself''), and the regret of not having a child of
her own. There were also some ``difficult business relationships,''
including a partnership with Ark Restaurants.
 &HT;    By the 1980s, Smith had parlayed her interest in entertaining
into a career in the food industry, working her way up to become a
popular manager at another Ark restaurant, America. With Michael
Weinstein, the president of Ark, she opened a restaurant on Eighth
Avenue.
 &HT;    He hoped her name on the restaurant, and her presence, would
help draw crowds from the nearby theater district. ``Barbara has a
very engaging personality,'' Weinstein says. ``She is quick-witted
and certainly beautiful to look at.''
 &HT;    Enter Gasby, whom Smith first met at the restaurant in 1987 and
married almost seven years ago. He says he loves being ``Mr. B.
Smith'' and is something of a stage husband. He is the creator of
her show (when the credits roll, Smith's voice can be heard, saying
sweetly, ``Thank you, Dan'') and the driving force behind her
expansion. ``I think it's important to see that a black man should
support a black woman,'' he says. ``It's her destiny; my duty, to
fulfill it.''
 &HT;    Gasby describes Weinstein as ``the Milosevic of the restaurant
business.'' When Gasby looked at Smith's partnership, he says, ``I
saw that it wasn't in her favor.''
 &HT;    Weinstein says that the Times Square lease is too valuable for
Smith and Gasby to buy him out, but they did buy him out of the
Washington partnership and have always had full control in Sag
Harbor. Ark's use of the B. Smith name expires in December, and
Smith and Gasby are now looking for new space in Manhattan. Their
plan is then to expand to Philadelphia, Boston and Charlotte, N.C.
 &HT;    ``If I weren't married to him already,'' Smith says of Gasby,
``I'd marry him now.''
 &HT;    They are certainly cut from the same cloth. Gasby was born in
Brooklyn, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, ``about four miles too soon,'' he
says. Like Smith's, his mother was a maid; his father was a bookie.
``When I was about 7 or 8 years old, I was like, I got dropped in
the wrong place. I always wanted to be some place esthetically
beautiful, like Barbara did. I took cold baths _ so the bathroom is
very important to me.''
 &HT;    He went to Colgate, worked at a TV station in Memphis and
created and produced a ``Star Search''-style show with Natalie Cole
in Los Angeles. He met Smith, and in time their plans converged.
 &HT;    When they bought and renovated their house in Sag Harbor, he
made sure it had two 75-gallon hot-water heaters for his baths and
two kitchens for the set of the TV show they did not yet have.
``People thought we were crazy,'' Gasby says, ``But you can't bet
against B., and you better not bet against me.''
 &HT;    And so while Smith may have grown up eating collard greens from
her own backyard, she now sautes them in olive oil and puts them in
Italian frittatas. There's a picture of one in her latest book _
photographed in her new backyard, the one overlooking a private
beach.
 &HT;    Smith is peddling style as an aspirational tool. ``I am more of
a conduit,'' she says. ``I bring in experts, and the audience and I
are in it together.'' This is what attracted Leslie McNeil, the
former executive producer of Martha Stewart's Emmy-winning TV show,
who has just signed on as executive producer of ``B. Smith, With
Style.''
 &HT;    ``Martha is an event unto herself, and you see the world through
her eyes,'' McNeil says. ``B. has a very powerful vision too, but
it has to do with encouraging people to develop their own
imprint.''
 &HT;    In the overcrowded lifestyle market, Cannon says, personality
has become everything, and so ``the key to B. is meeting her,
seeing her. That's why we're putting so much behind her.''

 By BLAINE HARDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Welcome to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia.
 &HT;    Here bureaucrats with bodyguards and blood on their hands have
become private-club dandies; middle-class professionals have been
forced to choose between poverty or criminality; and feigned lunacy
is a sane way to stay safe.
 &HT;    Four lost wars, international isolation and gangster economics
have combined to make Belgrade especially cruel to the young people
who have come of age during the 12-year reign of Slobodan
Milosevic.
 &HT;    The city has descended into its own sad, slacker category among
major European capitals. It's a metropolis where hard work,
professional excellence and saving for the future are wastes of
time.
 &HT;    This is home for the Milosevic generation. Unemployed or stuck
in jobs that usually pay less than $100 a month, young Serbs
between the ages of 18 and 30 typically live with their parents,
spend nearly all their money on night life, postpone marriage,
avoid parenthood and put off plans for the future _ except to get
out of the country.
 &HT;    Estimates of the number of university-trained young people who
have fled the city since 1990 range from 100,000 to 300,000. That's
a catastrophic drain of talent and skills from a nation where in
1991 just 622,000 people in a population of 10 million had more
than a high-school education.
 &HT;    But the option of running away has run out. The war in Kosovo
forced most Western countries to close their embassies in Belgrade,
making obtaining visas far more difficult.
 &HT;    ``Delayed gratification is what the whole civilized world is
based on, but in Belgrade, it makes no sense,'' says Svetlana
Logar-Djuric, a prominent psychologist at the University of
Belgrade and the mother of an 18-year-old son. She has spent
several years researching, among other things, the lives of
Belgrade's smart set _ those whose professional parents had, as
late at the mid-1980s, constituted the only well-paid, widely
traveled middle class in the Communist bloc.
 &HT;    ``For young people here, it makes sense to be depressed,'' she
says. ``Many go to bed at 4 o'clock in the morning and sleep all
day. They don't see a point in growing up to become responsible
adults. The city teaches them to be helpless.''
 &HT;    Her own son, Jovan, scolds her for having wasted her time
working long hours to earn a Ph.D. He has a point. Her university
job pays approximately $100 a month, and the money always arrives
several months late.
 &HT;    ``If you are a criminal, you are, like, cool,'' Jovan said one
afternoon as we sat with his mother and four of his high-school
friends in their Belgrade apartment so choked with cigarette smoke
that it was difficult to see across the cramped living room. (Jovan
and his friends were all chain-smokers.) ``You can't blame anyone
for being a criminal. I have respect for those who have the will to
do what they want. Life in the fast lane _ how can that not be
attractive?''
 &HT;    His friends' heads bobbed in agreement. Burglary, for instance,
is one of the few promising career paths for savvy young Serbs.
 &HT;    Home is where the money is _ about $2.5 billion, according to
the Yugoslav Association of Banks. In the Milosevic era, it's much
less risky to hide money in a mattress than to deposit it in a
bank. The regime has seized the hard-currency savings accounts of
most private depositors _ about $4.1 billion in the last decade.
 &HT;    The regime also tacitly encourages the young to consider careers
in car theft. The streets of Belgrade are filled with gleaming
late-model cars that have no license plates. They are driven by
mean-looking young men and are often ignored by the police.
 &HT;    For the past two years, the government has offered a monthlong
amnesty to car thieves, allowing them to register any car, even one
that is obviously hot, in order to raise money from licensing fees.
Many of the vehicles have been swiped by gangsters and paramilitary
thugs from other republics in the former Yugoslavia, as well as
from Western Europe.
 &HT;    And yet, as much as Jovan and his friends were mesmerized by
life in Belgrade's fast lane, they saw dark motives behind the
West's bombing of their city. They say the reasons for the war
were: American fear of a united Europe, the desire of the
military-industrial complex to use up its old bombs and
multinational corporate hunger for Serbia's mineral wealth.
 &HT;    As for war crimes, Jovan and his friends say, get real. ``It was
war,'' Jovan said. ``As much as Serbs did something bad, so did the
Albanians.''
 &HT;    Even when about 35,000 NATO troops had occupied Kosovo and when
Kosovar Albanians, bent on revenge, were harassing, ripping off and
murdering Kosovar Serbs, Belgrade was drowning in denial. Some of
it was merely the posturing of a defeated demagogue, as
state-controlled television in late June insisted that Serbia had
won the war.
 &HT;    Still more fundamental and more pernicious was the denial that
bubbled up in conversation this summer with well-educated young
people in Belgrade. Almost without exception, they could not bring
themselves to admit that atrocities had been committed in their
name.
 &HT;    War-crimes investigators were digging up mass graves in Kosovo,
but they refused to concede what was obvious to the rest of the
world: Serb forces had committed crimes against humanity on a scale
and with an organized savagery that was grossly disproportionate to
the threat posed by ethnic Albanians.
 &HT;    The people of Belgrade, about a fifth of Serbia's 10 million
people and 40 percent of its college-educated population, were far
less upset at the bestial way in which the war was fought than by
the fact that Milosevic had compounded their poverty and isolation
by losing it.
 &HT;    I first started coming to Belgrade as a reporter in 1990, as
Yugoslavia was beginning to come apart. It never occurred to me
early in the decade that the Serbs of Belgrade would be
collectively responsible for the horrors perpetrated by the
Milosevic regime. Far from it, Belgrade was for me an intellectual
and cultural oasis in the ruins of Yugoslavia.
 &HT;    Thanks to Tito's brand of communism, Belgrade's middle class had
become far more affluent and Westernized _ from foreign travel and
foreign investment, from a hybrid economy that mixed socialism with
private enterprise, from a flood of foreign movies, books and music
_ than residents of any other capital in Eastern Europe.
 &HT;    Until the war in Bosnia began in 1992, Belgrade had been the
destination city in the East bloc for young Poles, Czechs and
Hungarians seeking to be cool. It teemed with outspoken
politicians, well-informed journalists and insightful academics _
not to mention beautiful women, smart nightclubs and excellent
restaurants.
 &HT;    Atrocities in Kosovo this year have blackened the name of Serbia
as never before. Outside the country, the very word ``Serb'' took
on the sinister resonance of ``Nazi.'' Even if they were not the
ones doing the fighting, an argument grew that Serbian civilians
should be held morally responsible for crimes committed in their
name.
 &HT;    In Belgrade this summer, though, people didn't feel responsible.
Nor did they tolerate politicians who suggested that they were.
 &HT;    At a huge opposition rally in mid-August in Belgrade, as during
earlier rallies outside the capital this summer, speakers who said
that Serbia had been ``shamed'' in the eyes of the world were
careful to blame Milosevic and a few maniacs in his regime _ and to
distance the people of Serbia from any accountability for the
conduct of the war.
 &HT;    I had asked Helena Zdravkovic, who is 21 and speaks perfect
American-accented English, to take me around Belgrade. Her father
owns the Tennis Club Max and plays doubles regularly with Radovan
(Rade) Markovic, the head of state security, who commands state
paramilitary forces that helped lead the campaign of murder, theft
and house-burning in Kosovo, which war crimes investigators say
killed at least 11,000 Kosovar Albanians.
 &HT;    American officials say Markovic is likely to be indicted by the
War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, but he has not allowed this
unpleasantness to rattle his tennis game. Throughout the
three-month Kosovo war and on into this summer, he played at Tennis
Club Max as much as weather permitted.
 &HT;    The police seem to know whom Helena's father plays tennis with _
Belgrade is that kind of town. They let her get away with driving a
Mercury Capri convertible with expired Florida plates. She was
familiar with the lifestyles of the rich and criminal, having spent
her teen-age years hanging out at Tennis Club Max. Both a player in
the city's social scene and a skeptic, she had studied journalism
for the past two academic years at Florida International
University, in Miami, and the American University in Paris. She
plans to attend Emerson College, in Boston, next year. Helena also
happened to be blond, attractive and fitted out in fetching summer
dresses, which does not hurt in Belgrade.
 &HT;    Her father, Dejan Zdravkovic, opened the club nine years ago
after retiring at the age of 40. He had made what he told me was a
substantial amount of money in Italy selling machine tools to
governments around the world. Most of the equipment was for making
cannons and artillery pieces.
 &HT;    He came home to Belgrade and opened the club in the exclusive
residential diplomats' neighborhood of Dedinje. Now the club has
just 35 members, many of them businessmen who have grown rich under
the U.N. sanctions imposed this decade on the Milosevic regime.
 &HT;    ``Sanctions are paradise,'' Dejan said as we sat beneath ``Just
Do It!'' sun umbrellas in the cafe of his club. ``Normally, you
import and you pay duties and then taxes. But under sanctions, if
you know the right people, you pay no duties and no taxes, and you
have the excuse of charging more. Sanctions are what cemented
Milosevic's power.''
 &HT;    Although Dejan and his wife, Ivana, play tennis, do business and
socialize with well-connected people in the regime, they are
nervous about the future. They are sending their children to
college in the United States.
 &HT;    On a hot July morning, Helena treated me to a comfortable
accoutrement of her upper-middle-class life _ an
apartment-turned-boutique in central Belgrade that admits only
customers known to the owner. The shop, which has no name, sells
designer clothing and fashion accessories shoplifted from Italy and
smuggled into Serbia.
 &HT;    The owner, a Montenegrin with a shaved head, gold chains and
leather vest, kissed Helena (and glared at me) before we climbed
the stairs to his third-floor boutique. He is a regular at Tennis
Club Max, where he comes with the latest issues of Vogue and Marie
Claire to sit with well-heeled women. They point to clothes that
tickle their fancy. His men in Italy then try to steal them.
 &HT;    During the owner's brief conversation with Helena, he told her
that one of his men in Italy had ``fallen,'' meaning that he was
arrested trying to break into a warehouse full of merchandise.
 &HT;    There were video cameras on the stairs leading up to the shop
and a monitor inside that gave clerks a chance to scrutinize
visitors before letting them enter. Helena, of course, was more
than welcome.
 &HT;    The place was piled high with panties and sunglasses, handbags
and evening gowns. I saw pink-and-gray stiletto-heeled Versace
shoes in the living room, Fendi white leather skirts in one bedroom
and a handsome charcoal-gray Kenzo business suit in the second
bedroom. Most of the clothes bore stickers from the stores where
they had been stolen. The prices were about one-third retail.
Helena was not impressed.
 &HT;    ``It is nothing like it was last year,'' she said. ``I mean I
could find really nice clothes for myself and I am really picky.''
 &HT;    The shopkeeper explained to Helena that the springtime war in
Kosovo had constricted his supply line for summer fashion. But with
the war over, he was expecting new shipments.
 &HT;    Then we were off in Helena's convertible, her 6-month-old,
purebred English bulldog, Boobi, drooling in the back seat, for a
look at what American cruise missiles have done to Belgrade.
 &HT;    In the heart of the city, at each corner of the intersection,
but only at each corner, there were ruins. The Serbian government
center, the foreign ministry and two defense ministry buildings had
been reduced to rubble or were fire-gutted shells. The precision of
the destruction suggested a war with an invisible, all-seeing enemy
and of a city helpless to protect itself.
 &HT;    Traffic flowed, shops were open and apartments were being lived
in. Except for long lines for rationed gasoline, the surface of
everyday life in Belgrade seemed remarkably placid. But the surface
was deceptive. The war in Kosovo had plunged the Serbian economy
into free fall, incomes were collapsing and the U.N. World Food
Program was warning of massive wintertime shortages of food,
electricity and fuel.
 &HT;    In Belgrade, the downwardly mobile do not mind being quoted by
name. Helena took me one evening to meet her friend Darko Susnjar,
who grew up in Belgrade's upper middle class, but who has since
been skidding into the ranks of the working poor. He worked this
summer as a ticket taker on a private bus, making about $5.50 for a
12-hour day.
 &HT;    With a ring in his left ear, day-old stubble and long brown hair
tied in a ponytail, Susnjar, 26, bears a passing resemblance to a
young version of the comedian George Carlin. An only child, he
lives with his parents and admits to being a desultory student at
the University of Belgrade. Like many students there, he sees no
point in graduating. He studies ethnology, a field that he
acknowledges is a waste of time, given the circumstances in Serbia.
 &HT;    His father worked at the Hotel Yugoslavia, which on May 7 was
hit by three American cruise missiles. The Americans were
apparently trying to take out the hotel's casino, which was partly
owned by Arkan, but missed by a few feet and gutted a wing of rooms
in the hotel.
 &HT;    Darko and his family live near that hotel, and he happened to be
out that Friday night in May getting a hamburger at a fast-food
kiosk. He paid for his burger a few minutes before midnight, just
as the missiles ruined his father's livelihood.
 &HT;    ``I stood there for a minute and watched the hotel burn,'' Darko
said. ``What to do? I walked home and ate my hamburger. Now, from
day to day, we sink lower. You ask yourself, How much more?''
 &HT;    Darko, who listened to Radio Free Europe throughout the war, had
also heard about atrocities. He did not argue that they were
justified by Albanian treachery. He simply did not care to talk
about the subject. To avoid thinking about war and to salve
depression brought on by the summer of endless rain, Darko said he
was reading 19th-century novels and listening to sunny Cuban music.
 &HT;    ``Politics here is a kind of sickness, and I'm not interested,''
he said. ``Democratic change will take many years. In the meantime,
the Serbs will hibernate, like bears. At this time, Thanatos is
much stronger than Eros. It is dark here now. That is our
reality.''
 &HT;    I also learned that for young women in Belgrade, on the other
hand, career choices tend to lie somewhere on a continuum between
honest-impoverishing and criminal-lucrative. In the dispiriting
middle lies the temp work done by ``sponsor girls'' _ middle-class
high-school girls who tart themselves up and trade their bodies to
gangsters in return for designer clothes, cell phones and fancy
dinners.
 &HT;    I had dinner with two buxom, bejeweled and elaborately made-up
young women, age 18 and 19, one of whom used to date Helena's
brother. We met around midnight in the Fortress, an elegant new
outdoor restaurant built amid Roman and medieval ruins on a hilltop
at the confluence of the Danube and Sava Rivers.
 &HT;    It's an expensive place where gangsters gather late at night to
show off new cars, gold chains and teen-age babes in designer duds.
Without a gangster friend, the girls told me, you can't really
enjoy Belgrade; young women have no possibility of doing what they
want with their lives unless they are from rich families.
 &HT;    Both the girls had graduated from high school and said they were
planning on enrolling this fall in the law faculty at the
University of Belgrade. It didn't make sense to become a lawyer in
a country without laws, they said, but they didn't know what else
to do.
 &HT;    I asked them about Kosovo, about the bodies of Albanians that
were being dug up there from mass graves and if they were aware
that outside Serbia, many people had the impression that Serbian
forces had committed genocide. It was as if I had belched or
insulted their makeup. The conversation paused awkwardly. Both
girls seemed offended.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what happened in Kosovo,'' Olja said,
dismissively. ``I didn't hear that we did any more atrocities than
what the Albanians did to us.''
 &HT;    They wanted to talk about the weather. Both said the summer's
thunderstorms reminded them of the spring months when Americans
bombed Belgrade. They said they'd been having trouble sleeping and
that they'd heard the Americans were causing the rainstorms. I said
I did not think that was very likely. They left for another
nightclub.
 &HT;    The night before coming into Belgrade, I had dinner with Milka
Tadic, a prominent Yugoslav journalist. During an evening in which
she grew increasingly combative and angry, she warned me not to be
taken in by Serbs who claim that they do not know about the
atrocities committed in their name in Kosovo.
 &HT;    ``The silence in Belgrade about what went on makes me really
sick,'' she said. Tadic is the managing editor of Monitor, a weekly
political magazine published in Montenegro.
 &HT;    ``Serbs don't want to know, but most of them know,'' she went
on. ``They have satellite dishes and short-wave radios. They know,
but they don't care. All they care about is themselves. For them,
Albanians are not really human beings. The Serbs believe they are
the chosen people. It is racism. I hate to say it, but it is like
what the Germans did.''
 &HT;    I argued with Milka that night. I said it was unfair to tar an
entire people for the depravity of their leaders. But after a month
in Belgrade, after listening to intelligent and cultured people
dismiss the savagery in Kosovo as ``no worse than what they did to
us,'' I came to share Milka's rage.

 By BLAINE HARDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Welcome to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia.
 &HT;    Here bureaucrats with bodyguards and blood on their hands have
become private-club dandies; middle-class professionals have been
forced to choose between poverty or criminality; and feigned lunacy
is a sane way to stay safe.
 &HT;    Four lost wars, international isolation and gangster economics
have combined to make Belgrade especially cruel to the young people
who have come of age during the 12-year reign of Slobodan
Milosevic.
 &HT;    The city has descended into its own sad, slacker category among
major European capitals. It's a metropolis where hard work,
professional excellence and saving for the future are wastes of
time.
 &HT;    This is home for the Milosevic generation. Unemployed or stuck
in jobs that usually pay less than $100 a month, young Serbs
between the ages of 18 and 30 typically live with their parents,
spend nearly all their money on night life, postpone marriage,
avoid parenthood and put off plans for the future _ except to get
out of the country.
 &HT;    Estimates of the number of university-trained young people who
have fled the city since 1990 range from 100,000 to 300,000. That's
a catastrophic drain of talent and skills from a nation where in
1991 just 622,000 people in a population of 10 million had more
than a high-school education.
 &HT;    But the option of running away has run out. The war in Kosovo
forced most Western countries to close their embassies in Belgrade,
making obtaining visas far more difficult.
 &HT;    ``Delayed gratification is what the whole civilized world is
based on, but in Belgrade, it makes no sense,'' says Svetlana

could find really nice clothes for myself and I am really picky.''
 &HT;    The shopkeeper explained to Helena that the springtime war in
Kosovo had constricted his supply line for summer fashion. But with
the war over, he was expecting new shipments.
 &HT;    Then we were off in Helena's convertible, her 6-month-old,
purebred English bulldog, Boobi, drooling in the back seat, for a
look at what American cruise missiles have done to Belgrade.
 &HT;    In the heart of the city, at each corner of the intersection,
but only at each corner, there were ruins. The Serbian government
center, the foreign ministry and two defense ministry buildings had
been reduced to rubble or were fire-gutted shells. The precision of
the destruction suggested a war with an invisible, all-seeing enemy
and of a city helpless to protect itself.
 &HT;    Traffic flowed, shops were open and apartments were being lived
in. Except for long lines for rationed gasoline, the surface of
everyday life in Belgrade seemed remarkably placid. But the surface
was deceptive. The war in Kosovo had plunged the Serbian economy
into free fall, incomes were collapsing and the U.N. World Food
Program was warning of massive wintertime shortages of food,
electricity and fuel.
 &HT;    In Belgrade, the downwardly mobile do not mind being quoted by
name. Helena took me one evening to meet her friend Darko Susnjar,
who grew up in Belgrade's upper middle class, but who has since
been skidding into the ranks of the working poor. He worked this
summer as a ticket taker on a private bus, making about $5.50 for a
12-hour day.
 &HT;    With a ring in his left ear, day-old stubble and long brown hair
tied in a ponytail, Susnjar, 26, bears a passing resemblance to a
young version of the comedian George Carlin. An only child, he
lives with his parents and admits to being a desultory student at
the University of Belgrade. Like many students there, he sees no
point in graduating. He studies ethnology, a field that he
acknowledges is a waste of time, given the circumstances in Serbia.
 &HT;    His father worked at the Hotel Yugoslavia, which on May 7 was
hit by three American cruise missiles. The Americans were
apparently trying to take out the hotel's casino, which was partly
owned by Arkan, but missed by a few feet and gutted a wing of rooms
in the hotel.
 &HT;    Darko and his family live near that hotel, and he happened to be
out that Friday night in May getting a hamburger at a fast-food
kiosk. He paid for his burger a few minutes before midnight, just
as the missiles ruined his father's livelihood.
 &HT;    ``I stood there for a minute and watched the hotel burn,'' Darko
said. ``What to do? I walked home and ate my hamburger. Now, from
day to day, we sink lower. You ask yourself, How much more?''
 &HT;    Darko, who listened to Radio Free Europe throughout the war, had
also heard about atrocities. He did not argue that they were
justified by Albanian treachery. He simply did not care to talk
about the subject. To avoid thinking about war and to salve
depression brought on by the summer of endless rain, Darko said he
was reading 19th-century novels and listening to sunny Cuban music.
 &HT;    ``Politics here is a kind of sickness, and I'm not interested,''
he said. ``Democratic change will take many years. In the meantime,
the Serbs will hibernate, like bears. At this time, Thanatos is
much stronger than Eros. It is dark here now. That is our
reality.''
 &HT;    I also learned that for young women in Belgrade, on the other
hand, career choices tend to lie somewhere on a continuum between
honest-impoverishing and criminal-lucrative. In the dispiriting
middle lies the temp work done by ``sponsor girls'' _ middle-class
high-school girls who tart themselves up and trade their bodies to
gangsters in return for designer clothes, cell phones and fancy
dinners.
 &HT;    I had dinner with two buxom, bejeweled and elaborately made-up
young women, age 18 and 19, one of whom used to date Helena's
brother. We met around midnight in the Fortress, an elegant new
outdoor restaurant built amid Roman and medieval ruins on a hilltop
at the confluence of the Danube and Sava Rivers.
 &HT;    It's an expensive place where gangsters gather late at night to
show off new cars, gold chains and teen-age babes in designer duds.
Without a gangster friend, the girls told me, you can't really
enjoy Belgrade; young women have no possibility of doing what they
want with their lives unless they are from rich families.
 &HT;    Both the girls had graduated from high school and said they were
planning on enrolling this fall in the law faculty at the
University of Belgrade. It didn't make sense to become a lawyer in
a country without laws, they said, but they didn't know what else
to do.
 &HT;    I asked them about Kosovo, about the bodies of Albanians that
were being dug up there from mass graves and if they were aware
that outside Serbia, many people had the impression that Serbian
forces had committed genocide. It was as if I had belched or
insulted their makeup. The conversation paused awkwardly. Both
girls seemed offended.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what happened in Kosovo,'' Olja said,
dismissively. ``I didn't hear that we did any more atrocities than
what the Albanians did to us.''
 &HT;    They wanted to talk about the weather. Both said the summer's
thunderstorms reminded them of the spring months when Americans
bombed Belgrade. They said they'd been having trouble sleeping and
that they'd heard the Americans were causing the rainstorms. I said
I did not think that was very likely. They left for another
nightclub.
 &HT;    The night before coming into Belgrade, I had dinner with Milka
Tadic, a prominent Yugoslav journalist. During an evening in which
she grew increasingly combative and angry, she warned me not to be
taken in by Serbs who claim that they do not know about the
atrocities committed in their name in Kosovo.
 &HT;    ``The silence in Belgrade about what went on makes me really
sick,'' she said. Tadic is the managing editor of Monitor, a weekly
political magazine published in Montenegro.
 &HT;    ``Serbs don't want to know, but most of them know,'' she went
on. ``They have satellite dishes and short-wave radios. They know,
but they don't care. All they care about is themselves. For them,
Albanians are not really human beings. The Serbs believe they are
the chosen people. It is racism. I hate to say it, but it is like
what the Germans did.''
 &HT;    I argued with Milka that night. I said it was unfair to tar an
entire people for the depravity of their leaders. But after a month
in Belgrade, after listening to intelligent and cultured people
dismiss the savagery in Kosovo as ``no worse than what they did to
us,'' I came to share Milka's rage.

   Juliette Lewis brings focus and electricity to a gooey-glossy
film that sometimes plays like a lavish Movie of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   She plays Carla, a mentally challenged woman who returns to her
wealthy family's San Francisco home from a boarding school for
``special'' students. Mom Elizabeth (Diane Keaton) frets when Carla
insists on her own apartment and wants to enroll in tech school,
where she falls for another mentally challenged person, Danny
(Giovanni Ribisi).
</P>
<P>
   The movie unfolds in such a rarified atmosphere, the stakes
never seem very high. Keaton seems uncomfortable playing a fussy
matron. But the movie is surprisingly watchable, mainly due to
Lewis' emotional translucence. She has moments onscreen that are as
breathtakingly truthful as the script is dishonest.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In the Brazilian film ``Central Station,'' Dora is a retired
schoolteacher who makes ends meet by sitting at the station writing
letters for illiterate people.
 &HT;    Suddenly she has an opportunity to pocket $1,000. All she has to
do is persuade a homeless 9-year-old boy to follow her to an
address she has been given. (She is told he will be adopted by
wealthy foreigners.)
 &HT;    She delivers the boy, gets the money, spends some of it on a
television set and settles down to enjoy her new acquisition. Her
neighbor spoils the fun, however, by telling her that the boy was
too old to be adopted _ he will be killed and his organs sold for
transplantation.
 &HT;    Perhaps Dora knew this all along, but after her neighbor's plain
speaking, she spends a troubled night. In the morning Dora resolves
to take the boy back.
 &HT;    Suppose Dora had told her neighbor that it is a tough world,
other people have nice new TVs too, and if selling the kid is the
only way she can get one, well, he was only a street kid. She would
then have become, in the eyes of the audience, a monster. She
redeems herself only by being prepared to bear considerable risks
to save the boy.
 &HT;    At the end of the movie, in cinemas in the affluent nations of
the world, people who would have been quick to condemn Dora if she
had not rescued the boy go home to places far more comfortable than
her apartment.
 &HT;    In fact, the average family in the United States spends almost
one-third of its income on things that are no more necessary to
them than Dora's new TV was to her. Going out to nice restaurants,
buying new clothes because the old ones are no longer stylish,
vacationing at beach resorts _ so much of our income is spent on
things not essential to the preservation of our lives and health.
 &HT;    Donated to one of a number of charitable agencies, that money
could mean the difference between life and death for children in
need.
 &HT;    All of which raises a question: In the end, what is the ethical
distinction between a Brazilian who sells a homeless child to organ
peddlers and an American who already has a television and upgrades
to a better one _ knowing that the money could be donated to an
organization that would use it to save the lives of kids in need?
 &HT;    Of course, there are several differences between the two
situations that could support different moral judgments about them.
For one thing, to be able to consign a child to death when he is
standing right in front of you takes a chilling kind of
heartlessness; it is much easier to ignore an appeal for money to
help children you will never meet.
 &HT;    Yet for a utilitarian philosopher like myself _ that is, one who
judges whether acts are right or wrong by their consequences _ if
the upshot of the American's failure to donate the money is that
one more kid dies on the streets of a Brazilian city, then it is,
in some sense, just as bad as selling the kid to the organ
peddlers.
 &HT;    But one doesn't need to embrace my utilitarian ethic to see
that, at the very least, there is a troubling incongruity in being
so quick to condemn Dora for taking the child to the organ peddlers
while, at the same time, not regarding the American consumer's
behavior as raising a serious moral issue.
 &HT;    In his 1996 book, ``Living High and Letting Die,'' the New York
University philosopher Peter Unger presented an ingenious series of
imaginary examples designed to probe our intuitions about whether
it is wrong to live well without giving substantial amounts of
money to help people who are hungry, malnourished or dying from
easily treatable illnesses such as diarrhea.
 &HT;    Here's my paraphrase of one of these examples:
 &HT;    Bob is close to retirement. He has invested most of his savings
in a very rare and valuable old car, a Bugatti, which he has not
been able to insure. The Bugatti is his pride and joy. In addition
to the pleasure he gets from driving and caring for his car, Bob
knows that its rising market value means that he will always be
able to sell it and live comfortably after retirement.
 &HT;    One day when Bob is out for a drive, he parks the Bugatti near
the end of a railway siding and goes for a walk up the track. As he
does so, he sees that a runaway train, with no one aboard, is
running down the railway track. Looking farther down the track, he
sees the small figure of a child very likely to be killed by the
runaway train.
 &HT;    He can't stop the train and the child is too far away to warn of
the danger, but he can throw a switch that will divert the train
down the siding where his Bugatti is parked. Then nobody will be
killed _ but the train will destroy his Bugatti.
 &HT;    Thinking of his joy in owning the car and the financial security
it represents, Bob decides not to throw the switch. The child is
killed. For many years to come, Bob enjoys owning his Bugatti and
the financial security it represents.
 &HT;    Bob's conduct, most of us will immediately respond, was gravely
wrong. Unger agrees. But then he reminds us that we too have
opportunities to save the lives of children. We can give to
organizations such as Unicef or Oxfam America. How much would we
have to give one of these organizations to have a high probability
of saving the life of a child threatened by easily preventable
diseases?
 &HT;    (I do not believe that children are more worth saving than
adults, but since no one can argue that children have brought their
poverty on themselves, focusing on them simplifies the issues.)
 &HT;    Unger called up some experts and used the information they
provided to offer some plausible estimates that include the cost of
raising money, administrative expenses and the cost of delivering
aid where it is most needed. By his calculation, $200 in donations
would help a sickly 2-year-old transform into a healthy 6-year-old
_ offering safe passage through childhood's most dangerous years.
 &HT;    To show how practical philosophical argument can be, Unger even
tells his readers that they can easily donate funds by using their
credit card and calling one of these toll-free numbers: (800)
367-5437 for Unicef; (800) 693-2687 for Oxfam America.
 &HT;    Now you too have the information you need to save a child's
life. How should you judge yourself if you don't do it?
 &HT;    Think again about Bob and his Bugatti. Unlike Dora, Bob did not
have to look into the eyes of the child he was sacrificing for his
own material comfort. The child was a complete stranger to him and
too far away to relate to in an intimate, personal way.
 &HT;    Unlike Dora, too, he did not mislead the child or initiate the
chain of events imperiling him. In all these respects, Bob's
situation resembles that of people able but unwilling to donate to
overseas aid and differs from Dora's situation.
 &HT;    If you still think that it was very wrong of Bob not to throw
the switch that would have diverted the train and saved the child's
life, then it is hard to see how you could deny that it is also
very wrong not to send money to one of the organizations listed
above. Unless, that is, there is some morally important difference
between the two situations that I have overlooked.
 &HT;    Is it the practical uncertainties about whether aid will really
reach the people who need it? Nobody who knows the world of
overseas aid can doubt that such uncertainties exist. But Unger's
figure of $200 to save a child's life was reached after he had made
conservative assumptions about the proportion of the money donated
that will actually reach its target.
 &HT;    One genuine difference between Bob and those who can afford to
donate to overseas aid organizations but don't is that only Bob can
save the child on the tracks, whereas there are hundreds of
millions of people who can give $200 to overseas aid organizations.
 &HT;    The problem is that most of them aren't doing it. Does this mean
that it is all right for you not to do it?
 &HT;    Suppose that there were more owners of priceless vintage cars _
Carol, Dave, Emma, Fred and so on, down to Ziggy _ all in exactly
the same situation as Bob, with their own siding and their own
switch, all sacrificing the child in order to preserve their own
cherished car. Would that make it all right for Bob to do the same?
 &HT;    To answer this question affirmatively is to endorse
follow-the-crowd ethics _ the kind of ethics that led many Germans
to look away when the Nazi atrocities were being committed. We do
not excuse them because others were behaving no better.
 &HT;    We seem to lack a sound basis for drawing a clear moral line
between Bob's situation and that of any reader of this article with
$200 to spare who does not donate it to an overseas aid agency.
These readers seem to be acting at least as badly as Bob was acting
when he chose to let the runaway train hurtle toward the
unsuspecting child.
 &HT;    In the light of this conclusion, I trust that many readers will
reach for the phone and donate that $200. Perhaps you should do it
before reading further.
 &HT;    Now that you have distinguished yourself morally from people who
put their vintage cars ahead of a child's life, how about treating
yourself and your partner to dinner at your favorite restaurant?
But wait. The money you will spend at the restaurant could also
help save the lives of children overseas! True, you weren't
planning to blow $200 tonight, but if you were to give up dining
out just for one month, you would easily save that amount. And what
is one month's dining out, compared to a child's life?
 &HT;    There's the rub. Since there are a lot of desperately needy
children in the world, there will always be another child whose
life you could save for another $200. Are you therefore obliged to
keep giving until you have nothing left? At what point can you
stop?
 &HT;    Hypothetical examples can easily become farcical. Consider Bob.
How far past losing the Bugatti should he go? Imagine that Bob had
got his foot stuck in the track of the siding, and if he diverted
the train, then before it rammed the car it would also amputate his
big toe. Should he still throw the switch? What if it would
amputate his foot? His entire leg?
 &HT;    As absurd as the Bugatti scenario gets when pushed to extremes,
the point it raises is a serious one: Only when the sacrifices
become very significant indeed would most people be prepared to say
that Bob does nothing wrong when he decides not to throw the
switch.
 &HT;    Of course, most people could be wrong; we can't decide moral
issues by taking opinion polls. But consider for yourself the level
of sacrifice that you would demand of Bob, and then think about how
much money you would have to give away in order to make a sacrifice
that is roughly equal to that. It's almost certainly much, much
more than $200. For most middle-class Americans, it could easily be
more like $200,000.
 &HT;    Isn't it counterproductive to ask people to do so much? Don't we
run the risk that many will shrug their shoulders and say that
morality, so conceived, is fine for saints but not for them?
 &HT;    I accept that we are unlikely to see, in the near or even
medium-term future, a world in which it is normal for wealthy
Americans to give the bulk of their wealth to strangers. When it
comes to praising or blaming people for what they do, we tend to
use a standard that is relative to some conception of normal
behavior.
 &HT;    Comfortably off Americans who give, say, 10 percent of their
income to overseas aid organizations are so far ahead of most of
their equally comfortable fellow citizens that I wouldn't go out of
my way to chastise them for not doing more. Nevertheless, they
should be doing much more, and they are in no position to criticize
Bob for failing to make the much greater sacrifice of his Bugatti.
 &HT;    At this point various objections may crop up. Someone may say:
``If every citizen living in the affluent nations contributed his
or her share I wouldn't have to make such a drastic sacrifice,
because long before such levels were reached, the resources would
have been there to save the lives of all those children dying from
lack of food or medical care. So why should I give more than my
fair share?''
 &HT;    Another, related, objection is that the government ought to
increase its overseas aid allocations, since that would spread the
burden more equitably across all taxpayers.
 &HT;    Yet the question of how much we ought to give is a matter to be
decided in the real world _ and that, sadly, is a world in which we
know that most people do not, and in the immediate future will not,
give substantial amounts to overseas aid agencies.
 &HT;    We know too that at least in the next year, the U.S. government
is not going to meet even the very modest United
Nations-recommended target of 0.7 percent of gross national
product; at the moment it lags far below that, at 0.09 percent, not
even half of Japan's 0.22 percent or a tenth of Denmark's 0.97
percent.
 &HT;    Thus, we know that the money we can give beyond that theoretical
``fair share'' is still going to save lives that would otherwise be
lost. While the idea that no one need do more than his or her fair
share is a powerful one, should it prevail if we know that others
are not doing their fair share and that children will die
preventable deaths unless we do more than our fair share? That
would be taking fairness too far.
 &HT;    Thus, this ground for limiting how much we ought to give also
fails. In the world as it is now, I can see no escape from the
conclusion that each one of us with wealth surplus to his or her
essential needs should be giving most of it to help people
suffering from poverty so dire as to be life-threatening.
 &HT;    That's right: I'm saying that you shouldn't buy that new car,
take that cruise, redecorate the house or get that pricey new suit.
After all, a $1,000 suit could save five children's lives.
 &HT;    So how does my philosophy break down in dollars and cents? An
American household with an income of $50,000 spends about $30,000
annually on necessities, according to the Conference Board, a
nonprofit economic research organization. Therefore, for a
household bringing in $50,000 a year, donations to help the world's
poor should be as close as possible to $20,000.
 &HT;    The $30,000 required for necessities holds for higher incomes as
well. So a household making $100,000 could cut a yearly check for
$70,000. Again, the formula is simple: Whatever money you're
spending on luxuries, not necessities, should be given away.
 &HT;    Now, evolutionary psychologists tell us that human nature just
isn't sufficiently altruistic to make it plausible that many people
will sacrifice so much for strangers. On the facts of human nature,
they might be right, but they would be wrong to draw a moral
conclusion from those facts.
 &HT;    If it is the case that we ought to do things that, predictably,
most of us won't do, then let's face that fact head-on. Then, if we
value the life of a child more than going to fancy restaurants, the
next time we dine out we will know that we could have done
something better with our money.
 &HT;    If that makes living a morally decent life extremely arduous,
well, then that is the way things are. If we don't do it, then we
should at least know that we are failing to live a morally decent
life _ not because it is good to wallow in guilt but because
knowing where we should be going is the first step toward heading
in that direction.
 &HT;    When Bob first grasped the dilemma that faced him as he stood by
that railway switch, he must have thought how extraordinarily
unlucky he was to be placed in a situation in which he must choose
between the life of an innocent child and the sacrifice of most of
his savings.
 &HT;    But he was not unlucky at all. We are all in that situation.

 &HT;    At the end of the movie, in cinemas in the affluent nations of
the world, people who would have been quick to condemn Dora if she
had not rescued the boy go home to places far more comfortable than
her apartment.
 &HT;    In fact, the average family in the United States spends almost
one-third of its income on things that are no more necessary to
them than Dora's new TV was to her. Going out to nice restaurants,
buying new clothes because the old ones are no longer stylish,
vacationing at beach resorts _ so much of our income is spent on
things not essential to the preservation of our lives and health.
 &HT;    Donated to one of a number of charitable agencies, that money
could mean the difference between life and death for children in
need.
 &HT;    All of which raises a question: In the end, what is the ethical
distinction between a Brazilian who sells a homeless child to organ
peddlers and an American who already has a television and upgrades
to a better one _ knowing that the money could be donated to an
organization that would use it to save the lives of kids in need?
 &HT;    Of course, there are several differences between the two
situations that could support different moral judgments about them.
For one thing, to be able to consign a child to death when he is
standing right in front of you takes a chilling kind of
heartlessness; it is much easier to ignore an appeal for money to
help children you will never meet.
 &HT;    Yet for a utilitarian philosopher like myself _ that is, one who
judges whether acts are right or wrong by their consequences _ if
the upshot of the American's failure to donate the money is that
one more kid dies on the streets of a Brazilian city, then it is,
in some sense, just as bad as selling the kid to the organ
peddlers.
 &HT;    But one doesn't need to embrace my utilitarian ethic to see
that, at the very least, there is a troubling incongruity in being
so quick to condemn Dora for taking the child to the organ peddlers
while, at the same time, not regarding the American consumer's
behavior as raising a serious moral issue.
 &HT;    In his 1996 book, ``Living High and Letting Die,'' the New York
University philosopher Peter Unger presented an ingenious series of
imaginary examples designed to probe our intuitions about whether
it is wrong to live well without giving substantial amounts of
money to help people who are hungry, malnourished or dying from
easily treatable illnesses such as diarrhea.
 &HT;    Here's my paraphrase of one of these examples:
 &HT;    Bob is close to retirement. He has invested most of his savings
in a very rare and valuable old car, a Bugatti, which he has not
been able to insure. The Bugatti is his pride and joy. In addition
to the pleasure he gets from driving and caring for his car, Bob
knows that its rising market value means that he will always be
able to sell it and live comfortably after retirement.
 &HT;    One day when Bob is out for a drive, he parks the Bugatti near
the end of a railway siding and goes for a walk up the track. As he
does so, he sees that a runaway train, with no one aboard, is
running down the railway track. Looking farther down the track, he
sees the small figure of a child very likely to be killed by the
runaway train.
 &HT;    He can't stop the train and the child is too far away to warn of
the danger, but he can throw a switch that will divert the train
down the siding where his Bugatti is parked. Then nobody will be
killed _ but the train will destroy his Bugatti.
 &HT;    Thinking of his joy in owning the car and the financial security
it represents, Bob decides not to throw the switch. The child is
killed. For many years to come, Bob enjoys owning his Bugatti and
the financial security it represents.
 &HT;    Bob's conduct, most of us will immediately respond, was gravely
wrong. Unger agrees. But then he reminds us that we too have
opportunities to save the lives of children. We can give to
organizations such as Unicef or Oxfam America. How much would we
have to give one of these organizations to have a high probability
of saving the life of a child threatened by easily preventable
diseases?
 &HT;    (I do not believe that children are more worth saving than
adults, but since no one can argue that children have brought their
poverty on themselves, focusing on them simplifies the issues.)
 &HT;    Unger called up some experts and used the information they
provided to offer some plausible estimates that include the cost of
raising money, administrative expenses and the cost of delivering
aid where it is most needed. By his calculation, $200 in donations
would help a sickly 2-year-old transform into a healthy 6-year-old
_ offering safe passage through childhood's most dangerous years.
 &HT;    To show how practical philosophical argument can be, Unger even
tells his readers that they can easily donate funds by using their
credit card and calling one of these toll-free numbers: (800)
367-5437 for Unicef; (800) 693-2687 for Oxfam America.
 &HT;    Now you too have the information you need to save a child's
life. How should you judge yourself if you don't do it?
 &HT;    Think again about Bob and his Bugatti. Unlike Dora, Bob did not
have to look into the eyes of the child he was sacrificing for his
own material comfort. The child was a complete stranger to him and
too far away to relate to in an intimate, personal way.
 &HT;    Unlike Dora, too, he did not mislead the child or initiate the
chain of events imperiling him. In all these respects, Bob's
situation resembles that of people able but unwilling to donate to
overseas aid and differs from Dora's situation.
 &HT;    If you still think that it was very wrong of Bob not to throw
the switch that would have diverted the train and saved the child's
life, then it is hard to see how you could deny that it is also
very wrong not to send money to one of the organizations listed
above. Unless, that is, there is some morally important difference
between the two situations that I have overlooked.
 &HT;    Is it the practical uncertainties about whether aid will really
reach the people who need it? Nobody who knows the world of
overseas aid can doubt that such uncertainties exist. But Unger's
figure of $200 to save a child's life was reached after he had made
conservative assumptions about the proportion of the money donated
that will actually reach its target.
 &HT;    One genuine difference between Bob and those who can afford to
donate to overseas aid organizations but don't is that only Bob can
save the child on the tracks, whereas there are hundreds of
millions of people who can give $200 to overseas aid organizations.
 &HT;    The problem is that most of them aren't doing it. Does this mean
that it is all right for you not to do it?
 &HT;    Suppose that there were more owners of priceless vintage cars _
Carol, Dave, Emma, Fred and so on, down to Ziggy _ all in exactly
the same situation as Bob, with their own siding and their own
switch, all sacrificing the child in order to preserve their own
cherished car. Would that make it all right for Bob to do the same?
 &HT;    To answer this question affirmatively is to endorse
follow-the-crowd ethics _ the kind of ethics that led many Germans
to look away when the Nazi atrocities were being committed. We do
not excuse them because others were behaving no better.
 &HT;    We seem to lack a sound basis for drawing a clear moral line
between Bob's situation and that of any reader of this article with
$200 to spare who does not donate it to an overseas aid agency.
These readers seem to be acting at least as badly as Bob was acting
when he chose to let the runaway train hurtle toward the
unsuspecting child.
 &HT;    In the light of this conclusion, I trust that many readers will
reach for the phone and donate that $200. Perhaps you should do it
before reading further.
 &HT;    Now that you have distinguished yourself morally from people who
put their vintage cars ahead of a child's life, how about treating
yourself and your partner to dinner at your favorite restaurant?
But wait. The money you will spend at the restaurant could also
help save the lives of children overseas! True, you weren't
planning to blow $200 tonight, but if you were to give up dining
out just for one month, you would easily save that amount. And what
is one month's dining out, compared to a child's life?
 &HT;    There's the rub. Since there are a lot of desperately needy
children in the world, there will always be another child whose
life you could save for another $200. Are you therefore obliged to
keep giving until you have nothing left? At what point can you
stop?
 &HT;    Hypothetical examples can easily become farcical. Consider Bob.
How far past losing the Bugatti should he go? Imagine that Bob had
got his foot stuck in the track of the siding, and if he diverted
the train, then before it rammed the car it would also amputate his
big toe. Should he still throw the switch? What if it would
amputate his foot? His entire leg?
 &HT;    As absurd as the Bugatti scenario gets when pushed to extremes,
the point it raises is a serious one: Only when the sacrifices
become very significant indeed would most people be prepared to say
that Bob does nothing wrong when he decides not to throw the
switch.
 &HT;    Of course, most people could be wrong; we can't decide moral
issues by taking opinion polls. But consider for yourself the level
of sacrifice that you would demand of Bob, and then think about how
much money you would have to give away in order to make a sacrifice
that is roughly equal to that. It's almost certainly much, much
more than $200. For most middle-class Americans, it could easily be
more like $200,000.
 &HT;    Isn't it counterproductive to ask people to do so much? Don't we
run the risk that many will shrug their shoulders and say that
morality, so conceived, is fine for saints but not for them?
 &HT;    I accept that we are unlikely to see, in the near or even
medium-term future, a world in which it is normal for wealthy
Americans to give the bulk of their wealth to strangers. When it
comes to praising or blaming people for what they do, we tend to
use a standard that is relative to some conception of normal
behavior.
 &HT;    Comfortably off Americans who give, say, 10 percent of their
income to overseas aid organizations are so far ahead of most of
their equally comfortable fellow citizens that I wouldn't go out of
my way to chastise them for not doing more. Nevertheless, they
should be doing much more, and they are in no position to criticize
Bob for failing to make the much greater sacrifice of his Bugatti.
 &HT;    At this point various objections may crop up. Someone may say:
``If every citizen living in the affluent nations contributed his
or her share I wouldn't have to make such a drastic sacrifice,
because long before such levels were reached, the resources would
have been there to save the lives of all those children dying from
lack of food or medical care. So why should I give more than my
fair share?''
 &HT;    Another, related, objection is that the government ought to
increase its overseas aid allocations, since that would spread the
burden more equitably across all taxpayers.
 &HT;    Yet the question of how much we ought to give is a matter to be
decided in the real world _ and that, sadly, is a world in which we
know that most people do not, and in the immediate future will not,
give substantial amounts to overseas aid agencies.
 &HT;    We know too that at least in the next year, the U.S. government
is not going to meet even the very modest United
Nations-recommended target of 0.7 percent of gross national
product; at the moment it lags far below that, at 0.09 percent, not
even half of Japan's 0.22 percent or a tenth of Denmark's 0.97
percent.
 &HT;    Thus, we know that the money we can give beyond that theoretical
``fair share'' is still going to save lives that would otherwise be
lost. While the idea that no one need do more than his or her fair
share is a powerful one, should it prevail if we know that others
are not doing their fair share and that children will die
preventable deaths unless we do more than our fair share? That
would be taking fairness too far.
 &HT;    Thus, this ground for limiting how much we ought to give also
fails. In the world as it is now, I can see no escape from the
conclusion that each one of us with wealth surplus to his or her
essential needs should be giving most of it to help people
suffering from poverty so dire as to be life-threatening.
 &HT;    That's right: I'm saying that you shouldn't buy that new car,
take that cruise, redecorate the house or get that pricey new suit.
After all, a $1,000 suit could save five children's lives.
 &HT;    So how does my philosophy break down in dollars and cents? An
American household with an income of $50,000 spends about $30,000
annually on necessities, according to the Conference Board, a
nonprofit economic research organization. Therefore, for a
household bringing in $50,000 a year, donations to help the world's
poor should be as close as possible to $20,000.
 &HT;    The $30,000 required for necessities holds for higher incomes as
well. So a household making $100,000 could cut a yearly check for
$70,000. Again, the formula is simple: Whatever money you're
spending on luxuries, not necessities, should be given away.
 &HT;    Now, evolutionary psychologists tell us that human nature just
isn't sufficiently altruistic to make it plausible that many people
will sacrifice so much for strangers. On the facts of human nature,
they might be right, but they would be wrong to draw a moral
conclusion from those facts.
 &HT;    If it is the case that we ought to do things that, predictably,
most of us won't do, then let's face that fact head-on. Then, if we
value the life of a child more than going to fancy restaurants, the
next time we dine out we will know that we could have done
something better with our money.
 &HT;    If that makes living a morally decent life extremely arduous,
well, then that is the way things are. If we don't do it, then we
should at least know that we are failing to live a morally decent
life _ not because it is good to wallow in guilt but because
knowing where we should be going is the first step toward heading
in that direction.
 &HT;    When Bob first grasped the dilemma that faced him as he stood by
that railway switch, he must have thought how extraordinarily
unlucky he was to be placed in a situation in which he must choose
between the life of an innocent child and the sacrifice of most of
his savings.
 &HT;    But he was not unlucky at all. We are all in that situation.

CLIPS THAT WILL WIN MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Madonna claw her way past Britney and Jennifer?
</P>
<P>
   Will the Backstreet Boys burst 'N Sync's pop bubble?
</P>
<P>
   Will Ricky-mania reign supreme? Or Will Korn steamroll over all
those pretty pop darlings?
</P>
<P>
   These and other burning questions will be answered Thursday
night during the ``1999 MTV Video Music Awards,`` broadcast live
from the Metropolitan Opera House at the Lincoln Center in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Actor/comedian Chris Rock will host the party, which will
feature performances by Lauryn Hill, Ricky Martin, Nine Inch Nails,
Jay-Z, TLC, Backstreet Boys, Kid Rock, DMX, Britney Spears, Eminem
and Moby. Scheduled presenters include Madonna, Jennifer Lopez,
Janeane Garofalo, Christina Aguilera, Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath,
Puff Daddy and the ``Blair Witch`` trio.
</P>
<P>
   To help you wade through the endless pool of prepackaged dance
moves and rap-rock heroes, I've assembled this list of the 12 major
categories, the nominees and my predictions. Keep in mind that
anything can happen, and that these aren't necessarily the clips I
think should win (a different story altogether) but who I think
will win. And away we go ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Video of the Year nominees: Backstreet Boys, I Want It That
Way; Lauryn Hill, Doo Wop (That Thing); Korn, Freak on a Leash;
Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca; and Will Smith (featuring Dru
Hill &AMP; Kool Moe Dee), Wild Wild West.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Korn's Freak whips them all. Surprising? Maybe
not. Korn's edgy, animated video was a mainstay on Total Request
Live, so it gives voters a chance to be hip with the kids and flex
some rock 'n' roll muscle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Viewers' Choice nominees: Backstreet Boys, I Want It That Way;
Jay-Z (featuring Ja &AMP; Amil-Lion), Can I Get a ...; Korn, Freak on a
Leash; Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca; 'N Sync, Tearin' Up My
Heart; and TLC, No Scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Boy-band mania reigns supreme. All of these
nominees are fan favorites, so it doesn't matter how cheesy the
video is. You can never discount Ricky-mania, but look for Total
Request Live favorite 'N Sync to slip past the Backstreet Boys in
this category.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Female Video nominees: Lauryn Hill, Doo Wop (That Thing);
Jennifer Lopez, If You Had My Love; Madonna, Beautiful Stranger;
and Britney Spears, ... Baby One More Time.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Madonna's very shagadelic clip, featuring Austin
Powers, shimmies past them all. There are other chances for
award-magnet Hill to earn a moon-man or two. Pinups Spears and
Lopez may cancel each other out, so look for MTV-vet Madonna to
groove up the podium this year. Yeah baby!
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Male Video nominees: Eminem, My Name Is; Lenny Kravitz,
Fly Away; Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca; and Will Smith, Miami.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Ricky! Ricky! Eminem and Kravitz are lightweights
in the wake of Martin's hip-swiveling clip, and Smith's unendurable
Miami clip didn't make enough of an impression.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best New Artist in a Video nominees: Eminem, My Name Is; Kid
Rock, Bawitdaba; Jennifer Lopez, If You Had My Love; 'N Sync,
Tearin' Up My Heart; and Britney Spears, ... Baby One More Time.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: MTV baby Kid Rock takes it home. Lopez, Spears
and 'N Sync are formidable challengers with stronger material, but
none has had the backing that MTV has spoon-fed Kid Rock. The
channel made him a star, and this is just another chance to say,
``Look! He really is famous!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Group Video nominees: Backstreet Boys, I Want It That
Way; Limp Bizkit, Nookie; 'N Sync, Tearin' Up My Heart; Sugar Ray,
Every Morning; and TLC, No Scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Backstreet's back! The Boys took this award home
last year for Everybody, and I Want It That Way provides just as
dandy eye-candy. Take that, 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best R&AMP;B Video nominees: Aaliyah, Are You That Somebody?;
Brandy, Have You Ever?; Lauryn Hill, Doo Wop (That Thing); and
Whitney Houston (featuring Faith Evans &AMP; Kelly Price), Heartbreak
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Hill will get to do her thing, thanks to her
old-school vs. new-school video. Brandy and Houston both received
heavy rotation for their respective clips, but Hill is a critical
and commercial darling. This is a chance to give her the praise
many think she deserves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Rock Video nominees: Limp Bizkit, Nookie; Korn, Freak on
a Leash; Kid Rock, Bawitdaba; Lenny Kravitz, Fly Away; and the
Offspring, Pretty Fly (For a White Guy).
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Korn reaps another bout of success. Limp Bizkit
proved its appeal with a frequently played clip, and Kravitz got a
lot of mileage out of his enduring hit, but Korn's inventive video
likely will be the night's big winner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Hip-Hop Video nominees: Beastie Boys, Intergalactic;
Busta Rhymes (featuring Janet Jackson), What's It Gonna Be?; Lauryn
Hill, Doo Wop (That Thing); and TLC, No Scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: The former Fugees singer doo-woops to the top.
Somebody get that girl a display case for all those statues!
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Rap Video nominees: 2Pac, Changes; DMX, Ruff Ryders
Anthem; Jay-Z (featuring Ja &AMP; Amil-Lion), Can I Get a ...; and Nas
(featuring Puff Daddy), Hate Me Now.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Jay-Z bounces up to the podium. The
Brooklyn-based rapper scored a big crossover hit with his party
anthem, which was pumpin' in car stereos all summer long. The video
retains the same feel-good vibe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Pop Video nominees: Backstreet Boys, I Want It That Way;
Jennifer Lopez, If You Had My Love; Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida
Loca; 'N Sync, Tearin' Up My Heart; and Britney Spears, ... Baby
One More Time.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Boy-pop battles it out. The Backstreet Boys and
Martin both hit it big with teeny-boppers and older listeners, but
I Want It That Way is the closest to pop perfection in this
category. Look for BSB to take it home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Video From a Film nominees: Aaliyah, Are You That
Somebody?; Jay-Z (featuring Ja &AMP; Amil-Lion), Can I Get A ...;
Madonna, Beautiful Stranger; and Will Smith (featuring Dru Hill &AMP;
Kool Moe Dee), Wild Wild West.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Jim West is no match for the shagadelic antics of
Austin Powers and his beautiful stranger. Aaliyah and Jay-Z are
just taking up space here, and Smith's clip, though a No. 1 hit,
was poorly received by critics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Dance Video nominees: Cher, Believe; Fatboy Slim, Praise
You; Jordan Knight, Give It to You; Jennifer Lopez, If You Had My
Love; and Ricky Martin, Livin' La Vida Loca.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Chances are slim for anyone but the Fatboy. If
there were any justice, Cher would take the prize for her
techno-tinged comeback hit and its glittery clip. Alas, Fatboy
Slim's wryly humorous video is just the kind of oddball thing
voters look for.
</P>
<P>
   _ Breakthrough Video nominees: Busta Rhymes, Gimme Some More;
Eels, Last Stop: This Town; Eminem, Guilty Conscience; Fatboy Slim,
Praise You; Korn, Freak on a Leash; and U.N.K.L.E., Rabbit in Your
Headlights.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Another heaping helping of Korn. Clips from the
Eels and U.N.K.L.E. didn't get enough airplay, while Busta Rhymes
and Eminem really didn't offer anything new.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best Choreography in a Video nominees: Ricky Martin, Livin' La
Vida Loca; Fatboy Slim, Praise You; Will Smith (featuring Dru Hill
&AMP; Kool Moe Dee), Wild Wild West; and Britney Spears, ... Baby One
More Time.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction: Martin and Smith's moves seem pretty cheesy after
the first few viewings. The Fatboy may coast on the intentional
goofiness of his clip, but my guess is Spear's school-hall fantasy
will get the best groove on with voters.
</P>
<P>
   As for the artsy categories (direction, cinematography and the
like), your guess is as good as mine. It's a bit of a popularity
contest, but my video radar is picking up another barrel full of
Korn on the horizon. Don't say I didn't warn you.

   Q: Do they still make Kaboom cereal? My husband has been dying
for this stuff for the past four years. I would love to find it for
him. Thanks so much.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allison Hatfield, Woodstock
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a boom. It's Kaboom! The presweetened puffed oat cereal
from General Mills, which debuted in 1969, is still going strong.
To the delight of kids of all ages, the frosted, fruit-flavored
cereal is shaped like smiling clown faces mixed with star-shaped
marshmallow bits in yummy shades of green, purple, pink, orange and
yellow. Since the 10-ounce boxes of Kaboom are in limited
distribution around the country, you can order it ($14.18 for a
four pack) by calling 1-800-233-5780, Ext. 994. This is for credit
cards only. Or write: General Mills, P.O. Box 5272, Minneapolis, MN
55440-5272.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been trying to locate Work Out! Liniment, which was
great on burns (took the pain away). It was also good for sore
muscles and insect bites. No stores seem to carry it anymore. Could
you find it or a similar product?
</P>
<P>
   _ Sandra Moore, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We found the real thing for you. Work Out! Liniment,
distributed by D.L. Carr of Plainview, N.Y., is available only
through the mail. Call 1-800-487-8688 to order the 8-ounce bottle
for $9.50, which includes shipping. Three bottles are $17.50 and
six are $29. According to the distributor, Work Out! can also be
used ``for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains of muscles
and joints associated with arthritis, sprains, strains, bruises and
simple backaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to find Dermatone sunblock, which contains
transparent zinc oxide. I saw it advertised in a magazine and have
looked in several drugstores with no luck.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lori Lynde, Dunwoody, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: No more clowning around for you in the sun. The white clown
look of the traditional oxide product is history. Dermatone
Laboratories' new white UVA/UVB sunblock creme becomes transparent
when applied and rubbed on your skin. It's a soothing combo of
nonchemical microfine zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. And this
creme also prevents chapping and reduces the risk of frostbite,
according to the manufacturer. A .5-ounce tin of creme is $3.25 at
Blue Ridge Mountain Sports, 3393 Peachtree Road N.E.
(404-266-8372).

   Q: I am looking for Lysol Touch-Ups. They are a great product
for in-between cleanings of my bathrooms. I used to find them
everywhere, but not now.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edie May Phillips, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Another request: I've been using Lysol Touch-Ups and have gotten
my mother and sister-in-law hooked, but now we can't find them.
They are great for things like pet accidents in addition to
bathroom/kitchen cleanups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cindy Wilson, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Yet another request: I am looking for disposable Lysol Touch-Ups
to clean your bathroom, kitchen, etc. Can you help me find them?
</P>
<P>
   _ Linda Biesecker, Kennesaw, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And a final Lysol request: I am looking for Lysol Bathroom
Touch-Ups and Lysol Concentrate. Stores don't carry these products
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rebecca Paden,
</P>
<P>
   Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Phew! These Lysol cleaning products must be something special
_ they have such loyal customers. Some cleaners made by Reckitt &AMP;
Colman have limited distribution, and Lysol Touch-Ups fall into
this category. But order a 36-count box ($1.99) from the company at
1-800-456-9477. As advertised on the box, with Touch-Ups you ``just
wet, wipe and toss.'' You can order Lysol Concentrate ($3.59 for a
12-ounce bottle) directly from the company as well.

 &HT;    Usher in the millennium with timely mementos
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The end is near.
</P>
<P>
   But no need to panic. With 113 days left until Jan. 1, retailers
are offering an array of fun, souvenirs _ some of them pricey _ to
help everyone get into an end-of-the-year party mood.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you can count down the seconds with a keepsake
01-01-00 digital clock ($18.99). Or decorate your home with a fat
silver candle in the shape of the numerals 2000 ($14).
</P>
<P>
   And if you are planning to celebrate on the town on New Year's
Eve, you will want to carry Judith Leiber's sparkling silver
crystal bag scripted in black with the date 01012000 ($2,775).
</P>
<P>
   Some items are in stores now; others will start trickling in
Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people regard Jan. 1, 2000, as the beginning of
the new millennium, it technically doesn't start until Jan. 1,
2001. Don't tell that to New York architect Ken Walker, who has
trademarked 01-01-00 for use on all types of merchandise, from
T-shirts and swizzle sticks to inflatable furniture and key chains.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, Walker was doodling with numbers and liked
the way 01-01-00 looked. He pursued the legal rights, then obtained
the licensees for the products.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than 1,000 items with this date are available in
stores as well as on the Home Shopping Network.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a time freak, count on the 11:59 millennium
collection for fun items. A Colorado firm, the 11:59 Co. has
trademarked the time and launched apparel and accessories
embroidered with ``Where Are You Going to Be at 11:59?'' Products
include T-shirts, caps and jackets. Information: 1-877-999-1159.
</P>
<P>
   Some lighthearted souvenirs are tied to the Y2K bug _ a software
glitch that some fear may cause your computer to read the new year
date change as Jan. 1, 1900, instead of 2000. The Oregon company
Something Blue is merchandising the Y2K Compliant Survival Kit over
the Internet. It includes a bottle of water, matches, a votive
candle, 2-ounce chocolate bar, a wooden nickel, commemorative
T-shirt and a computer backup system _ a No. 2 pencil. Cost:
$19.99. Information: 1-888-205-6606.
</P>
<P>
   While much millennium merchandise has a short shelf life, one
item meant to last, until, well, the next millennium is Tiffany &AMP;
Co.'s sterling silver Time Capsule box.
</P>
<P>
   Bordered in Roman numerals and lined in vermeil, the 10 3/8-by-6
3/8-by-4-inch collector's box is $15,000; the 15-by-9-by-4-inch box
is $20,000. Each comes with a lock and key and can be engraved with
a name, date or message. It's the perfect place to keep mementos
from that night of nights, Dec. 31, 1999.

 &HT;    Upscale stores find home outside the malls
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ Ever wish you could run in and shop at a mall
store without the hassle of dodging traffic jams or hunting for a
parking space in another time zone? That's the concept behind the
Avenue East Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Simmons, director of corporate communications for Cousins
Properties, which owns and manages the shopping center, says that
the Avenue East Cobb in Marietta is within 15 miles of Perimeter,
Town Center and North Point malls.
</P>
<P>
   Avenue East Cobb, which opened last month, is geared toward
consumers who don't have quick, easy access to a major mall but who
want to shop in mall stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were targeting upscale retailers traditionally found in
malls,'' Simmons said, ``looking for the right mix between fashion,
furniture, books and music.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks like they found it.
</P>
<P>
   The Avenue East Cobb is noticeably different from surrounding
strip malls. Anchored by a large, flowing fountain, the
pedestrian-friendly center features lush landscaping and brick
walkways. Benches and planters encourage shoppers to sit and take
in the many life-size bronze statues commissioned specifically for
the center.
</P>
<P>
   A small gated courtyard with a seating area provides space for
events, which will include cooking demonstrations and book
readings.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel among friends at the Avenue East Cobb because most
of the shops have familiar names found in malls and a handful are
catalog stores. Note that most of the restaurants and some stores
are scheduled to open in the next month or so. However, as it
stands, the center still offers plenty of shopping opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy this place opened up,'' said Anna Moorhead, who
recently moved to Marietta from Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know my way around that well, and this is so
convenient because I don't have to get on the freeway to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Moorhead is especially happy with the Pottery Barn. ``I've been
shopping in their catalog for years, and it's great to actually
shop at the store. It's beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is. But then so are most of the shops.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Hawken, a familiar name to catalog shoppers, opened
its second metro store at the Marietta site.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part we carry most of the items in our catalog,
said manager Phoebe Brown. ``We have all the gardening items but
not women's clothing. We're known for our fine-quality teak
furniture from Java and English gardening tools.''
</P>
<P>
   This handsome store also carries home decor items: pots, French
dishes and some indoor furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The whole family can shop at the Avenue East Cobb. Talbot's
stocks a wide variety of traditional women's dresses and suits
while the White House/Black Market boutique offers an elegant
interior showcasing women's casual outfits as well as that perfect
little black dress. As the name implies, most of the merchandise is
black or white. In fact, the right side of the store is dedicated
to black and the left to white, with a smattering of pale gray and
taupe.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for casual clothing will find no shortages at
Banana Republic, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and Chico's Casual Clothing.
</P>
<P>
   If something a bit more avant-garde is on your shopping list,
consider Pacific Sunwear, where, along with a huge selection of
cargo pants, you can pick up funky Bullhead black satin jeans set
off by white stitching. Called club pants, these are all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   BabyGap and Gymboree are havens for parents.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a culinary bent, Williams-Sonoma provides a
wonderland ranging from professional-quality cookware, specialty
food items and casual dishware.
</P>
<P>
   During a busy Saturday afternoon at Williams-Sonoma, Harold
Bishop was loading up on some heavy-duty Calphalon pans as a
wedding gift for his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can't cook very well,'' he said, ``but she wants to learn,
so I figured I'd inspire her with the same pans I use.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away near Williams-Sonoma sits V. Reed Gallery, which
just moved to the Avenue from its Virginia-Highland digs. Owner
Barry Rosenstein offers contemporary art and whimsical objects
ranging from domed glass cake plates painted with splashy pink
roses to cockeyed clay dogs.
</P>
<P>
   If you need a little break from the shopping, consider a visit
to Borders Books &AMP; Music, where you can wander among the latest
best sellers, hunt for that classical CD or dig up your favorite
video before settling down with a pastry and a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: From I-75 north take Exit 112 (Ga. 120 Loop)
toward Roswell (east). Exit off 120 Loop to Ga. 120 (Roswell Road).
Turn right and pass through the Johnson Ferry and Roswell roads
intersection. The Avenue East Cobb is on the left-hand side of
Roswell Road across from Harris Teeter.
</P>
<P>
   From Ga. 400 north take the Northridge Road exit and go west to
Ga. 9. Turn right and go to Marietta Highway (Ga. 120) and turn
left. Go about 7 miles just past the Timber Ridge Road traffic
light. The Avenue East Cobb is a quarter-mile on the right. If you
cross Johnson Ferry Road, you've passed the center.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hours: Most stores open 10 a.m.-9 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays;
12:30-5:30 p.m. Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parking: Plenty of free parking in the center.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Handicapped access: Stores are accessible but some of the
sidewalks have steps rather than ramps.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrooms: Available in the management office.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: The Avenue East Cobb management office,
770-303-2806.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More restaurants are due to open this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Rockets. Located near the center's splashy water
fountain, this retro eatery serves up '50s-style burgers, fries,
shakes and malteds, along with plenty of oldies on the jukebox. You
can eat inside or get walk-up service and munch on that burger
alfresco. Prices range from $2-$3.25.
</P>
<P>
   Borders Cafe Espresso. Here you'll find mini-pizzas, pastries,
smoothies and cappuccinos when it's time to take a break from
shopping. If hanging out is your thing, the folks at Borders
encourage customers to pull out a magazine from the rack, order a
cup of java and relax for as long as they want. All they ask is
that you replace the magazine when you leave. Prices range from
$1.50-$4.75.

 &HT;    
 By RANDY KENNEDY  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's a familiar, if not typical, situation: a young man living
dirt cheap so he can pay back the costs of a top-flight college
education _ Harvard, magna cum laude; Columbia graduate school,
with honors.
 &HT;    But a simple phone call to the New York City railroad apartment
of Philippe Wamba can blur this snapshot beyond recognition.
 &HT;    Sometimes the call is from a friend who warns him that his
father is, once again, in the sights of an assassination plot. Or
it's his mother assuring him that his father is OK. Or it's
reporters wanting to know what he has heard.
 &HT;    When the phone rings this afternoon, there's just a click on the
other end and then static. ``That was probably my dad,'' he says.
``A lot of times he calls, and it doesn't go through.''
 &HT;    This is because Dad, Prof. Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, is calling
from an unreliable satellite phone in sub-Saharan Africa, where he
leads a rebel faction in the Democratic Republic of Congo _ a lush,
resource-rich country a quarter the size of the United States _
seeking to overthrow a government that itself came to power through
rebellion in 1997, when the nation was known as Zaire.
 &HT;    Wamba is a tall 28-year-old who has inherited his father's
steam-shovel jaw and almost monastically serious demeanor. He has
also inherited from him something much more important.
 &HT;    Both men are examples of a quiet phenomenon and one that has
been steadily growing for years: American higher education's role
as a kind of finishing school for the foreign elite _ many of whom
return home to become leaders in politics, business, diplomacy, the
military, even in armed insurrection.
 &HT;    For the last several years, Philippe Wamba has spent a lot of
time trying to measure the effects of this unusual export system.
In a memoir he has written that will be published by Dutton in
September '99, ``Kinship: A Family's Journey in Africa and
America,'' the difficult conclusion he draws is that living in two
worlds often means belonging to neither.
 &HT;    ``African-Americans,'' Wamba writes, ``usually saw me as an
African, and though I didn't often admit it, many Africans, both at
Harvard and at home in Tanzania, considered me an American, or at
best an inauthentic hybrid.''
 &HT;    The memoir describes a complex sort of double alienation, or
what Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard professor and one of
Wamba's mentors calls a kind of ``'Black Boy,' squared,'' referring
to Richard Wright's famous memoir.
 &HT;    So where does a young man like Wamba go from here? How long can
he carry on with day-to-day life in America before the pull of
life-and-death politics back home becomes too strong?
 &HT;    There are constant reminders of how stark that choice will be.
One day not long ago, for example, Wamba and one of his brothers
tried to call their father. But he couldn't talk: He was busy with
rifle training. Wamba dia Wamba had no military experience before
trading in the title of history professor for that of rebel leader;
his military advisers decided it would be good for the professor to
learn to use a Kalashnikov.
 &HT;    ``He told me,'' Wamba says, ``that he had hit seven out of nine
bull's-eyes.''
 &HT;    The lives of Wamba and his two younger brothers, Kolo and
Saleem, can be divided fairly neatly into two parts: before and
after Dec. 19, 1981, the sweltering day that made their family
different from others they knew.
 &HT;    All three were born in the United States _ their Congolese
father married an American woman he had met in the French club
while attending Western Michigan University, in Kalamazoo, and he
taught at American universities for several years. But the brothers
grew up mostly in Dar es Salaam, on Tanzania's coast.
 &HT;    Their father's political writings, harshly critical of Congo's
enduring dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, made it too dangerous for them
to live in his native country.
 &HT;    But in 1981, Wamba dia Wamba (his sons have adopted a shortened
version of his last name) attempted a brief, dangerous trip back
into Zaire to visit family and friends. He sneaked into Kinshasa,
the capital, and sent for his wife and sons. That December day, the
Wamba brothers stepped off the plane looking forward to an
emotional first homecoming to their true African heritage.
 &HT;    What they got instead was a welcoming committee of armed Zairean
soldiers, who told them their father had been arrested.
 &HT;    The brothers tell slightly different versions _ kind of family
Gospels _ of the nightmarish weeks that followed. Philippe, 10 at
the time, remembers frantically scanning crowds for familiar faces.
 &HT;    Kolo, a Columbia University graduate who is now a doctoral
physics student at Stanford, was 7 and recalls coping through
denial. Saleem, a sophomore at the University of Central Florida,
in Orlando, was just 4 then and retains the stark child's
impressions of the runway, the brightly lighted airport, the clutch
of discordantly smiling officials.
 &HT;    ``They were all nice _ but in the way a villain in a movie is
nice,'' he says.
 &HT;    Their father was held in a notorious prison, where he was
interrogated about his anti-Mobutu writings, beaten with a buckled
belt and given little to eat. It took five weeks of international
pressure to secure his release.
 &HT;    For Philippe, it was a turning point. ``Africa was not a
mystical, magical and beautiful place as I had thought,'' he writes
in ``Kinship.'' ``Instead it was a place inhabited by evil and
dangerous men _ black men at that _ who had imprisoned and beaten
my father. ... My naive romance with Africa was over.''
 &HT;    In Dar es Salaam, when the boys were growing up, there was a
love in the city of American culture. Whenever they visited
relatives in the States they were expected to return with essential
staples of 1980s African-American teen-age culture: parachute
pants, high tops _ and anything that had anything to do with
Michael Jackson.
 &HT;    African-American hip-hop fans began to wear leather Africa
medallions, Philippe writes in his memoir, and so the medallions
also caught on among African youth, ``in an attempt to emulate
African-Americans celebrating Africa.''
 &HT;    Though each Wamba brother has held onto his United States
citizenship, all three _ and especially Philippe _ were ambivalent
about following their father's lead and leaving Africa to get an
American education.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, at age 16, Philippe won a scholarship to the Armand
Hammer United World College outside Las Vegas, N.M., the American
campus of a slightly loopy, utopian school system that prepares
foreign students for something bigger than college _ to be good
foreign ministers.
 &HT;    If it seems strange to think you could run into a Congolese
rebel leader or his son at your college reunion, consider this:
Another leader of Wamba dia Wamba's rebel group is a Stanford
alumnus whose son now attends Berkeley. To the north, a rebel
commander in Sudan's perpetual civil war earned his doctorate in
agricultural economics from Iowa State.
 &HT;    As of last year, there were 481,280 foreign students in colleges
in the States, the highest number ever. In the mid-1970s, there
were less than half as many. Only a fraction of these students ever
rise to prominence, of course, but there are dozens of marquee
examples: Benjamin Netanyahu (MIT); Kofi Annan of Ghana (Macalester
College, in St. Paul); King Abdullah II of Jordan (Deerfield
Academy, Georgetown University), and, more recently, the son of Hun
Sen, the Khmer Rouge soldier who became prime minister of Cambodia
by way of a coup (West Point).
 &HT;    At Harvard, dozens of Wamba's wealthy foreign classmates lived a
college experience most students wouldn't recognize _ many had
bodyguards, drivers and hotel suites instead of dorm rooms. They
existed in a version of what ambassadors' children call the
diplomatic bubble. Students like the daughter of Moshood K.O.
Abiola, the late Nigerian magnate and opposition leader, were
ducking into limousines after their Harvard classes.
 &HT;    Wamba, though, lived in the dorm and relied mostly on
scholarships and loans. His father's teaching career was never
lucrative, and his mother, Elaine, remains a moderately paid French
instructor in Tanzania. He scrubbed bathrooms and policed the
campus video-game arcade to make money. ``I had a bike,'' he adds.
 &HT;    Once, a fellow student asked whether, as an African, he was used
to wearing clothes. (``They gave me these at the airport,'' Wamba
replied dryly.) He was also surprised to find that even as they
celebrate the ideological concept of Africa, some African-Americans
seemed to find actual Africans ``too white.''
 &HT;    He observes: ``African-Americans often look to Africa with an
unrealistic sense of romanticism. And Africans often look over here
with those same exaggerated expectations.''
 &HT;    Wamba speaks distantly about his father's dangerous life. In the
next breath, however, he can become furious _ for example, over how
an episode of ``Lateline,'' an NBC sitcom that spoofed network
news, used his father's name in a story about a fictional African
coup.
 &HT;    ``I suppose they picked it because they think Wamba dia Wamba
just sounds like a funny African name,'' he says indignantly. He
stews for a moment. ``It was sort of ironic,'' he concludes. ``I've
never heard Peter Jennings say my dad's name, but it shows up on a
sitcom.''
 &HT;    Not long ago, Wamba visited an American cousin in Boston, and at
a Cambridge bar they bumped into a friendly guy who turned out to
be Congolese. Wamba was pleased to share a beer with someone from
the ``homeland.''
 &HT;    As it always does with expat Africans, the talk turned to
politics. Wamba dia Wamba's rebel group was then mounting a serious
challenge to the new regime of Laurent Kabila. Though Kabila's
autocratic style had made him unpopular, few Congolese wanted
another civil war.
 &HT;    In fact, before Philippe's conversation in the bar got very far
the friendly guy declared: ``All of these rebels should be killed.
They're just destroying the country.''
 &HT;    His cousin nudged him, and he decided to let the remark pass.
``In that particular context, it was just not worth getting into
it,'' Wamba says. ``What good would it do?''
 &HT;    Now he worries about what happens if he goes back home, whether
his education has cost him some part of his African identity.
 &HT;    In Africa, it was often said that those who lingered too long
abroad had joined the ``Been-to Tribe.'' ``They acculturate, get
some strange ideas and cultural values and then they go home and
they don't fit in anymore,'' Wamba says _ describing, perhaps,
himself.
 &HT;    The question is particularly full of contradictions for the
Wamba brothers. To ignore the possibility of going home and
contributing something to Africa with their expensive degrees is to
be un-African. Yet for them to act as though some form of
leadership is a birthright could be a disastrous display of
arrogance.
 &HT;    When I visited Wamba's youngest brother, Saleem, he was working
weekends at a McDonald's in Orlando to save money for a trip back
home. He was unenthusiastic about America, brightening only when I
asked what he would do if Kabila ever fell from power and he could
live in Kinshasa.
 &HT;    He said he would definitely go, ``at least for a while.'' But in
the same breath, he admitted that he doesn't ``know squat about
Congo,'' and worries about ever being expected to follow in his
father's footsteps.
 &HT;    ``In Africa,'' he said, ``politics is like someone with multiple
personalities _ it's dangerous, and it changes without warning.''
 &HT;    The middle brother, Kolo, worries about those expectations too.
Now he spends nearly all his waking hours in a basement
astrophysics lab at Stanford. ``There's no physics in Africa,'' one
colleague bluntly told him. Nevertheless, he says he hopes he will
ultimately end up in Africa, maybe in Congo.
 &HT;    As to whether any of them will get involved with politics, Kolo
agreed that with Saleem, who said, ``Of all of us, Philippe looks
like the one who's drifting in that direction.''
 &HT;    After a week of trying, I finally reached Philippe Wamba's
father. Ernest Wamba dia Wamba spoke via his unreliable satellite
phone from a hotel room in Pretoria, where he had traveled to watch
Nelson Mandela pass the torch to a new South African president.
 &HT;    His voice sounded gravelly and tired. Kabila's reign has not
resulted in the kind of changes Wamba dia Wamba and others hoped
for. But this new rebellion had splintered, with one major armed
faction (backed by Rwanda) claiming that Wamba dia Wamba was no
longer its leader. Soon there were three competing groups.
 &HT;    Wamba dia Wamba was calling for a negotiated political
settlement since last summer, but others sought a purely military
victory. Just as his sons had warned me, he seemed deeply
distracted.
 &HT;    But on the subject of his American education as a preparation
for life in African politics, he was quite animated: ``To put it
simply,'' he said, ``I was not radicalized about Africa until I
came to the United States. It is strange, but I became much more
aware of what was going on in Congo in the United States than I had
ever been in Congo.''
 &HT;    About Philippe, he answered my questions indirectly, with a
story. ``When he was in secondary school, I asked him, 'What do you
want to be when you grow up?' And he said, 'secretary-general of
the U.N.''' Wamba dia Wamba pauses and begins to laugh. ``This
child was so young!''
 &HT;    I once asked Philippe Wamba what he saw himself doing if he were
to join his father in Congo. He stressed that it was a subject he
did not want to get into, but he did anyway.
 &HT;    ``If he were doing something I didn't believe in politically it
would be different,'' he said. ``But there's no contradiction, and
I do somehow want to be involved in whatever way I can.''

 By RANDY KENNEDY  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's a familiar, if not typical, situation: a young man living
dirt cheap so he can pay back the costs of a top-flight college
education _ Harvard, magna cum laude; Columbia graduate school,
with honors.
 &HT;    But a simple phone call to the New York City railroad apartment
of Philippe Wamba can blur this snapshot beyond recognition.
 &HT;    Sometimes the call is from a friend who warns him that his
father is, once again, in the sights of an assassination plot. Or
it's his mother assuring him that his father is OK. Or it's
reporters wanting to know what he has heard.
 &HT;    When the phone rings this afternoon, there's just a click on the
other end and then static. ``That was probably my dad,'' he says.
``A lot of times he calls, and it doesn't go through.''
 &HT;    This is because Dad, Prof. Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, is calling
from an unreliable satellite phone in sub-Saharan Africa, where he
leads a rebel faction in the Democratic Republic of Congo _ a lush,
resource-rich country a quarter the size of the United States _
seeking to overthrow a government that itself came to power through
rebellion in 1997, when the nation was known as Zaire.
 &HT;    Wamba is a tall 28-year-old who has inherited his father's
steam-shovel jaw and almost monastically serious demeanor. He has
also inherited from him something much more important.
 &HT;    Both men are examples of a quiet phenomenon and one that has
been steadily growing for years: American higher education's role
as a kind of finishing school for the foreign elite _ many of whom
return home to become leaders in politics, business, diplomacy, the
military, even in armed insurrection.
 &HT;    For the last several years, Philippe Wamba has spent a lot of
time trying to measure the effects of this unusual export system.
In a memoir he has written that will be published by Dutton in
September '99, ``Kinship: A Family's Journey in Africa and
America,'' the difficult conclusion he draws is that living in two
worlds often means belonging to neither.
 &HT;    ``African-Americans,'' Wamba writes, ``usually saw me as an
African, and though I didn't often admit it, many Africans, both at
Harvard and at home in Tanzania, considered me an American, or at
best an inauthentic hybrid.''
 &HT;    The memoir describes a complex sort of double alienation, or
what Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard professor and one of
Wamba's mentors calls a kind of ``'Black Boy,' squared,'' referring
to Richard Wright's famous memoir.
 &HT;    So where does a young man like Wamba go from here? How long can
he carry on with day-to-day life in America before the pull of
life-and-death politics back home becomes too strong?
 &HT;    There are constant reminders of how stark that choice will be.
One day not long ago, for example, Wamba and one of his brothers
tried to call their father. But he couldn't talk: He was busy with
rifle training. Wamba dia Wamba had no military experience before
trading in the title of history professor for that of rebel leader;
his military advisers decided it would be good for the professor to
learn to use a Kalashnikov.
 &HT;    ``He told me,'' Wamba says, ``that he had hit seven out of nine
bull's-eyes.''
 &HT;    The lives of Wamba and his two younger brothers, Kolo and
Saleem, can be divided fairly neatly into two parts: before and
after Dec. 19, 1981, the sweltering day that made their family
different from others they knew.
 &HT;    All three were born in the United States _ their Congolese
father married an American woman he had met in the French club
while attending Western Michigan University, in Kalamazoo, and he
taught at American universities for several years. But the brothers
grew up mostly in Dar es Salaam, on Tanzania's coast.
 &HT;    Their father's political writings, harshly critical of Congo's
enduring dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, made it too dangerous for them
to live in his native country.
 &HT;    But in 1981, Wamba dia Wamba (his sons have adopted a shortened
version of his last name) attempted a brief, dangerous trip back
into Zaire to visit family and friends. He sneaked into Kinshasa,
the capital, and sent for his wife and sons. That December day, the
Wamba brothers stepped off the plane looking forward to an
emotional first homecoming to their true African heritage.
 &HT;    What they got instead was a welcoming committee of armed Zairean
soldiers, who told them their father had been arrested.
 &HT;    The brothers tell slightly different versions _ kind of family
Gospels _ of the nightmarish weeks that followed. Philippe, 10 at
the time, remembers frantically scanning crowds for familiar faces.
 &HT;    Kolo, a Columbia University graduate who is now a doctoral
physics student at Stanford, was 7 and recalls coping through
denial. Saleem, a sophomore at the University of Central Florida,
in Orlando, was just 4 then and retains the stark child's
impressions of the runway, the brightly lighted airport, the clutch
of discordantly smiling officials.
 &HT;    ``They were all nice _ but in the way a villain in a movie is
nice,'' he says.
 &HT;    Their father was held in a notorious prison, where he was
interrogated about his anti-Mobutu writings, beaten with a buckled
belt and given little to eat. It took five weeks of international
pressure to secure his release.
 &HT;    For Philippe, it was a turning point. ``Africa was not a
mystical, magical and beautiful place as I had thought,'' he writes
in ``Kinship.'' ``Instead it was a place inhabited by evil and
dangerous men _ black men at that _ who had imprisoned and beaten
my father. ... My naive romance with Africa was over.''
 &HT;    In Dar es Salaam, when the boys were growing up, there was a
love in the city of American culture. Whenever they visited
relatives in the States they were expected to return with essential
staples of 1980s African-American teen-age culture: parachute
pants, high tops _ and anything that had anything to do with
Michael Jackson.
 &HT;    African-American hip-hop fans began to wear leather Africa
medallions, Philippe writes in his memoir, and so the medallions
also caught on among African youth, ``in an attempt to emulate
African-Americans celebrating Africa.''
 &HT;    Though each Wamba brother has held onto his United States
citizenship, all three _ and especially Philippe _ were ambivalent
about following their father's lead and leaving Africa to get an
American education.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, at age 16, Philippe won a scholarship to the Armand
Hammer United World College outside Las Vegas, N.M., the American
campus of a slightly loopy, utopian school system that prepares
foreign students for something bigger than college _ to be good
foreign ministers.
 &HT;    If it seems strange to think you could run into a Congolese
rebel leader or his son at your college reunion, consider this:
Another leader of Wamba dia Wamba's rebel group is a Stanford
alumnus whose son now attends Berkeley. To the north, a rebel
commander in Sudan's perpetual civil war earned his doctorate in
agricultural economics from Iowa State.
 &HT;    As of last year, there were 481,280 foreign students in colleges
in the States, the highest number ever. In the mid-1970s, there
were less than half as many. Only a fraction of these students ever
rise to prominence, of course, but there are dozens of marquee
examples: Benjamin Netanyahu (MIT); Kofi Annan of Ghana (Macalester
College, in St. Paul); King Abdullah II of Jordan (Deerfield
Academy, Georgetown University), and, more recently, the son of Hun
Sen, the Khmer Rouge soldier who became prime minister of Cambodia
by way of a coup (West Point).
 &HT;    At Harvard, dozens of Wamba's wealthy foreign classmates lived a
college experience most students wouldn't recognize _ many had
bodyguards, drivers and hotel suites instead of dorm rooms. They
existed in a version of what ambassadors' children call the
diplomatic bubble. Students like the daughter of Moshood K.O.
Abiola, the late Nigerian magnate and opposition leader, were
ducking into limousines after their Harvard classes.
 &HT;    Wamba, though, lived in the dorm and relied mostly on
scholarships and loans. His father's teaching career was never
lucrative, and his mother, Elaine, remains a moderately paid French
instructor in Tanzania. He scrubbed bathrooms and policed the
campus video-game arcade to make money. ``I had a bike,'' he adds.
 &HT;    Once, a fellow student asked whether, as an African, he was used
to wearing clothes. (``They gave me these at the airport,'' Wamba
replied dryly.) He was also surprised to find that even as they
celebrate the ideological concept of Africa, some African-Americans
seemed to find actual Africans ``too white.''
 &HT;    He observes: ``African-Americans often look to Africa with an
unrealistic sense of romanticism. And Africans often look over here
with those same exaggerated expectations.''
 &HT;    Wamba speaks distantly about his father's dangerous life. In the
next breath, however, he can become furious _ for example, over how
an episode of ``Lateline,'' an NBC sitcom that spoofed network
news, used his father's name in a story about a fictional African
coup.
 &HT;    ``I suppose they picked it because they think Wamba dia Wamba
just sounds like a funny African name,'' he says indignantly. He
stews for a moment. ``It was sort of ironic,'' he concludes. ``I've
never heard Peter Jennings say my dad's name, but it shows up on a
sitcom.''
 &HT;    Not long ago, Wamba visited an American cousin in Boston, and at
a Cambridge bar they bumped into a friendly guy who turned out to
be Congolese. Wamba was pleased to share a beer with someone from
the ``homeland.''
 &HT;    As it always does with expat Africans, the talk turned to
politics. Wamba dia Wamba's rebel group was then mounting a serious
challenge to the new regime of Laurent Kabila. Though Kabila's
autocratic style had made him unpopular, few Congolese wanted

 By ERIK ECKHOLM  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In 1992, a retired book editor named Zhu Zheng read a short
essay a friend of his had written about the Anti-Rightist Campaign
of 1957. That year, more than half a million people were purged
after they responded to Mao Zedong's invitation to criticize the
revolution, only to find themselves branded enemies.
 &HT;    For Zhu, the topic had special resonance. As an idealistic young
journalist in the southern city of Changsha in 1957, he was labeled
``a poisonous weed'' and spent several years breaking rocks in a
labor camp. Upon reading his friend's words, Zhu recalls, he was
consumed by the need to tell the story in detail.
 &HT;    Like many who lived through it, Zhu, now 68, sees the 1957
campaign as a terrible turning point, inaugurating a series of
disastrous upheavals that ended only with Mao's death, in 1976.
 &HT;    So in 1993, in one frantic year, Zhu _ who skipped college out
of revolutionary zeal and describes himself as ``a minor
intellectual'' _ scoured the records and newspapers of the period,
interviewed everyone who would talk and scrawled out a book
manuscript, ``The Summer of 1957.''
 &HT;    Then began the quest to get his book printed. Eventually, the
Henan People's Press expressed interest. But in keeping with the
rules for accounts of Communist Party history, the publisher first
sent the manuscript to the chief guardians of the printed word at
the News and Publishing Office, under the central Department of
Propaganda, in Beijing.
 &HT;    The response came in an April 1996 memo, written by three
scholars at the party's History Research Office, to which the
manuscript had been referred. ``Generally, this book is rich in
sources and supports its account with evidence,'' their memo said,
adding, with patronizing politeness, that ``the author's attitude
is serious and rigorous.''
 &HT;    But noting that it covered ``a rather complex'' subject, the
memo _ its daggers cloaked in typically banal Communist prose _
went on to say that ``particular care must be given to adopt an
analytic attitude of seeking truth from facts.'' Specifically, it
said that the manuscript ``still needs to accurately reflect the
spirit of the 1981 resolution on history that the Anti-Rightist
struggle was a necessary one.'' This was a reference to a key
document that for nearly two decades has set the boundaries for
scholarship on the Mao era.
 &HT;    The censors' memo to Zhu demanded excision of quotes from Mao
that had been circulated at the time but later omitted from his
published works as embarrassing. It noted sections where ``the
reasoning and analysis are not proper.'' It barred the naming of so
many persecutors, ``especially influential and well-known
figures,'' and exhorted Zhu to adopt the spirit of ``uniting as one
to look to the future.''
 &HT;    On Oct. 1, China will mark 50 years since Mao proclaimed the
People's Republic before cheering throngs in Tiananmen Square. In
the best Communist fashion, betraying a mix of pride and
insecurity, China is going all out, giving Beijing a virtual
makeover in preparation.
 &HT;    The big day will feature a minutely orchestrated parade of
140,000 _ everything from Young Pioneers in red bandannas to
China's latest ballistic missiles. The marchers will pass under the
giant painting of Mao that perennially hangs over Tiananmen, facing
toward the mausoleum where the Great Helmsman's embalmed body is
displayed.
 &HT;    The group of men who now rule China will celebrate the triumphs
of the Communist revolution and the inevitable glories ahead. But
they are sure to skate over the past. For an unflinching look at
the half-century of Communist Party rule is the last thing the
leaders want. Confession may be good for the soul, but making a
clean breast of prior calamities can be dangerous for a dictatorial
government.
 &HT;    China's current leaders, including President Jiang Zemin,
watched in horror as the Soviet Communist Party collapsed _ and
they are convinced that Mikhail Gorbachev's decision in 1987 to
allow candid probing of Soviet history helped speed its downfall.
And their harsh crackdown on Falun Gong, the spiritual movement
that staged an illegal protest earlier this year, is further
testimony to their insecurity.
 &HT;    China's problem is epitomized by that giant portrait hovering
over the square in the center of Beijing. Mao is the undisputed
founding father of the revolution and remains a key source of the
party's claims to legitimacy. Yet he was also the source of bizarre
and sometimes murderous campaigns that crippled China's
development.
 &HT;    In addition to the Anti-Rightist Campaign, these included the
economically idiotic Great Leap Forward, in the late 1950s, which
caused the famine deaths of tens of millions, and the Cultural
Revolution, a reign of terror stretching from 1966 to Mao's death,
in 1976.
 &HT;    Deng Xiaoping, who created today's more open and vibrant China,
was the first leader to wrestle with the Mao problem. As he gained
power in the years after Mao's death, Deng was intent on preserving
stability while reviving the economy through market reforms.
 &HT;    But even as he pointed China on the capitalist road, he knew he
could not afford to repudiate a Communist legacy that was, after
all, his own foundation for power. Least of all could he take down
that big portrait in Tiananmen Square. So he presided over an
artful revision of official history.
 &HT;    ``It is better to write in broad outline and not go into too
much detail,'' Deng said in a 1981 speech, as the new guidelines
were being prepared. ``The purpose of summing up the past is to
encourage people to close ranks and look to the future.'' Deng had
a personal reason for stifling the truth as well: He had been a
chief enforcer of the Anti-Rightist Campaign.
 &HT;    To an astonishing degree, Chinese historical scholarship,
journalism and public speech must still adhere to that 1981
document, the ``Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of
Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China.''
 &HT;    Since he could not afford to jettison the Communist legacy, he
set out to explain the most glaringly disastrous events as
aberrations. The resulting 1981 document is almost surreal in its
efforts to parcel out blame without tarnishing Mao too badly, or
Deng himself.
 &HT;    Mao, it says, was a gross violator of his own thought. The
Cultural Revolution is unambiguously described as wrong, led by Mao
under the mistaken notion that ``capitalist roaders'' had taken
over the party and that ``continuous revolution'' was needed. But
these ``erroneous theses,'' the document says, ``were obviously
inconsistent with the system of Mao Zedong Thought.''
 &HT;    The resolution says that the purges of 1957 were definitely
needed, arguing that some ``rightists'' were out to destroy
socialism, but acknowledges that the purges got out of hand,
harming many innocent people. The Great Leap Forward, with its
forced communal farming and backyard iron smelters, ``overlooked
objective economic laws'' because Mao was ``impatient for quick
results.''
 &HT;    In its overall assessment of Mao, the document describes him as
``a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist
and theorist.'' In a conclusion that is still parroted by Chinese
officials, it declares, ``If we judge his activities as a whole,
his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his
mistakes.''
 &HT;    Deng's guidelines have never been updated _ the issues are just
too hot to reopen. So for more recent events, such as the killing
of hundreds in 1989 as the army crushed the student democracy
movement, the government has simply used censorship and arrests.
Everyone instinctively knows the limits.
 &HT;    Today, trying to control history would seem futile. Yes, China's
newspapers and radio and television, virtually without exception,
still stick blandly to the official line. But many Chinese lived
through the disasters and know that the past has been airbrushed.
And now, with the Internet and with so many Chinese studying
abroad, many scholars are also familiar with the devastating
accounts published in the West.
 &HT;    What's more, profit-seeking Chinese publishers are responding to
a clear public yearning with a stream of memoirs, often by retired
party officials, that are loaded with damning facts. These often
wriggle past the censors by avoiding generalizations about national
policy and being careful not to assign blame to particular leaders.
 &HT;    Except in obviously touchy cases, such as Zhu's manuscript on
the 1957 campaign, publishers themselves decide whether a work
needs prior party review. Mostly, writers and editors do their own
tinkering, then publish and pray for enough buzz to stimulate sales
but not attract trouble.
 &HT;    So why do the party leaders still bother? The truth is, that at
this ripe stage in the life cycle of Communist rule, no one really
expects people to believe the canned history or the related, often
vacuous language of political speech.
 &HT;    ``The leaders don't have to believe it themselves,'' Zhu says.
``But they have to make everybody else say they believe it.
Everybody is acting in a play.'' So long as most people agree to
keep acting _ and most do, usually because they see no plausible
alternative for China right now _ the Communist show can go on.
 &HT;    In the end, Zhu had to cut more than 10 percent of the material
in his book, which was finally published in 1998 in a respectable
printing of 30,000 that is mostly sold out.
 &HT;    He went on to write his autobiography, which he called ``A Minor
Scholar in Major Times.'' It is a memoir of betrayed hopes and an
almost comical train of misfortunes through Mao's campaigns, with
homage to the sheer creativity of the persecutors. And because the
manuscript was not a direct analysis of Communist history it was
published this year without prior vetting, by the prestigious
Peking University Press.
 &HT;    Making use of new materials made available in recent years, even
some party scholars have published more revelatory accounts of
events such as the Cultural Revolution. Still, because they cross
that line drawn in 1981, a number of major manuscripts covering the
Mao period languish in office drawers or are passed around,
samizdat-style, among like-minded scholars.
 &HT;    At a formal level, the Communist Party is producing a major new
official history of the revolution. A first fat volume covering the
period from the party's founding in 1921 to its victory in 1949
appeared in the early 1990s.
 &HT;    The second volume, covering the tortured years up to 1978, is
expected by the end of this year. It would be a mistake, however,
to anticipate any major reappraisals of Mao or his destructive
campaigns. A chief editor of Volume 2 just happens to be one of
those three party historians who, back in 1996, so politely
censored Zhu Zheng's manuscript.

WORLD WAR II, SEMINAL EVENT OF THE CENTURY, TAUGHT A VITAL LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 12)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the evil forces of fascism swept through one
European country after another in 1940, a young John F. Kennedy
contemplated the weakness of democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it competes with a system of government which cares
nothing for permanency, a system built primarily for war,
democracy, which is built primarily for peace, is at a
disadvantage,'' Kennedy wrote in a book extrapolated from his
Harvard honors thesis.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, ``Why England Slept,'' he sought to explain why a
great democracy, with an empire stretching around the globe, buried
its head, ostrich-fashion, while Germany's Adolf Hitler and his
fellow malefactor, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, gobbled up
other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Little did Kennedy, then just 23 years old, realize that one day
he would be president of the United States and have to cope with
democracy's weaknesses as he confronted a belligerent,
nuclear-armed Soviet Union in Cuba, Berlin and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   As a student and the son of Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, who
was emerging as a pillar of American isolationism, he had lived
briefly in England. But his views were at odds with those of his
father.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy recognized the need for America to play a major
role in Europe once the war was over and to maintain an ``armed
guard that will wake up when the fire first starts or, better yet,
one that will not permit a fire to start at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the young student had some question about the
survivability of democracy. He therefore admonished Americans to
``profit by the lesson of England and make our democracy work.''
</P>
<P>
   While any system of government will work when ``everything is
going well,'' he noted, ``it's the system that functions in the
clinches that survives.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he was prescient. He had no idea how long the
war would last, whether England could survive the nightly air
assault of German bombers or that the United States eventually
would be drawn into the conflict. He did, however, recognize that
the world was undergoing a monumental transition that would change
life as he and millions of others had known it.
</P>
<P>
   An old way of life was yielding to a new, as yet uncharted, way
of life.
</P>
<P>
   In a century that has witnessed great achievements and
horrendous tragedies, no event has had a more far-reaching impact
on the world than the war that began 60 years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   As dawn broke over Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, German tanks and
troops blasted their way across its borders, and German planes
peppered the landscape with bombs.
</P>
<P>
   England and France, which until then had appeased Hitler,
decided they no longer could slumber in silence while the vicious
dictator conquered lands occupied by peaceful peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler, after he had subdued much of Czechoslovakia in 1938,
told British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Premier
Edouard Daladier that that was ``the last territorial claim I have
to make in Europe.'' But he lied. One year later, when he invaded
Poland, England and France declared war on Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after that, Mussolini, who had subdued Ethiopia and
was about to invade Greece and British Somaliland, declared war on
England and France.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, imperial Japan had invaded Manchuria and was seeking
to control China. The Soviet Union moved its troops into eastern
Poland while Germany took control of western Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the war raged across Europe and North Africa. It eventually
spread around most of the globe, ushered in the Atomic Age and set
the stage for a 40-year Cold War that ultimately would end with the
downfall of communism and the rise of the United States as the
world's single super power.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1941 Japanese attack on America's fleet at Pearl
Harbor, the deadly conflict engaged the United States and enveloped
large sections of Asia and the islands of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier, especially when the war began in 1939 and even when
Pearl Harbor was bombed, America was deeply divided between
isolationists and interventionists. Had it not been for Franklin D.
Roosevelt's leadership in providing arms to England and other
allies, including the Soviet Union, and in building America's own
arsenal, the United States, like England, would have been asleep
when Japan propelled it into war.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, its men went off to war, its women went into war
production plants, and Americans as a whole proved they had the
character and courage to face any adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Lives of people everywhere have been changed in the 20th century
by the automobile, the airplane, radio, television, computers,
atomic power, dramatic breakthroughs in medical research, motion
pictures and other great discoveries and inventions.
</P>
<P>
   But World War II was the seminal event of a century crowded with
momentous happenings.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 20, 1945, less than three months before his death,
Roosevelt defined one of the most enduring lessons of World War II.
Taking the presidential oath for the fourth time, the ailing FDR
declared: ``We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace;
that our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of other
nations far away. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned to be citizens of the world, members of the
human community. We have learned the simple truth, as Emerson said,
that `the only way to have a friend is to be one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Americans have learned that lesson. But fortunately
every president, Democrat or Republican, since FDR has understood
that America cannot survive as an island isolated from the rest of
the world.

STUDENT, 13, ACCUSED OF USING STUN GUN ON PEER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An eighth-grader who allegedly used a stun gun
on another San Francisco middle school students faces possible
felony charges and expulsion from school.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred in a crowded hallway at Hoover Middle
School just before lunch Tuesday as students were leaving gym
class, the authorities said. The eighth-grader, 13, apparently
grabbed a sixth-grade student and shocked the victim on the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. David Oberhoffer said the boy then either dropped the
stun gun or handed it to a friend who didn't know what had
happened, and walked out to the playground.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, 11, and a group of students who witnessed the attack
immediately reported the incident to the principal, who summoned
paramedics, said school district spokeswoman Elaine Koury. The
paramedics found the victim to be fine, except for two welts on his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-grader, who was later arrested, was taken to the
Youth Guidance Center and faces charges of assault with a deadly
weapon and possession of a stun gun on school grounds, both
felonies.
</P>
<P>
   He also was suspended from school and the district has
instituted proceedings to expel him. It is against state law to
take a stun gun or any other kind of weapon onto a school campus.
</P>
<P>
   Koury said she wasn't certain what prompted the attack. The two
boys weren't fighting, and may not even have known each other, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like you have something new, you try it out,''
she said. ``It sounds like it was the case of a 13-year-old boy
using very poor judgment, which is part of being 13.''

a landscape or change a house: a force of nature, or people.
Dorothy Cullman is a bit of both. ``I love change,'' said Mrs.
Cullman, 75, with visceral relish, as though she were describing
her favorite food, the kind you have to dig out of a shell. She was
sitting on her new porch in Sag Harbor, N.Y., relaxed but by no
means retired after the year of renovations that created the home _
her third. By William L. Hamilton.

using www37.com, the card catalogue of the web (or any search
engine will do). I spoke with consumers who had shopped at many of
the sites, and questioned sales people as if I were a potential
buyer. Generally, salespeople were well-informed and personable
and, most important, low-key. There was no pressure to buy; in
fact, many, collegially, shared information with me about other
sites where they had shopped. By Timothy Jack Ward.

STUDY SEES LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT CHARTER, MAGNET SCHOOLS WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One in four children has left the neighborhood
school in favor of a magnet, charter or voucher program, despite
lax oversight and scant evidence of academic success, according to
a two-year study released Wednesday by an academic think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE) study,
``Abundant Hopes, Scarce Evidence of Results,'' concludes that
alternatives to traditional schools are wildly popular but
unproven.
</P>
<P>
   The national report analyzed research on the effectiveness of
magnet, charter and private schools, voucher programs and open
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tidal wave of support for the school-choice
movement,'' said the co-author of the report, Luis Huerta. ``But, I
was surprised and distressed by the scarcity of hard evidence
backing advocates' claims that school choice boosts achievement and
pressures public schools to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   School choice, an umbrella term that encompasses home schooling,
charter schools and public and private scholarships, has become a
rallying call in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of children _ some 7 million nationwide _ opt
out of their neighborhood public school, an increase from 11
percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In California, nearly 500,000 students _ 9 percent of the
state's enrollment _ attend alternative schools. Ten percent attend
private schools, a number unchanged since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice movement is blossoming largely in the dark _ for
the most part ignoring the lessons gained from past educational
successes and failures, and proceeding without a clear research
agenda to evaluate the effectiveness of new incarnations,'' Huerta
said.
</P>
<P>
   PACE is a think tank run by the University of California at
Berkeley and Stanford University. Among the key findings of the
study:
</P>
<P>
   _ Magnet schools, created in the 1970s in response to districts
roiled by mandatory integration, are credited with keeping white
families in urban districts. Magnet programs offer a particular
focus, such as technology or performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   Results, however, are mixed: Test scores from magnet programs in
San Antonio and St. Louis went up, while scores in a New York
program declined.
</P>
<P>
   _ Open enrollment means parents opt out of their assigned
neighborhood school and select another one either within or outside
their district. The research shows no significant gains
attributable solely to open enrollment. In a 1997 study of open
enrollment in California, 70 percent of districts reported no
change in student achievement, while 13 percent reported
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charter schools, which originated in Minnesota in 1991, are
publicly funded and largely free of state regulations and union
contracts. Such schools attract better-educated, more affluent
parents, raising questions about what happens to children left in
failing public schools. While the study found no proof that charter
schools boost achievement _ no study has tracked children for more
than a year _ or provide competitive incentive for faltering public
schools to improve, there is a higher level of parental
satisfaction and involvement with charter schools than public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vouchers and private scholarships, first proposed by Nobel
Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman in the mid-1950s, provide
public or private money for children who enroll in a private
school.
</P>
<P>
   Initial findings suggest that poor children in Milwaukee and New
York City who remain in voucher programs over a few years do
somewhat better in math but not in reading, compared with similar
students in neighborhood schools.
</P>
<P>
   But, because these students come from families that took the
initiative to move their children, it's difficult to know whether
the results are attributable to a motivated home environment or the
voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   ``From breakfast cereals to SUVs, consumers demand choices in a
democratic society,'' said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at
UC-Berkeley and the director of PACE. ``But as market dynamics are
used to energize school reform, we have yet to see solid evidence
of achievement gains.''

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For advocates of school choice, however, the dismal record of
some public schools is reason enough to create an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper, who lost faith in
California's public education, is crafting a school choice
initiative to go before voters in November. The initiative will
offer $4,000 in taxpayer money to parents who want to remove their
children from public school and enroll them in private or parochial
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer that if people are given a choice, then
both types of schools will improve,'' Draper said. ``Right now,
there's no competitor to the public model.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical of the PACE report, Draper said: ``Researchers often
shape policy to make a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly not enough choice now,'' he said. ``If
you're a child stuck in a failing school, whether in San Francisco
or Oakland, you really don't have a way out. This choice initiative
will give parents a way out and it will cause other schools to
improve.''

LEVI STRAUSS ENLISTS A MAN WITH MARKETING MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The appointment of PepsiCo Inc. executive Philip
Marineau to lead the closely held Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. brings an
outsider with marketing muscle to the 149-year-old jeans
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Levi's former president, Peter Jacobi,
wanted to happen when he announced his resignation eight months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for the company. They seemed to get somebody who
had the right credentials for the position,'' said Jacobi, who was
not involved in the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly they brought him in because of his marketing skill and
brand-development experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Marineau _ the head of PepsiCo's PepsiCola
North America unit _ to president and chief executive marks only
the second time San Francisco-based Levi Strauss has picked a
non-family member to run the company. In the first case, Robert
Grohman ran Levi Strauss from 1981 to 1984, but he had come up
through the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi, 55, said he also thought it would be healthier for the
company to select a chief executive from outside the apparel
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like he's the perfect guy for what the company was
looking for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel consultants say Levi's selection of an outside means the
jeans maker is serious about turning around its image.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an open acknowledgment on the part of the current
management that they've run out of ideas,'' said Kurt Barnard,
president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J.
``He is an outsider and is not encumbered and encrusted with years
of old ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnard said Marineau needs to resuscitate the Levi brand, which
has been taking a beating from Old Navy, the Gap and Abercrombie &AMP;
Fitch, as well as trendy jeans such as LEI and Mudd.
</P>
<P>
   The key, according to Levi watchers, is Marineau's marketing
background. He is widely credited with helping Pepsi appeal to a
broader audience as well as introducing the Pepsi One brand during
his 20-month tenure as president of the North American beverage
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Marineau is essentially a marketing professional. As a
marketing professional, it should not make too much a difference
whether the product is a pair of jeans or a glass of Pepsi,''
Barnard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he can refocus the brand image. That's what he's best
at,'' said Harry Bernard, a partner of San Francisco strategic
marketing firm Colton Bernard Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernard was less sure of Marineau's ability to buck the
mentality of what he calls the ``old masters of the 501,'' or some
of the longtime Levi executives still with the company. ``Will he
bring the culture up to his level or will he become engulfed by
that culture?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Marineau, 52, steps in as head of Levi Strauss on Sept. 27,
he will arrive at one of the toughest times in the company's recent
history. Sales last year dropped 13 percent to $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Levi laid off about 7,000 employees, and this year
announced plans to cut 30 percent more of its work force by closing
plants. Much of the company's troubles are blamed on its products'
loss of popularity, especially Levi's trademark five-pocket jeans,
as well as on increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau also takes the Levi role at a time when he had been
considered the front-runner to succeed Pepsi chairman Roger Enrico.
Steven Reinemund, who on Tuesday was named Pepsi's chief operating
officer, is now considered the likely successor.

CAN'T MEDIA GIVE CAPRIATI SOME PEACE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The media made Jennifer Capriati cry the other day. They must be
so proud of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati is a 23-year-old professional tennis player who is
attempting to recapture the tennis brilliance of her childhood and
also trying to live down the personal mistakes she made as a
rebellious teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   The media have set the ground rules: Capriati can create
whatever future her talent will allow on the tennis court _ but her
past belongs to them.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statute of limitations on youthful indiscretions in
this country, no deferred adjudication program by which a public
person can have some early lapse of judgment erased from his record
and declared off limits to continued media scrutiny. An adolescent
ax-killer can have his juvenile court record sealed and stashed
away forever, but a teen-age tennis phenom's legal and social
misdemeanors are fair game forever.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati was an international tennis star before she was old
enough to drive, and the pressure evidently took its toll. Before
she was old enough to vote, her career was on the skids.
</P>
<P>
   Before she managed to pull herself together and begin the
comeback that carried her all the way to the fourth round of the
1999 U.S. Open, Capriati would be cited for shoplifting and
arrested for marijuana possession as she explored ``a darker side
of my confusion in a confusing world.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``darker side'' quote was part of a statement that Capriati
read to the media after her Labor Day loss to fellow former phenom
Monica Seles. The gist of the statement was that she didn't want to
talk about her messed-up teenhood anymore and wished that the media
would stop asking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Dream on, Jennifer.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati will move on when the media say she can move on _ and
not one minute, one month or one millennium sooner. According to a
column in Monday's New York Times, reporters are still asking the
questions because they are not satisfied with Capriati's answers.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati's failure, it seems, is that she has not been
sufficiently forthcoming, sufficiently confessional, sufficiently
apologetic or sufficiently evangelistic in warning others to avoid
the mistakes she made.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound familiar? Sure it does; it's the same malarkey
we've been hearing about presidential front-runner George W. Bush
and allegations that he used illegal drugs many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The media's obsession with long-ago stupidities is annoying
enough in the case of a man who wants to be president of the United
States. But Jennifer Capriati is a tennis player, for heaven's
sake.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati isn't asking citizens of the world's lone remaining
superpower to put her in charge the nation's nuclear arsenal. She's
asking sportswriters to let her work on her backhand without
constantly rehashing the day she walked away from a mall jewelry
booth with a $15 ring she hadn't paid for. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And guess what. Tennis fans don't want to hear about that stuff.
What the fans want to know is how fast Capriati's serves zoom
across the net and whether she's physically fit enough to compete
with the uncommonly athletic women who make their living playing
tennis nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Such are questions that Capriati must answer _ but she must
answer them on the tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   The other questions, the ones that surface in media interviews
and post-match news conferences, are questions that Capriati
needn't answer until and unless she wants to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Where in the world did the media get the idea that they are
entitled to decide what a public person must discuss about his
private life and when he must discuss it? What provision of the
Constitution confers upon the media the authority to establish a
universal standard for self-revelation that must be adhered to by
anyone who dares to step into the public arena?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, most of us have had it up to here with celebrities
confessing their sins, with public figures blabbing their deepest
secrets and innermost feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who stands up and says, ``I refuse to talk about it''
deserves our undying gratitude.

   A ceiling fan can help keep a room cooler in the summer and
warmer in the winter. It uses less power than an air-conditioner,
so it can help keep electrical bills down.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging a fan is not especially difficult, but care should be
taken to situate it where it will do the most good. Ideally, the
fan should be in the center of the ceiling. If this is not
possible, then it should be far enough from the wall so that the
tips of the fan blades will have 24 inches of clearance. If the fan
is closer then this, it will produce noisy air turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   The fan must also be high enough so the spinning blades will not
hit anyone standing in the room. You will need at least seven feet
of space between the bottom of the fan and the floor for this. If
you have a ceiling light fixture, you can remove it and replace it
with the fan; then you can connect the fan to the existing electric
circuit. Otherwise you will have to run a special circuit to power
the fan.
</P>
<P>
   The first step when doing any electrical work is to turn off the
power to the circuit. First, remove the appropriate fuse or flip
the correct breaker at the service panel. After that, you can
remove the ceiling fixture. Some ceiling lights are held in place
with a lock nut that screws onto a central nipple in the junction
box. When you unscrew the lock nut, the fixture will drop down.
Other fixtures may be held in place with two bolts that screw onto
a hanger strap across the junction box. These fixtures can be
removed by unscrewing the bolts.
</P>
<P>
   The fixture will still be attached to the electrical wires
coming through the junction box. Take care when disconnecting
these, because there is a remote possibility that you flipped the
wrong breaker and the circuit is still hot. Unscrew the solderless
connectors, being careful not to touch the bare wires, then probe
the wires with a circuit tester to make sure the power is indeed
off. Now you can disconnect the wires and remove the fixture.
</P>
<P>
   You are now ready to mount the fan. All manufacturers provide
hardware to hang their fans, and while the assemblies may differ
from manufacturer to manufacturer, they are all variations of three
methods. One type uses lag bolts, a J-hook or a ball-and-socket
hanger to attach the fan directly to a framing member like a
ceiling joist. Another uses a special hanger (one model is called
``fan brace'') that expands between ceiling joists. With the third
method, the fan hanger is attached directly to the junction box.
</P>
<P>
   Attaching the fan directly to a framing member can offer a safe
and stable arrangement provided the framing member is secure.
Mounting the fan on an unstable wooden cross brace between the
joists can lead to problems. Before attaching the mounting bracket
to any cross brace, check to make sure the brace is firmly nailed
to both joists. There should be no play when you attempt to wiggle
or twist it.
</P>
<P>
   It is better to drive the mounting screw directly into a joist.
However, it must be positioned in the center of the joist. An easy
way to find the center is by first locating the joist, then
drilling a series of small holes in a straight line until you
locate the sides of the joist then position the screw in between.
Don't worry about the holes; they will be covered later by the fan
canopy.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a suitable cross brace or if the joists are
not centered in the room, you can use an expansion brace to hold
the fan. Open the brace until it spans the gap between the joists _
that's approximately 14 1/2 inches _ then place it between the
joists. You may be able to do this from above in the attic, or you
can reach through the ceiling hole where the junction box was
positioned. Twisting the horizontal brace will cause it to expand
and lock firmly between the two joists.
</P>
<P>
   The third method, attaching directly to the junction box, is the
least secure method. Basically the fan mount is screwed to the
flanges, sometimes called ``ears,'' in the corners of the junction
box. Many building codes prohibit this type of attachment because
the flanges have only a few screw threads and vibrations from the
rotating fan could cause the bolts to work loose.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hanger assembly is in place, you can position the fan
and connect the electrical wires. Use wire nuts to connect the
fan's white wire to the circuit white (neutral) and the black to
the black (hot). Connect the ground wires as indicated by the
manufacturer. If you have any doubts about making the electrical
hook-up, consult an electrician.

SEGA'S DREAMCAST: A TOY, YES, BUT A PC AT HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sega's new Dreamcast video game console, which goes on sale in
the United States today, is the first of the next-generation home
game machines to arrive on these shores. As a game machine its
power is unrivaled, except by high-end personal computers costing
more than 10 times as much, and it makes the graphics on the
current market leader, the Sony Playstation, appear grainy and
jerky. The Dreamcast is the closest thing to an arcade-quality game
experience you can get at home.
</P>
<P>
   But the $199 Dreamcast is more than just a game console. Unlike
earlier generations of game machines, which were closer to toys
than to computers, the Dreamcast blurs the distinction between PC
and game console. It has a 56K modem, for example, and it comes
with software for connecting to the Internet for activities like
e-mail, Web browsing and online chatting. Oddly, it comes from the
box with Internet software but no games, which have to be purchased
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say that inexpensive, Internet-enabled game consoles
like the Dreamcast, along with its future rivals, the Sony
Playstation II and Nintendo's Project Dolphin, will become an
alternative to PC's for millions of people who want to connect to
the Internet through their television screens.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, people who are already on the Net might be alarmed by
the prospect of millions of Internet newbies whose common bond
appears to be a love of Sonic the Hedgehog (Sega's most popular
game character) and an ability to type with their thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake, however, to dismiss these new game
consoles as frivolous. While the Sega Dreamcast clearly has the
pedigree of a game machine, it has the digital genetics of a
computer. Besides the built-in modem, it has a powerful
microprocessor, fancy 3-D graphics and audio chip sets, a CD-ROM
drive that also plays audio compact disks, 26 megabytes of various
kinds of system memory, and _ surprise _ even a custom version of
the Microsoft Windows CE operating system.
</P>
<P>
   All play and no work makes the Dreamcast a very dull toy. The
presence of Windows CE makes the Dreamcast a very interesting
device because it means that thousands of software developers could
create applications for it with relative ease if the Dreamcast
gains a large enough following.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast console has four high-speed ports on the front,
and it comes with a single game controller that plugs into one of
them. Other options for these ports include extra controllers,
keyboards, steering wheels, force-feedback joysticks, microphones,
guns and fishing reels that jerk in conjunction with the action on
screen and, down the road, digital cameras and other smart devices.
</P>
<P>
   A serial port on the back can work with a printer or a storage
device like a Zip drive, although Sega would have been smarter to
include a Universal Serial Bus, or USB, port instead.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast is built around a 128-bit microprocessor. The
current market leaders for game consoles, the Sony Playstation and
the Nintendo 64, use 64-bit processors. Basically, that means the
200-MHz Dreamcast chip can process twice the information its rivals
can in any tick of the clock, enabling programmers to add
sophisticated software features like the ability to recognize and
exploit patterns in the user's playing style.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the system can learn and adapt to give the
player a greater challenge over time, which is a trait shared by
some of the newer and more advanced PC games.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, about five years ago, Sega sold more game
machines than Sony and Nintendo combined. But for a number of
reasons, few of which were technical, Sega botched the introduction
of its ill-fated Saturn system, the predecessor to Dreamcast,
allowing Sony and Nintendo to take over. Today Sega has less than a
2 percent share of the market, said Kelly Henry, an analyst with
the International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Video game players appear willing to embrace whatever system
gives them the most realistic thrills, and for the next year at
least, that will be Dreamcast. Sega said more than 250,000
Dreamcast systems had been ordered in advance of today's nationwide
rollout, and the company expects to sell 1 million systems by the
end of this year. Even so, Sega has no illusions about toppling the
market leaders. At best, the Dreamcast will keep Sega competitive
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   It is no exaggeration to say that Dreamcast is Sega's last
chance to remain competitive with Sony, Nintendo and perhaps even
Microsoft, which has been exploring the possibility of creating its
own video console machine. (Microsoft is already one of the world's
largest makers of computer games and peripheral devices for PC
games.)
</P>
<P>
   But if Sega has a year's head start on Sony and Nintendo in the
128-bit processor race, that also means that the Playstation II and
Dolphin systems will be a year more advanced in their own
technologies when they finally arrive in 2000. We already know that
the Playstation II will be backward-compatible with existing
Playstation games and that the Dolphin system will use a DVD drive,
which will make possible even better video and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Sega says its Dreamcast system is designed to take advantage of
new technologies that will be developed in the next year or two,
but that may be whistling in the dark. A year from now, Dreamcast
will be toast unless it can lock its customers into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly everything else these days, the new Sega system has
been transformed by the Internet. When attached to a phone line,
the Dreamcast console can be used as an Internet terminal. Users
can send and receive e-mail, participate in chat groups or get
game-playing tips on the Sega Dreamcast Online Gaming Network, and
browse the Web. Sega says Dreamcast users can connect through any
Internet service provider, but it lists AT&AMP;T Worldnet as its
preferred service and includes a Worldnet software disk. And AT&AMP;T
offers a special deal on a keyboard that attaches to the Dreamcast
console for virtually thumb-free typing.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Dreamcast owners will not be able to do, however, is
play games against one another over the Internet, a rather
astonishing lapse in what is otherwise an impressive system.
Already, hundreds of thousands of PC users compete against one
another over the Internet or private game networks, making online
games one of the Internet's most popular activities.
</P>
<P>
   A Sega spokesman said the company would offer online competitive
games ``within the next 12 months or so.'' Until then, Dreamcast
users can only taunt one another with e-mails and chat. There's not
much sport in that.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, however, the Dreamcast and its game-console
rivals will emerge as network information devices, ready to slug it
out with low-cost PC's, set-top boxes like Web TV, smart telephones
and other information appliances. Let the games begin.

CUP FOR CUP, THIS IS MOM'S SALAD
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While noodling through the Internet the other day (Do you
suppose Michael Dell ``noodles''? Probably not) I came upon a
recipe for Hawaiian salad.
</P>
<P>
   I have news for the Chicago Tribune, which ran the recipe. It's
five-cup salad. I know because it was a staple of my mother's since
the 1960s. And it has nothing to do with the Islands. I spent most
of my childhood in Norway.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is one of my favorites, and I hadn't made it in
years. The recipe on the Internet is credited to Rose Krautstruck
of Chicago. But I know that's wrong. It's my mother's salad.
</P>
<P>
   And the second recipe is for a Luby's Cafeterias version of a
recipe answer-request we ran a few weeks ago. It's perfect for a
potluck outdoor party.

FRESH VEGGIES REVIVE INTEREST IN COOKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There comes a time, usually once or twice a year, when I would
rather be force-fed dry, stale tofu than have to crank up the
stove.
</P>
<P>
   It is a late-summer kind of thing, generally around right now. I
just lose interest under the unrelenting heat and stumble home each
day to huddle near the air conditioner and watch baseball on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers fans know that can cause a different set of
frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Not cooking isn't a really big deal at our house. We enjoy
take-out. But after a month or so, it gets a little pricey, to say
nothing of redundant.
</P>
<P>
   This malaise, or affliction, if you will, can last interminably
unless I force myself out of the easy chair and onto the road. The
cure is a simple prescription that calls for one 30-mile drive.
</P>
<P>
   I go to the Dallas Farmers Market.
</P>
<P>
   The market, with its rows and rows of produce, hits me like a
sugar rush hits a hyper preschooler. The smells, the colors and
tastes come alive, and slowly they raise my battery levels to fully
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   I always come home energized, carrying bags of vegetables I
didn't know I needed. I can't wait to get in the kitchen. Problem
gone.
</P>
<P>
   I just got back from the market.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Forde works for Pat's Pea Pasture, a Canton produce
company that farms in East Texas. She's been at the market for
about 35 years, she says, and she has a good grasp of what's in and
what's out.
</P>
<P>
   East Texas tomatoes, for example, are on the way out, she says.
The season is getting kind of long in East Texas, and the lack of
rain has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   But over at D.L. Stubblefield's stand, there are stacks and
stacks of ripe beefsteak tomatoes from Jacksonville. They are
``slicers,'' meaning it would be criminal to do anything but cut
them into big, thick slices and serve them with just a hint of salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it would be all right to mound a little goat cheese on
top.
</P>
<P>
   The beefsteaks come four or five big juicy ones to a basket for
$3. The catch is, these aren't the cardboard-tasting grocery-store
tomatoes that can sit on the counter for a week without ripening.
</P>
<P>
   The beefsteaks are cheap because they are fully ripened and
won't last much longer. Of course, they can be sacrificed for
sauces, then frozen. It is a shame to treat slicers that way,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other tomatoes at the market are coming from
Tennessee. Some are arriving from Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Black-eyed peas are still plentiful, but growers warn that the
current supply is about to dry up. The old fields have given about
all they can, and the new pastures won't yield anything until the
rains begin.
</P>
<P>
   Texas onions are still coming into the market, along with sweet
corn and peppers. If you are looking for bargains, red bell peppers
are cheap right now. But they, too, have ripened and must be used
soon, or chopped and frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit, especially watermelons, is plentiful. The melons are from
Texas and Oklahoma. The strawberries are from California; the
blueberries and peaches are from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Farmers Market is just off Interstate 30 on Pearl
Street, nestled right next to the downtown business district. It is
open every day, all day, with the exception of Christmas and New
Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a recipe for those juicy, ripe tomatoes. It can be made
under the broiler, but better yet, it can be prepared outside on
the barbecue grill. The Bruschetta di Pomodori recipe is from the
newly released ``Savoring Italy,'' a Time-Life Book from
Williams-Sonoma ($39.95). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   BRUSCHETTA DI POMODORI (FRESH TOMATO TOASTS)
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   _ 6 fresh basil leaves, torn into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   _ 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   _ Coarse salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   _ 8 slices coarse country bread, each about 1/2-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 large cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler, or prepare a fire in a charcoal grill.
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, basil, olive oil, vinegar and
salt. Toss well.
</P>
<P>
   Place the bread on a baking sheet or grill rack and broil or
grill, turning once, until lightly toasted on both sides, about 2
minutes total. Remove from the broiler or grill and immediately rub
one side of each slice with the garlic cloves.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the grilled bread, garlic side up, on a serving platter
and spoon on the tomatoes, dividing evenly. Serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Note: You can add some chopped garlic if you like. A thin slice
of ricotta salata (or a mild feta) laid atop the tomatoes is a nice
addition and can turn this antipasto into a light lunch.

MICROSOFT TO START NET HOTEL-PRICING SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imitating a competitor's patented approach, the Microsoft Corp.
is introducing an Internet service that lets consumers name their
own prices for hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was an innovation of the heavily promoted
Priceline.com service, which last year introduced a system to let
people enter the prices they would be willing to pay for airline
tickets. It has since expanded to hotels, cars and mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
   On both Priceline and the new Price Matcher service that
Microsoft is introducing Tuesday on its Expedia travel site,
consumers specify the city, dates, room rate and hotel rating (one
to five stars) they are seeking. The service picks the individual
hotel, and automatically charges the amount of the full stay to the
buyer's credit card. No refunds or changes are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have become so enamored by the potential of this
system that Priceline, which went public last year, has a market
value of some $9.9 billion, more than any airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking for a way to hook onto Priceline's coat
tails,'' said Kenneth J. Orton, chief strategist at Cognititive, a
San Francisco consulting firm, and former chief executive of
Preview Travel, an Internet travel service. He said Microsoft's
move was meant to appeal more to investors than to travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Wall Street is devoted to Priceline, consumer
reaction has been more tepid because of the restrictions that the
system imposes. If the service can find a hotel room or plane
ticket at the specified price, the consumer must buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Barton, the general manager of Expedia, said that such
restrictions are necessary to get the hotels to agree to take lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good for consumers because they can get great deals,''
he said. ``And it's good for hotels because they can put people
into rooms that may go empty while protecting their published price
structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton declined to say whether Microsoft would introduce a
similar system for airline tickets and car rentals, but he said
there was no reason that it would not if the hotel offering was
successful.
</P>
<P>
   One factor, however, that might impede Microsoft is that
Priceline has been granted a patent on the central mechanism of its
system: the concept of a ``conditional purchase offer'' in which a
consumer is committed to buy something if the seller can meet their
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Ek, a spokesman for Priceline, said that the company had
not licensed its patent to Microsoft and that the company was still
studying the Microsoft site to see if it was an infringement on its
patent.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, of Microsoft, declined to comment on Priceline's patent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Priceline and Expedia buy blocks of hotel rooms at
wholesale rates and then sell them to those who bid higher prices.
There is a well-developed market for such bulk purchases of hotel
rooms, since hotels are willing to take less money in return for a
volume purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Meristar Hotels and Resorts, which operates 218 hotels under the
Hilton, Sheraton, Radisson and other brands, now sells 1 percent to
2 percent of its rooms through Priceline, said David McCaslin, its
president. It will also take part in the Microsoft program, but
McCaslin said he did not expect such a sales approach to dominate
the hotel industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do your job properly, you will create your own
demand,'' he said. ``But I don't think any hotel is so good they
are selling out at full rate 365 days a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Expedia already books reservations online through more
conventional models. In the second quarter, it sold $183 million
worth of air travel, hotel rooms and car rentals. In addition to
receiving commissions on those sales _ often $5 or $10 for airline
tickets _ it sells advertising and other promotional opportunities
to travel providers.

MUSIC VIDEO TAKES MEDIUM INTO NEW REALM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In this age of post-music MTV, one seldom looks to
music videos for compelling visuals. But based on what has been
shown at a couple of primo special-effects gatherings, one good
place to look for cutting-edge special effects is the work of
Bjork, the quirky Icelandic sylph of a singer.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``All Is Full of Love'' video, which languorously ends in a
lesbian robot embrace, was one of about 50 computer-generated
shorts showcased at the SIGGRAPH convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bjork's face was superimposed seamlessly onto the head of one
robot, moving sinuously through the futuristic scene.
</P>
<P>
   And Bjork's ``Hunter'' video, showing her head twitchingly
transforming into a cyberbear, was one of the more striking tidbits
that special-effects wizards showed at a recent American Film
Institute salon.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hunter'' shoot was a major headache for the visual-effects
gurus from Digital Domain (James Cameron's firm) who created it.
Bjork insisted that a) she would appear bald and b) that she
wouldn't shave her hair.
</P>
<P>
   Makeup couldn't hide the forehead seam left by the skin cap she
wore, especially given the close-up shots and her snakily moving
head.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they had to digitally erase the problem in every single
frame of video during post-production. It took weeks to clean up
footage that only lasts a few minutes. But the results are
fabulous. &QL; 
NET NOTES
</P>
<P>
   Among the many companies launching a splashy new enterprise on
Thursday's 9/9/99 date is Spike Radio, the latest creation of one
of the Net's more intriguing companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the view that, in the youth-oriented space we're
targeting, we need to be trend-setting, taste-making. And the live
component is crucial,'' said Spike CEO Chris O'Hanlon. ``Actions
that are provoked by on-air content, the ability to communicate
live with the audience, these are paradigms that haven't been
explored by the new media.''
</P>
<P>
   What O'Hanlon _ a blunt, blocky Australian with an entertaining
take on the Web _ means is that most Internet ``radio'' is either
human-free digital music (think Spinner.com) or a straight feed of
what's playing on some broadcast station (say, KCRW-FM).
</P>
<P>
   Spike tries to be more like broadcast, but freed of over-the-air
limitations. The station's prime attraction is its 27 DJs (O'Hanlon
calls them ``iJays''), drawn from Los Angeles' techno scene, with
guest jocks from London and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think not enough attention is paid to the live experience
in the Internet experience,'' O'Hanlon said. ``The
unpredictability, the surprise is something even the best Web site
can't produce.''
</P>
<P>
   The DJs play a lot of stuff you won't hear elsewhere (except
maybe in those clubs), some of it with language and attitudes
you'll never hear on broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone would argue that the best DJs aren't
performers,'' O'Hanlon said. ``They're really able to perform in
many ways like they are in clubs. When it's at its best, it has the
immersive experience of the Web but also has the best of the club
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In listening to the site over several evenings, I've found it
wonderfully challenging and engaging. That's particularly so
because sometimes what the DJs choose just doesn't work, as
O'Hanlon freely admits.
</P>
<P>
   Spike's first stab at a stand-alone player has flaws, but
O'Hanlon promises it will be replaced on Launch Day with a more
robust application that allows chat, access to archives and more.

THE ADMAN IS A PC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOLORES KONG   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are computers more creative than humans?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps _ at least when it comes to developing ad concepts,
according to an experiment comparing ideas that a specially
programmed computer generated with those dreamed up by humans.
</P>
<P>
   To convey that a particular brand of computer is user-friendly,
for instance, the computer came up with the notion of having a
bouquet of flowers come out of a computer screen. The human
concept, on the other hand, called for a lipstick imprint on the
screen, as if a woman had kissed it. The computer's idea was judged
better by a panel of ordinary people, not trained in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   An essay titled ``Creative Sparks'' reports the findings in the
current issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the exercise was not to minimize human creativity,
or to compare computers with humans, but to explore the mechanical
aspects of creativity, so that what makes humans human can be
better understood, said Sorin Solomon, a physics professor at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He co-authored the report with
marketing colleagues Jacob Goldenberg and David Mazursky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep in ourselves, we hope that humans are really something
special. I still believe we are,'' said Solomon, a particle
physicist by training, in a telephone interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And the way Solomon and his colleagues are trying to prove that
is through a process of elimination, by seeing what aspects of
human endeavor can be performed just as well by computers and which
can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these efforts of reductionism of mine are not because I
really believe that everything can be reduced to physics, to
mechanics. It's in order to take away what can be reduced, and
leave in all the splendor the things that cannot be reduced,''
Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his work as a particle physicist, studying the
natural rules that govern microscopic particles, Solomon became
intrigued with trying to find similar rules that might explain
human activities, if they are broken down into small enough parts
to be studied. He calls this effort ``microscopic representation.''
</P>
<P>
   So for the advertising experiment, he and his colleagues worked
with advertising professionals and analyzed award-winning ads
(designed by humans), to come up with discrete formulas to explain
what makes a great ad.
</P>
<P>
   These formulas, or algorithms, were then plugged into a
computer, which then came up with ad concepts of its own.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common formulas for an award-winning ad, for
instance, turns out to be what the researchers call the ``pictorial
analogy template,'' in which a symbol, like a bouquet of flowers,
is put on a product, like a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The humans who came up with ad ideas for the experiment were
highly educated people like professors and scientists, but not
necessarily advertising professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Then the ideas from both computers and humans were given to
artists to turn into advertisements. The judges compared those ads
with each other, as well as to some of the human-made award-winning
ads that had served as the basis for some of the computer formulas.
</P>
<P>
   All hope is not lost for humans, though. Even though the
computer-generated ideas beat out those dreamed up by humans in the
experiment, the judges found the best ads to actually be the
award-winning ones (created by humans) that served as the basis of
the computer-formulated ones.
</P>
<P>
   And advertising officials in Boston scoffed at the notion that a
computer could ever take the place of the most talented
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put our best creative minds against computers any time,''
said Bethany Kendall, president of the 7,000-member Advertising
Club of Greater Boston, the largest advertising and communications
trade group in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Holliday, one of the founders of ad agency Hill Holliday
Connors Cosmopulos and now an assistant professor of mass
communications at Boston University, said, ``There's an awful lot
of dumb, boring advertising that a computer could probably do just
as well, but the really great advertising takes in a lot of factors
that I don't think a computer can.''

SUN TO INTRODUCE AN EVEN MORE BASIC NETWORK COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Sun Microsystems Inc. will introduce a
second generation of its network computing business in New York on
Wednesday with a stripped-down ``computing appliance'' for
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Like all so-called network computers, the new device, named the
Sun Ray, relies on a central server computer for its processing
power, data storage and most software applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Ray is extremely basic, even by network computer
standards, with only enough processing power and memory to display
images passed to it by software on the server. It has no disk
drives or other storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   The first widespread commercial availability of the long-awaited
network computer comes three years after the device was made a
rallying cry against Microsoft by Sun's chief executive, Scott
McNealy, and Oracle Corp.'s chairman, Lawrence J. Ellison. The two
executives have waged war against the personal computer, which they
argue is too expensive and complex.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived as a simple and inexpensive alternative to the PC, the
network computer centralizes most of the expense and complexity of
computing in the powerful servers.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of network computers from Sun and IBM, both
based on the Java programming language, have largely failed as PC
prices fell. But Sun executives said Tuesday that the company had
not given up on its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Ray will be priced as low as $9.99 a month for a
five-year lease, or it can be purchased for $499. A complete system
including server computers, software and monitors will be leased
for $30 a month for each user.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is network computing 2.0,'' said Ed Zander, Sun's
president and chief operating officer. ``We've learned a lot in the
last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Sun would focus on several corporate markets and
intended to use its recently acquired Star Office business to offer
users PC-type productivity applications like word processing and
spreadsheets as well as network applications like Web browsers,
e-mail and access to corporate data bases.
</P>
<P>
   Zander said it was also possible to link the system with a
Windows NT server so that Sun Ray users could run standard Windows
applications over the network.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest in San Jose, Calif.,
called Sun Ray a smart move _ not in terms of killing Windows or
Microsoft's Office suite, but in increasing Sun's corporate market
share. He added that eventually the technology would be well suited
to the growing number of networked homes with high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Ray itself is a small box that is connected to a
network, a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard. Each unit can be
personalized to the needs of an individual user by means of a Smart
Card that identifies the user's needs and preferences and also acts
as a security device.
</P>
<P>
   A software system called Hot Desk, which runs on the central
server, permits a user to insert his or her Smart Card into any Sun
Ray on the network and instantly personalize that unit.
</P>
<P>
   Zander said that the new Sun computing environment was a step
back toward an era of mainframe computers and so-called ``green
screen'' terminals _ but with a major performance difference. Sun
is guaranteeing that users will not have to wait longer than
one-tenth of a second between keystrokes.
</P>
<P>
   Sun executives said a typical network system would link two
servers and 50 to 200 active computer users.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge by Red Hat Software Inc.'s red-hot stock price and
press clippings, one might conclude that software gigagiant
Microsoft Corp. is in for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat is the little North Carolina company that has run up a
$5.6 billion market capitalization by peddling a version of Linux,
the increasingly popular low-cost computer operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But mention Red Hat and Linux to Aubrey Edwards, group product
manager for Microsoft's forthcoming Windows NT upgrade Windows
2000, and he seems almost on the verge of stifling a yawn. ``When
you look at the hype versus the reality today,'' says Edwards,
``there is a big disconnect.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he is whistling in the dark. But then, Microsoft has been
here before.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Java? That was the radical new technology of four years
ago, an upstart product that threatened to smash Windows once and
for all.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the labs of Sun Microsystems Inc. and intended at first
to run cable TV controller boxes, Java wasn't an operating system
like Windows or Linux. Instead it was a much broader system that
challenged some of the most basic principles of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, computer software is very closely linked to the
hardware running it. The Windows operating system is specifically
designed to work with computers that contain Intel Corp.
processors. Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh machines use the
PowerPC chip, a different type of processor made by Motorola and
IBM. Windows software can't work with a PowerPC chip, and Mac
software won't talk to an Intel Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   Java attempts to get around all this by creating a ``virtual
machine,'' a piece of software that can run on all kinds of
different computers, from palm-sized data organizers to room-sized
mainframes.
</P>
<P>
   Java programs run in the virtual machine, and so in theory,
never again would programmers have to write different versions of
the same program for every different type of computer. ``Write
once, run everywhere,'' was the battle cry of Java advocates; Sun
even copyrighted the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, companies that had been battered by competition from
Microsoft embraced Java as a way to get back into the game. Corel
Computer Corp. said it would rewrite its WordPerfect office
software suite entirely in Java, so it would run on any computer.
Lotus Development Corp. announced eSuite, a set of lightweight
office software programs in Java, for use on corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   And even Microsoft in late 1995 agreed to license the Java
technology from Sun.
</P>
<P>
   (That license agreement spawned a bitter and still-pending
lawsuit between the two companies, with Sun claiming Microsoft is
trying to make unauthorized modifications to Java.)
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate dream for many computer users was software that
would render Windows irrelevant and shrink the power of Microsoft
forever.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't worked out that way. Corel killed its Java office
suite, and while Lotus officials refuse to provide confirmation,
several computer-industry publications have reported that eSuite is
also getting the ax.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's difficult to find any major Java programs on
business or home desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, says Sun's vice president of software marketing,
George Paolini. ``It hasn't happened because it hasn't needed to
happen,'' he says. ``There's no reason to rewrite an entire office
suite in Java.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially not when it turned out that Java programs
consistently ran much slower than programs written in the
traditional way. Java also had built-in limitations that made the
programs safer to run on corporate networks, but also less useful.
For example, Java was originally designed to prevent users from
saving files to a computer's hard drive _ a good security
precaution, but worse than useless for word processing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Java was touted as a key tool in another heavily hyped
movement toward ``network computers.'' Instead of keeping software
on each machine, people would use small, cheap computers that would
get all their software from a central server. Java is well-suited
to this approach.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad nobody wanted to buy network computers. Their
unpopularity was yet another blow to the Java movement. ``I think
that this network computing idea will be a major success, but it
may be years before it becomes a major success,'' says Rick Ross,
president of the Java Lobby, an organization of Java programmers.
``A lot of companies will go bankrupt waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Java is far from dead.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, there are still thousands of software
developers cobbling together Java programs, but for purposes quite
different than the overthrow of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Programs such as WordPerfect and other word processors are
called ``client'' applications, and are run by ordinary users. Java
hasn't caught on in that arena. But it turns out Java is a good way
to write programs that run on servers, the powerful machines that
work behind the scenes, running corporate networks and the
Internet. Server-based Java programs make it easy to exchange data
among many types of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Novera Software Inc. in Burlington, Mass. is one of many firms
that make Java software tools to help companies link up their
networked databases. ``It's an excellent language in which to work
to integrate disparate back-office applications,'' says Novera
cofounder Tim Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly there's no need to mourn for Java's fate. But its
success as a sort of welding tool for computer networks is a long
way from the early visions of Java partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Microsoft executives and they'll tell you that a similar
fate awaits Linux. Charles Fitzgerald, director of business
development in Microsoft's software development unit, says the
Linux hype has already peaked. ``Cold hard reality is coming to
bear,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald points to recent benchmark tests by the research firm
Mindcraft Inc., which found Windows NT performs a variety of tasks
faster than Linux. And he says Linux is notoriously complex and
hard to use, making it a poor choice for any but the most
sophisticated users. And Microsoft's Edwards says that Linux lacks
many advanced capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly are categories where Linux is a strong
competitor,'' Fitzgerald admits. For example, he says it makes a
good server for delivering World Wide Web pages. But Fitgerald says
Linux still isn't ready for the heavy-duty tasks that Windows 2000
is designed to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Troan, director of engineering at Red Hat, freely admits
that the buzz over Linux has gotten a bit too loud as the price of
his company's shares has been bid up from 14 on the first day of
trading last month to 84 1/8 at the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Troan says Linux has already avoided one of Java's biggest
mistakes. The first releases of Java were crude and buggy. ``People
set it up as though the first release of immature technology was
going to go out and take over the world,'' Troan says. Linux, on
the other hand, came to public attention after years of buffing and
bug-fixing. Linux was running successfully on thousands of
computers long before the media hype began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably an adolescent now, instead of a toddler,''
Troan says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Java experience suggests that it's too early to say
what Linux will do when it grows up.

ACER ASPIRE POINTS THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's usually not very interesting to review each month's crop of
desktop computers. Frankly, they just aren't very different from
one another these days. Most machines have a keyboard and a mouse,
a screaming-fast microprocessor, not enough memory (you almost
always have to upgrade), and the standard collection of
input/output ports.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with the machines is also pretty
standard. If the computer is designed for business users, you get
the operating system and usually little else. Machines targeted for
consumers come with Microsoft Works, cut-down versions of Microsoft
Money and Intuit's Quicken, and perhaps antivirus software.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are changes coming to desktop computers.
Besides getting faster, they are becoming easier to set up, use,
and somewhat more forgiving. Last month I was fortunate enough to
have an Acer Aspire 6160 on my desk. In many ways, this computer _
and the entire Acer Aspire product line _ shows what's coming down
the line for many Windows users.
</P>
<P>
   The Acer 6160 is somewhat easier to set up than other computers
because it is based on the Universal Serial Bus (USB). Gone are the
traditional keyboard, mouse, and serial ports that clutter up the
backs of most computers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Aspire has four neat USB ports. You plug the
keyboard into one port, the mouse into another, and the speakers _
yes, the speakers _ into a third. Unlike other machines, it doesn't
matter which plug goes into which socket. The fourth is a spare,
for future expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The USB, however, only goes so far. Although the speakers do
plug into the USB socket, they only use the USB interface to power
their built-in amplifier. A second wire runs from the speakers to
the computer for the sound itself. This wire is analog. It would
have been more daring, and only a little more expansive, if Acer
supplied the Aspire with fully-digital speakers. Then there would
have been just one wire, and much better sound.
</P>
<P>
   The USB keyboard is a good idea, but in addition to the cable
the keyboard should have two USB sockets of its own, so that you
could plug in a mouse and perhaps a digital camera. That's the way
the USB works on Apple's iMac, and Acer should have copied it.
</P>
<P>
   Acer also should have put USB connectors on both the front and
the back of the computer, perhaps giving customers eight sockets,
rather than just four. Nevertheless, Acer's use of USB is a good
first step.
</P>
<P>
   On the software side, Acer boasts an innovative feature called
the Aspire TimeMachine. The idea behind the TimeMachine is rather
simple: when a Windows-based computer stops working properly, it's
usually because some important file has been deleted, or some new
file has been installed in the directory that shouldn't be there,
or because some critical application setting has been altered.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the TimeMachine. Once a day, the Aspire TimeMachine
program takes an electronic snapshot of the operating system, all
of the application files, the configuration files, DLLs, and the
Windows registry.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if something stops working, you can use the TimeMachine to
roll back the system to the way it was on a previous day when
everything was working properly. And because you might not
immediately realize there are problems, the TimeMachine stores many
snapshots on the hard disk _ one a day for the past week, one a
week for the past few months, and one for each month going back a
full year.
</P>
<P>
   I was skeptical about the TimeMachine software when I first
heard of it, but after trying it out a few times, I'm a believer.
The snapshots happen when you aren't paying attention, they don't
take up any space at all, and the restore process really works.
</P>
<P>
   How is it possible that the snapshots don't take up any space?
Because Acer hides them on the computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Although my Aspire was allegedly delivered with an 8 gigabyte
hard disk, a detailed inspection revealed that disk's true size is
12 gigabytes. Those extra 4 gigs are used to hold TimeMachine
snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening here is that Acer is selling its computers with
a hard disk larger than advertised. The company is then using that
additional disk space to decrease its technical support costs.
</P>
<P>
   My Aspire also came with version 5.0 of Inoculan Antivirus.
Whoops! While Acer should be applauded for supplying this, the
virus signature files included with the program are more than a
year and a half out of date, and the product itself has been
discontinued. That's not very useful.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy the computer on line at http://www.shopacer.com/
you'll find Acers are pretty competitive. The 6150 I've been using
has been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   But in its place, consider the Aspire 6151. It has a 500 Mhz
Pentium III with 64 megabytes of RAM, 8.6GB of hard disk, a
DVD-ROM, and a 17-inch monitor, for $1299. Pay an extra $99 and you
can get it with 128MB of RAM and 10GB of disk space. If you want to
run speech recognition, be sure to get 128MB.

TIME-SHARING UPDATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two decades ago, firms like Microsoft Corp. taught us that
software is something you buy. It comes in pretty boxes with
confusing, badly written manuals. Every year or two, you buy a new
version with brand-new bugs that won't get fixed until you buy yet
another version.
</P>
<P>
   It's come to be an annoying yet vaguely pleasurable habit, like
smoking. But it's a habit that a host of new companies are trying
to break. They're called ``application service providers'' or ASPs,
and they want businesses to stop buying software and start renting
it.
</P>
<P>
   ASP operators like Andover-based Navisite Inc. say buying and
running business software makes no sense for many firms. The stuff
costs a fortune, and you have to keep updating it. Besides, you
must buy computers to run the programs and hire workers to oversee
it all. Why not simply rent a network connection to the ASP's
powerful server computers and let them process your data?
</P>
<P>
   As new ideas go, it's one of the oldest. Computer
``time-sharing'' was hot stuff in the '60s, when somebody noticed
that mainframes can do a dozen tasks at once. Firms began renting
time on them to businesses who couldn't afford machines of their
own. The ASP concept is time-sharing, updated for the era of PC
servers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the second coming of the moribund boomlet in network
computing that swept the industry a couple of years ago. We were
all supposed to give up on expensive ``fat'' desktop computers
stuffed with costly software from the likes of Microsoft Corp.
Instead we'd use ``thin client'' machines connected to a powerful
server, sitting in another room or another city.
</P>
<P>
   I bought into this fad, but it flopped, partly because desktop
computers are about two-thirds cheaper than three years ago. Still,
I've kept the faith. Network computing is bound to catch on in some
form, because it dramatically simplifies life in a computerized
world.
</P>
<P>
   Traver Gruen-Kennedy, chairman of the ASP Industry Consortium in
Wakefield, calls the ASP concept ``the revenge of network
computing.'' But this time around, ASPs aren't in the hardware
business.
</P>
<P>
   First-wave network computer firms like Sun Microsystems Inc. and
IBM Corp. hoped to make a fortune selling specialized thin-client
devices. Nobody wanted them. But ASPs are happy to let us keep
using our Pentium IIs, as long as they're linked to the ASP's
servers.
</P>
<P>
   There's another good sign for the ASPs: Larry Ellison is keeping
his mouth shut. Ellison, the CEO of database maker Oracle Corp.,
almost single-handedly discredited network computers with grandiose
claims that millions of ordinary consumers would buy them, relying
on slow telephone modems to download whatever software they might
need.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is claiming that ordinary folks will use ASP-based
programs in the near future; that would be as unprofitable as it is
impractical. The big money will be earned as companies play host to
business computer services. Clare Gillan, vice president for
applications research at International Data Corp., figures it'll be
a $2 billion market by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of firms want a piece; Sun Microsystems just bought German
office software firm Star Division, to offer Star's office software
as a rentable Internet application for firms that don't want to
spend $300 a pop for Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   Is Microsoft worried? Probably not, at this early stage. Yet by
accident, the company landed a blow against network-based software
this week. The break-in at Microsoft's Hotmail free e-mail service
exposed the messages of 50 million users, and reminded us it can be
dangerous to store data on somebody else's computers. ASP customers
might also fret about last month's network collapse at MCI
WorldCom, an outage that disconnected thousands of corporate users.
Firms that count on ASPs will always be at their network's mercy.
</P>
<P>
   But then, we're all at the mercy of the Internet these days.
Many of us now wonder how we ever did business without it. The ASP
people hope that in a few years, firms will ruefully recall the
Dark Ages, when they spent a fortune every year buying and
upgrading software, when they might have been renting it.

WILL THE THIRD TIME STILL BE A CHARM FOR THE BELOVED BOY WIZARD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The boy is being educated by wizards, but he's not the Wart from
T.H. White's ``The Once and Future King.''
</P>
<P>
   He's skinny and bespectacled, but he's not Encyclopedia Brown
from that eternally popular series of children's novels.
</P>
<P>
   His parents are dead, and he's sometimes in the clutches of mean
relatives, but he's not Cinderella or Snow White or any other
familiar fairy-tale protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter is, without question, the hottest character in
fiction, with ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' certain
to top bestseller lists after it hit bookstore shelves Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect tremendous response,'' said Jackie Goodman, general
manager of Borders Books &AMP; Music in Fort Worth, of author J.K.
Rowling's wildly popular series. ``It's the most anticipated book
of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The orphaned, wizard-in-training Harry is charismatic, lovable,
intelligent and daring. He's often able to work magic, is sometimes
a bit of a klutz, and he always, always tries to do the right
thing, even if it means breaking the rules at his
young-wizards-and-witches boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   But Harry isn't unique. ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone'' and ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,'' the first
two mega-sellers in Rowling's projected seven-book series, had
shoppers blazing a trail to bookstores even though British author
Rowling _ a former schoolteacher, and divorced single mother who
wrote her first Harry tale while on welfare _ didn't blaze a new
literary path. In these children's stories that adults can enjoy,
too, variations of familiar themes still work, and Harry Potter is
proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorcerer's Stone,'' which introduces us to 10-year-old Harry,
borrows generously from past storytellers. This is far from
criminal. ``The Three Investigators'' series that was popular among
youngsters in the 1980s was influenced by the Hardy Boys and Nancy
Drew, those young crime-stopper heroes of a previous generation of
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's world has dragons and an evil sorcerer named Lord
Voldemort, who would wreak havoc if only he could once and for all
finish off Harry (see Sauron in Tolkien's ``Lord of the Rings''
trilogy).
</P>
<P>
   Yet Harry's world also has videogames. And the broomsticks Harry
and his pals fly around on during exciting Quidditch matches are
revved up in high-tech style. Harry's Nimbus 2000 broomstick is
today's equivalent of Nancy Drew's sporty roadster _ cutting-edge
transportation for its literary time.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Rowling has done what T.H. White and J.R.R. Tolkien
did before her. The result is the same: bestsellers. Harry
resonates with readers for the same reasons previous generations
loved the Wart and Frodo. He is decent, well-meaning, and behind
the 8-ball often enough that readers easily identify with him.
</P>
<P>
   Harry attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where
gifted youngsters are trained to do good magical things. Nonmagical
humans are referred to as ``Muggles.'' Muggles are not supposed to
know about this magical Otherworld that exists within their own
world. Adult wizards and witches spend a great deal of time hiding
traces of prestidigitation that Muggles would never understand.
Thus, secret powers form a large part of Harry's life, something
Superman would understand.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's parents were killed by Lord Voldemort in a confrontation
when Harry was a babe. But somehow, Voldemort's powers weren't
sufficient to kill Harry, although the encounter left the infant
with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. This has enhanced his
reputation among his magical kind even though Harry is only a
wizard-in-training (some kids at Hogwarts ask for his autograph).
</P>
<P>
   But Harry is not a celebrity outside school. He must spend
holidays at the home of a nasty uncle and aunt, where he sleeps in
a cupboard. His mean Muggle cousin gets dozens of expensive gifts
at Christmas and on his birthday. Harry gets a box of dog biscuits.
(Cinderella and her wicked stepsisters, anyone?)
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   In his first two adventures, Harry discovers his true identity,
begins his studies at Hogwarts, and risks his life to foil
Voldemortian schemes.
</P>
<P>
   These stories take place in real time; Harry, unlike eternal
teen-ager Nancy Drew, is growing up. From enrollment to
matriculation, his stay at Hogwarts lasts seven years, which lends
itself nicely to Rowling's anticipated seven-book series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prisoner of Azkaban'' (Azkaban being a faraway dungeon for
rule-breaking wizards), then, marks almost the halfway point of the
series. It is already apparent that Harry Potter is a landmark _ if
honorably derivative _ children's literary series. The only
question is whether it will continue to be a bestseller for its
four remaining titles.
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie with its author, who is almost as mysterious
as the character she created.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling is scheduled to visit America next month for a series of
interviews and public readings. Her publisher, Scholastic, normally
a low-key distributor of educational titles, seems unprepared for
the bestseller spotlight. A book editor's routine request for a
photo of Rowling couldn't elicit an immediate reponse. Scholastic
said it wasn't certain that the author would approve of using her
photo for publicity purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what we know about Rowling must be gleaned from media
reports in her native United Kingdom. She is in her early 30s, and
as mentioned, is a former teacher and a divorced single mother. It
took Rowling several years to find an agent and, eventually, get
Harry into print.
</P>
<P>
   The female author/boy hero is a rare fairy-tale tandem.
Encyclopedia Brown's creator was a man; Mary Poppins was the
brainchild of a woman. Mildred Hubble, whose ``The Worst Witch''
adventures most closely mirror Harry Potter's escapades in modern
fiction, is the product of author Jill Murphy's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' (titled ``Harry Potter
and the Philosopher's Stone'' in the United Kingdom) was a British
hit, but no mainstream U.S. publishers were willing to risk even a
modest advance. Scholastic won by default. A measure of the series'
success is that ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' is
projected to sell 500,000 copies. Consider that sales of
50,000-60,000 will usually guarantee any novel a spot on the
bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't stop there. MGM studios has won a hot bidding war for
Harry Potter film rights. Harry probably will be onscreen a year or
two into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   But, by 2001 or 2002, will anyone still care? Extended book
series are risky; Jean Auel's ``Children of the Earth'' novels were
initial smashes in the '70s _ ``Clan of the Cave Bear'' sold in
Harry Potter-type numbers _ but readers gradually tired of its
prehistoric cast. The series has yet to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Reading ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' is great fun;
pages are quickly turned and lots of colorful scenes unfold. But
follow-up ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' already has a
certain sameness. It is somewhat darker in tone, perhaps a sign
that Rowling expects her young readers to gradually mature with
Harry.
</P>
<P>
   An educated guess, then, has ``Prisoner of Azkaban'' hitting a
sales peak for the series, with subsequent titles selling less. But
Rowling is an unknown literary quantity; she may have some
intriguing tricks up her sleeve as well as Harry's.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain, though, is that Wednesday was Harry Potter's
day in bookstores across America. Speculation about whether Harry
will enjoy continued popularity in the rest of the series is put on
hold for now as we go onward to Azkaban, and don't fall off your
Nimbus 2000 broomstick on the way.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Ivy fears that his son Jonathan, a freshman business major
at Pennsylvania State University, will graduate from college
without ever having taken a chemistry course. Montville High
School, the New Jersey school he attended, did not require
chemistry, and his adviser at Penn State says he can skip it there,
too _ provided that he signs on for more computer science courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says computer sciences are mandatory for him, but no
one has ever recommended that he even look at chemistry,'' said
Ivy, the chief executive of Savin Corp., a copier company in
Stamford, Conn. ``It's truly sad that kids can graduate today
without getting exposure to the fun of physical sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   No one questions the need to emphasize computers in education
these days. Nor do they deny the plethora of high-paying jobs that
the computer world offers, from the mundane tasks of fixing
computers to the mind-stretching ones of designing digital code.
Few suggest that basic sciences are disappearing from the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But a sense is growing in some business quarters that the sheer
ubiquity of computers has deflected attention from more traditional
sciences and skills.
</P>
<P>
   Experts worry that vocational schools will soon churn out too
many computer repair people and too few refrigerator technicians.
They worry even more that universities will produce scads of people
who can use computers as research and calculating tools but far too
few who can use the scientific method to solve problems. They fret
that the prospect of quick wealth will lure bright students who
might have become research scientists _ or science teachers and
professors _into joining Internet ventures instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to need more HTML coders five years from now.
We're going to need biotechnologists,'' said Paul Saffo, a director
of the Institute for the Future, a research group in Menlo Park,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to start an Internet business today,'' he
added, ``because they don't realize that the science moguls of a
decade down the road will be the biotechnologists. And that means a
good chance that the biotechnology moguls a decade from now will be
foreign-born.''
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that the next generation might not develop the
experimental zeal and creative thinking of the precomputer days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer science courses teach skills and techniques, but they
don't teach critical thinking the way physics does,'' said Gerald
Wheeler, executive director of the National Science Teachers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many computer scientists take umbrage at any hint
that theirs is an intellectually bankrupt field. Indeed, Michael
Hammer, the management consultant who coined the term
``re-engineering'' and who is often cited as a premier management
thinker, has a doctorate in computer science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer science gives you the intellectual grounding to deal
with enormous complexity,'' he said. ``The liberal arts teach
critical thinking, the basic sciences teach the scientific method,
but computer sciences gives you systems thinking skills. It teaches
the value of precision, and it gives you the ability to deal with
tradeoffs and with huge issues of design.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that idea does not stop science educators from worrying
that their fields are being eclipsed. According to Richard Heckel,
a professor emeritus of metallurgical engineering at Michigan
Technological University, who collects statistics on engineering
enrollments, ``The number of undergraduates going into computer
sciences and computer engineering is growing rapidly, while
enrollments in electrical and environmental engineering is
plummeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Hein, associate executive officer of the American
Association of Physics Teachers, cites a similar trend. ``The
number of undergraduate majors in physics is at a post-Sputnik
low,'' he said. ``Kids are saying, `Why should I go into something
as demanding and rigorous as physics when I can take computer
science and make more money?'''
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Paul Hallee. All through high school he was on
the four-year college track, taking chemistry, biology, physics,
earth sciences _ all the traditional science courses. And he has
always loved the outdoors. So, going for a four-year degree in
environmental law _ the kind of program that trains forest rangers
_ seemed a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until he realized that his hobby, fixing computers,
could be a better career bet. Hallee was accepted into a four-year
program, but instead he took a two-year course in computers and
electronics. Now, at age 20, he is working for Maine Business
Solutions, a computer repair operation in Waterville, and hopes to
carve out a career administering computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have ended up with a fancy four-year degree and no
clue of where to get a job,'' Hallee said. ``Computers seemed a
really viable option.''
</P>
<P>
   Most parents, worried about future jobs, are anxious to give
their children a head start in this computer-oriented world.
According to the Toy Manufacturers of America, some 10 million
scientific toys _ Chem Craft sets and such _ were sold in both 1997
and 1998. Some 32 million electronic toys _ computer games and such
_ were sold last year, up from 28 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The widening interest gap is particularly apparent in vocational
schools, which are often pressed for funds. Many have added
computer skills courses and subtracted courses in, say, automotive
repair, welding and other traditional blue-collar skills. ``If they
are using resources for new computer programs, they have to cut the
ones they see as marginal, or that have low enrollment,'' said
Thomas Holdsworth, director of college and technical programs at
Skills USA-Vica,which creates programs for vocational education.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Within schools, the financial crunch is affecting academic
programs, too. Western Hills High School, in a poor part of
Cincinnati, used to offer anatomy, earth science, botany and
advanced-placement courses in biology, chemistry and physics. Last
year, it abolished all of them and converted many of its
laboratories to other uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all part of a cost-cutting directive, but the computer
labs did not get hit,'' said Louise Gerl, a biology teacher at the
school who says she spends her own money for supplies to do even
rudimentary experiments. ``Local companies bombard us with free
computers, but no one will give me materials to build a laboratory
or conduct experiments,'' Ms. Gerl said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, industry is trying to fill the gap. Dow Chemical
Co. recently sent a road show, made up of professional actors and
run by a professional director, around to junior and senior high
schools to ``educate children on the importance of science in a fun
MTV singing-dancing-game-show way,'' said William Stavropoulos,
Dow's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago a consortium of automotive companies formed
Automotive Youth Educational Systems, a nonprofit organization in
Troy, Mich., that sets up mentoring and apprenticeships between
high school students and automotive executives and dealers. It has
even begun inviting kindergarten classes in to see how cars are
fixed or sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make good money without a college degree in this
industry, but moms and dads just don't encourage their kids to be
technicians anymore,'' said Donald Gray, the president of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Although such industry-specific efforts can fill some job
pipelines, few educators believe they can do much to stop the
erosion of hands-on science in the schools. ``What corporations do
is a Band-Aid on a hemorrhaging wound,'' said Sylvia Ware, director
of education at the American Chemical Society, which has set up
groups to seek ways to train better science teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and science education are not mutually exclusive, of
course. A growing number of teachers and professors, from the
prekindergarten level through graduate schools, are using software
packages and Web sites as tools to teach sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The American Chemical Society has set up a Web site
(www.chemcenter.org) that enables children to simulate some
experiments. ``Too many teachers are teaching science as something
that is learned from a book, rather than as a way of testing
reality, of looking at the world,'' Ms. Ware said.
</P>
<P>
   Educational associations are running with the computer ball,
too. The National Science Teachers Association, in conjunction with
Toshiba Corp., a leading maker of laptop computers, just sponsored
a contest among teachers to pick the best lesson plans using
laptops to teach scientific principles. Among the winning programs
was one that helped students learn about the human body's response
to physical activity by measuring their pulse rates at various
running speeds at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers association has also begun a program with textbook
publishers to include, in the margins next to specific topics,
links to its new Web site (www.scilinks.org), which offers expanded
discussions or experiments. Holt, Rinehart &AMP; Winston, a division of
Harcourt Brace, is including the links in two high school chemistry
and environmental science textbooks, and another publisher plans to
do so in new versions of elementary school science books.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many teachers worry that while chemical formulas and
physics equations can be conveyed through a computer screen, the
basic scientific questing that is supposed to accompany them
cannot. ``Computers can teach information, but they don't teach a
way to ask questions or conduct experiments where you don't know
the correct answer ahead of time,'' said Eric Gruenstein, a
professor of molecular genetics at the University of Cincinnati
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Saffo, the futurist, put it more succinctly. ``Computers done
right can open entirely new educational horizons,'' he said, ``but
computers done wrong will turn our high schools into trade
schools.''

   Nor do computers teach that science can be just plain fun. That
is what Sarah Beth Corning is trying to do. She teaches science to
children ages 3 to 7 at the Village Infant Center in New York City.
It is an affluent school, and she has ample access to computers.
She pretty much shuns them.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, computers can simulate the bubbles that will rise if acid
is added to an alkali, but Ms. Corning infinitely prefers letting
the children make ``volcanoes'' by pouring vinegar into a baking
soda solution. ``They'll look at it on a computer once and get
bored, but they'll make the volcanoes again and again, and they'll
even check to see what happens if they add something else,'' she
said. ``They can learn from computers, but they need this kind of
hands-on experience to get hooked on science.''

Preparation, a slow hand needed to handle PC's innards 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sooner or later, with trembling fingers, you'll open
up your PC to work on its innards.
</P>
<P>
   I had a friend _ a physician _ who could deal with
life-and-death situations without a quiver. But the very idea of
taking the top off her PC was so frightening that simply thinking
of such of a thing gave her anxiety dreams.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know when your day will come. Perhaps you'll want to add
memory or swap hard disks or even do something as simple as change
an internal modem. But I promise it will come.
</P>
<P>
   Just as hospitals sometimes guide a patient through the steps
that will take place before an operation, today we'll take a little
tour _ think of it as an insider's view to a computer. Along the
way, you'll learn a few things that will make the process easier
and less frightening.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a single standard way to open the case of your
computer. On those tall skinny tower cases, there's usually an
access plate on the side. On regular desktop cases, the top usually
slides back and off. Check your computer manual to find out how
your PC's case opens.
</P>
<P>
   My first hint sounds painfully simple, but someday you may thank
me for it. When you remove the screws to open the case, put them in
a small container well away from the working area. I don't know how
many computers I've owned, but I can't think of a single one that
survived with a full complement of screws. Sure, I eventually found
them. I knew I had because I could hear the vacuum cleaner rattle
as it sucked them out of the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to remember when working inside a computer is
that static electricity _ even in amounts too small to notice _ can
kill memory chips and microprocessor chips. Since many of us keep a
computer in a room with a carpeted floor, it's easy to build up a
static charge. Before you touch anything _ those new memory chips
or the innards of your PC _ touch the chassis to ground yourself.
If you really worry about static electricity (and that isn't a
crazy thing), go to any electronics supply house and ask for a
grounding strap. You wear it on your wrist, and it prevents static
electricity buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Shock of a different kind also is a component killer. That's the
shock that comes when something hits the floor. Dropping a chip or
a card that contains chips won't necessarily ruin it. But it could.
So handle with care.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have the cover off and are ready to install your new
component, you'll notice a strange compulsion almost universal
among those who are new to working on computers. You'll feel an
overwhelming compulsion to rush. To grab the danged thing, shove it
into its proper place and then get the top on ... as if you got
extra points for speed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, once the case is open, review the instructions for
putting in the part. Then _ without touching anything _ take a
close look at where the part will go. If something doesn't make
sense, after seeing where the chip or the card will go, stop right
there. While being inventive and spontaneous may work just fine in
your personal life, it's not such a great idea while working on
gadgets. If you're confused and try to force something, the odds
are that it will break. So, if you're confused before you start,
call tech support for the company that makes the chip or gadget and
get advice now.
</P>
<P>
   For most small upgrades, the task is fairly straightforward. But
there are times _ when replacing a CD-ROM drive, or adding a hard
disk, and certainly when replacing a motherboard _ when you can
forget which connection goes where, or which side of the connector
is up. Sometimes it is a good idea to make a sketch, showing where
the connectors go, before you remove them from the old gadget. Even
if you never refer to the sketch again, just the process of
creating it will help you remember.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that PCs are complicated beasts but _ as far
as the kind of upgrades the home user might do _ really simple to
work on. Everything snaps together like Lego blocks.

Videos: Inexpensive, easy-to-use editing technology available 
By Goutami Hyma Mikkilineni  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Remember being forced to watch Dad's home videos of
his and Mom's second honeymoon to Hawaii? It wouldn't have been so
bad if you actually got to see the gorgeous volcanoes, sparkling
water and cute surfers instead of Dad's shoes, the back of Mom's
head and all those fuzzy images that came into focus as soon as the
shot changed.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame Dad. You can't expect him to be a professional
cameraman.
</P>
<P>
   People who are still forcing viewers to sit through shaky
pictures, shots of everyone's shoes and curses from an
inexperienced cameraman may think that Hollywood filmmakers with
high-tech (and high-priced) equipment are the only ones who can
produce a neatly edited video.
</P>
<P>
   With existing technology and a little patience, you can become
an accomplished amateur filmmaker and spare your viewers headaches
and boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, video editing is here for the masses. In fact, many of the
options have been on the market for years. By the time you finish
reading this, you'll have a step-by-step guide on how to edit.
You'll know how much to spend and where you can find the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the notion that editing has to cost a lot of money. The
cheapest and simplest way takes no more than the equipment you
already own: your VCR and video camera. Using this method, you can
cut and rearrange your footage to your liking.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   Just as you would record something from broadcast television,
you simply hook the camera to the VCR through the input slot. When
you find the first footage you want to run, hit pause, then get the
recorder ready. Hit record, then press play on the camera. Anyone
who has taped another tape or taped off the television already
knows how to edit this way. It just might not have occurred to you
that you could or should improve the overall look of your home
video.
</P>
<P>
   When you press record, the VCR automatically rewinds a few
seconds on the tape, stops, then begins recording. If you're not
careful, you could tape over the last few seconds of the tape you
are making. To avoid this, after you stop recording, fast forward
just a few seconds. Watch your timer _ 5-6 seconds will suffice.
Then, you can safely record the next section of footage without
taping over the last portion of the videotape. Editing this way
allows you to cut out sections of your home videos that are
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   To take full advantage of this method, take a few extra seconds
of your image when you are shooting with your camcorder. That way,
you have some more options of what to put on your final tape,
without losing precious images.
</P>
<P>
   Also, each shot should at least be 10 seconds long to give you
enough to work with during the editing process. This method also
allows you to choose the order of the footage.
</P>
<P>
   And you have the option of using various source tapes to create
a single new video. If you wanted to compile footage of all of
baby's firsts, you can use old tapes of her first crawl, then add
the tape of her first steps and finally edit in her first words. A
tape of all these events can be a nice holiday gift for the
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is the easiest way to edit and requires no extra
equipment, it offers the fewest options. You can still create
amateurish home videos this way if the camera operator makes a lot
of mistakes. The biggest drawback is that your viewers will see an
obvious break in your footage at the spots where you cut and added
other footage. Sound editing can be messy, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to do a better job, a number of affordable options
are just as simple but allow for a little more human error when it
comes to shooting.
</P>
<P>
   You have two choices: Use special editing boards, or, since you
probably already have a home computer, you may have most of what
you need for the next method of editing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the personal computer has replaced the dog and the diamond
as man and woman's best friend, many people are probably aware that
their PC can help them with their photography and other graphics.
</P>
<P>
   What most people don't know is that computers can also edit
moving-picture photography, i.e., home videos.
</P>
<P>
   Many software packages are out there, available at any large
software store. These programs allow you to feed your videotape
into the computer and do everything from rearranging footage to
adding characters, animation, music and narration as well as using
special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Two programs for PC owners, Video Wave and VideoStudio, are
relatively inexpensive at $100 and allow you all the editing
options various editing boards provide. An added advantage is the
chance to add animation to your tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Apple owners can take advantage of Final Cut, a program modeled
after the AVID program that professionals use. It, too, falls into
a reasonable price range.
</P>
<P>
   In order to use this software, the more memory and speed your
computer has, the better. Although the minimum requirements are a
166-megahertz processor and 16 megabytes of RAM, you really need
more. It's best to have 32 megabytes of RAM and a 200-megahertz
processor. In addition to sufficient hard drive capacity, a special
video card is necessary to feed the video from your VCR or camera
into the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Digital video cameras are causing a stir with camera buyers,
which brings us to new technology for editing. Everything mentioned
has been out there for years, but now camera operators are faced
with a new option.
</P>
<P>
   Digital cameras do have better-quality resolution, and the
footage, after being put through the editing process, comes out
cleaner, says David Armstrong of Wolf Camera video sales. Digital
video is more popular than the high-eight format because it yields
a finished product with the look of film. Professionals are
attracted to digital video because of this quality and its
lower-than-film price tag.
</P>
<P>
   However, high-eight still offers good quality, and editing with
either tape has the same requirements and options. The equipment is
the same. Digital cameras also allow you to take a still picture
from your footage.
</P>
<P>
   For technophobes, or those who don't have adequate computers to
run the programs, other options exist. Editing boards sell for $100
to $1,000 at stores that sell video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Editing boards sit between your VCR and camera. The board
contains the technology to produce a series of effects that can
alter the footage in the camera before it goes to the final tape.
You can watch the editing process on your TV.
</P>
<P>
   Editing boards come in different varieties.
</P>
<P>
   A character generator allows you to write titles, dates and
other symbols onto a screen. You can even add film credits to your
home video. The board looks just like a computer keyboard and is
just as easy to use. The catch: All it does is add numbers, letters
and symbols in various colors and fonts to your footage, and it's
pretty expensive for just that (around $799 by Videonics or $200 by
Sima).
</P>
<P>
   Special effects generators are a more useful type of editing
board because they have a lot of options, not just character
capabilities. Not only can you cut and paste footage as when you
use two VCRs, you can do fades, wipes, slow motion and instant
replays. It is possible to fade the picture and sound into darkness
or bring them both into light.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of options to play around with. Upscale
character generators (like the Videonics MX1 Digital Video Mixer
for $1,000) let you edit from four sources at one time. You can put
a smaller screen within a screen, make small images get bigger,
reverse images, and zoom in and out of images. There are about 250
effects. Also, the quality is as close to professional as you can
get without spending $100,000 or so for equipment.
</P>
<P>
   If the $1,000 price tag is too much for you, don't get
discouraged. Sima makes a special effects generator that will allow
you to do many of the effects that the MX1 does. You can still
fade, do wipes and have dissolves. Pictures within pictures and
smaller images within bigger images are exclusive to the $1,000
price range. But the Sima SFII costs just $200, and your video will
have a professional finish. There are enough effects on the Sima
board to keep the average home videographer busy.
</P>
<P>
   Even more basic than the SFII is the Edit Master by Sima ($149),
which allows you to cut and paste footage as well as add sound.
Keep in mind an editing board is an extra piece of equipment, and
the editing process can be time-consuming..
</P>
<P>
   As you make lists of the equipment that you'd like, don't lose
sight of the fact that the person behind the camera determines the
standard of the video. For some tips, check out Sima Products' Web
site at www.simacorp.com. It offers a section with tips for the
home video maker.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who merely want to document life with a video
camera, good editing is worthwhile. Your eyes and your audience
will thank you. Who knows, maybe you'll win an Oscar. Just don't
forget to mention me in your acceptance speech.

Bypassing the mall an individual cosmetic decision 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Buying makeup would seem to be the one thing you just
cannot do on the Internet. Lipstick with names like Russian Red,
Viva Glam or Sheer Plum may sound enticing, but until you slap a
stripe across your wrist, there's no way of telling if it will make
you look sensual or silly.
</P>
<P>
   Makeup looks different on different people. Once, a very peeved
saleswoman at the Chanel counter at Saks Fifth Avenue practically
reached across the counter to smack my friend Janet because the red
tones absolutely refused to stay red and turned a bizarre shade of
orange when Janet tried them on.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is my friend Linda, who is allergic to certain kinds
of perfume. She can't breathe and her eyes start to water when she
smells certain scents.
</P>
<P>
   These women are not weird. Makeup has an individual look and
feel on everyone who wears it. Cosmetic companies know this and are
trying with some success to develop Web sites that evoke a brand,
an image and a color selection women might actually want to go out
and buy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most sites warn customers what you see isn't always what
you'll get. The colors on the monitor may not be the same colors
you'll find in the mall. Online ordering is available from
companies, but the process is clunky and prices are often higher
than you'd find in many stores. Lipsticks recently for sale online
at one site cost $14 plus tax and shipping but were only $12 plus
tax at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus for most cosmetic sites is not shopping but
increasing brand awareness and image and teaching consumers about
their products.
</P>
<P>
   A growing trend for makeup sites is to give users an interactive
consultation. The notion of letting customers play with colors
keyed to their skin tone was pioneered by Cover Girl several years
ago. Cover Girl (www.covergirl.com) originally asked users to try
out eye shadows and lipsticks on the virtual faces of supermodels
such as Tyra Banks.
</P>
<P>
   But most women quickly found out that while most anything looks
good on Tyra, the average Web-surfing woman isn't so lucky. To its
credit, Cover Girl's site now lets women choose makeup, not only
according to their coloring, but other factors as well, including
lifestyle and personality.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the British-based Body Shop (www.bodyshop.com)
devoted most of its Web site to a brand-awareness campaign that
stressed its political activism, detailed the company's
no-animal-testing policy and documented how Body Shop products help
people in Third World countries. It was a great branding strategy
but offered almost no information about its products, let alone
where to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   But the Body Shop site has grown up. While it still touts the
company's environmental and political activities, it now offers the
interactive features Cover Girl uses.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, the Urban Decay site (www.urbandecay.com) was
all about weird poetry, lists of places to kiss and
not-too-realistic representations of its offbeat but very wearable
lipstick, eye shadow and nail polish.
</P>
<P>
   The list of places to kiss is still there, but so are several
key improvements, including detailed text descriptions of what
colors like ``manic depressive,'' ``roach'' and ``AC/DC'' are
supposed to look like. Online ordering is available but stops you
before you enter your credit card number to tease you into buying
something else. While this may work at the makeup counter, it's
just time-consuming and crass on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   With all its drawbacks, shopping online may be the only
alternative for fashion mavens who must have the latest colors no
matter what, but it's the rare woman who wears only one company's
products.
</P>
<P>
   Sites like Eve.com offer a good selection of cult brands like
BeneFit and Philosophy that turn up in all the magazines but are
often hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   With a variety of products, tips and hints, Eve is a good bet if
you know what you want and what you like and just want to stock up
on your favorites.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that makeup aggregators like Eve.com will be the real
Web winners in this difficult online category.

Feedback on `Solitaire' reveals individual players' preferences 
By Jack Warner  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No column I've written since the one years ago
bad-mouthing the Macintosh has drawn so much response as the recent
one about Microsoft's ``Solitaire'' game, and it was delightful.
</P>
<P>
   So delightful, in fact, that I want to share some of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bunny'' scoffed at my disdain for players who turn one card at
a time. ``I challenge you to score 8634/Time 88,'' she boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Score? Bunny, it matters not whether you win or lose, but how
you play the game.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful woman who persisted in calling herself a ``little
old lady'' didn't even know she had a ``Solitaire'' game in her
computer and wanted to know how to find it. You ought to try typing
out the entire route from the desktop to ``Solitaire.'' It's easy
to do mouse-wise, but the written directions look something like
the procedure for launching an ICBM.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the lady found her ``Solitaire'' game and at last
report was well immersed in it.
</P>
<P>
   A man named George, who at the age of 80 is teaching computers
at a senior center, insists we can do better than Windows
``Solitaire.''
</P>
<P>
   He prefers one which, he says, ``I downloaded four years ago
when it had only 150 games and paid $25 for the program. It has
been upgraded at no additional cost and is now at 300 games. It is
flexible and allows you to select how it is to be played, i.e., you
can elect to take back a move you didn't like. One- or three-card
draws and many more. It keeps track of your play and will tell you
your percent of wins for any of the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs nothing to download, will let you play for 30 days
and then turns you off if you don't send $29 in, but you get a good
try. The name is: `Pretty Good Solitaire' with a Web site at
www.goodsol.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is most interesting. You can enter your own games,
talk to others interested or get in competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, George, that sounds very good. I haven't looked at it yet,
but there's no reason why someone couldn't make a better solitaire
game than the one Windows provides. Windows does provide many of
the game play variations you describe. But a young fellow of a mere
72 years has the key to my preference:
</P>
<P>
   ``RIGHT ON, JACK!!'' he begins. ``The Windows `Solitaire' has
given me endless hours of enjoyment and I agree with you; the
graphics are great. There is one other solitaire game similar to
this one that I obtained from some software, and the one advantage
is that you only have to click your mouse to move a card to another
pile; but the graphics leave much to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I also like about the Windows version is that it is
large enough for these old eyes to see.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. We don't have to put our nose to the screen
to tell one card from another.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur, who must be a youngster since he doesn't provide an age,
reports that, ``I too like Microsoft's `Solitaire.' (Of course, you
can only trust me half the time as I many times turn one card at a
time.) People look at me like I am crazy because I reject `Doom,'
`Quake,' etc., etc. I like the quickness of `Solitaire' _ of
course, it is even quicker when I select the draw-three option and
lose. I have never had a problem running `Solitaire.' I only have
two complaints about Microsoft's `Solitaire': The green background
cannot be easily changed, and moving exposed cards from a pile does
not automatically turn the next card.''
</P>
<P>
   No accounting for taste. It never occurred to me to change the
green background, and games that automatically turn the next card
bother me. It ruins the suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne writes that he's got a problem with the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden it would no longer open. I let it go after a
few attempts. I had to format my system due to various problems.
After I once again entered Windows 98, I thought I could try the
solitaire again. No luck, it would not open even with the system
entered anew. Have you run into any problems such as this with your
system?''
</P>
<P>
   No, but nothing surprises me _ except that reformatting the
drive and re-installing Windows should have cured it. Somebody out
there ought to be able to help, though. If anyone has a solution,
let me know and I'll pass it on to Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have room for all the nice responses, but let me finish
with the brief e-mail from Sue, who sums it up for all of us
computer cabbages:
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the game `Solitaire' because it is a great stress
reliever. I can play a game of `Solitaire' and forget everything
but the game.''

Just a name needed to find long-lost friend 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the average, Americans move once every four years.
The days of staying in one place _ of a real hometown _ seem to be
slipping away. If you're like most folks, you've lost touch with
some people who were once important parts of your life.
</P>
<P>
   Now that more and more of us are online, the Web and the
Internet have become a great people locator. Today we'll look at
some of the ways you can use the Web to find lost friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with an obvious and easy way _ the Web-based
directories for phone numbers and e-mail addresses. Two of my
favorites are Switchboard (www.switchboard.com) and Bigfoot
(www.bigfoot.com). Using either directory is so simple that
directions really aren't required. Just enter the name and as much
address information as you know.
</P>
<P>
   If you know the city, that sure makes things easy, but you can
do searches with just the state and the last name filled. But when
I tried the search without designating a state or first name _ even
with a name as unusual as ``Husted'' _ I got nearly 200 hits. If
your friend is named ``Smith'' or ``Williams'' you'd just be flat
out of luck if you can't at least supply a state.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to find telephone numbers and e-mail addresses
using either search engine. Since these lists aren't universal, try
several if the first one doesn't list your friend.
</P>
<P>
   You may get a list of several people with the same name.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're not sure which person is your friend, you'll need
to send e-mail to all of them, explaining your search. That's a lot
less intrusive than a phone call and is, of course, free.
</P>
<P>
   Another good way to find someone is by using a general purpose
Web search engine. For searches like this, I prefer AltaVista
(www.altavista.com), since it seems to be more thorough than some
of the others. On AltaVista, you'd simply use the name as the
search words. So, if you were looking for me, you could type in
``+Bill +Husted'' ... the plus signs would tell AltaVista that both
words must be found on the page. Not all search engines use the
same methods, but you'll find a help button on any of them that
explains how to set up a search.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in my case, I have a personal Web page and my columns
appear in several newspapers and also on some Web sites. So that
would be an easy search. But even if the person you are searching
for isn't as publicly visible, you'd be surprised at how effective
this search method is at finding someone.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your long-lost friend doesn't have a Web page, chances
are that he or she has left some tracks on the Web. For instance,
some Web pages have guest books that visitors sign; a friend of
your friend may mention them on a Web page; or your friend's
company or school may include the name on a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Another place to try _ and it's especially helpful when you
don't know the married name of an old friend _ is a Web site called
Classmates.Com. It has compiled lists of school classmates, listed
by the graduation year. Even if your friend isn't listed, you can
correspond with other classmates and perhaps find the name and
address of your friend.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there are more sophisticated ways to search on the
Web. Most of these more sophisticated search sites charge a fee,
and some are basically detective agencies. We'll leave those sites
for another day.

New niche magazine Sony Style covers what's chic in the world of
high tech 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You know technology has become chic when it gets its
own style magazine. That's what happened with the launch of Sony
Style. The premiere issue features stories about how celebrities
incorporate digital gizmos into their lives. Fashion designer Diane
Von Furstenberg, for example, explains how she designed a ``life
vest'' for the wired woman. The vest includes pockets for a cell
phone, MiniDisc player and camcorder, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Internet Life dedicates its September issue to how people
use the Internet. You'll find articles about the Net's impact on
ordinary people and a discussion of whether blacks and Latinos are
being left behind by the rapid growth of the Web. There are also
snapshots of Web use across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if you could hold every issue of Mad magazine ever
published in the palm of your hand. Well, this is no longer
fantasy. Broderbund has published a collection of the magazines on
seven computer CDs. The set, called ``Totally Mad,'' features 50
years of back issues. The collection is available only for PCs with
Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   The Web is a great place to research your family tree. One of
the better sites for geneaological searches is Ancestry.com. The
site includes a massive index of some 240 million names. There are
also more than 1,600 searchable archives from a host of public
archives. This depth of resources comes at a price: $59.95 a year,
to be precise. But the site also makes a limited amount of its
database free. You'll find the site at www

Plenty of top-quality, discontinued software available for free on
Web 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a wonderful trend under way on the Internet
that you might want to check out. Developers are posting
discontinued commercial Mac software. It's free for the
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't shareware. It's stuff like WordPerfect, at one time
the leading contender to Word.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that these programs are no longer supported, so
you can't expect any technical help. Nor will there be any
upgrades. You'll have to live with the programs' bugs and glitches.
</P>
<P>
   That said, much of what's available is a great deal. Take
WordPerfect, which Corel has decided to no longer develop for the
Mac. That's a shame, because this was a very good word processor.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can have this program for free. It offers 90 percent of
the features you'll find in Word.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect has such automated features as sentence
capitalization and correction of common misspellings. It also has
strong layout and design features. You'll find WordPerfect at
www.corel.com/products/macintosh/wpmac35/packfreedownload.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Another free word processor available online is version 4.1.6 of
Nisus Writer.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus Writer is a bit more obscure than WordPerfect, but it's
still an excellent program. Nisus Writer includes features still
incorporated in any word processor, Mac or PC. You'll find this
program at www.nisus.com/news/pr/980925.asp.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Nisus Writer doesn't have is an outliner. Now you can
find a great one for free. It's called More and, although it was
discontinued several years ago, many observers still consider the
program the best of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   More was developed by famed programmer Dave Winer, who has
regained the rights and posted the program online. You'll find More
3.1 at www.outliners
</P>
<P>
   .com/more31.html.
</P>
<P>
   More, Nisus Writer and WordPerfect are just a few examples of
what you can now find online. There are plenty of other programs
out there.

Site offers boorish men a way to say `I'm sorry' 
By Mark Clothier  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Are you cursed with a tendency toward moronic behavior
in your relationships and an inability to explain yourself out of
predicaments?
</P>
<P>
   A site called Mark's Apology Note Generator, net.indra.com
</P>
<P>
   /(tilde)karma/formletter.html, is a kind of do-it yourself
doghouse-extraction letter-creator geared toward idiotic men.
</P>
<P>
   Using multiple-choice phrases on pull-down menus, the site
creates an apology letter that can be e-mailed to a wife or
girlfriend for free. (Warning: Skip the link to the women's site.
The language is offensive, and content is meager in comparison.)
</P>
<P>
   The site is included in the September issue of Yahoo Internet
Life magazine's roundup of Incredibly Useful Sites.
</P>
<P>
   The cover story takes an interesting look at how Americans use
the Internet. The story includes a feature on the Web habits of
``regular'' people, including a Pez collector, a biker and a sports
fan.
</P>
<P>
   The story is sprinkled with interesting statistics: half of 1
percent of people who visit Web sites actually click on the
advertisements, and Wednesday is the day most people shop online.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Of the 100.9 million Americans with Internet access, 52
percent are male and 48 percent are female, 80 percent are
Caucasian and 68 percent are older than 40.
</P>
<P>
   America ranks fifth in the world by number of users per capita.
Iceland leads the pack with 320.9 users per 1,000, followed by
Finland, Norway and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Latin-flavored music rumbas onto Web
</P>
<P>
   First came the Summer of Ricky. Now Latin music is staking a
solid claim on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.eritmo.com, will be available to the public
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It features live chats with Latin musicians, fan clubs and pages
devoted to the artists.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the evolving crossover appeal of Latin music,
highlighted by the success of Ricky Martin's CD this summer, the
site's content will be available in English, Spanish and, later
this year, Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and board members include Roland Hernandez, chairman
of Telemundo Group; Michael H. Jordan, former chairman of CBS
Television; and Derek Reisfield, former president of new media for
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Reisfield helped create CBS MarketWatch.com and CBS
SportsLine.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be divided into six areas: news; music, which will
include samples and songs that can be downloaded; fans, which will
include links to fan-club sites; chat; concerts, which will include
live Webcasts for concerts, reviews, video archives, schedules and
the ability to buy concert tickets; and videos.
</P>
<P>
   The site will be free to visitors. It will make money from
advertising, promotions and by selling music, merchandise and
concert tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Camcorder fits in your palm
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Electronics' new digital camcorder fits in your palm and
sells for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The VL-SD20U comes with a 3-inch color LCD screen. The device is
6.4 inches wide, 3.8 inches high and 2.9 inches deep and weighs
1.21 pounds without its battery pack and cassette.
</P>
<P>
   The camcorder also has a feature, called Digital Gamma
Brightness Correction, that darkens the background light of any
image and makes the subject brighter.
</P>
<P>
   The image screen has 660,000 CCD pixels and up to 50 lines of
clear image reproduction. It also lets the user capture still
images and transfer them to a PC, TV or VCR.
</P>
<P>
   The camcorder has an optional PC Connection kit, which sells for
$129, that lets users transfer images to a PC to edit, process and
customize. The connection package includes PixLab Browser software,
PhotoSuite 8.0 and a cable. The PhotoSuite software lets you
manipulate the images using more than 20 filters.

</P>
<P>
   _ Focus on your children's sense of pride. Mention the
satisfaction from doing something on your own.
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk to your children early and often. Then they will continue
to turn to you as they grow older.
</P>
<P>
   _ Practice what you preach. Children notice actions more than
words.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assure children that cheating is neither normal nor
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask children where the world would be if everyone cheated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Focus on fueling a love of learning, rather than obsessing
over grades and scores.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't overextend children in an effort to keep them
``well-rounded.'' Children without ample time to study are more apt
to cheat.

 &HT;    NEW ADS TELL KIDS 'CHEATING IS A PERSONAL FOUL'
 &HT;    600&AMP;add. With CHEATING-TIPS.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With more students than ever saying they cheat,
education groups and advertising agencies Wednesday launched a
$35-million-a-year ad campaign aimed at reversing the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the work, take the test, listen to the ref in your head,''
chant the first two 30-second TV spots, which show several children
10 to 14 as each turns down a friend's offer to share homework or
slip them answers to a test.
</P>
<P>
   The perky, fast-paced ads are punctuated by blasts of a whistle
blown by a referee described by the ad's designers as ``a very much
larger-than-life fantasy.'' Each spot closes with the visual and
verbal message: ``Cheating is a personal foul.''
</P>
<P>
   The public service ads are aimed at children in middle or junior
high schools. That age group was targeted because the Educational
Testing Service (ETS) and the Ad Council concluded that older
students in high school and college resist such messages and
younger students in elementary school don't feel as much pressure
to get good grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our youngest children know in their hearts that cheating is
wrong, but they lose that conviction along the way,'' said Sharon
Robinson, an ex-teacher who is chief executive officer of ETS.
</P>
<P>
   Donald McCabe, a Rutgers University professor who founded the
Center for Academic Integrity, said, ``Cheating unfortunately, is
common in all sectors of our educational system.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that more students than ever acknowledge they have
cheated, but it is hard to sort out how much of the trend is due to
an increase in cheating and how much to an increase in candor about
cheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more who just aren't ashamed about cheating any
more,'' McCabe said. ``Some are doing it because it's easy. Some
are doing it because they just don't want to be left out.''
</P>
<P>
   In his survey this year of 593 middle-school and 455 high-school
students in New Jersey, McCabe found patterns that emerged in
earlier nationwide studies:
</P>
<P>
   _ 87 percent in middle school and 90 percent in high school said
they have seen another student cheat on a test or exam.
</P>
<P>
   _ 74 percent in middle school and 78 percent in high school
reported at least one example of their own cheating on a test or
exam.
</P>
<P>
   _ Routine cheating increased by grades. The portion reporting
they had cheated on a test or exam more than three times was 20
percent in 6th grade, 35 percent in 7th grade, 60 percent in eighth
grade and 80 percent among high school juniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that point, in my view, you have a student who has made the
decision that when necessary, he or she will cheat to achieve the
goal or the grade they are after,'' McCabe said.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, scheduled to appear on donated air time starting this
month, are based on months of research. Children 10 to 14 were
unmoved by test ads using jingles or hip hop, presenting ``choose
not to cheat'' testimony by other children or adult celebrities, or
showing a medical student whose cheating turns him into an
ill-prepared surgeon whose patient dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't see cheating as a life-or-death matter like
smoking,'' said Paul Kurnit, president of Griffin Bacal Inc. His ad
agency, which specializes in marketing aimed at children,
volunteered to create the sports-oriented ad campaign, , which
includes a Web site (www.nocheating.org), and will expand into
radio, print and give-aways of referee's whistles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports are a way of life for today's kids (that) inspires
talent and tenacity in a forum in which cheating is not
tolerated,'' said Kurnit, who described the referee as ``an
iconization, an impartial symbol, of distinguishing right from
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   McCabe said older children cheat more because they have acquired
more cheating skills. More fundamentally, he said, they are more
likely to view cheating as ``a coping measure to deal with the
pressures of school and, particularly at the high school level,
with the pressure from parents for good grades, because of the
impact that will have on their college admission.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Cole, president of ETS, said, ``The message we're working
against is the message that cheating's okay.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that pro-cheating message can come from the example
offered by adults as close as parents who lie to avoid traffic
tickets or brag about cheating on income taxes, or as distant as
``the indiscretions of the president and the indiscretions of
congressional leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said the ETS and its allies turned to the Ad Council for
help because, ``If you have an issue that you wish to reach a large
number of people with, there's no alternative but advertising in
this society.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar ad campaigns helped reduce forest fires, increase
recycling and discourage drunk driving and convince more people to
wear seat belts, Ad Council officers said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-cheating campaign has the support of several ethics
centers, the National Association of Secondary School Principals,
the National Honor Society and the Council of Chief State School
Officers.

SLAIN UNION OFFICER MADE EMBALMING ACCEPTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MECHANICVILLE, N.Y. _ Kenneth Ellsworth, the closest living
relative of Col. Elmer E. Ellsworth _ the first Union officer
killed in the Civil War _ shrugs when asked to talk about his
fourth cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crazy about soldiering; he was one of those gung-ho
guys,'' said Kenneth Ellsworth, a 73-year-old former letter carrier
still living in the colonel's hometown. ``In this day and age,
they'd call him a nut.'' Well, Col. Ellsworth may be the best-known
nut in Mechanicville.
</P>
<P>
   The city's stationery contains his profile; the city's VFW post
bears his name; a statue commemorating his actions stands near his
burial site in the Hudson View Cemetery; and now, a new city
historical marker will be unveiled near Ellsworth Avenue in a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to Thomas Salvadore, a city funeral home owner, and
Susan Kilpatrick, executive director at the Brookside Museum in
Saratoga County, Ellsworth has gained recognition in a whole
different kind of historical light: as the first American ever to
be embalmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned about it back in the 1970s when I was taking a
mortuary science course at Hudson Valley Community College,''
Salvadore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was researching a paper on the modern methods of embalming,
and this history book told the story of a Dr. Holmes, who had been
called the father of embalming because he was the first American to
experiment with it during the beginning of the Civil War,''
Salvadore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then when I read that the first soldier to be embalmed by Dr.
Holmes was a friend of Lincoln's from a small city near Albany
named Mechanicville, everything clicked _ it was Ellsworth!''
Salvadore said.
</P>
<P>
   Salvadore didn't do anything with the information until recently
when Kilpatrick heard of the story, contacted Salvadore, and began
publicizing the new fact about Ellsworth on the Brookside Web site
(www.brooksidemuseum.org).
</P>
<P>
   Americans viewed embalmment _ preventing the decay of remains
with chemical preservatives _ as against the laws of nature and God
during much of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   But ``embalming became more acceptable due to Ellsworth's
wakes,'' Kilpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellsworth needed to be embalmed because there were four
separate wakes for him held around the country, and his body needed
to be preserved as best as possible for as long as possible,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without being embalmed, his body wouldn't have lasted through
the heat, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Embalming was already popular in Europe when Dr. Thomas Holmes
traveled to Washington hoping to make his fortune embalming bodies
for transport home.
</P>
<P>
   His calculations paid off. The Civil War proved to be a catalyst
for the increased popularization of embalming because it allowed
bodies to be shipped home year-round.
</P>
<P>
   It cost about $100 to embalm Ellsworth, using zinc chloride with
an arsenic base, Kilpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, ``probably 65 to 70 percent of people get
embalmed,'' said Salvadore. ``It is the preferred method, or `the'
method, for preservation of a body.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Elmer Ellsworth, a native of New York state, worked as Lincoln's
law clerk in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellsworth held a romanticized view of warfare, and he used to
attract 60,000 to 70,000 people in Chicago before the war when he
led a regiment nicknamed the French Zouaves,'' a military drill
team that conducted marching performances and military displays,
said Paul Loatman, the Mechanicville historian.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln took political advantage of Ellsworth's crowds, and the
favors were returned when Lincoln asked him to accompany him to
Washington in 1861.
</P>
<P>
   By May 24, 1861, Confederate troops occupied Alexandria, Va.,
across the Potomac River from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rebel flag could be seen over the Marshall House in Virginia
from Lincoln's bedroom from the White House, something Ellsworth
just couldn't stand,'' Loatman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Ellsworth went across the river and tore down the flag, but
as he was coming down the mansion's stairs, he was shot by the
inn's owner,'' James W. Jackson, Loatman said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson himself was then shot by a Union soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Col. Ellsworth was killed, it sent shock waves throughout
the nation,'' Loatman said. ``It brought home the reality that this
war could get serious, and Lincoln was crestfallen, stupefied at
losing Ellsworth, whom he viewed as a lost son.''
</P>
<P>
   Union troops recovered Ellsworth's body, and he was displayed at
the White House on May 25. That same day, he was taken by train to
New York City Hall, where 10,000 New Yorkers mourned him.
</P>
<P>
   A steamship then took his body to Albany on May 27, where he lay
in the state Capitol. Ellsworth finally arrived home on May 28 by
train, where the fourth and final wake was held, and he was buried
at the Hudson View Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funniest thing about Ellsworth,'' said Kenneth Ellsworth,
``was that he couldn't have even joined his own post because he was
not a foreign war veteran _ all his soldiering was done in the
U.S.''

`SOMETIMES,' YOU SHOULD JUST SKIP A MOVIE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK ... FOR MORE'
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; 1999, R, Trimark, VHS priced for rental, DVD $24.99
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes producers buy sequel rights that go beyond the force
of their source material.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they come back with more and more movies despite
having less and less of a story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   This is such a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes They Come Back ... for More'' is the third movie
based on the same Stephen King short story from his ``Night Shift''
collection.
</P>
<P>
   King's tale first was turned into a 1991 TV movie called
``Sometimes They Come Back,'' then was spun into a knock-off for
video in 1996 dubbed ``Sometimes They Come Back ... Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes this unwanted third thudder, which is no more a true
King adaptation than ``The Lawnmower Man,'' whose absurd liberties
with King's work _ while brandishing his name _ had the author
howling in protest.
</P>
<P>
   At least here King doesn't get misleading prominent billing. His
credit is buried beneath the no-name cast _ which at least has
familiar faces.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a soldier who probes murders at an Antarctic base is
Clayton Rohner. He starred in the underrated ``Modern Girls'' and
once guest-starred on ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' Chase
Masterson, a ``Deep Space Nine'' alumnus, plays his fellow officer.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the film they indulge in emotional histrionics over
bumps in the night (but precious little horror) and get all cranky
from cabin fever.
</P>
<P>
   Finally this exploitation film starts exploiting, via
supernatural mayhem from pentagrams, sacrificial altars and zombies
and gratuitous nudity in perplexing flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The script has one good zinger. As an icebound character
complains, ``If you guys are waiting for hell to freeze over,
you're a little bit late.''
</P>
<P>
   Like 1951's and 1982's ``The Thing,'' ``Sometimes'' uses wintry
polar desolation for haunting eeriness. But the ambience is
undercut by production values, which are as meager as the plot is
slow.
</P>
<P>
   In scene after scene amid the bitter polar cold, frosted breath
never appears.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the action was shot on a sound stage in Santa
Clarita, Calif., and the budget didn't allow for adding breath
digitally or ``Exorcist''-style freezing of the sets.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you can allow for cheapness. Sometimes a film succeeds
anyway with guile, wit and inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   But this ``Sometimes'' is no such film. A failed stab at a
wintry ``Night of the Living Dead,'' it's often more lifeless than
living. 1 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FREDDY IN A BOX &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Krueger is clawing his way onto the pre-Halloween
bandwagon with new boxed sets for his remastered movies.
</P>
<P>
   Due this week for $89.98, the VHS set has all seven ``Nightmare
on Elm Street'' movies, which also are sold separately for $14.98.
(Only individual tapes have a wide-screen option.) Extras include
theatrical trailers and interviews with the directors.
</P>
<P>
   Due Sept. 21, the DVD boxed set offers much more: wide-screen
format, a bonus ``Encyclopedia'' disc, a 36-page booklet of
production notes, photos and essays, and two pairs of 3-D glasses
for watching the 3-D segment of ``Freddy's Dead: The Final
Nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The DVD set goes for $129.98, while individual films on DVD cost
$24.98.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`FOUR WEDDINGS' ON DVD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also arriving on DVD this week is ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral'' for $24.98. It includes a widescreen option, the
theatrical trailer and an eight-page booklet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`HOME' FINALE ON TAPE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Improvement'' may have ended, but it's now on a 90-minute
videotape called ``The Series Finale'' (Touchstone, $19.99).
</P>
<P>
   Also shown are previously unseen bloopers and outtakes from the
series' eight-year run, as well as cast interviews and a
behind-the-scenes look at the final episode's creation.

   Wrong Sunflower
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have a large terrace in Manhattan and each year we plant
sunflower seeds. We always manage to get lovely blooms but the
centers are yellow rather than the black pictured on the packet,
which is somewhat disappointing. Do you know the reason for this?
Is it the soil?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If they grow at all, the soil's not to blame. Unlike
hydrangeas, which can be sweet-talked into changing from pink to
blue or back again by changing the soil pH, sunflowers are stubborn
_ their colors are genetically determined.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerry Miller, a geneticist at the Agriculture Department's
Northeast Crop Science Laboratory in Fargo, N.D., is one of the
country's foremost sunflower breeders. He said that dark centers,
or disk flowers, are controlled by a gene that produces dark
pigments. Since this is a dominant gene, any sunflower that has it
will have a dark center no matter how you grow it.
</P>
<P>
   Since you don't mention growing a particular sunflower, for
example Sonia or Holiday, which both have dark centers, you may
have ended up with a package of seeds that simply had a generic
photograph of a sunflower on it, but a different seed inside.
</P>
<P>
   Next year don't make it any old sunflower _ choose one (or a
dozen) that will really turn heads among your neighbors. A wide
range of interesting sunflowers, including those with dark centers,
are available from Shepherd's Garden Seeds, 30 Irene St.,
Torrington, Conn. 06790, (860) 482-3638, and Park Seed, 1 Parkton
Ave., Greenwood, S.C. 29647, (800) 845-3369. Both offer free
catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Fall Planting Hazards
</P>
<P>
   Q. I wanted to plant a magnolia but my nurseryman said magnolias
shouldn't be planted in the fall. Why not?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For most trees, fall is the best time to plant. The soil is
warm but not waterlogged the way it can be in spring, and trees
without leaves make fewer demands on their roots to provide
nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something about a few trees, including magnolia,
birch, hawthorn, black gum, tulip tree and most oaks, that makes
them cranky when planted in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure, but researchers think that there is
something that prevents their root structure from taking up enough
water to overcome transplant shock, and that winter comes before
the tree is ready for it.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by Dr. Nina Bassuk at the Cornell University Urban
Horticulture Institute in Ithaca, N.Y., show that transplanting
these trees when smaller increases the fall planting success rate.
She has had much better results with trees that measure less than
two inches in diameter at a point six inches above where the trunk
emerges from the roots than with larger trees. Be sure to water
that new tree in well. Whether it has leaves or not, it needs
water. Watering also settles the soil and helps eliminate any air
pockets. Dormant trees planted in October or early November should
only need that one, deep, soothing watering to last all winter.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Timing, Not the Total
</P>
<P>
   Q. If the current hurricane season is as strong as predicted,
will the additional rain make up for the drought that has
devastated our landscape?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The rain will refill the reservoirs, but as far as trees and
shrubs are concerned, the damage is already done. Leaf scorch,
browning of the edges, is already apparent, and some trees,
especially maples, are showing early fall color as they prepare to
give up and wait for next year.
</P>
<P>
   But many signs won't show up until next spring or even the next
couple of years. Drought-stressed trees and shrubs may become more
susceptible to disease and insects. Twigs and even entire branches
may die. Some maples' crowns may not seem as full as they were
before the drought. And more years of summer drought will do more
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Watering trees slowly and deeply during dry summers is boring,
but during a hot summer, newly planted trees should get 20 gallons
of water every four to five days. One solution being used by some
municipalities is the Treegator Bag, water-filled plastic bags that
zip around a tree trunk (two can be zipped together for larger
trees). Each bag drips 14 or 20 gallons of water into the soil over
a 6- to 10-hour period, depending on the size of the bag. They sell
for around $20. Retail sources are available from Treegator
Irrigation Systems at (800) 800-7391.

   AOL Options for Browsers
</P>
<P>
   Q. I use America Online for my Internet service provider, but
how would I install a Web browser other than the one from AOL?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have version 3.0 or later of AOL's software, you can
run different Web browsers with it. With these later versions, you
can run just about any Internet program from your AOL connection,
including Telnet, FTP (file transfer protocol, good for downloading
files from remote servers) and Internet relay chat, or IRC.
</P>
<P>
   You can download a copy of Netscape's Communicator or
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser directly from AOL. Windows
users are advised to use the AOL keyword NETSCAPE to get to the
downloading area for Communicator and BROWSER for Internet
Explorer. AOL advises Macintosh users to stroll through the Mac
Orchard (www.macorchard.com), a Web site devoted to Apple-friendly
Internet applications. AOL's online help area (keyword: HELP) has
more information about how to set each of these up.
</P>
<P>
   After you've installed the new browser software, sign on to AOL
and then open the browser program. You will need to have enough
memory available on your computer to have both these programs open
at once. Cnet, the technology news site, also keeps a helpful page
(home.cnet.com/category/0-3773.html) devoted to Web browsing
software and how to use it.

A SEPTEMBER DRESS REHEARSAL FOR THE YEAR 2000 COMUTER TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer managers are dismissing once-widespread concerns that
Thursday _ the ninth day of of the ninth month of 1999 _ will
provide a nasty preview of the kinds of disruptions expected from
Year 2000 dates.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Year 2000 conferences for computer managers and
industry gatherings regularly featured warnings that a date
represented as 9/9/99 might confuse computers because strings of 9s
can also mean a variety of other things in computer programs, like
``end of program'' and ``this file is filled.''
</P>
<P>
   Some malfunctions are also expected later this month or on Oct.
1 when monthly reports using September data are created.
</P>
<P>
   It is now clear, though, that such problems are far rarer than
Year 2000 date glitches and are largely confined to the world of
giant mainframe computers. They are also easy to locate and
generally a snap to fix.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason for confidence is that most computers will
read Thursday's date as 090999, not 9999.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than waste the heightened awareness of computer date
problems created by fears about Sept. 9, North American utilities,
various government agencies and others are using the day to test
their Year 2000 readiness and contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not expecting any problems with 9/9/99, but it's a good
time to test our reporting system for Year 2000,'' said Lisa
Pellegrin, a spokeswoman for the International Y2K Cooperation
Center, a U.N.-sponsored clearinghouse based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperation center is testing its ability to receive updates
on the status of computer systems in crucial sectors like energy,
telecommunications and banking in various countries and to post
those updates on its intranet site.
</P>
<P>
   The utility industry test will assess the operating and back-up
plans of all major institutions in the generation and distribution
of electricity, including simulated loss of important
communications systems. It treated Wednesday as Dec. 31 and
Thursday as the rollover to Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be our major dress rehearsal for the Year 2000,''
said Eugene F. Gorzelnick, a spokesman for the North American
Electric Reliability Council, which is coordinating the test.
</P>
<P>
   In computer programming, number strings like 9999 were sometimes
plugged in where true dates, like when someone was born, were not
known. They were also used when a future date, like when a program
was to be retired, had not been set. In addition to 9999, 123199,
the last day of this year, was also used by some programmers for
such functions.
</P>
<P>
   Such programming tricks seemed harmless 20 years ago, when Sept.
9 and Dec. 31, 1999, appeared very remote.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Year 2000 computer issue gained attention in the past
few years, fears began to rise that computers would be unable to
distinguish the number strings from data representing the actual
date.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmists spoke of the ``dreaded 9s'' as another potential land
mine that could cause the same kinds of malfunctions expected from
Year 2000 glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Both 9999 and Year 2000 malfunctions can shut computers down or
cause them to generate faulty data. But similarities end there.
While two-digit years in dates were standard practice, using 9999
strings without distinguishing them from potential dates was never
regarded as good programming practice.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 problems exist in virtually all computer languages,
but 9999 glitches occur almost exclusively in Cobol programs that
were written for older mainframes.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts say that some 9999 failures will almost
certainly occur Thursday but that they will not be surprised if
everything appears to go perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to publicly report such failures,'' said Louis
Marcoccio, director of Year 2000 research for the Gartner Group, an
information technology consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The malfunctions can be kept private because 9999 faults are
generally easy to work around if crucial data is backed up and can
be quickly fixed, Marcoccio said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Several Gartner clients have already run into such
problems, but the faults were handled within an hour or two so word
never got out, Marcoccio said.

<P>
   The Sega Dreamcast processor is fast, but a console is only as
good as the games you can play on it. There are two dozen games
scheduled for release before Santa loads up his sled, so the
machine may be worth its $199.99 price tag by Christmas. But after
spending days on end reviewing the debut titles, I didn't see much
that blew my mind. And that's a bad sign because I'm easily amused.
</P>
<P>
   First, the bad news: Sonic the Hedgehog is cheesy and boring,
probably the biggest disappointment of the bunch. Throughout Sega's
history, the blue hedgehog has always harbored a glint in his eye,
an edgy demeanor and a subversive attitude. He was a little bit
bad, and that made him cool. And it made the Sega Genesis console
cool for teen-agers, in contrast with Nintendo's little-kid fare.
</P>
<P>
   For Dreamcast, Sonic has been recast as a cuddly, earnest Dudley
Do-Right adventure hero, complete with gung-ho superhero
voice-overs. He sounds like a walking advertisement _ distinctly
uncool.
</P>
<P>
   He's fast. That seems to be the point of the game: to show off
Dreamcast's frame rate. Unfortunately, 60 frames per second doesn't
guarantee a great game. A lot of the game is scripted _ Sonic just
zooms along without any input from the player.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fantastic technical demonstration. But it's not that
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case for the bulk of Sega's racing games, almost
half of the debut titles. They're generally much the same racing
games we're used to playing on other consoles, with more resolution
and faster frame rates.
</P>
<P>
   They're prettier, but not necessarily more fun, than Grand
Tourismo or F-Zero X for the Playstation and Nintendo 64,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Of the racing games, two set themselves apart. The first, Hydro
Thunder, is an arcade conversion. Visually, it's more interesting
than CART Racing or Monaco Grand Prix because it's powerboat
racing. Powerboats veer and splash in exciting ways, and water is
prettier than a concrete race track.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Dreamcast racers, the only one that inspires
hardware lust is a futuristic hoverboard game called Trick Style,
which is a perfect, delectably scrumptious bonbon of thumb candy.
</P>
<P>
   The physics of the game are dreamy, which is to say that once
you suspend your disbelief about antigravity hoverboards, you can't
help leaning as they turn. Visually, the game is razor sharp and
achingly hip (cyberpunk ravers trailing ribbons of colored light
behind their high-tech skateboards _ fashion editors, take note).
</P>
<P>
   Trick Style shares the trails-of-colored-light effect with
another standout title, Soul Caliber, the Dreamcast version of the
arcade fighting game. Unlike most hand-to-hand brawlers, Soul
Caliber gives each character a signature weapon, and all of these
weapons leave beautiful trails of colored light as they swoop and
twist through the air.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it's difficult to tell whether you're engaged in
combat or in some deadly form of rhythmic gymnastics. In the
arcade, Soul Caliber was gorgeous, and it is no less gorgeous on
the console.
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeous is not a word one would typically use to describe
Mortal Kombat Gold, another arcade hit burned onto a Dreamcast
disk, gory bits and all. At last, it is possible to see geysers of
blood erupt as a gravel-voiced anti-referee instructs you to
``finish him'' in the privacy of your own home. If you prefer
blowing zombies to gory smithereens, House of the Dead 2 has also
been translated from coin-operated to console with every scrap of
rotting flesh intact.
</P>
<P>
   Two other fighting games, Marvel vs. Capcom and King of Fighters
'99, are old-school 2-D fighting games that are beginning to show
their age.
</P>
<P>
   Power Stone, another arcade conversion, isn't as visually slick
as Sega's other 3-D fighting games, but the game play is much more
dynamic. If you're a seasoned video-game ninja, that means
``exciting.'' If you're a novice, that means ``frantic and
impossible to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready 2 Rumble, the only fighting game not borrowed from the
arcade, is a boxing title with fantastically kitschy graphics and
fight-night ambiance (``Get ready to RUMMMMM-BULLLL!!!!!'') that's
tailor-made for beer-soaked dorm-room parties. As a cartoon boxing
game, Ready 2 Rumble also counts (sort of) as a sports title, as
does NFL Blitz 2000, an arcade version of football with no
penalties and no holds barred (the National Football League meets
the World Wrestling Federation).
</P>
<P>
   Half of Sega's debut titles (the games list for $49.99) are
coin-operated conversions. On one hand, that is a very obvious and
natural thing for a company with a successful arcade division to
do. But it does give the console a case of deja vu because some of
the best games on it have been out for a year, albeit on arcade
cabinets. And the relative mediocrity of the original Dreamcast
titles (Trick Style excepted) is not a hopeful sign.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a ray of light. That ray is called NFL 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is, without a doubt, the best football game ever. The level
of detail is unprecedented _ you can see fog of the players' breath
in cold-weather stadiums. You can see their facial expressions. You
can read the names on the back of their jerseys as the game unfolds
from a player's-eye view.
</P>
<P>
   This game does not compete with other football games. This game
competes with a live broadcast, and most of the time it wins.
That's largely because football is a brilliantly designed game,
with or without the console. The NFL 2000 team could devote all of
its time and energy and all of Dreamcast's technology to
visualizing situations based on existing rules. It has proved that
Sega's developers can do a great job simulating a game.
</P>
<P>
   If the team can do an equally good job designing games from
scratch, this console will really be a dream.

 &HT;    SENATOR SEES PROGRESS IN PREPARING FOR Y2K BUG
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This year's massive effort by business owners and
government officials to prepare computers for the date change to
2000 has put the country in much better shape to start the new era,
Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The awareness has paid off,'' with millions of potential
computer problems being averted, Bennett, chairman of the Senate
Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, told the
National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   But with date-related software flaws so widespread, ``random
problems'' are inevitable and ``fingers still need to be crossed,''
he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1998, Bennett's committee has been holding hearings
to gather information and spur action on the so-called Y2K bug. The
problem could cause computer programs, especially older ones, to
misunderstand the two digits representing the year and possibly
malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   If the flaw had not been addressed, the problems could have been
catastrophic, with power plants shutting down and banks losing a
century's worth of records.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, and especially in 1999, the progress by
business owners and government officials in fighting the bug has
been ``far more than I would have predicted,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty lingers because too many companies and local
governments have scheduled their remediation work for late in 1999,
creating ``almost dangerous deadlines,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Given how close some are cutting it, Bennett is ``absolutely
certain'' some problems will result. He urged Americans to have
enough food, batteries, warm clothes and drinking water to cope
with a variety of service interruptions for 72 hours, starting at
midnight Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., vice chairman of the Y2K
committee, also spoke, sharing Bennett's generally optimistic
views. But Dodd said he remains deeply concerned about the
preparedness of the U.S. health care industry, and about other
countries' nuclear power industries. If Russia, for example, fails
to fix the software controlling its nuclear plants, dangerous
accidents could occur.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``greatest threat'' from Y2K is possibility that people
will take it too seriously, triggering panicky stampedes to obtain
cash, medicine and food, he said, warning that such hoarding will
``do far more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said that while fixing the Y2K bug has been an expensive
and difficult task, it has helped alert lawmakers to bigger
problems that will linger well beyond Jan. 1. Congress now is much
more aware of the vulnerability of the country's computers to
hackers, terrorists, industrial spies or even warring enemy
nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rodney Long is an Alabama inventor who typically spends 16 hours
a day on the Internet, logging on to things like inventor forums
and an online patent database (www.patents.ibm.com/ibm.html) that
has been sponsored by IBM since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Long, a former maintenance mechanic for U.S. Steel, has already
seen one of his inventions go into production: a device that moves
granulated materials like cement and sand more reliably through
processing plants. That success has spurred him to keep tinkering,
often with online help. ``Without the Internet,'' he said recently,
``I wouldn't have the other 27 inventions that I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another inventor who is fond of the Internet is Nancy Beaule of
Lewiston, Maine, the inventor of the Pie Saver. (It keeps pie edges
from burning and can be seen at www.betabake.com.)
</P>
<P>
   She applied for a trademark more than a year ago, but had no
idea where her application stood until she checked the Federal
Patent and Trademark Office's Web site four months ago, and
discovered, to her relief, that her trademark was pending. Lately,
she has used the Internet to do patent searches. (The Pie Saver, by
the way, is also available in supermarkets and at Yahoo's shopping
site.)
</P>
<P>
   Inventors like Long and Ms. Beaule are flocking to the Net. To
be sure, part of what they find there is silliness of the mad
inventor variety. There are, for example, roughly a dozen Web sites
that seem to exist solely to highlight kooky _ if not downright
absurd _ inventions. But the silliness is vastly outweighed by Web
sites that together offer a veritable dream shop for inventors.
</P>
<P>
   Inventors can find online support groups, chat rooms, message
boards and patent and trademark databases. And the main goal of
some sites is to alert inventors to those suspicious promotion and
development companies that have long snookered inventors,
especially beginners.
</P>
<P>
   One such company bilked Gary Kellmann out of $3,000 when he was
19 and was trying to sell his first invention, an alarm clock that
could be turned off with a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   Kellmann of St. Charles, Mo., is now 30 and has four inventions
on the market, including adhesive ``belly buttons'' that give a
pierced look without the pain. But he wishes he had had access to
the Internet information when he started out. He used to drive two
hours at a stretch from Southeast Missouri State University in Cape
Girardeau to downtown St. Louis to research patents.
</P>
<P>
   Basic patent searches can be done on line from the comfort of a
computer chair, and pages of resources can be called up in less
time than it takes to say Alexander Graham Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The Patent Office formally opened a full-text patent database on
line in April. Because of the heft of the database, some inventors
say it is best used for cursory searches, rather than the
full-fledged ones that tend to be done by professional search
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the database contains text and images for more than two
million patents, dating to 1976, and more than one million
registered and pending trademarks, dating to 1870 (www.uspto.gov).
</P>
<P>
   Before the new database was rolled out, the Patent Office
offered only abstracts of patents on line. For the complete text,
inventors usually had to visit a federal patent and trademark
depository library, get access to a private _ and often expensive _
online service, or a professional search firm.
</P>
<P>
   Inventors can also find useful information at the sites for the
National Inventors Hall of Fame (www.invent.org) and the United
Inventors Association of the U.S.A. (www.uiausa.com). Both groups
are revamping their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The association recently started offering an invention
evaluation service through its Web site. The service costs $695, or
about half of what an inventor might have to pay for working with,
for example, a patent lawyer and a university evaluation service.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet offers something that is perhaps as important
as databases and services: the opportunity for inventors, who are
often solitary figures, to connect one another.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, such connections were not easy to make. There
were few support groups for inventors and many parts of the country
still do not have them, said Carol Oldenburg, administrator for the
United Inventors Association, a national group with some 3,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   Inventors often keep to themselves because they tend to be
individualistic and ``very paranoid,'' said Victor Lavrov, a
mechanical engineer in Fullerton, Calif., who is also the founder
of Inventnet, a popular Web site (www.inventnet.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Internet, there was minimal communication among
inventors,'' said Ronald J. Riley, an independent inventor who has
a Web site for inventors (www.inventored.org) and posts an online
listing of people and invention promotion firms that he contends
offer questionable value to inventors (www.rjriley.com/site-index).
</P>
<P>
   Like other invention experts, Riley credits the Net with helping
to persuade independent inventors, who include weekend hobbyists
and downsized corporate researchers, to get involved with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventors are now talking more freely and sharing
information,'' said Michael S. Neustel, a patent lawyer who opened
a Web site in August 1998 under the banner of the National Inventor
Fraud Center (www.inventorfraud.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the Internet,'' he added, ``it would also be tough for
consumer-minded organizations like ours to exist. It's just too
time-consuming to contact inventors individually.''
</P>
<P>
   Long, the inventor of the granulated material feeder, credits
the fraud center with helping him avoid an invention promotion firm
that has generated some complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Dr. Frank Evans shows what the Web can mean to
small inventors.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who is retired and lives in Baltimore, Md., spent some
eight years designing a portable wind-powered generator that can
run a device like a small radio or television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Evans posted his invention _ which catches the wind in
cups shaped like Oriental soup spoons _ on a message board that is
offered on line by the Inventors' Network of the Capital Area, a
nonprofit association for inventors in Washington, Maryland and
Virginia (inca.interspeed.net).
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Evans found someone to help him develop the
machine: Fred Currence, a marine engineer who owns a prototype
development shop and who just happens to live 20 blocks away.

BETTING THE FARM ON THE VIRTUAL STORE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For eight years, Fred Parks says, he sold all manner of antiques
and collectibles, ``everything but tube socks and T-shirts,'' from
a series of stores in downtown Baltimore, Md. About a year ago, he
closed his latest store, but he didn't go out of business. He took
his expertise in ceramics _ Art Nouveau, Art Deco and Arts and
Crafts styles _ to Ebay, the largest of the online auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Now working from home and a studio that he rents for $100 a
month, he has lowered his expenses, he says, and increased his
prices and profits. ``If I opened a store, I might have 35 people
on a good day,'' he said. ``I get thousands in my virtual store.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more people are making a living from online auctions,
often closing their brick-and-mortar stores or quitting jobs to
vend bric-a-brac electronically at auctions like the ones at Ebay
(www.ebay.com), Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) and Yahoo
(www.yahoo.com).
</P>
<P>
   According to a report issued in March by Forrester Research, a
consulting company that tracks E-commerce, spending on auction
sites will grow from $1 billion in 1998 to an estimated $2.3
billion this year. While none of the auction sites knows how many
people have turned electronic auctions into full-time jobs, Ebay
estimates that it has about 10,000 ``power sellers,'' who sell
merchandise for $2,000 to $25,000 or more each month.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said he had no regrets about going virtual. ``I at this
point have no interest in ever having a store again,'' he said.
``Why would I?''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, there are the long hours at the computer, and the
tedium of wrapping and sending countless packages. Sometimes the
auction sites crash, suspending business for days and putting a
crimp in the cash flow. And there are the prickly customers who
think nothing of firing off rude e-mail tirades.
</P>
<P>
   But for Parks and others, the increased profits and ability to
open for business at any hour are ample compensation for the
drawbacks of Web auctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Forrester Research study projects that by 2003, auction
sites will account for $6.4 billion in spending. And as more store
owners get a taste of selling on line, more stores will close, the
study predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael May, a digital commerce analyst for Jupiter
Communications, a research firm in Boston, Mass., explained: ``They
are Main Street, mom-and-pop-type stores that realize they are
selling a far greater percentage of their inventory through sites
like Ebay, and they can't justify paying rent anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, take Mike Baker, who had averaged $30,000 to
$40,000 in revenue a year selling baseball cards and photographs
from his store in Springdale, Ark. Now he makes bulk purchases of
movie star photos and art prints to sell in online auctions, and he
reports that his gross revenue is in six figures.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he had been initially startled by the effectiveness
of auction sales two years ago when he posted some Marilyn Monroe
photos that were readily available from other sources. ``If I got
$6 back, I broke even; if I sold them for $12, I did good,'' he
said. They sold for $36.10 each. (Baker has since self-published a
book, ``Strike it Rich on Ebay.'')
</P>
<P>
   Or take Chris Gwynn, who quit his job as a marketing analyst
with the Yankee Group in Boston to sell refrigerator magnets on
line. He has now branched out to auctioning new action figures and
has created his own site (actionfigureauctions.com) to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn makes less money than he did as an analyst. ``But within a
year,'' he said, ``I should be doing a lot better than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Auction sites have made it fairly simple for people to hang out
a shingle because they require sellers to do little more than enter
information in a series of text boxes. That has made it possible
for even the computer-phobic to become involved in E-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared of it and I thought I was too old to learn,''
said Claudia Bennett, an antiques dealer in Vernon, Texas. Ms.
Bennett, who is 52, is now designing her own Web page, and she says
she does not regret closing her 14,000-square-foot store or
quitting her job at the post office to underwrite her antiques
operation. ``Now for the first time, I am making money at it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   While anyone can sell on line, not just anyone can make a living
at it. ``It's not as easy as saying, `I am an E-merchant,''' said
Parks, who bought a $1,200 digital camera, lights and a booth to
make his ceramics and other wares look appealing on line. ``A bad
photograph will not make you money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though successful, full-time auction entrepreneurs set
their own hours, they say the job is extremely demanding. One such
Web merchant, Lisa Harrington, said she had owned a tropical fish
store in Houston that went bankrupt. But six years after the
bankruptcy, she was drawn into Ebay when she helped a friend who
was struggling with an online business.
</P>
<P>
   She struck out on her own in June 1998, and in the year that
followed, she said, she took in $250,000, selling everything from
electronics to motorized self-scooping cat litter boxes.
</P>
<P>
   To generate that kind of income, Mrs. Harrington signs on at
8:30 a.m. on workdays and does not sign off until 2 a.m., taking
only an hour on some days to watch a soap opera. She takes only
Fridays and Mondays off. ``They are dead,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical workday, she handles about 600 e-mail messages,
monitors 20 auctions and packages about 20 items for shipping. She
also has to scare up fresh stock over the phone and on line.
</P>
<P>
   Although customers pay for shipping fees _ and Mrs. Harrington
confides that she sometimes makes a small profit on the shipping
charges _ there are other costs that new sellers tend to overlook,
like the fees charged by auction sites, usually a percentage of the
selling price. Mrs. Harrington said that she paid an average of
$2,000 a month to Ebay alone. She also uses sites like Utrade,
Ubid, Haggle and 321Gone.
</P>
<P>
   Baker also puts in long hours selling his celebrity photos and
art prints. ``I start at 6 every morning,'' he said. ``I work until
6. Then I take a break. Then I go back up around 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hunter, who auctions sports and political memorabilia on
line, said he put in eight hours a day photographing items, writing
descriptions, uploading information onto the day's auction sites,
answering e-mail and packing up items to be mailed out. ``But that
doesn't include the time you spend hunting this stuff up,'' he
said. ``The toughest part is that you have a commitment to it every
single day.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those who are not willing to put in long hours may get involved
in too few auctions to really make money. Even worse, they may be
slow to respond to customers, which can result in the posting of
complaints referred to as dreaded ``negative feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   When a transaction is completed, the seller and buyer can write
a short message commenting on it. Such feedback is available for
all to see, and it works as a self-policing mechanism, warning
people away from buyers or sellers who other people think are
dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for someone selling goods at a lot of auctions is
that it is easy to accrue negative comments. The more customers a
seller has, the greater the chances that some of them will be slow
to pay or hard to satisfy. If a seller posts a complaint about a
buyer, the buyer may retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``And before you know it,'' Hunter said, ``you have 20 negative
feedbacks.'' The alternative is for a seller to grin and bear it
when dealing with a testy buyer _ a frequent occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers often try to increase profits a few percentage points by
avoiding auction site fees. For instance, there is no rule against
a seller getting in touch with auction losers to make separate
deals if the seller has multiple copies of an item.
</P>
<P>
   Arlen Miller, who quit his job at Planet Hollywood in Orlando,
Fla., two years ago to deal full time on line in Disney
collectibles, said: ``I'll look at Ebay stuff, and if I have the
same item on my list, I'll go back when the auction is over. You
can go in and look at all of the bidders. If it went for $50, and I
have it for $30, I'll send a note.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller draws an ethical line. ``I would never step on
someone's toes by doing that before their auction is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction game is outgrowing the boundaries of Ebay, Amazon
and Yahoo. The Forrester study predicted that the future of online
auctions would be in sales of new retail products sold by
companies, often on their own sites, rather than by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, consumers will prefer buying from businesses rather
than individuals since businesses are more accountable and offer
first-run merchandise,'' the report said. A check using Yahoo's
search engine turned up a list of close to 200 auction sites,
including head-to-head Ebay competitors as well as specialty sites
like Justbeads.com, which auctions beads, and Floorspace.com, which
auctions industrial machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Off-the-shelf auction software makes it possible for individuals
and small businesses to set up their own auction sites. ``Auction
software costs about $5,000,'' said Gwynn, the refrigerator magnet
magnate who sells his action figures on his own site. ``The server
is a few hundred dollars a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn does not allow other people to sell on his site. If he had
set up the site that way, he said, he would have been competing
against Ebay; that, he added, would be a losing proposition.
</P>
<P>
   In an early test of his sales plan, Gwynn said, he auctioned 96
Austin Powers figures, which sell at retail for about $11, in a
week. He sold many of them in the $20 range, and some for as much
as $38. ``They were popular that week, and they were hard to get,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the figures have flown off the shelves. Gwynn has found
it difficult to sell everything from Barbie to ``Star Wars''
figures on a single site. So he will soon specialize even more. He
plans to set up auction sites that are organized to reflect the way
collectors collect: by manufacturer. That will make it easier to
reach collectors looking for specific toys through online bulletin
boards and newsletters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the online auction entrepreneurs do a lot of selling, they
do little buying on line. ``I never have really been able to buy on
Ebay to re-sell and make a profit on it,'' said Baker, the print
seller.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some sellers worry about what Ebay and other sites will
mean for their sources for items, like garage sales, if everyone is
selling everything, including the kitchen sink, on line.
</P>
<P>
   So far those fears have proved to be unfounded. The number of
yard sales each weekend proves that people still need to clean out
their attics _ and that most of them still do it the off-line way,
especially if they don't own a digital camera.
</P>
<P>
   Selling Tips
</P>
<P>
   Top sellers agree that the most important ingredient for success
in online auctions is choosing the right words to describe the item
up for bid.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to include as many potential search words as
possible in the limited space allowed for the title line of a
listing. That way, when a prospective bidder searches for a
particular item, there is a greater chance for a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a Marlboro lighter,'' said Mike Baker, who sells
movie star photos and art prints in online auctions. ``If you write
`butane lighter, Marlboro Zippo style,' you've got four key words.
A lot of people would put `Great, beautiful, hard-to-find Marlboro
lighter.' That way you have only two words.''
</P>
<P>
   Spelling counts, too. Buyers who search for a product using the
correctly spelled word will never find a listing with a
misspelling. The result is fewer bids.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, clever buyers intentionally search using misspelled
words to find the best deals. For instance, a search on Ebay for
``beanie babies'' produced 10,066 listings. But a search using the
misspelling ``beenie'' returned only 10 listings, some ripe for the
picking without any bids.

BUILDINGS THAT GIVE CHILDREN ROOM TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JILL BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's the whining hour at the Watkins home. Liam, 23
months old, is wailing at an earsplitting decibel, and his parents
are desperate to find a distraction. There used to be few options,
especially on a rainy day. But the Watkinses, like more and more
New Yorkers, are finding that their apartment building now offers
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take him downstairs to the indoor playroom, and he'll run
around and get rid of all that built-up energy,'' said Jim Watkins,
an anchor for WPIX-TV, who lives on Central Park West.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Lauren Thierry, a financial news anchor for CNN,
added: ``What's great is that you don't have to worry about safety,
because it's only for the building's residents. In Central Park,
your kids could run off. Liam can play with all the other kids, and
I can even read a newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Basement storage spaces and maids' rooms, once the gulags of
Gotham, are morphing into romper rooms throughout Manhattan,
complete with the latest array of brightly colored trucks, cars,
slides and fairy-tale castles. Some are Spartan spaces with a slab
of carpeting and scattered toys next to the laundry room, while
others feel like Playland.
</P>
<P>
   At an apartment building at 170 E. 87th St., the indoor-outdoor
playroom not only offers Halloween parties, R.L. Stine book-reading
nights, baby-sitting bulletin boards and chocolate chip cookie
cooking classes, but also outings to museums and aquariums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm living on a luxury cruise ship,'' Grace Sachs,
a resident of the building and mother of two children, said. ``On
Tuesdays, I'll get a fax under my door telling us of each week's
activities. You're even allowed to schedule birthday parties in it.
You can't put a price tag on what this means for a parent in the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes you can. Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the Corcoran
Group, estimated that apartments in buildings with playrooms get an
extra 5 to 10 percent boost in the sale price. ``And that's
conservative,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely a big trend, because more and more families
are opting to live in the city instead of the suburbs,'' Ms.
Corcoran added. ``New buildings are putting them in as a selling
point, and older buildings are spending the money to create them
for their tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are some drawbacks. ``These places can be petri
dishes for germs,'' said Lisa Shawn, who has one boy. ``I've
visited many of my friends' playrooms, since we all like to meet at
them, and some are definitely cleaner than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of supervision. Children aren't allowed
in playrooms unsupervised, and nannies or parents are expected to
clean up after Junior (and have the good sense to keep him home if
he's sick). Some buildings have the janitor doing the heavy
cleaning, while others have on-site people running the playroom.
``Each board must decide their own rules and regulations for the
facility,'' said Charles Urstadt, senior managing director of Brown
Harris Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents are euphoric to find play outlets beyond the city
parks, ones where they don't have to worry about the hassles of
getting children dressed to go outside. The commercial playrooms
available, like Gymboree, which has five outlets in Manhattan,
charge a fee but are far from plentiful in a city whose pint-size
population is growing at astounding speed. At 1150 Fifth Ave., the
number of children has increased from 8 to 40 in the last two
years. Other buildings with playrooms house more than 150 children.
</P>
<P>
   More important, these playrooms are giving apartment dwellers
the feeling of a neighborhood where nannies or parents routinely
meet for play dates and fun. Except now the traditional backyard is
a renovated basement or a whimsically designed floor. And buildings
that sponsor them have found they don't need to increase their
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since all buildings insist that the children are supervised,
we don't assume any greater insurance risk than if they were moving
along the corridors or elevators,'' said Patrick Tierney, the
manager of the condominiums at 170 E. 87th St.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to these playrooms isn't the co-op board
but the building's space shortage. ``It's very inexpensive to
create one,'' Suzanne Waltman, a co-op board member at 333 Central
Park West, said. ``Once you have the space, all you really need is
some paint, carpeting, as well as some toys.'' At her building,
each new tenant gives an initial $200 donation to the playroom, and
parents are also asked to donate toys.
</P>
<P>
   At an Upper West Side apartment on 107th Street, parents turned
a small area near the laundry room into a playroom complete with
handmade doodles on the walls from the littlest tenants.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is mostly Manhattan dwellers who are benefiting from
this service. ``All good marketing ideas start in Manhattan,'' Ms.
Corcoran said. ``And it's too good of an idea for the other
boroughs not to roll them out soon. I'm sure we'll be seeing them
in the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace Sachs, watching her son play happily on the jungle gym,
said: ``Many of my friends want to move here. As for us, we're
never moving out.''

 By TED OEHMKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On any weekend night in New York City, 3,000
twenty-somethings crowd into Twilo, a 10,000-square-foot dance club
in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, to twirl and gyrate to a
pulsating techno beat until 11 a.m., while thousands more wait
outside the club's West 27th St. entrance.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners of Twilo, Steve Dash and Phil Smith, hardly
resemble typical New York nightclub impresarios. Dash, 52, is a
Vietnam War veteran who feels most comfortable tweaking Twilo's
sound system while wearing jeans and a T-shirt. Smith, 56, is given
to wearing pastel golf shirts and Docksiders. If anything, they
look more like chaperones than club owners.
</P>
<P>
   The pair not only run Twilo, but in the past 15 years, through
their affiliated company, Phazon, they have also designed and
installed sound systems in more than 200 dance clubs around the
world, have contributed to five speaker-related patents and have
built a reputation among many as the best sound designers in the
club world.
</P>
<P>
   And sound, not celebrities, makes their clubs popular. Twilo is
carefully calibrated by Dash to give its patrons the visceral
experience of music. The result is as much about bodily sensation
as it is about hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Dash is the technician of the pair. Working with well-known
techno-music deejays like Junior Vasquez, Sasha and Carl Cox, Dash
has turned Twilo into a showcase for his systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's magical because working here, you can really take people
to another place,'' Cox said. ``It's a bit like creating another
world or taking a trip in a spaceship.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a more helpful description than the one provided by Dash.
Sitting in one of Twilo's two deejay booths recently, Dash tried to
put his magic into words while adjusting the system's frequencies.
``You plus the plus, minus the minus,'' he said. ``Sometimes you
want to make it minus the plus. I don't want to make it too
technical.''
</P>
<P>
   Dash learned his trade during the Vietnam War. He had an
aptitude for electronics so the Army trained him in electrical
engineering. In combat, his job was to align the radio waves and
microwaves that guided surface-to-air missiles. But his superiors
had him doing double duty fixing their stereos. ``The stereos were
always getting blown from surges caused by the generators, so for
20 bucks a pop, I'd fix them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spending many years after the war ``just trying to get by'' in
Philadelphia, Dash also did graduate work in electrical engineering
at the University of Pennsylvania. Dissatisfied with a job setting
up hotel sound systems that played elevator music, Dash started
working on equipment for a New York nightclub called the Paradise
Garage, where Phil Smith was one of the owners. Famous for its
powerful sound system, the Garage closed in 1985, but Smith and
Dash paired up to open the Sound Factory one year later.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told Dash to ``do whatever he wanted'' at Sound Factory.
What emerged was a system that set the standard for high-end club
sound, and other club owners wanted the pair to build their systems
as well. So Sound Factory became, literally, that.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the week, we'd build speakers and other components,''
Smith said, ``and on weekends we'd sweep away the sawdust and make
it a club.'' After changes in ownership, Sound Factory reopened as
Twilo in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still promoting their clubs in England by claiming
their system is as good as the one at Sound Factory,'' said Tim
Fielding, part-owner of a London nightclub called The End. Though
The End is a showcase for a competing English sound company,
Thunder Ridge, Fielding tips his hat to Dash. ``They may not know
his name,'' he said, ``but people in the club world know that the
guy who developed that system is a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Dash and Smith are currently working on three new systems, one
for a club in Sydney, Australia, and two for clubs in Britain.
``Our systems are strictly for a type of dance music known as
techno or trance music,'' Smith said. ``That's all we've ever
focused on, and that's why we've become popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Popular, but not cheap. The average system costs $170,000.
Phazon was recently awarded a $500,000 contract to design and
install the sound system for a London club called Home. ``Whether
we do a club or not depends on the vibe they have, what kind of
deejays they are booking and the budget they're going to give us,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to analyze the room. While conductors have
been known to walk around a room clapping to measure reverberation,
Dash sets off an electronic device called a bomb, which produces
and then measures an array of sounds. That data, along with
detailed information about the room's surfaces, is plugged into a
program that produces a color scheme of the room's acoustical
values.
</P>
<P>
   Much the way a doctor might analyze a CAT scan, Dash looks over
the report and decides what is best for that room. Dark areas on
the screen indicate problems _ excessive reverberation in one
corner or uneven sound distribution. A pink screen means that all
3,000 patrons of Twilo should experience the sound in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Map in hand, Dash then calculates which speakers are best for
the room and designs them on a CAD program. A contract factory in
Philadelphia then uses high-tech computerized saws to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting those missiles to hit their targets was a hell of a
lot easier than getting a room to sound right,'' Dash said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dash's aim was on display on a recent Friday night at Twilo.
When the needle is put on a record by Sasha, the deejay, the sound
is immediately sent to a back room, where a bank of equalizers and
computer processors break it down into bass, mid-range and
high-range frequencies. Digital signal-processing chips that have
modified by Dash to clean any unintended noise from the track.
</P>
<P>
   Since bass sounds tend to reverberate longer than treble sounds,
a time-alignment program feeds them to the amplifiers at minutely
different speeds, insuring that they will arrive at the listener's
ear at the same moment.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling from three turntables, Sasha uses a mixer to control
not only which frequencies are emphasized but also the area of the
room the sound goes to. As if to demonstrate, Sasha silences the
room around 3 a.m. As the crowd quiets, people hear a high-pitched
chirp. Faintly at first in one corner, the invisible electronic
bird, controlled by Sasha, circles the room. Piece by piece, layers
of different sounds are added that seem to interact with the bird.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of three or four minutes, the entire room of 120
speakers is filled with the visceral and aural equivalent of a
raging thunderstorm. Without pause, that collage of sound becomes a
driving dance beat _ the intense peak music that the
twenty-something patrons came to experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, the Twilo system is the best sound system in
the world,'' Sasha said. ``It's like a Lambourghini in constant
need of tuning. But when it's in fine shape, nothing can compare to
it. I have no idea how he does it, but Steve makes sure this thing
works great.''
</P>
<P>
   An experiment is pushing the dance club further into
computerization. ``One of the things Steve is working on now is a
joystick,'' said Smith, imitating the joystick action with his
hands. ``So Junior Vasquez can move sounds around the room better.
It works, too.''

ELECTRONIC TOLLS: SUBTLE AS A PICKPOCKET

<TEXT>
<P>
   When science-fiction writers conjure up flying cars of the
future, they don't usually make them stop to pay tolls. Even in
today's world of automated teller machines, electronic commerce and
online banking, the idea of tossing quarters into toll baskets is
beginning to sound perfectly quaint.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, it will seem even more archaic because electronic
toll collection systems are gaining speed. In the New York region,
the E-Z Pass wireless toll system, already in place for the city's
bridges and tunnels, is expected to spread to major highways like
the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway next year.
</P>
<P>
   E-Z Pass is already a way of life for more than 3 million
subscribers in the six states it serves. To participate, drivers
open prepaid accounts, then receive special tags for their cars'
windshields. When a car with one of these tags cruises through a
toll plaza equipped with E-Z Pass, the account information is
automatically received and the toll debited. No stopping. No cash.
No rolling down the windows.
</P>
<P>
   After some initial start-up problems, the system has been
credited with helping to ease congestion at most of the bridge and
tunnel crossings in the New York metropolitan area. Most recently,
it was introduced on the Atlantic City Expressway and the Delaware
Turnpike, part of Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   The program first hit the drawing board in 1990 after regional
toll authorities met to discuss their high-technology future. Soon
afterward, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York
and Pennsylvania established an interagency group. The states' goal
was to develop a system that would allow a driver to travel from,
say, Buffalo to Baltimore without ever stopping to pay a toll. Mark
4 Industries, a Canadian company, manufactures the E-Z Pass units.
</P>
<P>
   Other automatic toll systems are in use in other areas.
Electronic toll collection has been in development for three
decades, said Neil Schuster, executive director of the
International Bridge Tunnel and Turnpike Association, a group that
is based in Washington and represents public and private toll
authorities in 20 countries. In the United States, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and Texas were some of the first states to adopt such
programs when they installed automatic systems 10 years ago. Today,
Schuster said, about 20 of the 55 toll authorities in the United
States have some kind of electronic system in place.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience is not the only goal. The E-Z Pass interagency group
hopes that a reduction in toll-booth bottlenecks will reduce stress
for drivers and help the environment by cutting down on the amount
of time cars spend idling, generating noxious fumes. It also
estimates that an electronic system can process up to three times
as many cars as a human toll-booth worker.
</P>
<P>
   But as of now, said Rena Barta, program director for the
interagency group, ``no one has lost a job over this.''
Computerized systems inevitably create new jobs, she said, and many
veteran employees are being retrained to service the E-Z Pass
system.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster, however, said that on a international level, it was
inevitable the machines would win in the long run. ``There are
workers who are going to be potentially displaced by this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue related to the growth of electronic toll
collection is safety. The E-Z Pass system can collect information
while a car is moving, which is why it increases traffic flow. But
most toll plazas were designed with manual collection in mind, so
it can be a safety hazard to have some cars stopping for tolls
while others are moving right through. In a more technologically
advanced toll system, like one in Norway, Schuster said, that
problem is alleviated because there are no booths at all _
electronic tolling systems monitor drivers across open highways.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic toll collection has raised some concerns about
privacy. In the E-Z Pass system, transponders record the time and
location each time a toll is collected. Ms. Barta said this
information was not publicized. It is used only in customer service
centers for reference, she said. But it can also be subpoenaed by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster compared electronic toll logs with the information
provided by a telephone bill, which contains a record of calls.
``Most people aren't concerned about phone companies misusing their
data,'' he said. ``There's no reason to be concerned about this
either.''
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, it's just a matter of time before electronic
tolls become as commonplace as automated teller machines or
computer-coded subway and bus passes. Such digital systems point to
a day when seemingly disparate financial services will converge.
Schuster said electronic toll transponders in some states, like
Texas, could be used to pay for airport parking fees. Could
drive-through burgers be next?

   TIMOR-RDP (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Indonesia on Wednesday rejected
international demands to allow a foreign peacekeeping force to
restore order in East Timor, even as a high-level U.N. delegation
met with officials to press for action to end widespread violence
there. Despite a declaration of martial law in the territory on
Tuesday, witnesses said the situation was still worsening, five
days after an announcement that East Timor's 800,000 people had
voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia. By Seth
Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   TIMOR-U.S. (Washington) _ Determined to preserve its
relationship with Indonesia and support early moves towards
democracy, the United States is warning Indonesia's military leader
to end the chaos in East Timor within days or face a disruption in
relations that could undermine Indonesia's economic recovery,
according to senior administration officials. (Developing) By
Elizabeth Becker and Philip Shenon.

<P>
   NIGERIA-TRANSFORMATION (Lagos, Nigeria) _ Three months after
Africa's most populous nation inaugurated its first civilian
government in 16 years, gas stations offer perhaps the clearest
promise of what could become one of the most remarkable political
transformations on the continent. Only 15 months ago, Nigeria was
in the grip of a rapacious military regime that had turned the
country into an international pariah and manipulated oil supplies
so that Nigerians often had to pay several times what Americans do
for a gallon of gasoline. Now most gas stations operate the way an
Agip station on Iju Road here does: motorists pull up to a pump and
drive away a minute later. By Norimitsu Onishi.

   CONGRESS-TAX (Washington) _ Majority Leader Trent Lott said
Wednesday that President Clinton's promised veto of the
Republicans' $792 billion tax cut bill will likely doom any
tax-relief legislation this year. Firing the opening salvo in the
biggest legislative and political issue in Washington this fall,
Lott virtually ruled out any compromise, saying there is too little
time to negotiate a new plan for taxes and spending. By Eric
Schmitt.

   QUAYLE-PROFILE (Goffstown, N.H.) _ Dan Quayle, whose slingshot
career has given him a glimpse of both the heights and depths of
American politics by the age of 52, appears to be back at the
bottom of his political trajectory. Since his eighth-place finish
in the Iowa straw poll some of Quayle's aides have signed on to
other campaigns, his old friends from the White House privately
describe his presidential ambitions as hopeless, and he is drawing
small crowds and perfunctory attention from the news media. Yet
with a tenacity that is poignant, Quayle perseveres, motivated by
the political vindication he has pursued since he was sworn in as
vice president 10 years ago and by the dogged belief that he has a
chance to succeed. By Adam Nagourney.

   INTERNET-CLASSNOTES (Undated) _ An upstart Internet venture,
Studyfree, is hiring students at each of 62 universities and paying
them to take notes in about 50 core courses. The note-takers then
post their jottings on a central website. The 25-year-old founder
of Studyfree said he intended the service to help students augment
their own notes or to help them catch up after a sick day. But he
concedes that his wares could easily be abused by those with less
legitimate excuses, like chronic oversleeping or lingering
hangovers. By Jacques Steinberg.

   NY-SCHOOLS (New York) _ As more than 1 million New York City
school children _ some in uniform _ hoist their book bags and
return to school Thursday, they will face the toughest promotional
standards in decades and a pivotal year for them, and for
Chancellor Rudy Crew. By Anemona Hartocollis.

PIRATE LORE AND SALVAGED TREASURES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Read ``Treasure Island,'' my sixth-grade teacher told the class,
because if you discover its thrills now, they will stay with you
forever. A lot of people have taken that advice because pirate
sites for young and old abound on the Web. But reliable pirate
sites? They're as scarce as reliable treasure maps.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, with only a few mouse clicks and a few thousand dollars,
you, too, can help finance the search for the hundreds of tons of
gold buried in the Philippines and the West Indies. What? They came
up empty? Well, looks as if you've got to learn about real pirates
after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirate Web Ring
(webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?ring(equal)piracy;list) lists 44
sites, but some appear fanciful and many are for role-playing
games. Fortunately, there are also some thoughtful and exciting Web
pages that have navigated the treacherous shoals of legend.
</P>
<P>
   One Web ring site that does justice to both fantasy and history
is ``No Quarter Given'' (www.discover.net/nqgiven/index.htm), a
supplement to a subscription magazine of the same name. This is a
big home port for re-enactment groups, current festivals, new
discoveries and, yes, pirate chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   On sites like Think Quest's ``Pirates: Fact and Legend''
(despina.advanced.org/16438/main.shtml), an enthusiast can read
some hair-raising history and learn about the Golden Age of Piracy,
roughly 1680 to 1725. There is Blackbeard lighting his long hair
before going into battle, and ending his career with his head on a
pike. There is Henry Morgan overcoming a 16-day jungle march, 600
Spanish cavalrymen and a stampede of 2,000 Spanish bulls to plunder
the gold of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   For a look at a real ship, see www.whydah.com, which chronicles
the history and ongoing salvage of the Whydah (pronounced WID-da),
the flagship of Capt. Samuel (Black Sam) Bellamy and the only
documented pirate shipwreck (with documented pirate treasure) ever
recovered. The Whydah's story is also told on The National
Geographic's site, www.nationalgeographic.com/whydah.
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy had a spectacular but short career in the Caribbean and
off the Atlantic coast, capturing more than 50 ships before he was
29. But the Whydah went down with 144 men and much of Bellamy's
treasure in a howling Northeaster off Provincetown, Mass., in April
1717 (according to legend, the captain had detoured into disaster
to see his mistress in Cape Cod).
</P>
<P>
   Barry Clifford, a professional treasure diver, found the wreck
in 1984, and the recovery is still going on. Some of the salvaged
gold, 400-year-old African jewelry, is extremely rare; most African
gold was melted down by European traders.
</P>
<P>
   The treasure, however, is perhaps less important than things
like the ship's bell, shot and pewter tableware, which have allowed
scholars to understand how pirates actually lived and fought.
</P>
<P>
   Off Beaufort, N.C., experts from a private exploration company
and for the state of North Carolina (www.ah.dcr.state.nc.us/qar)
are doing underwater research on a hulk that is strongly believed,
though not proved, to be the remains of the Queen Anne's Revenge,
the flagship of one of history's bloodiest pirates, Edward Teach or
Thatch, known as Blackbeard.
</P>
<P>
   His ship was grounded on a sandbar off Beaufort Inlet in June
1718, a month after leading a pirate fleet that blockaded the
harbor at Charleston, S.C. Blackbeard escaped, but in November
1718, with a price on his head, he was killed by Capt. Robert
Maynard of the Royal Navy at Ocracoke Inlet, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's Underwater Archeology Unit completed a research
dive last fall, and its logs are on the Web site, along with a
trove of pirate history. State divers plan to return to the wreck
this fall, and they will again post their daily logs, said Mary
Cook, director of public affairs for the North Carolina Department
of Cultural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Any information on the site about Blackbeard, other pirates or
the ship that may be the Queen Anne's Revenge has been researched
for accuracy by the department's historians, she added.
</P>
<P>
   For armchair treasure hunters, the site includes an illustrated
description of the 2,000 artifacts recovered, including gold
flakes, 18 cannon, a blunderbuss barrel, ceramics, hair fragments
and pewterware.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, the researchers identified two baseball-size hand
grenades filled with black powder, designed to destroy a crew but
not property.
</P>
<P>
   These reinforce the case for the ship's being the Queen Anne's
Revenge, Ms. Cook said. ``If you were a merchant ship, would you
have been carrying grenades?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   For pirate pictures, Beej's Pirate Image Archive
(www.ecst.csuchico.edu/beej/pirates) has scores of old maps, prints
and paintings related to pirates, ships, pirate punishments and
``pirate fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a British site, the U.K. Office for Library and
Information Networking (www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/treasure) has the
greatest treasure of all: everything you could possibly want to
know about ``Treasure Island.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In today's computer-driven culture, the once-derogatory term
``geek'' has been proudly reclaimed. Sure, you probably made fun of
those guys on the audio-visual squad in high school. But when you
can't get that printer to show up on the network and the deadline
for your presentation is approaching fast, who are you going to
call? The office computer geek, of course, the one who can
mind-meld with the hardware, coax the software into working and
make it all look easy. Let's hope for your sake that he or she
(because they're not just guys anymore) doesn't know about those
lunchroom nerd jokes you made.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you  &UR; know &LR;  that stuff?'' is a question frequently asked
of geeks. Hacker culture (we're talking about hacking in the
nonmalicious, noncriminal sense) has generally promoted the sharing
of knowledge, and scores of Web sites out there offer patient _ and
creative _ advice explaining the nuances and mysteries of computers
for anyone who is willing to click through.
</P>
<P>
   Being the first to know breaking news in the technology industry
is also important for geek credit, and many sites will provide the
latest facts _ and rumors as well. Corporate sites specializing in
tech news like Cnet (cnet.com), Wired News (www.wirednews.com) and
ZDnet (www.zdnet.com) pump a steady stream of updates onto the Web.
But even more impressive are the smaller sites, often run by a few
dedicated souls, that gather up the day's developments at the speed
of light, and with a sense of humor. The grammar may sometimes be
uneven and some of the content not for the technically faint of
heart. But for anyone who needs a daily dose of the digital, geek
Web sites are a must-read.
</P>
<P>
   UGEEK
</P>
<P>
   www.ugeek.com
</P>
<P>
   With its overflowing content, clean layout, links galore and
intelligent sense of humor, Ugeek is perhaps the mother lode of
techie news sites. Billing itself as ``the online technology
resource,'' Ugeek is one-stop shopping for daily updates on the
business, as well as the practice, of computing. The site also
offers product reviews, tips and tricks for users, a technical
glossary and scads of other information for the computer-curious.
</P>
<P>
   Four levels of Geekdom are described on Ugeek's welcome page,
ranging from Beginner Geek (``can program the family VCR'') to
Super Geek (``can't understand why there are some people who can't
build their own computer from scratch''). The site offers something
for all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by some of the excited prose generated by and aimed at
advanced computer users, new computer users may feel as though they
have been beamed right into an episode of ``Star Trek: Voyager.''
Here's an example: ``If you ARE obsessed with faster Athlons, then
you should check out the Japanese site that gives instructions for
overclocking an Athlon to 700MHz.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Super Geeks may revel in the section of the site
devoted to minutiae about motherboards, there is also a
newbie-friendly link right on the front page on how to buy that
first personal computer. Hard-core fans of PC games and personal
digital assistants have their own areas.
</P>
<P>
   Readers can contribute to the Rants and Raves and to Tales From
the Geekside. The site produces its own e-mail newsletter, and you
can even sign up for free Web-based e-mail that offers the user an
``(AT)geek.com'' address.
</P>
<P>
   SLASHDOT
</P>
<P>
   www.slashdot.org
</P>
<P>
   True to its motto _ ``news for nerds; stuff that matters'' _
Slashdot is a site that truly revels in its high-geek factor. While
not as comprehensible to computer neophytes as other sites,
Slashdot serves as a gathering place for power users to share
knowledge, answer questions and post comments.
</P>
<P>
   Several feature stories are posted each day, and the site gets
hundreds of submissions a day from its readers. Although Slashdot
is heavily focused on the Linux operating system and programming
concerns, there are plenty of general-interest computer tidbits
posted.
</P>
<P>
   Slashdot was created in 1997 by Rob Malda, a computer science
undergraduate at the time, and was bought this summer by
Andover.net, a company that provides resources for Internet
professionals. Malda still maintains the site and writes quite a
bit of it.
</P>
<P>
   The personalities of the writers come shining through the HTML.
Slashdot encourages readers' responses and has a real community
feel to it. Instead of neighbors leaning swapping gossip over the
back fence, however, the discussions focus on things like personal
computer networking and opinions of good computer science graduate
schools.
</P>
<P>
   One of the livelier areas is the Ask Slashdot page, in which
questions range from the highly technical to the purely
philosophical. On one recent day, the page offered discussions
about playing PC games through corporate firewalls.

<P>
   LOCKER GNOME
</P>
<P>
   www.lockergnome.com
</P>
<P>
   Locker Gnome started life as a newsletter about Windows 95
shareware, and the site's name sprang from an old high-school
nickname of the site's founder, Chris Pirillo. For Windows users
who want up-to-date information about hot new shareware and
freeware, games, bugs, Web sites and industry happenings, the
Locker Gnome site provides an easy-to-read source.
</P>
<P>
   Announcements concerning newly released software patches and
updates for Windows can be found here, plus an assortment of tips
and tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Locker Gnome offers a section devoted to finding the lowest
prices for popular software. The site also operates a readers forum
and has links to back issues dating to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it is full of information about Windows 95, 98 and
NT and the forthcoming Windows 2000, one of the most important
areas of the Locker Gnome site is a place where you can sign up for
the free Locker Gnome e-mail newsletter, which offers a variety of
data nuggets that you're not likely to find anywhere else on line.
Subscribers can choose to have a daily issue, created in HTML,
delivered to their In boxes or opt for a weekly text-only digest.

<P>
   MAC OBSERVER
</P>
<P>
   www.macobserver.com
</P>
<P>
   For Macintosh addicts, one of the most energetic geek sites on
the Web is the Mac Observer, which is updated several times a day.
The site is a full-service online magazine, with news reports,
original stories, opinionated columnists and editorials that
celebrate, cogitate and occasionally berate Apple Computer's
creations.
</P>
<P>
   Slick and well organized, the Mac Observer (formerly Webintosh)
tracks Mac news from many other Macintosh and tech-news sites. It
also provides its own commentary on the issues with a few
paragraphs called the Mac Observer Spin, directly underneath the
main story.
</P>
<P>
   Major software and hardware reviews are posted in the site's
First Look section, and there are also plenty of links to articles
about forthcoming products and user tips.
</P>
<P>
   The Mac Observer tracks computer-game news and new Mac
shareware, and it has a section devoted to Macintosh conventions
and trade shows. Two years' worth of past stories are available in
an archive. Perhaps as a bit of leftover panic from the dark days
of 1997, when the company was financially ailing, the Mac Observer
has a steady preoccupation with Apple's stock price and includes a
daily report on its performance on Wall Street. The Mac Observer's
motto is, ``You'll get your Mac news here from now on.'' With its
depth of coverage, darned if you won't.
</P>
<P>
   WIN98 CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   www.win98central.com
</P>
<P>
   As the name implies, Win98 Central sets its sights squarely on
the current version of Microsoft's crown jewel: the Windows
operating system and all that is related to it. Under the site's
nameplate and motto (``your one-stop Windows 98 Web site''),
readers are greeted with headlines and summaries of the day's news
concerning Windows and related products, along with general
technology news. Links to the original sources of the news items
are provided for further reading.
</P>
<P>
   A sassy Quote of the Day is featured. A recent offering: ``When
a tech says he's coming right over, go for coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers can answer a poll question about a current computer
concern. In the Babbling Area, the site's writers ramble on about
personal topics in a kind of geek diary entry. While heartfelt, the
Babbling Area is not especially interesting (unless, perhaps, one
knows the writer).
</P>
<P>
   Much more enlightening are the several sections of the site
devoted to technical issues with Windows 98. Tips for solving
software version conflicts, how to speed up a computer's Internet
performance and an explanation of the utility programs that come
with the system can be found here. A link to the How To page of
Microsoft's own tech-support Web site is in the site's 98 Support
area.
</P>
<P>
   You can also find new shareware programs from around the Web, as
well as links to articles on other sites about Windows hardware and
software on the site. Parts of Win98 Central are still under
construction, but it's probably a safe bet that these guys will get
their site done before Microsoft ships Windows 2000 and they have
to change all the logos.
</P>
<P>
   MACINTOUCH
</P>
<P>
   www.macintouch.com
</P>
<P>
   Created by Ric Ford in 1994, the Macintouch site provides
Macintosh users with insightful, timely technical information about
their cherished platform. While many geek Web sites offer fancy
graphics, the Macintouch site is positively plain: mostly just
black type on a white background.
</P>
<P>
   But that simple layout reminds you that Macintouch is there to
provide pure, no-frills information, and the site has a solid
reputation among Mac professionals. It's a great source for news
about viruses, software bugs and new products.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Macintouch provided users with detailed
reports about problems like the Autostart virus and security
glitches with Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   With Apple Computer releasing upgrades for its operating system
software once or twice a year, Macintouch also takes a microscopic
look at each new version and provides its readers with precise
documentation on fresh features, as well as quirks, bugs and
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Macintouch is aimed mostly at Mac pros, the site does
have a spin-off area called iMacintouch, which is devoted to
Apple's colorful and curvaceous (as well as profitable) desktop
computers. The iMacintouch area also contains product reviews and
news, with plenty of attention devoted to new Macintosh software
and hardware.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite as fancy as some other Mac sites, like Macfixit
(www.macfixit.com) and Apple Links (www.applelinks.com), but
Macintouch (and iMacintouch) is a great tip sheet for Mac mavens.

LOTS OF DEALS, BUT WHICH ARE THE BEST? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See TRAVEL-EXOTIC) 
 
By SYD KEARNEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to touting millennium celebrations, the use of
superlatives has reached a new level. Hotels, cities and tour
providers vying for your time and dollar aren't satisfied with
qualifying their celebrations as simply ``the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of festivities and packages advertised, we've
seen ``the ultimate'' and ``the quintessential;'' about a dozen of
``the unique;'' several ``rare opportunities;'' three
``once-in-a-lifetime;'' and too-many-to-recall ``unforgettables.''
Our favorite may be ``the soiree of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sea of adjectives, adverbs and special amenities, how
can you discern what really is a good deal? (And a good deal must
be qualified: Even during a normal holiday period, rates can
skyrocket. But no one likes to feel they are being gouged.)
</P>
<P>
   First, do your homework. Ascertain the normal rates _ or rack
rate _ for a hotel or resort. You can expect that holiday charges
will be higher, but if the price is tripled, you may want to
consider another place to lay your head. (The rack rate is the
highest published tariff, which an informed traveler should never
have to pay.)
</P>
<P>
   Discuss rates with a travel agent, who should be able to give
you a good idea of what prices are during a non-holiday period and
during a non-millennium holiday period.
</P>
<P>
   If you make arrangements on your own, prod the reservationist
for the lowest price. Remember that an ocean-view room will be less
that an ocean-front room. And a garden-view room will be priced
even better.
</P>
<P>
   Remember to ask about taxes and gratuities, which may not be
included in the package price. Many packages require full payment
at the time of booking. Make sure you understand the hotel's
cancellation policy before you confirm.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware of minimum-stay requirements. One Caribbean resort is
requiring a 14-night minimum stay with rates starting at $446 per
room per night. Closer to home, the Hotel Jerome in Aspen is
requiring an eight-night stay with room rates starting at a
budget-busting $740 per night. That rate is more than double what
you'd pay to stay at the historical hotel in early December.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists are accustomed to New Orleans' penchant for minimum
stays during special-event periods. Most hotels there are requiring
New Year's Eve revelers to commit to a four-night stay. And not
just any four nights. In most cases, you've got to be checked out
by Jan. 2 to make way for Sugar Bowl fans (who, by the way, also
will face a required minimum stay).
</P>
<P>
   The smart hoteliers are adding value to their packages by
tacking on such extras as breakfasts, champagne and spa treatments.
But don't assume admission to the hotel's fancy New Year's Eve bash
is included in the package price.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheraton New Orleans offers several millennium packages: The
most economical starts at $399 per night (four-night minimum) and
comes with a bottle of champagne, a limited-edition souvenir and
the opportunity to partake in the ``party to end all parties'' in
the city's fabled French Quarter. For admission to the hotel's New
Year's Eve party, you have to upgrade to the ``Suite Millennium
Experience'' package, which goes for $1,000 per night with the
four-night minimum stay.
</P>
<P>
   Scrutinize the package. The list of add-ons may be long, but if
you are not interested in a sunset cruise or a tennis clinic, you
will be paying for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   We've pawed through hundreds of press releases, reviewed a
gazillion e-mails and surfed the Web until we were queasy to find a
selection of appealing millennium packages. Here are some hotel
packages to ponder. Samplings of city celebrations and cruise
offerings are found elsewhere in this section:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A PRICE FOR PAMPERING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ In California's wine country, the Sonoma Mission Inn marks the
opening of its new 27,000-square-foot spa with a millennium package
that spotlights the spa and its natural hot springs. The
three-night deal provides lodging, two 50-minute spa treatments per
person, two commemorative spa robes, a bottle of sparkling wine and
a pair of etched champagne flutes, New Year's Day Brunch and
admission to the inn's New Year's Eve gala, which will feature
dinner and dancing. Price varies with the accommodations, but
packages start at $3,000 per couple. Call 800-862-4945.
</P>

financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Air passenger complaints more than doubled in July
compared with a year ago, hitting the highest level since March
1988, the U.S. Transportation Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Delays, missed connections and cancellations were most often
cited along with poor customer service as the complaints filed with
the government reached 2,485, an increase of nearly 87 percent over
the previous month and 169 percent from July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines drew the most complaints, nearly five times
more than last July. The showing kept the Fort Worth, Texas,
carrier at the bottom of the list for customer satisfaction among
the 10 major carriers this year.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Southwest Airlines rated the highest in pleasing
its customers, and Atlanta-based Delta Airlines was third.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith traced much of the
complaints to delays in late spring and early summer caused by
unusual weather and renovations being made to the air traffic
control system along its routes.
</P>
<P>
   The company was ``actively working'' on its problems, Smith
said. ``It is not simple to make an overnight change, but we are
actively looking at every conceivable way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith noted that the airlines improved in on-time performance to
third among the major airlines. He predicted that the complaint
level would go down as more flights take off on time.
</P>
<P>
   David Fuscus, spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the
trade group for the major carriers, said that Transportation
Department statistics tell only a fraction of the story, since most
passengers complain directly to the airlines, which don't divulge
the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But Fuscus said, ``We know that complaints have been going up
all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress earlier this year threatened to enact a passenger
rights bill after a winter snowstorm left packed airplanes stranded
on Detroit runways without food or running water. The lawmakers
backed down after the major carriers agreed to produce a voluntary
plan for improving service. That plan is due out next week.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   American's Smith suggested that ``the ease of complaining on
line'' via the Internet could be boosting the count.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, American has been taking a beating on the Internet this
summer. Travel writer Charles Leocha posted a column on an ``AAwful
Flight'' by a 6-foot, 6-inch friend who had been injured in Spain.
He was given a cramped middle seat that wouldn't recline and told
his injury didn't justify special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger suffered throughout the flight while he and his
wife heard flight attendants in the rear ``complaining, in hushed
voices, about the passengers,'' Leocha reported.
</P>
<P>
   The commentary, featured on America Online, drew a flurry of
responses from other travelers with similar complaints. Leocha said
in an interview Wednesday that some American crew members responded
with messages for the passenger such as, ``Crack open the wallet
and buy an upgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Leocha said of American: ``They've
gone from being one of the best airlines in the nation to being one
of the most complained-about airlines, perhaps in the world. It's a
wake-up call to management.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to admit anything, but I bet you they're
scrambling now to figure out what they can do, because they've got
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who said he was unaware of this particular story, said,
``That disturbs us to hear anecdotal stories'' about passenger
mistreatment.

TRAVELERS SHOWING APATHY FOR BIG PARTY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See TRAVEL-SEAS) 
 
By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From New York to New Zealand, it's touted as the grandest party
ever staged.
</P>
<P>
   What's that? You haven't sent your R.S.V.P. to confirm your name
on the guest list?
</P>
<P>
   You aren't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Most travelers have given a collective ho-hum to the
``once-in-a-lifetime'' cruises, tours, hotel packages and banner
events scheduled worldwide to usher in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Or ``pseudo-millennium,'' as one Houston travel agent dubs a
celebration contrived to occur a year ahead of the 21st century's
official debut.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a rash of eye-popping enticements (alas, many with
eye-popping prices), only 8 percent of all consumers have made
plans to leave home during the upcoming New Year's holiday period,
according to a survey conducted by New Jersey-based Plog Research
for Travel Weekly, an industry publication.
</P>
<P>
   Another 9 percent still are exploring the possibility of
millennium-related travel.
</P>
<P>
   Of those numbers, barely one in four say they will attend a
party or event, while almost half intend to visit relatives or
friends.
</P>
<P>
   In the Plog Research/Travel Weekly survey of 405 individuals, 43
percent of probable nontravelers said ``the millennium means
nothing to me.'' Twenty-three percent cited expense as a factor.
Only 7 percent expressed concern about potential Y2K computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the root causes of disinterest, the bottom line is
this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Most cruise lines and hotels still offer space over the New
Year's holiday. Some have lowered prices in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flights remain available to most destinations; the majority
are at the usual high holiday tariffs, but some Internet sites are
promoting discounts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many tour packages are unsold. Maupintour, acclaimed for its
wide range of high-quality packages internationally and within the
United States, canceled seven of 24 scheduled millennium tours
because of slow bookings. The company has availability on all
others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some major events, including festivals scheduled in Dallas and
Minneapolis and a mega-concert in Southern California, have been
canceled. Many activities in smaller cities have been curtailed or
scaled down.
</P>
<P>
   Dare we declare the millennium celebration a dud?
</P>
<P>
   Let's not rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists within the industry suggest that the
slower-than-anticipated pace of bookings indicates only that the
public hasn't embraced a ``Buy early at our price or you'll get
left out'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   There is still ample time to join in the fun, this position
holds. Holiday vacation planning usually begins after the Labor Day
weekend, which traditionally signals the end of the peak family
travel season.
</P>
<P>
   Not every travel supplier is experiencing disappointment either:
</P>
<P>
   _ Unlike most competitors, Crystal Cruises, the world's
highest-rated large-ship line, has sold out millennium sailings on
both its vessels (at prices beginning at $8,375 and $8,975 for 16-
and 17-day itineraries). The line also reports the longest waiting
list in its history for any cabins that become available.
</P>
<P>
   _ Major concerts are generating high interest: Tickets in three
of four price ranges for Barbra Streisand's much-ballyhooed New
Year's Eve appearance at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Hotel are gone; the
minimum $500 and maximum $2,500 seats sold out quickly, and only a
limited number of $1,500 tickets remain. (The argument could be
made that Streisand's final U.S. concert, as this is billed, would
attract a capacity audience on any date.)
</P>
<P>
   _ New York's Times Square anticipates its biggest New Year's
celebration ever.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good attendance is expected, too, for blockbuster events in
London, Paris, Sydney, Washington and other cities (but it's
uncertain what percentage of partygoers will be locals or
tourists).
</P>
<P>
   _ Some tour companies that specialize in exotic
adventure-oriented itineraries report brisk business. A
spokesperson for Mountain Travel Sobek, an adventure-oriented firm,
says that firm has increased millennium departures on two tours to
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, too, figures can be misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Ritz-Carlton spokesperson Stephanie Platt says only two of the
chain's 35 hotels and resorts _ in Boston and Cancun _ have booked
an innovative, luxury-filled $100,000 ``Millennium Experience,''
available to one couple per property.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're really happy with that,'' says Platt. ``We thought
this would be a fun, over-the-top package to promote but weren't
sure anyone would actually buy it. We've got bites at several other
properties, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, advance reservations place Ritz-Carlton New Year's Eve
occupancy at 49 percent. ``But that's in advance of what we would
normally be doing at this point,'' Platt says.
</P>
<P>
   Maupintour spokesperson Carol Snyder says pricing alone doesn't
explain millennium apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rates are only about 15 percent higher than at any other
time, and that's only what is reflected by the higher prices hotels
are charging us,'' Snyder says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Houston travel agents suggest that a surge in
millennium bookings will occur only if companies rethink their
price structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some big mistakes made with pricing,'' says
Eva Holguin, president of Travel Arts/Cruise Gallery and Planet
Honeymoon, Houston agencies, whose business is 100 percent leisure
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Some rates have remained firm for as long as two years, and no
``fire sale'' of millennium offerings appears imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are beginning to get faxes from cruise lines and other
companies offering promotions such as free air as an incentive,''
Holguin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any millennium bookings. But we're telling our
clients the truth: Prices are totally out of control on almost
everything. We're steering people away from the millennium, and we
haven't had any objections,'' Holguin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a few clients who wanted to go to Las Vegas for the
New Year's celebration. But even there, prices are out of line. One
hotel is asking $1,300 per night for a room that normally costs
$250. And they're requiring a four-night minimum stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even some of the run-of-the-mill beach resorts in the
Caribbean have set seven- and 10-night minimum stay requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, Holguin says, ``We're promoting trips for
what we call the millennium's post-frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Others point to bargains earlier in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking for a really super cruise deal, the period
right before and after the holidays is a particularly good time,''
says Jennifer de la Cruz, spokesperson for Carnival, the world's
largest cruise line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early December traditionally offers some of the greatest
travel bargains,'' says de la Cruz. ``This year, we're also seeing
that there are some really good deals over Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Linblad Special Expeditions' Sven-Olof Lindblad recently sent
previous passengers a letter offering a 25 percent discount on any
of 22 sailings before and after Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Crystal is offering a 50 percent discount on the Crystal
Harmony's Christmas sailing in South America and a
$1,000-per-couple reduction on a Crystal Symphony voyage in
Australia and New Zealand during that same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anticipation of New Year's Eve 1999 (at least for Crystal
passengers) has put Christmas plans in the background for many,
resulting in space on cruises which are traditionally booked by
now,'' says Crystal vice president Adam Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise industry represents particularly intriguing food for
millennium thought.
</P>
<P>
   Several lines began accepting reservations well before
itineraries and prices were firmed, and they generated tens of
thousands of bookings (with refundable deposits). Encouraged by
this immediate outpouring of interest, the lines then announced
strategies that positioned ships all over the world _ even at the
international date line in the South Pacific _ with big-time
entertainment and guest lecturers aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Once prices were announced, however, many lines had a surprise:
mass cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Even lines that maintained familiar Caribbean-based itineraries,
without sticker-shock pricing, haven't been besieged by customers.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, which lowered its initial millennium brochure rates by
15 percent on five cruises earlier this summer, still has space on
12 of its 14 ships, according to de la Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   ``That space ranges from minimal to ample,'' de la Cruz says.
``But we are pleased with the pace of bookings, and we fully expect
that all these cruises will sell out.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnival's current pricing for millennium cruises varies widely,
depending on the ship and itinerary. Examples: Cruise-only per
person rates for a seven-day western Caribbean itinerary aboard
Carnival Destiny range from $3,165-$6,635; cabins for a nine-day
eastern Caribbean sailing aboard the older Inspiration are priced
from $739-$1,909.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not anticipate further price reductions,'' says de la
Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line also reports availability on all seven
ships, including the Houston-based Norwegian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've introduced some passenger incentives for sailings that
have the most space,'' says spokesperson Fran Sevcik.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late either to reserve space aboard either of
Silversea's two luxury-oriented vessels. The all-suite Silver Cloud
and Silver Wind boast the most elaborate holiday-at-sea
entertainment lineups, with itineraries in the South Pacific, and
where guests will celebrate the first day of the new millennium
twice (when the ships cross the 180th meridian and international
date line in tandem).
</P>
<P>
   Prices are impressive as the itinerary _ $32,195 to $66,195 per
person for 15- or 16-day sailings _ but spokesperson Dale DiBello
says, ``We're about 75 percent full, which is right about where we
thought we'd be at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The line plans no discounting. But DiBello says, ``We've put
together package deals that include the millennium sailings and
others (for only a small extra tariff).''
</P>
<P>
   One theory behind high-end millennium products is this:
</P>
<P>
   A traveler accustomed to paying $15,000 for a product may be
willing (and financially solvent enough) to double that investment
_ assuming the extra charge results in added value (perceived or
real). But an individual normally on a $1,000 travel budget may not
afford to spend $2,000 to welcome the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many with the money and desire to celebrate away from
home don't have that option during this upcoming holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Even if most travelers aren't overly concerned that
transportation services and support systems won't be shut down by
massive computer failures at the stroke of midnight on New Year's
Eve, the corporate world must guard against any surprises.
</P>
<P>
   And most business executives are keenly aware that they had
better be easily reachable _ and not on a remote island or cruise
ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guests are not price-sensitive,'' says Robert Weber,
general manager of the Westin Casuarina Resort on Grand Cayman
Island in the Caribbean, ``but many executives are being required
to be on call just in case there are Y2K problems.''
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with other luxury property managers, Weber says
he believes this is a prime reason why millennium bookings are flat
throughout the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Should travelers be worried about breakdowns?
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association and Federal Aviation
Administration system, following extensive testing, has assured
that potential Y2K problems have been fixed on critical systems
within the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But in late July, a State Department report found that about
half of 161 nations surveyed face a ``medium to high risk'' of
disruptions in their telecommunications, energy and transportation
systems.
</P>
<P>
   In an updated worldwide notice, the State Department cautioned:
``On or about Jan. 1, 2000, some automated systems throughout the
world may experience problems, including unpredictable system
malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments or businesses with more limited resources or
expertise, or those that are not paying appropriate attention to
the problem, may experience more significant difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   (The notice in its entirety, and related Y2K matters, can be
accessed via the Internet at travel.state.gov; by Oct. 1, the State
Department plans to provide country-by-country reports on this Web
site. Reports by the Aviation Millennium Project, coordinated by
the Air Transport Association, are available at
www.aviationmillennium.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Those discouraged from turn-of-the-century travel because of Y2K
_ or because of apathy _ can take heart in the awareness that some
celebrations aren't fixed to our New Year dates.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's official millennium festivities begin Nov. 27 with
the ``world's largest tea party'' and peak Feb. 5 with a ``Parade
of the Dragons'' welcoming the Chinese New Year. Italy and Israel
will celebrate throughout 2000. Closer to home, Disney World has
decreed that its millennium celebrations, which begin in October,
will last 15 months. Philadelphia started an 18-month schedule of
events even earlier, in July.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel executive Weber says he anticipates a boom in travel to
the Caribbean once Y2K concerns abate. He foresees higher tourism
for New Year's 2000 when the true millennium turns.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Weingart, president of Carlson Wagonlit Utopia Travel in
Houston, seconds that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling that the real millennium may end up doing
better than the pseudo-millennium,'' Weingart says.
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe wager that cruise lines, hotels and others in the
industry _ perhaps after learning a few valuable lessons from this
experience _ will adopt that philosophy as a mandate, come Jan. 2.

<P>
   Vacations at sea take on a new dimension this New Year's season.
</P>
<P>
   Among itinerary highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ships representing Crystal, Radisson Seven Seas, Silversea,
Princess and Royal Caribbean will cross the international date line
in the South Pacific as the new millennium begins.
</P>
<P>
   _ Orient Lines and Special Expeditions vessels are destined for
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cunard and Princess plan cruises to the Holy Land.

itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Clipper ship will circumnavigate New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Holland America vessel offers Margarita Island and Trinidad
in the southern Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seabourn's plans include Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   _ Classical Cruises passengers will take a land excursion to the
Taj Mahal to greet the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Royal Caribbean ships will sail under San Francisco's
Golden Gate Bridge at midnight on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>

Panama and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   _ Three Celebrity ships will gather off the private Caribbean
island of Labadee for a gala fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment is high on the agenda, too:
</P>
<P>
   _ Travelers booking Silversea's Silver Cloud will gather in Los
Angeles on Dec. 21 for a private concert by Tony Bennett, then will
take chartered aircraft to Tahiti to board the ship for a 15-day
voyage to Auckland, New Zealand. Performers and lecturers en route
(or on the Silver Wind from Cairns, Australia, to Tahiti) will
include Rita Moreno, Joel Grey, Buzz Aldrin, Andrew Morton, Winston
S. Churchill, Mike Stoller, Richard Sherman and Sha Na Na.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joining Cunard's QE2 for a Caribbean/Panama Canal sailing will
be singer Jack Jones, the Jimmy Dorsey orchestra and the Pied
Pipers. On a round-trip trans-Atlantic sailing, that line's Caronia
(formerly the Vistafjord) will feature singer Cleo Laine and
composer-musician husband John Dankworth and actress Liliane
Montevecchi.
</P>
<P>
   _ Entertainers aboard Carnival ships in the Caribbean will
include singers Shirley Jones (Holiday), John Davidson
(Imagination) and Florence Henderson (Fascination) and comedians
Alan King (Jubilee), David Brenner (Fantasy), Richard Jeni
(Inspiration) and George Wallace (Celebration and Tropicale).
</P>
<P>
   _ Holland America vessels also will feature King (on the Noordam
and Westerdam in the Caribbean) plus singer and classical guitarist
Charo (on the Statendam to Hawaii) and comedian Red Buttons (aboard
the Ryndam on a Panama Canal sailing).
</P>
<P>
   Other lines will offer entertainment, but not all lineups have
not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   A travel agent can provide brochures, prices and complete
itineraries, and make reservations.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I just bought a wallpaper that is not pre-pasted so I will
have to brush on my own paste and cannot simply dip each strip into
water. Unfortunately, I don't have a long table that will enable me
to unroll the full length of each strip when I want to apply paste
on the back, so I am not sure how to do this without rolling it out
on the floor and then working on my knees. Isn't there a better
way?
</P>
<P>
   A: There certainly is. You need a table that is only about five
or six feet long because each strip will be folded as you paste it.
</P>
<P>
   Start by unrolling the strip and then placing the top end of
this strip on one end of the table. Let the rest of the strip hang
down over the other end of the table while you spread the paste on
over the portion that is on the table. Then fold that end over as
shown here so that the pasted side is touching itself and so that
the folded area is now about one-third the total length of the
strip. Be sure you fold loosely without creasing at the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Next, slide the pasted end off the table (let it hang down over
the end of the table) and then finish pasting the rest of the
strip. Fold this part over in the same way so that the two ends are
almost touching _ again without creasing.
</P>
<P>
   You can now carry the folded strip over to the wall by draping
it over your arm. Unfold the top end first and apply this to the
wall, after which you can unfold the bottom end.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My bathroom vanity is stained with what looks like cigarette
burns and rust marks left by the previous tenant. How can I remove
these stains without damaging the plastic laminate top?
</P>
<P>
   A: Rust stains can often be removed by using a commercial rust
remover of the kind sold in hardware stores and home centers. You
can also try scrubbing with a scouring cleanser that contains
bleach, using a kitchen-type abrasive pad.
</P>
<P>
   Burn marks are seldom removable _ unless they are very shallow,
in which case the scorched material may come off by rubbing with a
very fine abrasive pad. However, if the burn is deep then it is
likely you will be left with a discolored or off-color stain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a problem with leaves accumulating in our roof
gutters because there are lots of trees around the house. Cleaning
out these gutters involves a great deal of ladder climbing. Is
there any way to simplify this job or minimize the need for doing
it so often, without pruning our beautiful trees?
</P>
<P>
   A: Cover the gutters with a protective mesh or ``gutter guard.''
Sold in most home centers and hardware stores this consists of
strips of a plastic or metal mesh that are shaped to fit over the
gutters.
</P>
<P>
   They are usually installed by slipping one edge under the bottom
row of roof shingles while the other edge snaps onto the outside
lip or rim of the gutter. The mesh traps leaves so they cannot fall
into the gutter. After the leaves dry out they get blown away by
the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our fairly new house has no basement and is built on a
concrete slab with wood parquet flooring on top of the slab. This
flooring often buckles and also squeaks badly in some places. What
do you think causes this, and what if anything can we do to correct
these problems?
</P>
<P>
   A: The buckling is probably due to the fact that when the
flooring was put down the installer did not leave proper clearance
space around the edges and next to the walls. This clearance is
needed to allow for expansion of the wood in humid weather so that
it will not buckle.
</P>
<P>
   The squeaking is probably another result of this same faulty
installation _ when the flooring buckles it also works loose, and
loose boards are the most frequent cause of squeaking. I suggest
hiring a flooring contractor or carpenter to see if trimming some
boards around the perimeter will solve your problems.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``FOLDING PASTED WALLPAPER'' goes with
this column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Pasted strip of wallpaper is folded so that pasted side
is against itself. This eliminates need for a long table and
simplifies carrying and handling the pasted strip.

ENCRYPTION TEAMS CIRCLE, FIRING AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., Mass.)   (af)  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The basic theory behind football, boxing and other collision
sports is to find the strongest contestants by bumping them into
one another. Now the National Institute of Standards and Technology
is using this method to choose a new encryption standard to protect
credit card numbers, personal data and other secrets as they travel
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of code makers are not only submitting new standards but
also trying to break the codes of other teams. The winner, to be
picked by the institute next year, will be knighted as the
``advanced encryption standard'' and embraced by government
computers. The private sector should eventually follow.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen teams of code makers entered the competition last year
and immediately set out trying to unravel their rivals' efforts.
Several promising entries have already been shredded by rival
mathematicians, and contestants are whispering about whose codes
will be next to fall. What is at stake is fame rather than fortune
because the institute requires the winner to forgo any royalties.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the National Institute of Standards and Technology
held such a contest was in the mid-'70s. IBM submitted the winning
entry then, only to discover that the National Security Agency
considered its new code to be so good that the design plan had to
be classified. That code received the name data encryption
standard, or DES. Now DES is now considered obsolete, especially
since a code-breaking computer has been shown to be able to crack a
typical message in one to three days.
</P>
<P>
   The NSA's involvement raised suspicions at the time that the
agency had secretly inserted a trapdoor (a piece of code that would
give the agency surreptitious access to encrypted material) into
DES to aid its eavesdropping, but no trapdoor has ever been found.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the standards institute is trying to counter
paranoia, which is an occupational hazard of code-makers and
code-breakers. The institute is actively encouraging public
comments, and all the competitors have circulated long descriptions
of their entries for public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is also courting European teams, in part
because digital commerce is in a global arena and widespread
adoption of the new standard will be a key to its success. One of
the three major conference shootouts was held in Rome last spring.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the standards institute selected five encryption
algorithms _ math-based systems _ as finalists. The finalists have
names that range from the arcane, Twofish, to the traditional,
RC-6; they include one planet, Mars; one animal name, Serpent, and
one Scandinavian name, Rijndael.
</P>
<P>
   The institute chose the finalists after considering the speed,
adaptability and security of the entrants.
</P>
<P>
   The competition will grow more intense as the teams prepare for
a final conference in March. The National Institute of Standards
and Technology will choose the winner next summer. Bruce Schneier,
the lead designer of Twofish and the president of Counterpane
Systems, a software company based in Minneapolis, said in an
interview: ``This fall the Twofish team is having a one-week
retreat. We're going to analyze ciphers. We're going to try to
break these things.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the finalists have any glaring weaknesses, which means
that the teams are also trying to one-up each other by comparing
their proposals' efficiency and adaptability. Speed is obviously
important, but so is the ability to run well on many different
classes of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The original call for submissions emphasized desktop computers,
but many of the teams are now concerned about designing the codes
to run well on relatively slow smart cards, plastic cards with
embedded chips that are used as debit or telephone cards or for
entry into buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Anderson, a lecturer at Cambridge University who is one of
the designers of Serpent, said: ``NIST asked us to design our
algorithms for Pentium processors, while the next century is likely
to be dominated by 64 bits on the desktop, 8 bits in smart cards,
with some 16 and 32 bits in mid-range embedded stuff. Some of us
saw to it that our algorithms would also run OK on low-end
processors; others did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing encryption codes is much closer to judging a figure
skating competition than a track meet because there are no good
techniques for proving that one code is definitively stronger than
another. Breaking a code is clear proof that a code isn't strong.
But you cannot prove a negative, that a given code cannot be
broken.
</P>
<P>
   The designers are a bit vexed by recent work showing that the
codes can be broken by tracking, in minute detail, the amount of
power consumed by a smart card running a code. None of the people
on the teams that are finalists have any great solution for
thwarting this type of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Many are handing off the problem to hardware designers, asking
them to find a way to make smart cards more opaque to determined
attackers with power measurement tools.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rivest, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who is the main designer of RC-6, said there was no easy
mathematical way to defend against power consumption snoopers.
``These issues are very important, but they seem to hit the
algorithms uniformly,'' he said. The best solution may be to choose
the best tamperproof hardware, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The job of selecting the winner will fall on the shoulders of
the standards institute's team of computer scientists studying
system security. The acting chief of the computer security
laboratory at the institute, Miles Smid, said in an interview that
the institute might want to select two winners so if one failed,
there would still be a backup.

A PROVOCATEUR WHOSE LANGUAGE IS THE ABSURD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Sweden)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 12)  
(DW) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is one thing you can say about the Swedish
choreographer Mats Ek: at his best, he is outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   The provocative image, its basic truth leavened with absurdity
and dark humor, is his forte. In his dance treatment of ``Carmen,''
for instance, the heroine symbolizes her independence by acting
like a man. When Don Jose stabs this Carmen in the tummy, a cigar
pops out of her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Ek's frequent reinterpretations of the classics
(drawn from ballet, opera and literature), Matthew Bourne's recent
``Swan Lake'' with male swans looks positively namby-pamby. Ek is
not as polite or as tame. Long known as a social-protest
choreographer, he aims less for the applause meter than the gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmen'' and ``Solo for Two'' make up the all-Ek program that
the Lyons Opera Ballet from France will perform at the Brooklyn
Academy's Harvey Theater (formerly the Majestic) from Oct. 19 to
24.
</P>
<P>
   Other troupes that dance Ek's works have already shown why he is
one of Europe's most talked about choreographers. At the Edinburgh
Festival this month, the Cullberg Ballet from Sweden presented his
modern-dress ``Sleeping Beauty'' with the heroine as drug addict.
Carabosse, the wicked fairy, is a dope pusher; the prince, a
racist, reforms by accepting the overdosed beauty's black baby.
</P>
<P>
   The sensationalist streak in Ek's work was already apparent in
1982 at the Metropolitan Opera House when the Netherlands Dance
Theater performed his ``House of Bernarda Alba.'' Ek portrayed
Bernarda, the Spanish matriarch of Lorca's play as a hypocritical
tyrant obsessively confusing erotic and religious ecstasy. The
dancers thrashed around the stage with cannonball force and Ek,
tall and powerful in his cassocklike dress, galvanized the piece,
never afraid to provoke _ or offend _ to make his point.
</P>
<P>
   Long before updated modern-dance versions of the ballet classics
came into vogue, Ek, now 54, set the pace. His best-known recension
is a ``Giselle'' (1980) whose second act is set in an insane
asylum. The usual white-clad wilis (ghosts of jilted maidens) are
now madhouse inmates with Myrtha, the wili queen, as their head
nurse. For Europeans attuned to themes of individuals whose spirit
is crushed by a social milieu, the Ek ``Giselle'' remains a
milestone. The Paris Opera Ballet staged it in 1993 alongside the
traditional 1841 version and revived the Ek production last year.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers saw this ``Giselle'' when Ek and his mother, Birgit
Cullberg, Sweden's celebrated modern-dance pioneer, presented it
during the Cullberg Ballet's U.S. debut at the Brooklyn Academy
Opera House in 1982. Americans have yet to see the Ek ``Swan Lake''
(1987), a nasty piece, with bald (plucked) and bare-legged male and
female swans.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ek knows that clever remakes of the classics go only so
far. In ``Solo for Two'' and ``Grass,'' which American Ballet
Theater performed in 1992, he offers original duets that explore
male-female relations.
</P>
<P>
   That Ek tends to think more like a theater director than a
choreographer is not surprising. His father was Anders Ek, one of
Sweden's leading actors. Although Ms. Cullberg, now 91, is world
famous (her ``Miss Julie'' was a Ballet Theater staple), Ek did not
immediately follow his brother Niklas Ek, 56, into dance. Like his
twin sister, the actress Malin Ek, he opted for drama, working as a
theater director in several troupes from 1966 to 1973. Early on he
was an assistant to Ingmar Bergman at the Royal Dramatic Theater.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, he had spent three months studying Martha Graham's
technique from Donya Feuer, an American modern-dance choreographer
living in Stockholm. But his formal dance training began in earnest
surprisingly late, when he was 27. In 1973, he joined the Cullberg
Ballet, founded by his mother in 1967 and directed by him from 1985
to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   To his admirers, Ek is a humanist, defending the oppressed in
the widest sense. But it was also once easy to see him as a message
choreographer whose concepts were better than his actual
choreography. His ``Soweto,'' in 1982 at the Brooklyn Academy, did
not show us anything new except that King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden
could maintain a Bjorn Borg-like cool in his box when a female
dancer turned to him and bared her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ek is an artist to take seriously. The king
notwithstanding, he shakes up audiences. While purely formal pieces
do not interest him, much of his choreography looks abstract and is
open to interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   One example is ``Solo for Two,'' originally titled ``Smoke''
when created for television with Sylvie Guillem and Niklas Ek. The
piece can be seen as a study in desire: a surprisingly tender image
has the woman doing a breast stroke as the man carries her
horizontally on his hip.
</P>
<P>
   A freelance choreographer since 1993, Ek showed off his
explosive style in his witty and strange ``Carmen.'' I saw it with
the Cullberg Ballet at the 1992 Lyons Dance Biennial. It is not
surprising that he is confident that the Lyons Opera Ballet has
mastered his eclectic and energetic idiom. This French company,
familiar here from past appearances (including Lincoln Center
Festival '96), specializes in contemporary choreographers. When I
saw it last year in Lyons, its sleek and committed dancers, many of
them new, looked more versatile than ever.

HE'S BACK _ BUT DONT CALL IT A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 12) 
(JT) 
 By ANTHONY DE CURTIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The artist formerly known as Prince leaned forward,
pointed to my notebook and raised his voice. ``I'm not going to be
on `Behind the Music,''' he asserted. ``Will you please say that?''
It's a demand in the guise of a question. And he was laughing, but
he was also dead serious.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Artist _ the tag by which he's come to be
known, for convenience as much as metaphoric resonance _ doesn't
watch the popular VH1 series himself. As he sat in a lounge at
Electric Lady Sound Studios in Greenwich Village, he cited chapter
and verse of shows about Hammer, TLC and Lenny Kravitz _ all,
significantly, African-American artists who, like him, have had
run-ins with the music industry. It's just that he has no patience
for the show's inevitable 12-step-derived emotional arc: Performer
enjoys huge success and gets ego-crazy; performer makes, then
ruefully acknowledges, enormous personal and professional mistakes;
performer makes amends and, chastened, moves on.
</P>
<P>
   The Artist, who is now 41, views his life in nothing remotely
like those terms. He may have spent much of this decade engaged in
an excruciatingly public battle to free himself from Warner
Brothers Records, the label that in 1992 negotiated a deal with him
that was reported to be worth as much as $100 million. He may have
disowned all the albums he made as Prince _ including such
masterpieces as ``Dirty Mind,'' ``Purple Rain'' and ``Sign `O' the
Times'' _ and sworn that he will re-record his entire catalog to
deprive Warner Brothers of royalties. He may have painted the word
``slave'' on his face and changed his name to an unpronounceable
symbol. And, despite having once been one of pop music's biggest
stars, he may have spent the last three years releasing music
exclusively _ and extensively _ on his own independent label, NPG
Records, and through his Web site. ``I don't even know how many
albums I've made now,'' he said coolly.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all that may be true, but the Artist is absolutely
unrepentant. On Nov. 2 he will release a new album, ``Rave Un2 the
Joy Fantastic,'' through an arrangement with Arista Records. It is
his first association with a major label since he put out the
three-CD set ``Emancipation'' (1996) through a similar agreement
with EMI Records, which subsequently went out of business. (Warner
Brothers, which dissolved its contract with the Artist in 1996, has
also just released an album of Prince outtakes titled ``The Vault .
. . Old Friends 4 Sale.'' The CD's notes include a disclaimer that
the ``enclosed material . . . was originally intended 4 private use
only.'') ``Rave'' will be introduced at a listening party in New
York for the international media _ and the Arista sales force _ on
Saturday. The first single, a powerful ballad called ``The Greatest
Romance Ever Sold,'' will be released on Sept. 22, and the Artist
will make a video to accompany it. ``I will be touring to promote
this album _ definitely,'' he said, and the tour will be extensive
and international. He tapped Gwen Stefani of No Doubt and the
rapper Chuck D. for cameos on the album. He has even announced that
while he remains the Artist Formerly Known as Prince, ``Rave,''
surprisingly enough, was produced by none other than Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if these developments signal a comeback of sorts, the
Artist shot back, ``A comeback from what?'' As far as he is
concerned, his way of going about things has not changed at all
since his chart-dominating days of the mid-80's. `` `We want you to
do this. We want you to do that' _ I've had people talk to me like
that. And loud,'' he said. `` `Everybody has to answer to someone,'
they'd tell me.'' His sense of insult _ and, again, his voice _
rose. ``I'd say, `I answer to God, fool.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clive Davis, the renowned founder and chief executive of Arista
and a no-nonsense industry veteran, is betting that ``Rave'' will
please Mammon as well as God.
</P>
<P>
   While he has supported outsiders like the Grateful Dead and
Patti Smith, Davis is best known as a hit maker, a man with sharp
commercial instincts and ambitions. Most recently, he signed the
guitarist Carlos Santana _ one of the Artist's idols _ to Arista,
helped produce his new album, ``Supernatural,'' and guided him to
the Top 10 for the first time in decades.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Artist professes no awareness of Davis'
relationship with Santana or anything else about Davis' career. ``I
knew nothing about him,'' he said simply, explaining that their
meeting came about at the suggestion of L. Londell McMillan, the
Artist's business partner. ``But he knows me. We agreed that the
album is full of hits. It was just a question of whether or not we
would agree on how it should be put out.''
</P>
<P>
   And, the Artist added, Davis ``agreed that I own the master
tapes'' _ a crucial issue in the Artist's war with Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Davis has long wanted to work with the Artist, and
he is determined to make ``Rave'' a success. Indeed, when Davis
speaks about the Artist, ``rave'' is the operative word. ``This is
a poet, a renaissance man, an iconoclast,'' Davis said. ``This is
someone who is bringing the state of music further and further
along. I don't want to get involved in whether this is hype or not
_ the man is at the top of his form. He's coming back peak. I don't
think it's an accident that the album is produced by Prince. That
says it right there.''
</P>
<P>
   But that says what, exactly? Davis comes gently down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, you're never going to pin him down on something like
that,'' he said with a laugh. ``He said with a twinkle in his eye
that Prince has always been his favorite producer, and he was the
right person for this project. There certainly have been hits
associated with Prince. But whether it's the Artist Formerly Known
as or the production of Prince, it works.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to be skeptical about Davis' enthusiasm, but
the undeniable fact is that, regardless of his commercial fortunes,
the Artist still holds a great degree of allure among both
executives and performers in the music industry. Label honchos
often take their ability to work successfully with eccentric
artists as a point of pride, and the Artist has no equal in that
regard. Performers, meanwhile, view him as the epitome of an
artist's Artist, a man who creates whenever and however the mood
strikes him and who plays by nobody else's rules.
</P>
<P>
   That the Artist carries himself, both on stage and off, with
instinctive rock-star hauteur doesn't hurt either. ``He's splendid,
he's sumptuous, oh my God, he's so striking,'' said Ani DiFranco,
another rebel artist, who plays guitar on one track on ``Rave.''
``Being someone who also lives in her own world and makes a
ridiculous amount of records, just to watch him work was
fascinating. Any instrument he picks up, he speaks through. He's an
example of the ability to keep being inspired by your life. Also,
he's sexy. I certainly haven't been immune!''
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Crow also appears on the new album, singing and playing
harmonica on a ballad titled ``Baby Knows.'' ``It's not only his
ability to play so many instruments, it's the level at which he
plays them,'' said Ms. Crow of the Artist, who plays virtually all
the instruments on ``Rave.'' ``I've heard him play piano like Chick
Corea or Herbie Hancock, move over to bass and play like Larry
Graham, then play guitar like Jimi Hendrix or Buddy Guy. He's
written some of the most amazing songs ever. And the main
impression I was left with is that he really loves what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed entirely in black save for his yellow, ankle-length,
high-heeled boots, the matching gold trim on his beret and the gold
pendant with the symbol that is his name hanging around his neck,
the Artist was putting the final touches on his album at Electric
Lady, which was built by Jimi Hendrix, another of his heroes. His
wife, Mayte, sat nearby. The Artist's distrust of contracts extends
to their marriage bonds, which they have mutually dissolved, though
they remain a couple. ``We read them over, and there were a lot
things in there we didn't like,'' the Artist casually explained,
referring to the marriage documents they signed in 1996. Any
further consequences of that decision remain unspecified. Mayte
currently lives in Spain, while he continues to live in his
hometown, Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Artist was reluctant to let me hear any of the
album or even to reveal the titles of the songs. ``I'm tripping on
that; when I listen, I prefer not knowing what the titles are,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as I was about to leave a couple of hours later, he asked,
almost shyly: ``Would you like to hear some of it? I'd hate to have
you go without hitting you with something.'' In the studio's
control room, he played sections of four songs at such crushing
volume that a rubber fish sitting on top of a speaker fell off
because of the shaking. The Artist can't be still while the music
is playing, so every few seconds he came over and shouted
commentary into my ear. He was speaking as loudly as he could, but
I could barely hear him.
</P>
<P>
   One sentence came through loud and clear, however. ``Tell me
that's not a hit,'' he insisted as the swelling choruses and Arabic
scales of ``The Greatest Romance Ever Sold'' washed over us. I
turned to look at him. His chest was puffed out and he was smiling.
His hips and shoulders were moving. But in his dark eyes, beneath
the bravado, there was a vulnerability he refused to acknowledge,
as well as a hope that the answer would be what he needed to hear.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two things are likely to transform a landscape or change a
house: a force of nature or people. Dorothy Cullman is a bit of
both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love change,'' said Mrs. Cullman, 75, with visceral relish,
as though she were describing her favorite food, the kind you have
to dig out of a shell. She sat on her new porch in Sag Harbor,
N.Y., relaxed but by no means retired after the year of renovations
that created the home _ her third. A Mexican silver earring flashed
at her ear like a glimpse of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an adventurer,'' said Diana Vinoly, an interior
designer, who, with her husband, the architect Rafael Vinoly,
helped Mrs. Cullman and her husband, Lewis, 80, transform three
modest buildings on two narrow lots in the town's historic district
into a contemporary country compound: a house that, with two
discrete guest wings, looks as if it's gone for a stroll in the
park.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an unusual sympathy between Mrs. Cullman and Ms.
Vinoly, the house also advances the moment in modern interior
design.
</P>
<P>
   It is eclectic, but collaboratively so. The client's impeccable
confidence informed the designer's sophisticated choices. Ms.
Vinoly picked out the 1950s Paul McCobb ladder-back dining chairs;
Mrs. Cullman put a 1930s French glass table at the center, like
throwing open a window.
</P>
<P>
   The house is not shy of architectural surprise, either: at Mrs.
Cullman's direction, Vinoly removed four ship's-cabin-size rooms
upstairs, installing a single suite of bedroom and bathroom that is
a minimalist's interpretation of a traditional Japanese inn. For an
18th-century seaside community like Sag Harbor, it is as if
Melville became a monk instead of a mariner.
</P>
<P>
   The Cullmans are no strangers to transformation. With a history
of philanthropic funding that has changed the cultural landscape of
New York City, they constitute a two-person Who's Who at
institutions like the New York Public Library and the American
Museum of Natural History. They are also collectors and inveterate
travelers: they have skipped the globe like stones.
</P>
<P>
   At home, their interests never rest. Rough, lustrous Oaxacan
ceramics had come out for coffee; a Saul Steinberg drawing sat
waiting for a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how we connected,'' Ms. Vinoly said, barefoot in
plum-colored toenail polish at the house, recalling how she met the
couple. Mrs. Cullman, in Issey Miyake, had admired Ms. Vinoly's
dress, by Miyake, at a dinner party. ``We became friends, and
suddenly I was doing her house. She met my youngest son, who is a
filmmaker, with his girlfriend; liked him, invited him to a party.
She invited Brook Astor _ same level. Very few people are like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Married for 36 years, the Cullmans disagree consistently enough
in conversation to constitute the kind of Pat and Mike agreement
good teams reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis is so resentful about coming out here,'' Mrs. Cullman
said, with the tease of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Cullman, the chairman of Cullman Ventures Inc., which includes
the At-a-Glance Group, the calendar publisher, waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty nice house in Darien,'' he said, smiling.
``What do we need another house for?'' The Connecticut farmhouse
was built in 1720; Cullman modernized it in 1950. They also have a
New York apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That house is part of his being,'' Mrs. Cullman said. ``He has
so much emotionally invested in it. I wanted to get out of Darien
for a long time. I had offered him Martha's Vineyard, South of
France.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullman added, ``London,'' as though he were clocking his pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cullman seized her chance last summer, on a visit to the
Vinolys' house in Water Mill, N.Y. She recalled Vinoly, whose
projects include the Tokyo International Forum and the Princeton
Stadium, being asked how, as a modern architect, he could live in
an old house.``He said, `You think I would live in a modern house?
I am not crazy. If you buy a house, I'll remodel it.' And I
thought, what a marvelous opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cullman found the 3,000-square-foot main house listed in
the newspaper; friends and family treated the find as if it had
come wrapped in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who lived in East Hampton or Southampton said, `Sag
Harbor!' '' Mrs. Cullman said. ``I wanted a small house. I did not
want to be on Lily Pond, in the midst of the glitz.''
</P>
<P>
   The little white house had its own kind of glamour. ``It was
turquoise inside,'' Mrs. Cullman said. ``Every doorway was painted
malachite, with shells.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vinoly said, ``Very chi-chi.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women were sitting on the porch, like sisters,
discussing what to wear to the September wedding of Kitty Hawks,
the decorator.
</P>
<P>
   ``End of the summer, five o'clock,'' Mrs. Cullman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so in-between,'' Ms. Vinoly said. ``It's almost like she
wants to see what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   The two shopped for the furniture together, in Ms. Vinoly's
fire-engine red 1961 MG convertible, stopping for picnics in the
car. Mrs. Cullman crystallized her vision of African, Japanese and
contemporary influences, she said. Ms. Vinoly took her to favorite
stores like Ruby Beets and Mary Ann Lembo in Bridgehampton,
Aesthetics Home Furnishings in Water Mill and Youngblood in Sag
Harbor, and to dealers like Tucker Robbins, Donzella, Frank Rogin,
Palumbo and Zero to Sixties in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want you to buy a pin without me seeing it,'' Ms.
Vinoly recalled her saying.
</P>
<P>
   Their dialogue produced a fresh, informal vocabulary for modern
interior design, recently popular but increasingly formulaic. In
turn, the house at the shore has the subtle coolness of modern
design's crisp, clean lines. It is a kind of low-key high style.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Cullmans' living room, nothing is what it seems _ the
furnishings are an intelligent parlor game. There are new
Jean-Michel Frank-like square sofas, but they are sea-grass
versions, upholstered in white cotton. Mrs. Cullman wrapped the
back cushions in her collection of Indonesian sarongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many sarongs I thought I was going to wear,''
she said. ``They ended up in a drawer.''
</P>
<P>
   On the wide-planked floor are natural fiber mats, but they are
vintage Mauretanian examples, patterned with woven leather. Two
rattan garden chairs were designed by Pierre Chareau in the 1930s.
A pair of free-form, rosewood coffee tables look like the work of
George Nakashima, the celebrated woodworker. They are African
driftwood that Mrs. Cullman had mounted like sculpture on
wrought-iron bases. The rope-seated side chairs that flank them are
from Nakashima's studio. Clover-leaf end tables have an early
American profile: they are 1940s, by Dunbar Furniture Co. Ms.
Vinoly gave them red leather lamps, stamped to look like handbag
crocodile.
</P>
<P>
   The two women were an education to each other. ``I'm a
modernist,'' Ms. Vinoly said. ``When I do a city project, it's very
urban. When I do a country house, it's more country. For Dorothy,
it's completely irrelevant. I am eclectic, but with her, I learned
you can be really eclectic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cullman said, ``I have a theory: no matter when it was
made, if you can find the best of the period, you can mix it with
any other period.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Mrs. Cullman watched her personal instincts
implemented as signatures of the Vinolys' design.

   Upstairs, the stripped space was refitted with precisely planed
raw pine and maple. Vinoly created a wooden-box bathroom that sits
inside the gabled bedroom like a sauna. The exterior provides a
headboard wall, which Mrs. Cullman hung with a set of Robert
Mangold prints. Ms. Vinoly chose a Nakashima bedroom set.
Attic-like eaves are enclosed by sliding shoji screens, veiled by
linen, that provide storage. Noguchi silk lanterns light the room
at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can turn out looking like a Japanese restaurant,'' Mrs.
Cullman said. ``One wrong move and you're finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, guests arrived for lunch. Cullman led them past the
Scott Burton sculptures into the parklike garden and grounds,
landscaped by Bayberry Nurseries in Amagansett.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cullman shared a secret. Though it was their second weekend
in the house, change was in the air. The terrace dining furniture
was living on borrowed time; two Kiki Smith collages were coming
out from the city, as centerpieces for the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men think, if they buy something, they're going to have it
forever,'' she said, descending the stairs to rejoin her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cullman adjusted an earring before greeting her guests.
``Women don't,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood.
This is my street. This is my life. In less than a year I'll be
dead. Of course I don't know that yet. In a way I'm dead already.
</P>
<P>
   These are the opening words of the ``American Beauty''
screenplay, the ones that startled Sam Mendes, the 34-year-old
Englishman who directed the Broadway hits ``Cabaret'' and ``The
Blue Room,'' and turned him into a film director.
</P>
<P>
   ``From those first words,'' he said, ``I couldn't put it down. I
read it three times in quick succession.''
</P>
<P>
   The script was by Alan Ball, a first-time screenwriter with an
off-Broadway play and television sit-coms on his resume _ none of
which hinted at the dark, phantasmagoric view of suburban life
revealed in ``American Beauty.'' It's the story of a desperately
dissatisfied middle-aged man married to a grasping, equally
dissatisfied real estate broker. Their family life is a sham, their
teen-age daughter despises them and her sultry best friend has the
father's sexual fantasies going full-time. The movie, with Kevin
Spacey and Annette Bening in the lead roles, opens on Wednesday.
Its director, seated in the coffee shop at Shutters on the Beach, a
hotel in Santa Monica, is still unable to articulate exactly what
the film is about.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a mystery at the film's core,'' Mendes said. ``Yet I
felt a very, very personal reaction to it. Somewhere in the film is
a lot of anger and rage on the part of Alan Ball. And the biggest
pitfall for me was to make a serious film that could also be funny
and emotional and move you.''
</P>
<P>
   The director, regarded as a wunderkind of British theater since
his early 20s, is friendly and unpretentious, a somewhat cherubic
figure with an easy laugh. But the normally voluble Mendes shies
away from discussing the ways in which the film's story resonates
with his own. He will identify one element of the ``American
Beauty'' plot that personally stirred him: the love affair between
the daughter, played by Thora Birch, and the drug-dealing son of
the tyrannical ex-Marine who lives next door. ``I'm an only
child,'' he said. ``This was about dysfunctional families. And
without wanting to sound rude about it, my family was not entirely
functional.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, his middle-class, north London childhood was
lonely. His parents divorced when he was 5. His father, Peter
Mendes, who is of Portuguese ancestry, is a retired university
lecturer in English literature. Young Sam lived with his mother,
Valerie Mendes, who writes children's books and was in the
publishing business.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes likes to find a personal dimension in his projects. His
mother is Jewish, and the realization that both she and he would
have been marked for death during the Holocaust was one reason
Mendes wanted to take on ``Cabaret.'' Being a bachelor _ albeit one
who has been linked to the actresses Jane Horrocks, Rachel Weisz
and Calista Flockhart _ Mendes has been drawn in recent years to
works about the search for love. In 1996, he directed an acclaimed
revival of Stephen Sondheim's single-guy musical, ``Company,'' at
the Donmar Warehouse, the nonprofit theater Mendes runs.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his childhood becoming a skilled cricket player,
reading books and watching movies. ``I was a troubled fantasist,''
he said. ``Well, most fantasists are troubled. I was escaping from
my parents' divorce. It was just me and my mother, and so I lived
in my head a great deal of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cambridge, he toyed with the idea of becoming a journalist.
But after his graduation, in 1987, he took a low-level job at the
Chichester Festival Theater. He says he was hired largely on the
strength of his cricketing ability _ the director of the Chichester
Festival at the time, John Gale, was looking for cricket players
who could beat the team fielded by the Royal Shakespeare Co..
</P>
<P>
   His rise was startling. When a veteran stage director suddenly
dropped out of a production of ``London Assurance,'' Mendes was
asked to step in. By the time Mendes was 24, ``London Assurance''
had transferred to the Theater Royal, Haymarket, and a second play
that he directed, ``The Cherry Orchard,'' starring Dame Judi Dench,
had opened at the Aldwych.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that I loved directing. I loved the company of other
people, because I had so little of it when I was a kid,'' he said.
``When I walked in and did it, I thought, `Oh, this is so great.'
And it combined the company of people and the visual arts, which I
had studied. I was able to paint, to a degree, on a stage. And I'm
not a very gifted painter.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Mendes became artistic director of the Donmar, where he
directed _ and rethought _ ``Cabaret,'' ``The Glass Menagerie'' and
``Company.'' The work on ``Company'' led to a friendship with
Stephen Sondheim, and Mendes is now preparing the new Sondheim
musical, ``Wise Guys,'' due this spring on Broadway. He is also
ready to sign a film-directing deal with Dreamworks.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised Mendes about filmmaking? ``The biggest surprise
was how mundane filmmaking is in many ways, how it's a mosaic and
you polish every little piece and it was very slow, very
practical,'' he said. ``Even bigger than that was the sheer joy of
editing. I mean, it was the most creative thing I've ever done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing about theater is the creative thing is
at the very beginning of the process. The rehearsals are great.
With movies, the creative thing was at the end. I didn't realize
the incredible pleasure of, once you've got your footage,
manipulating it and beginning to tell a story and cutting to a
close-up or adding a music track. That astonished me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendes was also surprised at the results of his inexperience. In
fact, his filmmaking career almost ended before it began. Mendes'
first three days directing ``American Beauty'' were, by his own
account, disastrous. After watching the dailies, Mendes felt
himself sinking in quicksand. The director asked Dreamworks whether
he could reshoot those scenes. The obviously nervous Dreamworks
executives agreed to start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were more than a couple of sleepless nights when I
thought, `Just help me out here,''' said Mendes. ``I started with a
wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way
too big. And I thought, `Oh my God.' And it was my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad
costumes, my fault,'' he said. ``And everybody was doing what I was
asking. It was all my fault. You can't slough off responsibility as
a movie director. Everybody's hanging on every word.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendes regained his footing; the reshoots worked.
</P>
<P>
   As a novice film director, Mendes said he depended heavily on
his director of photography, 72-year-old Conrad L. Hall, the master
cinematographer who won an Academy Award for his work on ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' (1969). ``I made a very conscious
decision early on, if I didn't understand something technically, to
say, without embarrassment, `I don't understand what you're talking
about, please explain it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are great similarities between the theater and films if
you have a visual imagination,'' he said. ``But theater emerges
through the mists in rehearsal. It's slow and rather social, it's a
collaboration. In theater if you say, `I don't know,' it leads to a
chat, it opens many doors, the beginning of a journey. If you say,
`I don't know' on a film set, you're dead. Because everyone's
going, `Well, if you don't know, who does?' You have to have it in
your head at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Even highly experienced British and Australian filmmakers have
fumbled when they came to the United States to make movies that
deal with the specifics of American life. Yet ``American Beauty''
seems fully conversant with the nuances of suburban life.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes discounted the notion that the film was, specifically,
about American life. Yes, he had spent time driving through New
York, New Jersey and Los Angeles on his trips to the United States.
But, he said: ``I don't think I tried to make a film about America.
But sometimes as an outsider, as an observer, you can see things
more clearly. Look at `Midnight Cowboy,' `Chinatown,' `The Truman
Show.' These were not made by American directors. The most accurate
depiction of Berlin in the 1930s was written by an Englishman,
Christopher Isherwood.''
</P>
<P>
   Before filming began, Mendes said, he and Spacey _ who was his
first choice for the role _ watched a videotape of Jack Lemmon in
the Billy Wilder film ``The Apartment.'' Mendes said, ``The way
Jack Lemmon moved, the way he looked, the way he was in that office
and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man _ that's
what I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   He also watched several other films for the heightened sense of
style that he sought: Martin Scorsese's ``King of Comedy,'' Bob
Fosse's ``All That Jazz'' and Roman Polanski's ``Rosemary's Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendes almost didn't get the job directing ``American Beauty,''
an assignment coveted by a number of well-known filmmakers. Ball's
script had begun circulating in March 1998. Most top studio
executives found it riveting but uncommercial. Robert Cooper, the
former head of production at Dreamworks, was given the script by a
Dreamworks development executive, Scott Williamson. Cooper
remembers Williamson's telling him, ``It's about a dysfunctional
family, but believe me, you've got to read it.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Cooper phoned his boss, Steven Spielberg. By the
next morning, Dreamworks had purchased the script for $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The directors Robert Zemeckis and Mike Nichols wanted to make
it, but other projects got in the way. Experienced directors
lobbied for the job. In the interim, the film's two producers, Dan
Jinks and Bruce Cohen, had seen ``Cabaret'' in New York and invited
Mendes to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes met not only the producers and Ball but also Spielberg
and Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald, two top film executives
there. He was offered the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very un-English thing to do, but I kind of pitched
myself,'' Mendes said with a laugh. ``I said these people in it had
to be real and it had to have a very distinct style and I would get
a great cinematographer and I'd storyboard it and I'd have Kevin
Spacey and Annette Benning and not stars like Costner or
Travolta.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg insisted that he wasn't deeply concerned about Mendes'
inexperience. ``I had seen his production of `Oliver' on the London
stage while I was making `Saving Private Ryan,''' Spielberg said.
``I still remember the way he used lighting and the sets and
entrances and exits. It was a visual candy store. I sort of banked
his name in my mind. And then I saw `Cabaret.' It was so visually
splendid. Watching his plays _ he controlled the focus of my lens.
And it left you with an emotional impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey, an Academy Award winner for his supporting role in ``The
Usual Suspects'' (1996), said he read the script in London while
appearing in ``The Iceman Cometh'' and was surprised that Mendes
wanted him for the role of Lester. ``I usually play characters who
are very quick, very manipulative and smart,'' he said. ``I usually
wade in dark, sort of treacherous waters. This is a man living one
step at a time, playing by his instincts. This is actually much
closer to me, to what I am, than those other parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey said that Mendes' theatrical background _ and his lack of
film experience _ actually benefited the movie. ``One of the
advantages of working with first-time directors is that they don't
have rules, they're not entrenched in their own style,'' Spacey
said. ``And as a theatrical director, Sam knows about story, about
words, about arc. He knows how to handle the emotional terrain. Add
to that he's a visual stylist. What more could you want?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bening, who burst into tears after seeing the film for the
first time, said that Mendes' theatrical training overlapped with
an unusual level of confidence for a first-time movie director.
``He was constantly focused on the story, and that comes from the
theater,'' she said. ``The camera never calls attention to itself.
This is someone who didn't go to film school. You can tell. There's
nothing fancy about the way the story is told. It's simple in the
best sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Mendes is planning the Sondheim musical and
nervously awaiting the release of ``American Beauty.'' Over the
years, he had toyed with the idea of directing other films _ but
backed out because of his inexperience. ``I got cold feet on a
couple of occasions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendes said, ``The script took the decision out of my hands,
because I wanted to do it so much.'' He added, ``I went out and
said, `Please, this is what I want to do.' And they let me do it.''
He grinned. ``And now let's see what happens.''

TALKING AUTO COMPUTERS OFFER DIRECTIONS, DRIVING TIPS AND MORE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich., Nev.)   (nk) 
 By MICHEL MARRIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I've made the 16-mile trip from my apartment on
Manhattan's Upper West Side to a favorite restaurant on City Island
in the Bronx dozens of times. Yet a recent drive there over the
asphalt spaghetti of parkways and interstate expressways was,
thanks to the latest injection of digital technology into our
lives, like no other.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the voices of my wife and 3-year-old daughter in the
car, there was a robotic voice emanating from the automobile's
in-dash personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have four new messages,'' it said calmly when I asked
about the day's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From news, received August 26th, '99, 7:58 p.m., hijacking in
Spain ends peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of promises and hands-off demonstrations at computer
and consumer electronics shows, the talking car is finally falling
into the hands of consumers. One of the first, the Clarion Auto PC,
is the result of a four-year collaboration between Microsoft and
the Clarion Corp., which makes car audio systems. The computer,
which was intentionally designed to fit into the slot in which car
stereo systems are installed in the factory, is on the market. And
its makers say it can be used in practically any car.
</P>
<P>
   This car system can say a lot more than just ``door ajar.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clarion Auto PC is about the size of a standard car stereo
and looks a lot like one, too. While I was driving along, it read
aloud short e-mail messages (drawn from the air by way of a special
FM radio receiver), real-time weather updates, news headlines and
reports on traffic conditions while spinning my CD's at a lowered
volume. It even plotted a series of detailed and often stunningly
accurate directions to the restaurant, gently guiding me with voice
prompts _ in its own oddly abbreviated style _ linked to the
computer's optional Global Positioning System receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two-and-a-half miles, bear right to on-ramp Cross-Bronx
Expr slash 178 Street slash Geo Washington B R,'' it said in a
clipped chirp (a voice I choose by adjusting the PCs pitch and tone
controls) after leading me to the Henry Hudson Parkway from my
apartment building near Columbus Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, PCs have become remarkably mobile and compact,
moving rapidly from desktop, laptop and handheld to coat pocket and
pocketbook. Now PCs are popping up in cars, offering their services
while threatening to take away a haven where a driver can sit and
essentially do nothing (other than concentrate on the road &UR;  &LR; _
unless the driver breaks that concentration by talking on a cell
phone, of course).
</P>
<P>
   ``Commuting in your car is the last piece of unconstructed time
left,'' said Jukka Rissanen, a Clarion project marketing
specialist. He noted that more than  &UR;  &LR; 80 million people traveled to
and from their jobs in cars. More than a quarter of them spend more
than two hours crammed into cars each workday, with little else to
do but listen to their stereos and stare through their windshields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge untapped market for connectivity and
productivity,'' Rissanen said.
</P>
<P>
   The market is untapped largely because the car is one of the few
places left that isn't wired. As Rissanen pointed out, all it would
take to extend the office and living room into the car's front seat
would be a car-based computer that can, as the Auto PC
does, &UR;  &LR; retrieve and read e-mail; dial a number on a cellular
telephone, using an address book database; record memorandums; and
transfer information through wireless connections from palm-size
personal data assistants.
</P>
<P>
   Will that also mean a loss of the freedom that Americans in
particular have always associated with the automobile? What will it
mean to be on the road but within easy reach of anyone through
e-mail _ and, thanks to the GPS receiver, perhaps one day be easily
located by anybody?
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Frady, executive director of the National Automobile
Museum in Reno, Nev., predicted that car-based PCs would become as
common as car radios in the near future. ``We are finding that cars
are becoming home offices,'' she said. ``I think the car as family
transportation to go out for a Sunday drive and have ice cream and
a picnic belongs to a day gone by.''
</P>
<P>
   The Auto PC is not the only talking computer rolling down the
road. A voice-activated computer system developed by Visteon is
already offered with the new Jaguar LS. It manages the car's
heating and air-conditioning controls and radio and offers
hands-free dialing for cell phones. ``We think consumers are
looking for a way to optimize their time spent in a vehicle, be it
a better form of entertainment or business professionals needing to
check up on their e-mail,'' said Lori Markatos, the product team
leader for multimedia systems at Visteon Automotive Systems in
Dearborn, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The Visteon computer is installed at the factory and cannot be
easily moved into another car. The Auto PC, however, is a
60-megahertz computer (a Hitachi SH3 microprocessor with 16
megabytes of DRAM and 8 megabytes of ROM) that is made for the
``after market,'' which means that it &UR;  &LR; can be installed in almost
any car or even removed from a car its owner intends to sell, then
reinstalled in another car. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With a price that starts at about $1,300, the Auto PC costs
about the same as a low-end desktop PC. But while it does have a
few handy buttons and a trackball, this is a computer that was
mostly built to be talked to instead of touched.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But before drivers turn over the inside of their cars to these
dashboard cousins of Hal 9000, there are some bugs to be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   On my test drive, the Auto PC, which uses a simple and intuitive
version of Windows CE, responded to most of my voice commands. When
I said, ``Radio,'' the radio played. When I said, ``CD player,''
the first of six compact disks I had loaded began playinc. When I
said, ``Normal,'' the volume of the music settled on a pleasant
level.
</P>
<P>
   The command ``Auto PC,'' brought the unit to life. It indicated
its readiness with a dotted green line along its eight-color,
liquid-crystal-display screen. A different wake-up command can be
added to the basic 200 commands the computer can understand by
going to its set-up screen. I reset the computer to awaken whenever
it heard me intone, ``Computer.'' I couldn't resist pronouncing
``computer'' with a hint of a Scottish lilt, much like the way
Scotty spoke on the starship Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer fails to respond, you're in trouble. On a
previous test drive in New Jersey, the computer crashed for no
apparent reason, other than perhaps demonstration fatigue. Because
the Auto Clarion PC doubles as the car's AM-FM radio and CD player,
I had to drive back in total silence. It's a good thing it is not
tied to the car's brakes and ignition system. When Rissanen hit the
Reset button, the computer came back online with its default
settings.
</P>
<P>
   When the Auto PC does work, it requires little training. When I
began my trip to the restaurant, I asked the computer where I was.
For about 10 seconds, &UR;  &LR; it consulted its satellite system.
``Somewhere near Central Park and West 86th Street,'' it informed
me as I sat by the curb and punched in my destination information.
The information is entered on a small telephone-like keypad to the
right of the display screen. To enter the letter C for instance,
you press the 2 key four times (one press equals 2, two equals A,
three equals B). Before beginning, the computer warns the driver
that this procedure should never be done while the car is in
motion. To punch the keys while watching the display to make
certain that all the information is correctly entered takes all the
driver's attention anyway; driving at the same time would be
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  A special directional microphone mounted on the sun visor on
the driver's side picks up the commands. While the powered
microphone is designed to screen out background noises, I noticed
that the computer was much more attentive when the car's windows
were up. While I was idling with the windows down next to a
rumbling city bus, I had to practically scream at the computer
before it would acknowledge me.
</P>
<P>
   When the Auto PC becomes hard of hearing, you can awaken the
computer to receive commands by pushing a small button _ in my test
car, it was beneath the emergency brake handle. I found myself
mashing that button quite a bit when I had the car's stereo cranked
up to a salsa-friendly volume. Even under the best of conditions,
the Auto PC is most responsive when it is spoken to with a stern,
clear tone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that meant barking orders in a voice loud enough to
startle drivers waiting next to me at stoplights. But hey, it's a
machine. Politeness doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   Still, enough commands were understood to make the trip
interesting, like the time when I tired of my CDs and shouted,
``Radio.'' When a random station came up, I simply said, ``Jazz,''
and my favorite jazz station (which I had preset) began to fill the
car with an early Miles Davis solo. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   While I was fascinated by the machine's ability to understand
the human voice, I felt at points more like Jerry Van Dyke in ``My
Mother the Car'' than William Shatner in ``Star Trek.'' A bit more
kooky than cool.
</P>
<P>
   And even though a user doesn't have to look at the computer when
speaking to it, it's hard to not look at it _ as if it were a
person _ when making a request. From time to time, I found myself
defeating the purpose of the computer's interface engineering by
taking my eyes off the road to address it.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tiny keyboard of sorts for more complex functions,
like punching in destination information for GPS-assisted
navigation. And if the driver doesn't feel like asking, the
keyboard can be used for some simple jobs, like calling up the next
preset station on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   For the makers of car computers, the possibilities are almost
endless. Designers are talking about having a computer linked to a
car's fuel gauge so that when fuel runs low, the computer can
search its database for the nearest (and perhaps the cheapest)
gasoline station and guide the driver there. Car PCs could also be
tied to the car's vital systems _ engine, transmission, suspension
_ and warn of trouble before something breaks down, then transmit
that information through a wireless connection to a waiting
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   The car computer's wireless communications _ which Ms. Markatos,
of Visteon, calls telematics _ may someday be more important than
roadside billboards. Restaurants, shopping centers and motels could
beam word of their blue-plate specials, basement bargains and room
rates to cars as they approached. And the car-based computers could
let passengers browse menus, place orders and register for a
night's rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kinds of companies want to be involved in that kind of
thing,'' Ms. Markatos said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, because the Auto PC (and the many others that will
probably follow it to the marketplace) is a personal computer, it
can be personalized by deciding what programs to install into it. I
can foresee an application that would wirelessly connect to my
son's business college in Ohio so that I could have the computer
read me information about his scholarship possibilities as I drive
to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Mundane? Perhaps. OK, it might be some time before I can cry,
``More power!'' to rev up a starship's computer. But telling the
Auto PC to read my e-mail while I prepared to play my favorite
Charlie Parker CD as I steered into a New York nightscape felt a
lot like the future.

MANA CROSSES BORDERS AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   In their native Mexico and other parts of Latin America, the
Spanish-language rock group Mana has been about as popular in their
native tongue as The Beatles were in theirs. And the four-man rock
group did it the hard way: eschewing traditional Latin instruments
for the guitars, bass and drums of mainstream rock 'n' roll while
keeping their vocals in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Mana and its ``combination'' approach has
mushroomed to become the world's most popular and best-selling of
such acts, dubbed ``rock en espanol.''
</P>
<P>
   Of its 6 million albums sold worldwide, more than 2 million of
those have been bought in the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   And Mana (pronounced ``ma-NAH'') remains the only true rock
group from Latin American to have an album certified gold (for
sales of 500,000 copies) north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Its new album, ``MTV Unplugged'' _ which breaks another barrier
by becoming the only Spanish-language album to achieve that status
_ was the first-ever rock en espanol album to debut at No. 1 on
Billboard's Latin charts.
</P>
<P>
   So Ricky Martin may get much of the hype and mainstream name
recognition in the United States, but Mana's status as the
most-successful rock en espanol group in the States makes it
equally significant in the Latin pop crossover phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Mana now crosses English-language barriers as easily
as it crosses the American border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time the tortilla flipped,'' Fernando ``Fher''
Olvera, Mana's lead singer and chief songwriter, told Latina
magazine. ``For Years, Latinos have been listening to rock in
English, and singing words to words they don't even understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Olvera, who started Mana 13 years ago in Guadalajara with
drummer Alex Gonzalez, knows what he's talking about.
</P>
<P>
   In their youth, Olvera, Gonzalez and bassist Juan Calleros may
have come from poor families. But they were just as influenced by
the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the Police as many of their
northern counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The original goal of the group, called Sombrero Verde when it
began in 1986, was just to put food on the table. ``I began the
band to make money to eat, frankly,'' Olvera told the Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us came from wealthy families. Sometimes we had huge
problems. We sold no records, we had no concerts. But thanks to
Sombrero Verde, I paid my way through college.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came in 1992, when an early album called
``Donde Jugaran Las Ninas?'' (``Where Will the Little Girls
Play?'') became a hit and sold more than 3 million copies
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the band, which changed its name to Mana (for
``godsend'') when guitarist Sergio Vallin joined in 1994,
popularized rock en espanol and became its de facto definition.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has always incorporated Latin musical influences with
its guitars, bass and drums, however, despite the fact that Olvera
draws comparisons with English singer Sting because of his high
vocal range.
</P>
<P>
   So just because nine of the 15 songs on ``MTV Unplugged'' have
their lyrics translated to English in the CD booklet, doesn't mean
Mana plans to record an album in English anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it doesn't mean it won't, either.

 &HT;    TEXAS RANGERS WILL GIVE HOUSE PANEL MATERIAL ON WACO
 &HT;    480&AMP;add. With WACO.
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR and JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional investigators expect to receive new
evidence as early as Friday in their latest probe of the fiery
federal siege of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers, the state's police force, has informed the
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee that it will turn
over material in response to a subpoena seeking documents, videos
and audio tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The material is from the Rangers' investigation of the standoff
between law enforcement agents and Branch Davidian leader David
Koresh and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators hope the material will offer insight
into the FBI's recent admission that agents launched potentially
flammable tear gas canisters at a concrete outpost near the cult's
compound on April 19, 1993. That admission is controversial because
the agency had steadfastly denied for six years that it used any
devices that could have started the fire that day.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas Rangers spokesman Mike Cox said the Rangers
expected to comply with the subpoena on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to the committee and were told it was a friendly
subpoena and to take as long as we needed,'' Cox said. ``Our
present plan is to get it to them by Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the committee requested documents and would receive ``a
report, as I understand it, a summary of the investigation and
maybe some support matter,'' but no physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a keen congressional interest in the role played
by the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force and other military groups
during the 51-day siege that left 76 people dead inside the cult's
compound, two dozen of them children.
</P>
<P>
   The House investigation marks the third time that chamber has
investigated the incident. That fact in itself has spawned concern
among Democrats that this investigation will fan the same partisan
tempers that flared during the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question isn't whether a competent non-partisan
investigation is needed, it's whether this Republican-led Congress
can investigate anything without turning it into a political
circus,'' said Philip Schiliro, chief of staff to Rep. Henry
Waxman, D-Calif., the ranking minority member of the Government
Reform and Oversight Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans don't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason why we have to have Round Three of Waco is the
Justice Department lied about the use of pyrotechnic devices for
six years,'' said Mark Corallo, spokesperson for the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The material supplied by the Texas Rangers is only the first
round of subpoenas issued by the panel's chairman, Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind. Burton has requested information from the White House,
Justice Department, FBI, Department of Defense and William
Johnston, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the surviving
Davidians. Those materials are due on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a member of Burton's committee, said
congressional hearings are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress fails to hold hearings, we will assure the rest of
the executive branch we are not serious about reasserting the
oversight powers that have been so flagrantly ignored by Justice
and the rest of the Administration for the past six years,'' Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., agreed that congressional hearings
were warranted, but he said those hearings should avoid the
partisanship that has become so commonplace on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should not be a partisan issue,'' Hutchinson said.
``There is no reason for it to be that way. No gain to either side.
It's a law enforcement issue, a credibility issue.''

GOING ONLINE TO BUY FURNITURE

 By TIMOTHY JACK WARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're not just buying books anymore. Internet customers have
quickly moved past life insurance and airplane tickets and are
surfing for furniture: poufs and pillow-back sofas, writing desks
and ergonomic office chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Marie Pagano, a Hollywood decorator, has E-shopped for
high-profile clients, including Nicholas Cage, from New York to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go on the Web for a big-ticket item, it's a risky
thing,'' she said. She can't just carry a lamp or an ottoman to a
client's house to try it out, leaving a credit card behind at a
shop.
</P>
<P>
   But she does turn to the Internet when she's stumped, say, by a
star's request for three huge antler chandeliers for his screening
room. (``They're very popular out here,'' she said.) At
www.Widerview.com, a Northern California site, she found Paul
Bunyan-size elk chandeliers and ordered $20,000 worth. ``They came
in crates that were as big as cars,'' she said. ``I would have paid
three times as much in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Furniture shopping on the Web is growing by the day, with
manufacturers and electronic marketers offering speedier downloads,
easier navigation and slicker sites to attract and retain
customers. While some industry analysts have doubts whether surfers
will spend $10,000 on a dining room sight unseen, others note that
customers in stores are already making a giant leap of faith by
leaving hefty deposits on furniture 12 weeks in advance. But there
is no debate that the furniture business is making a bet on the
Web. Witness the current ``.com clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until a few months ago, people had virtually no choices,''
said Michael May, a digital commerce analyst at Jupiter
Communications, a new-media research company. What has limited the
growth of furniture sales online, he said, ``is simply a lack of
supply, not of demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news _ and bad news _ is that more of everything is
suddenly available. Hundreds of mom-and-pop digital retailers like
Fred Friar, who sells handmade sassafras chairs from his West
Virginia farm, now have the opportunity to be seen (in his case, at
www.home.earthlink.net/ffriar/). For the style-starved, there are
small shops showing well-designed wares, classic and new. Big
retailers like Crate and Barrel, Smith &AMP; Hawken and Restoration
Hardware are testing the water with online stores; Ethan Allen is
plunging in: the company, with sales of $756 million for the last
fiscal year, is to unveil a site in October offering 4,000
furniture choices. (A guide to the most compelling sites is on page
F5.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With $300 million in venture capital being thrown at
home-furnishing Web sites this year, something big is going to
happen,'' said Brian Carroll, online editor for Furniture Today, a
High Point, N.C., trade newspaper. ``But who the winners and losers
will be is unknown. The consumer will decide. She'll shop; we'll
adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   Reversing the gender bias among shoppers on the Web, women now
top the 50 percent mark, according to Media Metrix, which measures
online shopping behavior.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many Web retailers and analysts sense that
men are more comfortable shopping for furniture online than in a
store. But just how much anyone is really spending remains unclear.
Carroll estimated that of furniture-store sales for 1998, which
totaled $45.3 billion, maybe 3 percent of sales were generated on
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers themselves don't know how the products are
purchased, whether from a retailer or a site,'' Carroll said.
(Internet stores have noticed that the peak hour for shopping in
the Northeast is 11 a.m., with people apparently buying lamps and
sofas from the office.)
</P>
<P>
   New Internet shoppers say they were first emboldened by small
purchases at Amazon.com. Elizabeth Dettoni, who works for an online
brokerage, took to the Internet to arrange much of her recent move
from a 600-square-foot studio in Manhattan to a two-bedroom condo
in Westchester County. Five days before her move, she spent about
$800 on a mission-style armoire, bookshelves and a table from
Sauder, at www.sauder.com.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, the furniture was delivered ready to assemble the
day she moved in. When she found a chipped part, the company
replaced it and sent it to Ms. Dettoni's home via priority mail.
``These people went the extra mile,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pagano, the Hollywood decorator, also savors the
convenience. She downloads images from Web sites and sends them via
e-mail to clients on movie sets, or they ``conference shop''
online, linked by cell phones and laptops. ``Instead of jaded
people in Los Angeles or New York showrooms, people with major
attitudes, I deal with lovely, homespun people who are very happy
to spend time with you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, traditional stores fear that their business will be
destroyed by online transactions; having invested in display,
advertising and sales help, they worry that shoppers will
test-drive recliners in the stores, sample the store service and
then use the Internet to find the best price. ( Carroll, who has
price-shopped himself, argues that ``furniture on the Net is no
different in price than it is in most stores, although the
perception is that it is.'')
</P>
<P>
   The field is so new, there is no reliable measurement of
shoppers' habits yet, but the tea leaves read differently to Linda
Lewi of Homeportfolio .com, an online clearing house for consumer
information about high-end appliances and furniture. Based on a
sampling of site visitors, she said, ``Consumers are using the
Internet for information and service, then turning to retailers to
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers, the ultimate empowerment may come the day digital
retailers end ``showroom shutout,'' the decades-old ``to the
trade'' system that has kept some haut designers behind closed
showroom doors. Throwing down the gauntlet, Homeportfolio.com, has
plans for a new digital shopping area in October featuring products
of companies that once sold only to architects and designers.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a Web site means there is no big-box store to rent or
stock. For companies selling $2,800 Knoll sofas, circa 1965, from
Antwerp, Belgium, (at www.fiftie-fiftie.be) or $4,600 boardroom
tables (from www.dwr.com, a site in San Francisco), it feels less
like the grand opening of a retail store than a eerie new kind of
fishing _ like rowing out onto a vast etherous pond, casting with a
quiet plunk and waiting for a customer to bite.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. on July 12 from his office in San Francisco, Rob
Forbes went fishing. His lure was www.dwr.com, otherwise known as
Design Within Reach, a new home furnishings catalog and Web site,
both designed by Pentagram, the international design firm, which is
a partner in the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the former director of inventory management at
Williams-Sonoma, did not anticipate catching much of anything the
first day, though he advertised in Metropolis magazine and threw
out some bait: photographs of hundreds of modern furnishings from
classic to new designs, including the hot Cricket outdoor chair
from Italy for $45. Lo, there was soon a frenzy of orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in battle mode,'' he said, recalling the 80 e-mail
messages and more than 200 phone calls the first day.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first customers was Ronald Fiore, who designs
showrooms for Baker Furniture. He spotted a dining chair by Charles
Eames for $140 and ordered two for his Greensboro, N.C., loft. They
were delivered exactly when promised, the next week. ``I thought it
would be a deal where you'd have to buy a container full from Italy
to get that price,'' he said.

Flight delays and missed connections led the list, which also

   GENETIC-FOODS _ BELLE GLADE, Fla. _ What if someone offered you
a pristine, nearly pesticide-free ear of corn so yellow and sweet
that it begs for a dollop of butter and a sprinkle of salt. That
would be a good thing. What if they then told you that this corn
looks and tastes so good because of the handiwork of some
scientists who inserted into its cells a gene that repels bugs. The
question of how safe gene-altered foods are is at the heart of an
escalating global food fight. Your answer likely depends on what

   GM-LAWSUIT _ ATLANTA _ In a strongly worded order, Fulton County
State Court Judge Gino Brogdon found that General Motors and its
attorneys (including some from Atlanta's King &AMP; Spalding)
obstructed justice to keep from public view a potentially damaging
study produced by a GM engineer. The study, by GM engineer Edward
Ivey more than 20 years ago, calculated that the cost of fire
fatalities to GM was $2.40 per vehicle. Brogdon said some of GM's
lawyers, when misrepresenting the facts surrounding Ivey's memo,
engaged in unethical behavior. The case is set for trial Oct. 4.

 &HT;    GORE EMPHASIZES WAR RECORD IN SPEECH TO AMERICAN LEGION
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Vice President Al Gore paraded his Vietnam war
experience before the American Legion national convention
Wednesday, a subtle reminder that his two major rivals for the
presidency avoided America's longest military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a speech largely tailored to appeal to the American
Legion's interest in a strong defense and improving veterans's
benefits, repeatedly referred to his military service in Vietnam.
In addition, he was accompanied to the event by Robert Dalabar, a
Seattle engineer who served in Vietnam with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was honored to wear my country's uniform during the Vietnam
War,'' said Gore, sporting the military-styled American Legion cap
that signifies his membership in American Legion Post 57 in his
home state of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
front-runner in the Republican presidential campaign, or former
Sen. Bill Bradley, the vice president's sole challenger for the
Democratic nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the contrast was clear as he declared that his commitment to
veterans is ``more than a policy position'' taken by a politician.
``It is a personal and moral standard to bear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Gore enlisted in the Army and volunteered for service
in the Indochina conflict. He was one of the few children of
privilege to do so at the time. He was a Harvard graduate and his
father, then a U.S. senator, was an outspoken critic of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, himself conflicted over the increasingly unpopular war,
went to Vietnam as an Army journalist assigned to a non-combat
engineering brigade about 25 miles from Saigon. He spent about five
months in the war zone, less than the typical tour of nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got a coveted spot in a Texas Air National Guard unit after
graduating from Yale University in May 1968, the year that troop
levels in Vietnam reached 525,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley received a rare slot in the Air Force Reserve in May
1967 just before signing a $500,000 contract to play professional
basketball. From 1966 to 1967, U.S. troops in Vietnam increased
from 215,000 to 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Guard and reserve units were rarely pressed into duty during the
Vietnam war. Manpower needs were met mostly through the draft of
young men without college deferments. Consequently, Guard and
reserve units became havens for men who lost their deferments and
wanted to avoid combat.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's route into pilot training with the Texas Air National
Guard has been a source of controversy, with suggestions mounting
that he received preferential treatment because his father, former
President George Bush, was a member of Congress at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy erupted anew this week after a report by the
Dallas Morning News that former Texas House Speaker Ben Barnes had
told friends that longtime Bush family friend Sidney Adger asked
him to help Bush get into the National Guard in the late 1960s.
Bush has denied any knowledge of any such help by Adger, now
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Less examined has been Bradley's opportunity to join the Air
Force Reserve in April 1967, just before he signed a four-year
contract to play with the New York Knicks in the National
Basketball Association. At the time, there were only 45,000
reservists, the vast majority with prior active duty experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley served five months on active duty, then spent six years
as an active reservist, requiring service one weekend a month and
two weeks every summer. But during the the 1968-69 basketball
season, Bradley did not miss a single Knicks game, even on
weekends, according to an examination of Bradley's military
experience by the Star-Ledger newspaper in Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   According to Selective Service records, Bradley received four
deferments from military service while a student at Princeton and
Oxford from 1964 to 1967, when he joined the reserves. He was
listed as 1-A, available for military service, on Dec. 11, 1970,
just 15 days before Gore arrived in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in 1970, the Knicks, with Bradley as one of the stars,
had won their first-ever NBA championship. Two years later, with
the Vietnam war still raging, the Knicks returned to the NBA finals
and lost. The Knicks won another championship in 1973, two years
before Saigon fell to a North Vietnamese invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Bradley's presidential campaign did not
respond to telephone calls seeking comment about the former New
Jersey senator's military record. Bradley formally announced his
presidential candidacy Wednesday in his boyhood home of Crystal
City, Mo.

 &HT;    Business Week profile says McColl facing last hurdles
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Calling him a ``feisty ex-Marine,'' Business Week
(Sept. 13) profiles Hugh L. McColl Jr., chairman of Bank of America
Corp., the $614 billion megabank formed from the merger of
Charlotte, N.C.-based NationsBank and San Francisco-based
BankAmerica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to his savvy dealmaking, McColl stands atop an empire
of 4,500 branches and 14,000 ATMs holding 8.6 percent of the
nation's deposits,'' the magazine says. ``But ... McColl has found
the footing far more treacherous than he expected 17 months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Business Week says McColl, 64, confronted defections from former
BankAmerica executives in his first year, a $372 million write-down
on a hedge-fund deal by the former BankAmerica management and ``a
bad bet on interest rates'' that saddled the company with more than
$2.4 billion in paper losses in its bond portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine says there's no turning back ``for McColl and
his troops.''
</P>
<P>
   With just under two years until his retirement, his final hurdle
is to tie together his various acquisitions ``and deliver the
elusive payoff from two decades of aggressive dealmaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The next Silicon Valley?
</P>
<P>
   The under-40 crowd is the target audience of Atlanta's newest
magazine from the Leader Publishing Group, Catalyst
(September/October).
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural issue considers Atlanta a potential ``Silicon
Valley of the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that can become a reality, it says, Atlanta ``first has
to grapple with a dearth of talent, increase its venture capital
and learn to take big risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboy capitalism
</P>
<P>
   A new breed of debt-laden, swashbuckling owner is changing the
professional football business, Forbes (Sept. 20) reports, giving
top honors for that role to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine describes him as ``a risk-taking former oil
wildcatter who wants to dismantle the revenue-sharing of (National
Football League) branded merchandise, now controlled by NFL
Properties.''
</P>
<P>
   He has already broken the league's hold on promotional deals by
selling ``pouring rights'' to Pepsi and making American Express the
``official'' Cowboys charge card.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes estimates the Cowboys take in $24 million a year from
promotional deals, or more than three times any other team. Forbes
also says the Cowboys topped the league in 1998 operating profit at
$57 million and revenue, $162 million.

looks and tastes so good because of the handiwork of some

State Court Judge Gino Brogdon found that General Motors and its

obstructed justice to keep from public view a potentially damaging
study produced by a GM engineer. The study, by GM engineer Edward
Ivey more than 20 years ago, calculated that the cost of fire
fatalities to GM was $2.40 per vehicle. Brogdon said some of GM's
lawyers, when misrepresenting the facts surrounding Ivey's memo,
engaged in unethical behavior. The case is set for trial Oct. 4.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first substantial outbreak of autumnal air will invade the
northern Great Lakes on Thursday behind a cold front pressing
toward the Atlantic seaboard. A testament to the early season chill
will be found across northern Minnesota, where mid-afternoon
readings only reach the 50s. As the cool air crosses the still
tepid Great Lakes, narrow bands of intense showers will form east
of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. The unstable combination of
cold air overlying the warmer water may spawn isolated waterspouts
over the Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow corridor of scattered showers and thunderstorms will
erupt from western New York to the central Appalachians as the
eastward-moving cold front undercuts and lifts moderately humid
air. Later Thursday night, these showers will move to the Eastern
Seaboard and strengthen as the front intercepts exceptionally humid
air near the coast.
</P>
<P>
   A jet stream disturbance will spark a cluster of thunderstorms
near Alabama and the eastern Gulf Coast on Thursday. Meanwhile,
partial sunshine and sultry conditions will cover the Southeast
Coast and Florida with spotty afternoon thunderstorms, especially
across southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sun will occur an expansive area from the northern
Rockies to the central Plains as a large high pressure system and
its associated sinking currents of air cover the region. Patches of
high clouds will stream into the Southwest as limited moisture from
Tropical Storm Greg drifts north from the east-central Pacific.
Meanwhile in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Floyd will move steadily
west toward the Windward Islands.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hurricane Controller  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A group of islands 700 miles east of the Carolinas lends its
name to a prominent summer weather system, the ``Bermuda high.''
Clockwise winds around this sprawling high pressure zone in the
central Atlantic not only direct sultry air to the East Coast, but
also play a role in steering hurricanes. A typical hurricane moves
west along the southern part of the Bermuda high before veering
north along its western flank. Thursday, Tropical Storm Floyd, 500
miles east of the Windward Islands will move steadily west. Its
ultimate path will be shaped by the strength and position of the
Bermuda high. &QL;

   TIMOR-RDP (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Indonesia on Wednesday rejected
international demands to allow a foreign peacekeeping force to
restore order in East Timor, even as a high-level U.N. delegation
met with officials to press for action to end widespread violence
there. Despite a declaration of martial law in the territory on
Tuesday, witnesses said the situation was still worsening, five
days after an announcement that East Timor's 800,000 people had
voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia. By Seth
Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   TIMOR-U.S. (Washington) _ Determined to preserve its
relationship with Indonesia and support early moves towards
democracy, the United States is warning Indonesia's military leader
to end the chaos in East Timor within days or face a disruption in
relations that could undermine Indonesia's economic recovery,
according to senior administration officials. (Developing) By
Elizabeth Becker and Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-SPEND (Washington) _ Congress returns to work on
spending bills _ and on turning the coming year's projected surplus
into a deficit. The Congressional Budget Office says the projected
$14 billion surplus will become a $13 billion deficit if House
proposals became law and a $16 billion deficit if Senate's plans
prevail. There is possible floor action (but no final votes
anticipated) in the Senate on an Interior bill with controversial
riders favoring mining and energy industries, and in the House on
Veterans Administration and HUD spending bills. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-TAX (Washington) _ Majority Leader Trent Lott said
Wednesday that President Clinton's promised veto of the
Republicans' $792 billion tax cut bill will likely doom any
tax-relief legislation this year. Firing the opening salvo in the
biggest legislative and political issue in Washington this fall,
Lott virtually ruled out any compromise, saying there is too little
time to negotiate a new plan for taxes and spending. By Eric
Schmitt.

   NIGERIA-TRANSFORMATION (Lagos, Nigeria) _ Three months after
Africa's most populous nation inaugurated its first civilian
government in 16 years, gas stations offer perhaps the clearest
promise of what could become one of the most remarkable political
transformations on the continent. Only 15 months ago, Nigeria was
in the grip of a rapacious military regime that had turned the
country into an international pariah. Now most gas stations operate
the way an Agip station on Iju Road here does: motorists pull up to
a pump and drive away a minute later. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   QUAYLE-PROFILE (Goffstown, N.H.) _ Dan Quayle, whose slingshot
career has given him a glimpse of both the heights and depths of
American politics by the age of 52, appears to be back at the
bottom of his political trajectory. Since his eighth-place finish
in the Iowa straw poll some of Quayle's aides have signed on to
other campaigns, his old friends from the White House privately
describe his presidential ambitions as hopeless, and he is drawing
small crowds and perfunctory attention from the news media. Yet
with a tenacity that is poignant, Quayle perseveres. By Adam
Nagourney. (With a photo.)

<P>
   INTERNET-CLASSNOTES (Undated) _ A new Internet venture,
Studyfree, is hiring students at each of 62 universities and paying
them to take notes in about 50 core courses. The note-takers then
post their jottings on a central Web site. The 25-year-old founder
of Studyfree said he intended the service to help students augment
their own notes or to help them catch up after a sick day. But he
concedes that his wares could easily be abused by those with less
legitimate excuses, like chronic oversleeping or lingering
hangovers. By Jacques Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-CAMPAIGN (Crystal City, Mo.) _ Kicking off his campaign
with a tour of his boyhood haunts along the Mississippi, Bill
Bradley says he feels an urgent need to seize the moment in
history, and that as president, he would do fewer things, but
essential things, and do them more thoroughly than his opponents.

NASA PULLS ASTRONAUT FROM STATION CONSTRUCTION FLIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusual move, NASA has pulled a key astronaut from a
high-priority international space station construction flight next
spring, an agency spokesman confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Astronaut Mark Lee was bumped from the five-member shuttle crew
that is to deliver the bus-sized U. S. research laboratory to the
new station in late May. He was to join a shuttle colleague for at
least three spacewalks to connect the laboratory module to already
orbiting station components.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration did not
disclose the reasons for its actions, and efforts to reach Lee, a
47-year-old Air Force colonel, were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a disciplinary action? The answer is no,'' said NASA
spokesman Ed Campion. ``It's an internal astronaut office matter.
This is being done essentially to maintain a high level of
professionalism necessary for the overall integrity of the space
flight program.``
</P>
<P>
   Lee is eligible for a future flight assignment, Campion said.
</P>
<P>
   Astronaut Robert Curbeam, a 37-year-old Navy lieutenant
commander who logged a previous shuttle mission in 1997, will take
Lee's place. Curbeam had been assigned as a spacewalker to a
mid-2000 station assembly flight.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining NASA's astronaut corps in 1984, Lee has flown in
space four times.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Lee served as the payload commander on a mission to
upgrade the Hubble Space Walk, logging three successful spacewalks.
In 1994, he participated in the first untethered spacewalk in a
decade as he and a colleague test flew a new back-mounted jet pack
developed as a space station rescue device.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Lee became half of the first married couple to fly in
space when he wed a fellow crew member, Jan Davis, before their
launching.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was among 13 astronauts assigned to early station
construction missions in August 1998. At the time, the flight
commanded by former chief astronaut Ken Cockrell was to lift off
this October.
</P>
<P>
   However, Russian financial difficulties that have delayed the
launching of the station's crew module and more recently the
electrical wiring flaws that have forced a suspension of U.S.
shuttle flights have prompted rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
   Though as a rule NASA does not assign backup flight personnel,
the need for astronaut replacements has been limited primarily to
rare instances when a crewman died during training or was
confronted with an urgent family matter.
</P>
<P>
   However, in 1990 the space agency temporarily grounded a pair of
veteran shuttle commanders for flight safety infractions. Later,
both men resumed their space flight duties.

SEALED WITH SORROW: MARY TODD LINCOLN IN LETTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (bl) 
 By HERBERT MITGANG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred and seventeen years after Mary Todd Lincoln's death
at 64 in 1882, six previously unknown letters written by her and
one by her last surviving son, Robert, have just come to light.
These rare letters, in their original envelopes, were owned by
descendants of one of Mrs. Lincoln's doctors. They describe her
use, and possible abuse, of pain-relieving medicines and her state
of mind at the saddest time of her troubled widowhood when she had
her own leftover life to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``These letters are gems because they fill in blanks in our
knowledge about a significant period of her life before her
insanity hearing,'' said Thomas F. Schwartz, the Illinois state
historian, in an interview from Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Todd Lincoln, a prospering lawyer in Chicago, had signed
a warrant for his mother's arrest as a ``lunatic'' in 1875, 10
years after his father's assassination, ``for her benefit and the
safety of the community.'' At her hearing, no legal defense was
offered; a jury quickly returned a verdict of insanity. Facing him,
Mary Lincoln said, ``Oh, Robert, to think that my son would do this
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered her committed to a state hospital for the
insane. After almost four months of confinement, Mrs. Lincoln was
allowed to live in the home of her older sister, Elizabeth Edwards,
in Springfield. In 1876 a second sanity hearing was held; Mrs.
Lincoln was deemed ``restored to reason,'' and Robert was removed
as her conservator.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered letters were obtained from Wisconsin
descendants of Dr. Willis Danforth by Kim Bauer, the Lincoln
curator at the Illinois Historical Library in Springfield, where
they are being studied by Lincoln scholars. Half the letters were
donated and half were sold to the library for an undisclosed sum by
the anonymous descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a professor of surgery, had treated Mrs. Lincoln and
prescribed drugs for her ailments, which included migraine
headaches and insomnia. Surprisingly, he had testified at the first
hearing that she was insane.
</P>
<P>
   The letters make clear that Mrs. Lincoln never stopped grieving
for her husband and for their three young sons: Edward, who died in
Springfield in 1850; William, who died in the White House in 1862,
and the sweet-tempered Thomas (called Tad), who died in 1871 in
Chicago at 18.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest of the newfound letters was written by Mrs. Lincoln
in 1869 from Frankfurt, Germany, where she lived while Tad attended
boarding school. It is addressed to Sally Orne, a loyal friend from
the White House years. (This letter was acquired separately at an
auction.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lincoln writes: ``Time brings so little consolation to me
and do you wonder when you remember whose loss. I mourn over that
of my worshiped husband, in whose devoted love, I was so blessed,
and from whom I was so cruelly torn? The hope of our reunion in a
happier world than this, has alone supported me, during the last
four weary years.''
</P>
<P>
   She often repeated the sentiment that her husband was
``devoted'' to her. In an earlier letter to a friend, Mrs. Lincoln
exaggerated when she wrote that her husband was ``only happy when I
was in his presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz explained: ``Mary Lincoln was battling William Herndon,
her husband's law partner in Springfield. In lectures and
broadsides, Herndon said that Lincoln's only true love had been Ann
Rutledge, and that there was no love in the Lincoln marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lincoln's letters to Danforth, written in 1874 while she
lived alone in a Chicago hotel, describe her ailments. She pleads:
``Please oblige me by sending about 4 more powders. I had a
miserable night last night &AMP; took the 5 you left. What is to become
of this excessive wakefulness, it is impossible for me to divine.''
Heavily medicated, she often used chloral hydrate, a sedative and
hypnotic, to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Robert's scrawled note to Danforth, written while his mother was
confined, protests: ``There was no foundation for the Tribune item.
My mother is at Dr. Patterson's at Batavia &AMP; I am going there this
morning to see her and will let you know how she fares, when I
return.'' Dr. R.J. Patterson ran the asylum.
</P>
<P>
   To his letter Robert attached a news clipping reprinted from The
Chicago Tribune saying that Mrs. Lincoln would be sent to a
``private insane retreat'' by her son, and that ``the arrangements
are all satisfactory.'' He deplored any mention in the press about
his role in her confinement.
</P>
<P>
   In the saddest letter of all, written to Danforth before her
first insanity hearing, Mrs. Lincoln leaves instructions for her
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Penned on the envelope of this funereal letter were the formal
words: ``For Robert T. Lincoln, Esq. To be opened by him,
immediately after my death.'' The letter reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish my remains to be clothes in the white silk dress which
will be found in the lower drawer of the bureau in my room. I
desire that my body, shall remain for two days (48 hours), with the
lid of the coffin being screwed down and on the 3d day, after my
death, Professor Swing acceding, I wish the coffin taken to the
latter's church, he preaching the funeral sermon from the 23d
Psalm.'' The Rev. David Swing was minister of the Westminster
Presbyterian Church in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   She concludes that her remains should be placed ``beside my dear
husband &AMP; Taddies' on one side of me.''
</P>
<P>
   When she died in Springfield on July 15, 1882, her instructions
were not precisely followed, but she was buried in Oak Ridge
Cemetery with her husband and children. Neighbors and officials
came to see her open coffin in the Edwards' parlor. The coffin
stood in almost the exact spot where, 40 years before, she had
stood as a bride.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Todd Lincoln's hands were folded across her chest. On her
finger was the wedding ring that, after one broken engagement,
Abraham Lincoln had placed there in 1842. It was inscribed: ``Love
Is Eternal.''

RESENDING BECAUSE OF TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS  
 PROFESSOR _ AND IMMIGRANT _ ARGUES FOR TOUGHER SCREENING OF
IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Borjas was 8 years old when Fidel Castro's tanks rolled
into Havana. Three years later, his family, having lost their small
factory making men's pants, fled to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Borjas, 48, is now a professor of public policy at Harvard
University, specializing in immigration. He's also an advocate of a
policy that would have prevented his own family from coming here.
He makes his case in his new book, ``Heaven's Door'' (Princeton,
$27.95).
</P>
<P>
   The book is neither an argument to close the nation's doors nor
to throw them wide open. It's an argument to screen applicants for
age, language and work skills. In contrast, the current immigration
system, set up in 1965, is based almost entirely on whether
applicants have family members in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 1965 reforms began what Borjas calls the Second Great
Migration _ the first being the influx of 1885-1914. In the new
wave, he writes, a high proportion of immigrants have been
unskilled. On balance they do not take the jobs of Americans; the
jobs multiply to employ the hands willing to work. But more of
those jobs are at the bottom end.
</P>
<P>
   And that's good for a lot of people. The San Diego couple who
hires a nanny at $200 per week can afford to work more hours. The
manufacturer who would have moved to Mexico now has affordable
employees. In Seattle, we employ foreigners to make our lunches and
stay up all night in convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   There's a cost to this. In the past 25 years, the gap between
the top and bottom in incomes has widened dramatically.
Immigration, says Borjas, is not the only reason for this, but he
calculates that it ``may account for nearly half the decline in the
relative wage of high school dropouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Borjas argues that the United States would be better off
attempting to select a better-educated class of applicants, as
Canada does. This, he allows, would change the ethnic mix of
immigrants. It would be attacked for being discriminatory. But all
systems of screening applicants are discriminatory, he writes,
including the one we have now.
</P>
<P>
   Under Borjas's proposal, for example, the United States would
end up admitting more Canadians and fewer Mexicans _ simply because
the average Canadian immigrant has 13.8 years of schooling, and the
average Mexican 7.6. The average Canadian immigrant earns 24
percent more than the average American; the average Mexican earns
39 percent less.
</P>
<P>
   Huge differences also exist in the different groups' use of
welfare. After 10 years in the United States, 5 percent of East
Indians are receiving some kind of government assistance; 9 percent
of Britons, 20 percent of Haitians, 21 percent of Russians, 34
percent of Mexicans and 58 percent of Dominicans.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences are normal. They are based, Borjas says, on
``ethnic capital'' _ the group's know-how, attitudes and values
handed down through generations. Among immigrants, half of the
first generation's earning-power differential is passed to their
kids, and half of the second generation's differential is passed to
their kids. ``Ethnicity matters in economic life, and it matters
for a very long time,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Any change in the mix of these groups would change the U.S.
labor market, helping certain industries and hurting others. To
take a local example, without Mexican immigrants who would pick
Washington state's apples? Well, Borjas argues, maybe high-wage
America shouldn't be growing apples.
</P>
<P>
   He writes, ``Does it make sense for the United States to be in
the business of exporting hand-harvested fruits and vegetables?''
</P>
<P>
   Oops. He just lost Central Washington. (But there are
alternatives: Growers in the Canadian Okanagan employ
French-Canadian youths.)
</P>
<P>
   After piling up all his evidence, Borjas allows that immigration
policy ``cannot be based on the evidence alone.'' All policies have
winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   This book assumes that the people who count are native-born
Americans, because they make the political decisions. It proposes a
policy that arguably would make them better off economically.
</P>
<P>
   And while screening could pay Americans a dividend, Borjas
allows that it would still miss two-thirds of the difference
between the highly productive immigrant and the merely average.
That's because two-thirds of the difference between individuals is
due to ``unknown factors.''

`DELTA JEWS': SOME SPECIAL SOUTHERNERS, CHOSEN AND UNCHOSEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss.)  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

<P>
   Bettye Sue Kline remembers going to Methodist Youth Fellowship
and Vacation Bible School as a child. ``I could sing `Yes, Jesus
Loves Me' with the best of them,'' she says. Ben Lamensdorf stands
in his cotton fields, weathered face under a baseball cap, and says
in a soft Southern accent: ``People are surprised that you're
Jewish and a farmer. But we were farming a long time ago. In
Israel.'' Leanne Silverblatt affectionately calls her husband,
Alan, ``a good ol' Mississippi Delta Jewish redneck.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the voices of ``Delta Jews,'' an intelligent,
reflective one-hour documentary on PBS on Thursday night. The film
was written, directed and produced by Mike DeWitt in Ken Burns
style: talking heads from the present, photographs from the past,
shots of sweeping land or empty streets when there are no
photographs and evocative music that comment on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta Jews'' is not as inspired as Burns' work; at times it's
even a little ragged around the edges. But it covers its subject
nicely and with balance. The playwright Alfred Uhry, best known for
``Driving Miss Daisy,'' is the narrator.
</P>
<P>
   The point that DeWitt makes is that, yes, there are Jews in the
South, even in the rural South, even in the Mississippi Delta,
which runs from Memphis to Vicksburg and has been called, as the
voice-over declares, ``the most Southern place on earth.'' And this
is their story.
</P>
<P>
   David Orlansky of Greenville, Miss., tells about an ancestor
who, not knowing a word of English, ``managed to get from Eastern
Europe to Ruleville, Miss.,'' with the help of a tag around his
neck with the address that was his destination.
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrants, as ``Delta Jews'' shows, began as peddlers and
ended up as merchants with general stores. They operated
essentially on credit, which was a necessity for farmers. Today
storefronts with names like E. Weinberg, Fried's and Kline still
line the streets of small Mississippi towns, and their owners may
be heading for the Delta Jewish Open, an annual golf tournament now
in its eighth year.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance within the white Christian (mostly Protestant)
Southern culture is still a matter of opinion. Earl Solomon Jr. of
Greenville says, ``I believe I've been discriminated more in my
lifetime, in my experiences, because I'm from the South than
because I'm Jewish.'' Others talk of having the feeling that they
didn't quite belong.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the film, Clifton Taulbert, an author who is black,
says of the Jews in his hometown, ``They may have thought they were
white, but we never did.'' Which brings us, and ``Delta Jews,'' to
the civil rights years. ``It was like a moment of truth,'' says
Jerry Himelstein, who grew up in Greenwood, Miss. ``Which side were
you on?''
</P>
<P>
   One opinion expressed in the film is that Jewish Southerners,
because they or their relatives had suffered oppression, tended to
have more sympathy for the plight of blacks. But almost 40 years
later, others express strong opinions on camera about white
Northern Jewish civil rights workers who came South: ``They were
crude; they were loud.'' ``They had no business down here.''
</P>
<P>
   These comments, of course, seem to come from the Southern side
of the speakers' identities, rather than the Jewish side. ``It's
all mixed up and intertwined together,'' says Ms. Silverblatt of
Indianola, Miss. ``We  &UR; are &LR;  Jewish, but we're Southern. Sometimes
we feel more comfortable with Southern Christians than with Jews
from another part of the country. And yet we have a very strong
sense of Jewishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining that sense of Jewish identity and passing it along
to the next generation appears to require real effort. Paul
Kossmen, single father of three sons in Cleveland, Miss., says: ``I
just kind of feel like it might be a bit easier in the big cities.
I think my children would have the benefit of numbers. Here they
are so few.''
</P>
<P>
   So few that the only tombstone carver in the area who does
Hebrew letters has decided to go ahead and carve his own stone. He
figures when he's gone, there won't be anybody else to do it.

SESAME STREET'S SUSAN SAYS BURY LEARNING IN FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Are you one of my children?'' asked Dr. Loretta Long, in the
beginning of our interview. Yes, I admitted, I was.
</P>
<P>
   One of the millions who grew up watching Elmo, Cookie Monster
and the Grouch. Who sang along when asked, ``Will you tell me how
to get, how to get to Sesame Street?''
</P>
<P>
   I was 6 when Big Bird first walked out of the house, in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Long, also known as ``Susan,'' has been a regular on the
Children's Television Workshop's most acclaimed show for more than
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sesame Street has long understood what every parent finds out:
</P>
<P>
   ``You're better off burying the education deep down under the
fun so children just think they're playing,'' says Long, who is
also a parent educator and teacher. ``If the kids aren't having
fun, they aren't going to do it. It's the same thing with us. If
the kids turn the channel, it doesn't matter how wonderful the show
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Long is a spokeswoman for Vtech's line of electronic ``smart''
toys that talk, light up and play music. She loves these
razzle-dazzle toys, especially the portable ones that have several
activities to keep traveling toddlers entertained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't they great?'' she says. ``When a child has his own
little backpack filled with stuff, that's a child who's not going
to be screaming from Newark to L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, today's kids are more sophisticated as to what they
expect from toys.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Long says, ``I grew up on a farm and was a real tomboy. I
believe in balance. All these years I spent on television, I would
never tell a parent to use TV as a baby sitter, anymore than video
games or high-tech toys replace walks or trips to the playground.''
</P>
<P>
   Team sports are great for older children, Long says, since they
crave camaraderie and an outlet for their boundless energy.
</P>
<P>
   Long has learned from her six nieces and nephews that a bored
child is a noisy, fidgety child.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests having a special car toy that children can play
with only after they're seated safely in their car seats or while
waiting in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   And while Long likes toys that educate and challenge, she
believes parents can make a mistake in buying toys that are
designed for older children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be sure to pay attention to the age-appropriateness of the
toy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She sees computers in children's lives as both a great learning
tool and a real danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't let a kid of mine isolate themselves and talk on
the computer: They're living a parallel life in your own house,''
she said. ``You've got to wake up and pay attention to what your
kids are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to Long's two main rules for parents:
</P>
<P>
   1. Be encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   2. Be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking of moving `Be involved' up to No. 1,'' she says.
``It's inconceivable to me that anything could have gone on in my
mother's house without her knowing. We used to call her the FBI.''

BAND ROCKS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors, resending story for NYT subscriber. Story first moved in
wire file of Tuesday, Sept. 7.) 
BY DAVID GREENBERG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. -- Brian Ahara celebrated Labor Day living a rock
'n' roll fantasy with some good company.
</P>
<P>
   Having been selected from 2.3 million entries in the fourth
annual VH1 Big Backyard BBQ contest, the 26-year-old Oxnard,
Calif., resident hosted pop-rockers the Goo Goo Dolls, moshing with
100 friends and selected guests before a live televised audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real exciting that this huge band is playing in my back
yard,'' Ahara said prior to the show. ``It blows me away every time
I think about it or look out in my back yard and see the stage.
It's definitely a good way to end the summer and by far the biggest
Labor Day party I've ever been to.''
</P>
<P>
   VH1's 65-member crew arrived Wednesday to transform his yard
from a playground for his frequent baby-sitting chores -- his
sister, Camarillo resident Stacey Evans, has two small boys -- into
a outdoor concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   Gone were the two dilapidated sheet metal sheds, one of which
rusted to the point where it fell over, a wagon and scattered toys.
</P>
<P>
   In their place was a makeshift stage with stacks of amplifiers
on each side and an above-ground pool that served as a popular
viewing area for bikini-clad women braving the overcast skies and
frigid water.
</P>
<P>
   Ahara, a business consultant, gets to keep the pool, as well as
$3,000 in cash and a barbecue grill, as winner of the contest,
which he entered via the Internet in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just entered because I thought it'd be really cool to win,''
he said. ``I've never won anything. But I thought it was worth a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous winners have hosted concerts in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
(John Mellencamp), Myrtle Beach, S.C. (Jon Bon Jovi) and Staten
Island, N.Y. (B-52s).
</P>
<P>
   Ahara, however, is the first winner whose back yard was large
enough to hold the concert, allowing the production crew to shirk
the responsibility of finding an alternative location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their space has to be accessible to set up a band, security, a
catering event and you have to have room for a production truck,''
said Mark McIntire, the network's marketing vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 guests, including 20 that Evans invited, feasted on
baby-back ribs, soda and beer before the start of the show, which
was broadcast live to the East Coast and delayed three hours until
7 p.m. for the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Goo Goo Dolls, who hail from Buffalo, N.Y., belted out a
10-song set that included the hits ``Naked,'' and ``Name'' from its
1995 breakthrough platinum disc ``A Boy Named Goo.''
</P>
<P>
   They ended the show with ``Iris,'' a smash hit from the ``City
of Angels'' soundtrack that is included on the band's 1998 disc,
``Dizzy Up The Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   For the band, which toiled for a decade in smoky,
off-the-beaten-path clubs before hitting stardom that including
warming up a leg of the Rolling Stones most recent tour, the
Backyard BBQ was a pleasant return to yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing a beer on the tour bus following the show, John Rzeznik,
the band's tattooed lead singer and guitarist, recalled a date on
the band's previous tour where the paid attendance could be counted
on two hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the Augusta, Ga., show,'' he said with a smile. ``But
it was the weekend of The Masters (golf tournament).''

   Monday's concert, which coincides with the band's status as
VH1's ``Artists of the Month,'' forced the group to acclimate
itself to something alien to most musicians: commercial breaks
every two or three songs.
</P>
<P>
   But the band took it in stride, telling off-color jokes during
the down time and inviting audience members to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks the rhythm,'' Rzeznik said afterward. ``It was
definitely strange, but you've got to think on your feet, man.''
Concertgoer Dawn Kroskey, a 24-year-old Oxnard resident, said the
entire setup had a surreal quality to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a dream,'' she said. ``I used to suntan in
this back yard. Now it doesn't even look like the same back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ahara has an unlisted phone number, Evans said she was
deluged with phone calls from strangers since Ahara's name went
over the airwaves as the contest winner three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   One caller even offered to spend the afternoon pouring beer in
exchange for placement on the guest list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them the guest list is already full,'' Evans said. ``I
can't even invite a couple of my friends. So I'm not going to
invite strangers.''

SESAME STREET'S SUSAN SAYS BURY LEARNING IN FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for fix release date)   (For release Thursday, Sept. 16)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Are you one of my children?'' asked Dr. Loretta Long, in the
beginning of our interview. Yes, I admitted, I was.
</P>
<P>
   One of the millions who grew up watching Elmo, Cookie Monster
and the Grouch. Who sang along when asked, ``Will you tell me how
to get, how to get to Sesame Street?''
</P>
<P>
   I was 6 when Big Bird first walked out of the house, in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Long, also known as ``Susan,'' has been a regular on the
Children's Television Workshop's most acclaimed show for more than
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sesame Street has long understood what every parent finds out:
</P>
<P>
   ``You're better off burying the education deep down under the
fun so children just think they're playing,'' says Long, who is
also a parent educator and teacher. ``If the kids aren't having
fun, they aren't going to do it. It's the same thing with us. If
the kids turn the channel, it doesn't matter how wonderful the show
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Long is a spokeswoman for Vtech's line of electronic ``smart''
toys that talk, light up and play music. She loves these
razzle-dazzle toys, especially the portable ones that have several
activities to keep traveling toddlers entertained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't they great?'' she says. ``When a child has his own
little backpack filled with stuff, that's a child who's not going
to be screaming from Newark to L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, today's kids are more sophisticated as to what they
expect from toys.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Long says, ``I grew up on a farm and was a real tomboy. I
believe in balance. All these years I spent on television, I would
never tell a parent to use TV as a baby sitter, anymore than video
games or high-tech toys replace walks or trips to the playground.''
</P>
<P>
   Team sports are great for older children, Long says, since they
crave camaraderie and an outlet for their boundless energy.
</P>
<P>
   Long has learned from her six nieces and nephews that a bored
child is a noisy, fidgety child.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests having a special car toy that children can play
with only after they're seated safely in their car seats or while
waiting in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   And while Long likes toys that educate and challenge, she
believes parents can make a mistake in buying toys that are
designed for older children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be sure to pay attention to the age-appropriateness of the
toy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She sees computers in children's lives as both a great learning
tool and a real danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't let a kid of mine isolate themselves and talk on
the computer: They're living a parallel life in your own house,''
she said. ``You've got to wake up and pay attention to what your
kids are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to Long's two main rules for parents:
</P>
<P>
   1. Be encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   2. Be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking of moving `Be involved' up to No. 1,'' she says.
``It's inconceivable to me that anything could have gone on in my
mother's house without her knowing. We used to call her the FBI.''
</P>

HOME FURNISHINGS, MODERN AND ANTIQUE, FROM THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., S.C., Minn., Texas, Mass., Mich., Calif., The
Netherlands, Belgium)  (See also ECOMMERCE) 
(DW) 
 By TIMOTHY JACK WARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Touchy-feely, persnickety and an Internet novice _ it would take
a lot of handholding to get me to buy a sofa without first
karate-chopping the pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm at least tempted. In the last four weeks, I sampled
about 80 home-furnishings sites, from Fred Friar's front-porch
location to Homepoint.com, a megasite with the virtual heft of a
Spiegel catalog.
</P>
<P>
   To find furniture e-tailers, I usually started with the
www.37.com search engine. I spoke with consumers who had shopped at
many of the sites and questioned the sales staff as if I were a
potential buyer. Generally, they were well informed, personable and
low-key. There was no pressure to buy; in fact, many collegially
shared information about other sites.
</P>
<P>
   At night on a home computer, surfing can be slow as molasses,
and frustrating. One tip: Do something else while shopping.
</P>
<P>
   There are half a dozen or so big players _ including
Homepoint.com and Living.com. Personally, I found these new
megasites overwhelming: they test the bounds of how much is too
much. Mike West, the founder of Homepoint.com in Greenville, S.C.,
says his company offers ``anything and everything from America's
3,700 furniture manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For our customers, quality is not a driving force,'' he said.
``We offer a tremendous selection and choice for customers who are
concerned with `Will it fit in my home?'''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a guide to some of the better sites:
</P>
<P>
   blindambition.com A leading site among the competitive miniblind
suppliers on the Web; plug in window dimensions, and order wooden
Venetian blinds, delivered in days at low prices (30 by 60 inches,
$88). Almost everything is in stock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   bludot.com Hip storage from a small furniture design cooperative
in Minnesota. Text can be too cute (``sawing logs'' for a maple
bed). But see Modulicious, the site's mix-and-match modular system
made of maple veneer and painted steel, well priced at $399 to
$899. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   dwr.com Design Within Reach is a professional-looking, fast,
concise site with modern classic pieces for home and office. Offers
a huge inventory and quick delivery. Prices appear to be fair,
often lower than in a Manhattan store; there are discounts for
large orders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.eckhart.nl
</P>
<P>
   This Rotterdam site offers a huge inventory from European
furniture manufacturers. The problem is getting prices for some of
the pieces. Try calling 011-31-10-414-1616 during business hours in
the Netherlands. There is warm customer service in English. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.fiftie-fiftie.be A Belgian dealer in vintage furniture,
objects and rare books. The site is in English, the prices in euros
(about one to a dollar) or in Belgian francs (100 of them equals
about $262). American collectors are heading here for the selection
of midcentury furniture and objects from Europe and Japan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   formdecor.com This Los Angeles dealer of vintage furniture is
favored by production designers and foreign collectors; a site for
high-end collectibles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   f-u-p.com A site based in Portland, Ore., with modernist
classics; prices and shipping fees are high, but the look of the
page is fashionable, and the product mix is intelligent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   georgesmith.com Very fine handmade English sofas and chairs from
the company's New York and Los Angeles showrooms, offered at 40 to
50 percent off; smart sales help. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   hmhome.com A beautiful, efficient site, from the 75-year-old
Herman Miller company, offers a professional room planner.
Consumers can buy directly from the factory here, with a discount
on seating and home-office products (but not classic designs by
Charles and Ray Eames, George Nelson and Isamu Noguchi). Some
quick-ship items (click I Want It ) include the Aeron ergonomic
office chair, $749 fully loaded, which undercuts some dealers'
prices. The Web site's customer-service phone lines close at 5 p.m.
Eastern time. The phone number is (888) 520-7646. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.industrial-home.com A homespun site that offers
one-of-a-kind modern furniture and accessories for collectors. See
the vintage 1960 Viscontea lamp by Achille Castiglioni for Flos,
$650.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   marthastewart.com Martha Stewart's Wweb site is appropriately
pastel-colored.
</P>
<P>
   noguchi.org An intelligent blockbuster and a real find: the
Isamu Noguchi Foundation Web site is soft-sell, and the best source
for the designer's Akari paper lamps _ you get thumbnails of all
the styles, but you then have to call or send an e-mail for prices.
Sales benefit the foundation and its museum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   simplymodern.com A small, speedy site for desks, accessories and
objects straight out of ``The Jetsons.'' There's a nice Finnish
plywood trash can for $42.
</P>
<P>
   www.shakerworkshops.com A source long favored by European
collectors, this Massachusetts maker of authentic Shaker
furnishings has a site that offers settees, chairs, tables,
dressers and beds, in kits or assembled. Skip the bric-a-brac and
the Shaker recipe of the month, and move on to furniture.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   store.moma.org The Museum of Modern Art's collection is in many
ways the definition of modern design, but the site can be
surprisingly slow. &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   www.unicahome.com At this site, operated by a Birmingham, Mich.,
store, you will find Philippe Starck office supplies, Droog laundry
baskets and a $250 coat rack from Christophe Pillet. Verner
Panton's Phantom chair is $250 at this site, which has nice links
to other design sites.
</P>
<P>
   widerview.com A reputable, site for country and traditional
styles, antler chandeliers, matelasse bedcovers, fair prices and
warm, knowledgeable service. Urbane shoppers will have to dig a
little to find the pearls: go to Urban Scapes, then to Take a Seat
and to Mike Room Service. Keep clicking to view the collection of
upholstered furniture. The best dining tables I've found for under
$700 are at this site. You will find European farmhouse tables of
recycled wax-finished pine; shipping is not free, but there is a
$150 cap.
</P>
<P>
   www.ziahouse.com A crisp, punchy Web site from a tiny Berkeley,
Calif., store that has a tightly edited collection of modern
furnishings. On the home page, click on Products. Objects here tend
toward a ``crafty'' look, but there are plump sofas covered with
colorful Tricia Guild fabrics, hard-to-find Santora Melone storage
cabinets and a $1,000 Peter Sandback coffee table. There is no way
to order except by calling the store's number, prominently
displayed on every page.
</P>
<P>
   MEGARETAILERS www.furniture.com In July alone, 600,000 different
visitors clicked on this huge site, according to Media Metrix.
Based in Framingham, Mass., the site offers middle-of-the-road
contemporary furniture &UR;  &LR; and a room-planner tool. There's an online
magazine with a story called ``When His Meets Hers,'' a smart idea,
since Web sales are are almost evenly split between men and women.
</P>
<P>
   www.goodhome.com  &UR;  &LR; A cooperative venture from Hearst, Mattel,
Broderbund and the Thomas H. Lee Co. (which built the Snapple
brand), www.goodhome.com is expected to announce Thursday that it
is merging with another ``not yet running'' Web site,
www.nhabit.com to form a mega-megasite called Goodhome. With $50
million in start-up money, the site, based in San Rafael, Calif.,
will go live on Sept. 21, and will offer 50 room scenes. ``Every
item of the room works together and is for purchase, including the
fresh flowers,'' said Douglas Mack, the chief executive of
Goodhome.
</P>
<P>
   www.homepoint.com The mother ship of mass marketers, it has
crisp, hyperactive pages. Featured recently was Fire-N-Ice, a $52
gooseneck desk lamp, but the site also sells chairs, beds, tables,
you name it. Almost everything takes four to six weeks for
delivery. There is usually no charge for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   www.living.com Can be slow to download, but there are 299 lamps,
213 sofas &UR;  &LR; and lots more, from manufacturers like Natuzzi and Lane.
Furniture from the site, which is based in Austin, Tex., may take
from six to 12 weeks for delivery, and any purchase above $300
requires a 33 percent deposit.

Group has filed a contract fraud suit against two reinsurance
companies, seeking $200 million in damages. By Dave McNary.

   MINDSPRING-SURVEY (Los Angeles) _ MindSpring, one of the
nation's fastest growing Internet service providers, ranked highest
in overall customer satisfaction among the largest national ISPs,
according to a survey released Wednesday by J.D. Power and

industry powerhouse America Online and its subsidiary, CompuServe.

BUSH VOWS TO `REBUILD' ARMED FORCES 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHAM, N.H. _ Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush, in a preview of another major policy address next week, said
Wednesday he would rebuild and revitalize the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Republican candidates, Bush's remarks suggested he
believed the U.S. military has deteriorated during the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush plans to deliver a major address on military and defense
policy next week in Charleston, S.C., aides said. But he gave his
New Hampshire audience a preview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to about 500 people at a chamber of commerce
breakfast in Windham, Bush said he intends to ``revitalize'' and
``rebuild'' America's armed forces and assure that they are
``well-paid, well-housed and well-trained.'' As he has before, he
advocated the development of a new system of ``theater-based,
intermediate-range'' anti-ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   He also vowed, ``I will never, ever commit U.S. forces to United
Nations control.``
</P>
<P>
   He said while an international peacekeeping force may be
necessary to quell the violence in East Timor, the Indonesian
province that is seeking independence, the peacekeepers should not
include U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said the biggest, long-term foreign threat to
the United States is China. He said the United States should
continue to trade with China and open up new markets there for U.S.
products.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``I know the next president must deal strongly
with China.``
</P>
<P>
   He said the next president must convince China to respect
individual freedoms and not to distribute weapons around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must look at China as a competitor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also was concerned about the former Soviet Union,
whose remaining arsenal of nuclear weapons and internal unrest
posed a particularly critical problem. He promised to work to
continue reducing nuclear weapons in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's preliminary discussion of his defense policies should he
win the White House came amid another small flurry about whether
his family connections influenced his admission into a National
Guard unit during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that the late Houston
oilman Sidney A. Adger, a Bush family friend, asked Lt. Gov. Ben
Barnes in 1968 to help George W. Bush gain a slot in the National
Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Barnes said he told them that one of his staff
members forwarded Adger's request to Brig. Gen. James Rose, who
died in 1993. Barnes is scheduled to testify in a deposition on the
matter Thursday in a lawsuit related to Texas' lottery contract
with Gtech Corp., for whom Barnes lobbied.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Wednesday that neither he nor his father had sought
help from Adger or anyone else in gaining a National Guard slot for
the future governor. ``Not at all. That's what President Bush said,
and that's what I say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No George Bush ever asked for anyone to help me,'' Bush said.
``People (should) listen to the commander of the unit that
instructed me as a pilot. He says that there was no special
favoritism. They were looking for pilots, and I was honored to
serve. I became an F-102 pilot and proudly served.``
</P>
<P>
   Asked if people should weigh whether a presidential candidate
avoided going to Vietnam, Bush replied: ``No. I think what's
important now is (whether) a candidate served, and I did. I became
an F-102 pilot, and had my unit been called up, I would have gone
to Vietnam.``

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In the Civic Opera House here, where Lyric Opera of
Chicago will present the world premiere of ``A View From the
Bridge'' on Oct. 9, the singers gathered in a rehearsal room
Tuesday for the first time, singing through the score accompanied
by two pianos. The composer, William Bolcom, was on hand to hear a
young tenor he had never met, Gregory Turay, move the assembled
company to applause with his rendering of a melodic aria. And the
director, Frank Galati, delivered an impassioned lecture on the
history of the Arthur Miller play on which the opera is based
before winding up with a flourish: ``Let us give thanks for the
privilege of working together on this first great opera of the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   So this is how the staging of an opera begins: With bravado and
the power of communal, artistic enterprise, right? Well, not quite.
The staging of an opera, in the end magnificent and grand, begins
before the bravado, with a charade that is almost comic.
</P>
<P>
   The real work of staging began last week in the Civic's
3,600-seat auditorium where a portable tape player sat on a long
table about two-thirds of the way back in the orchestra. From it,
played in fits and starts, came the strains of ``View.'' It sounded
a little pathetic, actually, with the score played on a piano and
all the parts, male and female, earnestly sung by Lyric chorus
master Donald Palumbo, the music rising sadly in the vaulting
heights of the vast, hall and dying long before it hit the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Because no orchestra had yet played the score, and because the
singers had yet to sing a note, the recording was made to help Mr.
Galati and the production's chief designers with the painstaking
task of creating the physical look of the opera. The single set is
by Santo Loquasto, who also designed the costumes. It's a tiny
apartment surrounded by an industrial landscape suggesting the
shipyards of Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the early 1950s, the opera's
setting. And though it is largely complete, the set needs to be
effectively lighted (by Duane Schuler, the designer) and to work
dramatically in tandem with enormous projections, on three screens,
by projection artist Wendall K. Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   This phase of preparation, known as tech week, places special
emphasis on accommodating and underscoring the shifting cadences of
drama that any theatrical presentation requires. Which is why the
tape-recorded score was both necessary _ in an opera it is the
music that controls the onstage tempo _ and insufficient. Because
``View'' is a new work and has never been recorded with a full
roster of musicians _ the first orchestra rehearsal isn't until
next week _ the designers are working, thus far, without their
complete palette of clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely hard to work when you can't hear the music
because we're trying to create rhythmic sequences and transitions
and patterns of composition that are related to the score,'' Galati
said. In a fully orchestrated work, Ms. Harrington said, ``the
color is all in the music.'' And Schuler added: ``The cueing is all
in the music, too. When you hear the music, you hear the cues.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was not the only feat of imagination the designers had
to cope with. Onstage, as the tape played, stand-ins for the
singers, known as lightwalkers, served as human design elements.
Opera fans who volunteer for the task, which offers minimal pay,
they spent hours walking through a kind of slow-motion
choreography, responding to Galati's suggestions as he began to
envision what the set would look like with performers on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob, would you be so kind as to move upstage,'' Galati said,
at one point, through a microphone from the table in the orchestra,
and the beefy, middle-aged man who was standing in for Catherine,
the opera's 17-year-old virgin ingenue, did so.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a perfect system; Galati complained, with a laugh, that
one fat guy had to pretend to be 24 female chorus members. But this
is how many operas coalesce, in a process that would seem to defy
logic. The main reason is that Lyric, like other large companies
including New York's Metropolitan Opera and the San Francisco
Opera, works in repertory and must prepare and rehearse several
shows at once. Unlike a Broadway show, which has the luxury of
commandeering a theater and can thus bring together cast and crew
for weeks of rehearsals and previews, an opera in repertory must
share the spotlight, not to mention the stage and rehearsal room.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, much of the fundamental work is done long in
advance. Each summer Lyric techs its entire season; for 1999-2000,
there are eight operas, including ``Tristan und Isolde,'' which
won't be performed until next year but finished teching more than a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird to be sitting here in July working on a show you're
not going to see again until February,'' said Lyric technical
director Drew Landmesser, who is responsible for coordinating all
the variables of staging and oversees a staff that can reach nearly
100 in complicated times of the year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One moment, he recalled, emphasized the eccentricity of it all;
a lightwalker, a middle-aged woman standing in for Isolde, began to
feel weak after standing onstage for hours. When she took a break
to sit down, she was replaced by a stagehand, only to stand up and
cry out, ``in a very theatrical voice,'' Landmesser said: ``I must
go back! They need my Isolde!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``View,'' the second production of Lyric's season, was the next
to last to be teched. Loquasto's set was removed from the stage
Friday and part of it was reinstalled in a rehearsal room for the
singers' arrival Tuesday. Meanwhile the set of Lyric's opening
production, Verdi's ``Falstaff,'' was erected on the stage. Its
first staged rehearsals and teching are this week, for an opening
Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   When ``View'' opens, ``Falstaff'' will still have a handful of
performances before its run is complete. By that time, the season's
third production, Handel's ``Alcina,'' will be rehearsing, and
before ``View'' closes in November, a fourth opera, Verdi's
``Macbeth,'' will be clamoring for stage time as well.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The first onstage rehearsal of `Falstaff,' a huge moment in
the life of a production, happens at the exact same moment as the
first offstage rehearsal of a world premiere,'' Landmesser said.
``Sometimes you feel like you're leading a double life, married and
with two or three mistresses.''
</P>
<P>
   The process is obviously complicated when a work has never been
heard or staged before. For the designers of ``View,'' much of the
work involved Ms. Harrington's projections, the presence of which
were first suggested to Galati by Loquasto because the life of the
Carbone family, at the center of Miller's play, ended up aswim in
the judgments of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this play, this material, was perfect for
projections,'' Loquasto said. ``It wants things to be happening
around a space that is completely static.''
</P>
<P>
   The screens are so enormous that they each require two
projectors. Two on a back wall are 35 feet high and 40 to 45 feet
across, and one, a trapezoid angled across the stage, is 32 feet
high and 28 feet across on top and 20 feet across at the bottom.
(They cost $20,000 apiece, a huge chunk of Landmesser's
half-million dollar budget, which also includes about $100,000 for
Loquasto's costumes.)
</P>
<P>
   The images to be shown on them consist of both archival photos
and newly created images. A mixture of giant cityscapes and
oversize urban details _ both exteriors, like close-ups of
apartment facades photographed at vertiginous angles and interiors
like hallways and kitchen corners _ they are meant, in aggregate,
to suggest a small world of crowded apartment living and an
enclosed neighborhood dwarfed by a mammoth city.
</P>
<P>
   As the tech rehearsals proceeded, the photos were matched to
scenes, the timing of changes and scrolls adjusted. Several images
were discarded; a decision was made to add a dark scrim in front of
the two screens that are on the back wall of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to make about 30 more slides and that's something I
couldn't have known until I saw how it all spooled out,'' Ms.
Harrington said. ``A lot of the landscapes that we had built don't
seem appropriate now. We'll be making things darker, more night,
making things slightly more scary. That's a melodramatic step
that's hard to take initially.''
</P>
<P>
   A key element of the set is the angled screen, which serves as
the roof of the apartment and creates a dramatic and unsettling
visual line on the stage. It may be more effective as a simple
design element than as a screen; unlike those on the back wall,
this screen is actually a scrim, somewhat transparent, and during
tech week, it was evident that it was not holding the projected
images clearly.
</P>
<P>
   The projector sits above it, above the proscenium arch, pointing
upward at a plastic reflecting surface, which turns the image
downward onto the screen. Some improvement in the image resulted
when the plastic was replaced by glass, but there is a safety issue
in suspending a heavy glass mirror above the stage, and the
production will have to go back to plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tilt screen has a complicated psychological effect on the
space and the story, even though it's not yet always alive,''
Galati said. ``There's something about the slice and the lean, an
action in it. It's kinetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harrington and Loquasto said they hoped the clarity of the
images could be improved by changing the images. But in any case,
both said it was a minor imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the way it dims the center of the stage,'' Ms.
Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler likes it, too. He designed the palette with darkness in
mind, and though many of the exact cues for the show will have to
wait until a full staging rehearsal not long before the opening, he
was pleased that the palette was apt.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is take the model and plan and this week hope I
get the angles and all that figured out,'' he said. ``Then you have
to be able to react quickly to the way things are going when we get
started. I have to pick all the colors and that worked well. It was
the right palette: a lot of sepia tones, a lot of cool in it, not a
lot of vivid color at all. It's all very muted.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lighting elements changed during tech week. ``We were
talking about some red: red clouds, right?'' Ms. Harrington said.
``But as soon as we saw them, we knew it wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuler responded: ``Yes, but you have to bring them to the
theater, because otherwise you never know for sure. That's why this
week is so valuable. You can experiment with everything, and then
go back if you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end all the participants were pleased. There were no
major squabbles; personalities didn't clash. It was a tech week
that accomplished what tech week can.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, it doesn't matter how well we get along or how
well we do our jobs,'' Ms. Harrington said last week, looking ahead
to this one. ``Bill Bolcom is not taking the phone call that says:
`You know, honey, that number in the second act? The one that's a
little dreary? Well, right about now we could use something peppy.'
That's a conversation that's not going to take place, and this
thing will live or die with the music.''

 THE PIRATES OF POP MUSIC FILL STREETS WITH $5 CDs

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under the scaffolding on the southwest corner of
Fulton and Nassau Streets in lower Manhattan the other day, a man
at a folding table tried to entice passers-by with what has become
an increasingly common pitch: ``CDs, $5. CDs, $5.'' On the
northwest corner another man offered the same deal. People crowded
around as if someone was giving out free food.
</P>
<P>
   The recordings bore the earmarks of illegally produced copies of
legitimate CDs. Those who buy them said they sound like the real
thing, and in their slick packaging they resemble the CDs for sale
in stores. But the tight-fitting plastic wrappers of the authentic
CDs, along with the pullout sections of art and lyrics, are
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The disks themselves have a slight blue-green tint on the bottom
side, and they list the name of the artist _ often misspelled,
apparently in an attempt to maneuver around copyright laws _ and
the CD in simple block letters rather than in the logos of the
legitimate versions. These nondescript products have become the
latest vehicle for street-level music piracy, replacing cassettes
and costing the music industry tens of millions of dollars. Recent
arrests hint at how quick the profits can be for what in all
likelihood are a growing number of low-cost, computer-based rings
that can operate out of a small basement or living room.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, consumers seem quite happy with the product. ``In a
store, the last CD cost me $14, so this was $5,'' said Alex
Salguero, referring to a CD by hip-hop artist Eminem that he bought
from a sidewalk stand in the Wall Street area. ``For $15, I can buy
three on the street. And it's good quality.''
</P>
<P>
   While the record industry has been concentrating most of its
anti-piracy efforts on music that can be downloaded from the
Internet, advancements in CD technology have opened up this new
front in the piracy war. It is relatively easy to produce multiple
CD copies of high quality for little money.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap graphics software allows some operators to copy album
covers in a way that makes their products look authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Peddlers are taking advantage of the market for pop and hip-hop
music. The common selection on the street includes artists like
Cher, Britney Spears, TLC and the Backstreet Boys. Popular hip-hop
artists like Nas, Jay-Z, Puff Daddy and DMX are available at almost
every stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when we were getting our arms around the mass replication
of counterfeit and pirate cassettes is when we started to see the
evolution of the CD-R and CD plant piracy problem,'' said Frank
Creighton, the director of anti-piracy operations for the Recording
Industry Association of America, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Queens district attorney and the Suffolk County
Police announced the arrests of 12 people in connection with a
counterfeit CD ring. Along with cassettes, computers, recording
equipment and dubbing machines, authorities seized 98,000
counterfeit CDs. Officials called it the largest one-time
confiscation of counterfeit CDs in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In making the announcement with the authorities, the Recording
Industry Association of America, representing record companies,
estimated that the Queens and Suffolk ring was taking more than
$100 million a year from legitimate sales.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, three years after CDs were introduced in the United
States, record companies had to decide if it was worth investing
$25 to $30 million to open a factory to manufacture them. Now, for
an investment as low as $180, anyone can walk into a computer store
and buy a small CD copier, called a CD burner, to accompany a
computer. Larger CD burners that can make multiple copies are
available through the Internet for roughly $3,000. The burners,
made by major electronics companies, copy CDs onto blank disks
called CD-recordables or CD-Rs through a digital process that
maintains the quality of the recording. The CD-Rs sell for $1 each
in retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   With this technology available, pirates can set up CD factories
in living rooms. A street-corner peddler in lower Manhattan, who
readily acknowledged that his merchandise was pirated, said one of
his suppliers copies ``thousands and thousands of CDs'' in a tiny
office space packed with CD burners. ``It's like having a room
filled with rack stereo systems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This salesman, in his late 30s, said he works for a middleman
who deals directly with a supplier. The suppliers generally don't
sell CDs themselves, he said, because ``they're too busy burning
CDs.''
</P>
<P>
   Data released in August show that 155,496 pirated CDs had been
seized by law enforcement officials tipped off by the Recording
Industry Association in the first half of 1999, up from 23,858 for
the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the shift from the counterfeit cassette rings to
the CD-R rings,'' said Creighton of the RIAA.
</P>
<P>
   With cassettes, however, reproduction quality was not very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely were quality control issues in the cassette
arena that don't exist in the CD arena,'' Creighton said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, authorities in Prince George's County, Md., seized
nearly 59,000 CDs. Police described the action as the end of a
counterfeiting ring that involved illegal videos and CDs that were
produced in New York and shuttled to the Washington area for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA is developing encrypting technology that it hopes will
curb the production of pirated music by preventing it from being
played on the next generation of audio equipment. But the new
technology may not eliminate the law enforcement difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, peddlers have the appearance of legitimacy because
they often have permits for sidewalk sales of legal goods. In some
spots, the trade is so stable that vendors accept returns or
exchanges from regulars. One customer who works for a private
delivery service pulled up recently to a table on Houston and
Varick Streets in Greenwich Village and handed the CD peddler a
recording by Latino pop artist Manny Manuel, saying it skipped. The
seller readily exchanged it, saying the new one could be returned,
too, if there was a problem. The vendor later said that he was on
the delivery man's route, so it paid to keep him happy.

   One customer, who did not want to give her name, talked about a

of her supermarket. ``Everybody buys from him,'' she said. ``The

   Can an even-longer ``director's cut'' of ``Blade Runner'' be far
behind? The Sharp Corp. and Japanese government researchers have
developed a new memory disk that can store 200 gigabytes of data,
more than 40 times as much as conventional DVD disks. But it will
not be available for at least two years. &QL;

   Good news for couch potatoes everywhere: La-Z-Boy Inc.
(www.lazboy.com) will sell its furniture online next year. And the
company is also releasing the Oasis, a chair with a built-in cooler

   A Stylish Carrying Case For Mobile iMac Users
</P>
<P>
   Way back in 1984, Apple's brochure for the first Macintosh
featured the no-bigger-than-a-breadbox computer in various smart
poses all over the verdant Stanford University campus. But with
today's popular iMac at 38 pounds, hauling it down to the
quadrangle would cause even sports scholars to break a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   A company called GrabPac (www.grabpac.com) hopes to ease the
strain with a wraparound carry case that slips and snaps into
place, much like the tight-fitting car bras designed to protect the
front ends of Camaros and Corvettes.
</P>
<P>
   The form-and-fashion accessory comes in gray, teal or black and
sells for $59.95. It cleverly manages to integrate a mouse pad into
the keyboard flap, which folds up against the monitor's glass face
to protect it from minor bumps and scratches when the iMac is
lugged about by its soft-padded handle. Pockets on either side give
shelter to the mouse, a disk drive and a bottle of aspirin, in the
event of a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Also climbing aboard the back-to-school bandwagon is Microsoft
(www.microsoft.com/mac). The company has just introduced a special
edition of Word for iBook and iMac users. With a suggested retail
price of $99 (after a $30 rebate), the company unbundled the word
processing program from its pricier Office 98 suite for users who
want only the word processor, and not the suite's other
spreadsheet, presentation and database programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its ``special edition'' moniker, the program does work
on any Mac computer. But a spokeswoman for the company stressed
that ``the licensing agreement states it is for use with the iMac
and iBook.'' Don't ask, don't tell? &QL;

   A Free Market for Seats In Business Courses
</P>
<P>
   You have heard of online auctions for Beanie Babies, breakfasts
with bigwigs and even spare kidneys. But what about bidding for
seats in business school courses?
</P>
<P>
   Students at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of
Business are in the throes of such an auction this week. Students
registering for elective courses log on to Wharton's course-auction
Web site and bid on the ones they want. (Students sign up for core
courses through the traditional registration system.)
</P>
<P>
   Each student starts with 5,000 points. An eager marketing major
might place 2,000 points on a course offered by a popular marketing
guru, for example, and bid 500 points each on four others. At the
end of the day, computers run the numbers and match the highest
bidders with the number of open seats. The seats are sold for the
``clearing price,'' the highest losing bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really puts you in charge,'' said Karin Magnuson, a
second-year Wharton student.
</P>
<P>
   Other business schools have built similar systems. But Wharton's
course auction adds a twist: The school runs 10 rounds of auctions
each semester. After the second round, it allows students to
``sell'' courses as well as bid on them.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a frenzy of speculation. After all, these are
people who have come to business school to learn how to outsmart
the markets or, at the very least, turn a quick buck. At semester's
end, every student receives a replenishment of 1,000 points for
each course completed. But students who want a bigger stash down
the road buy courses with the intent of selling them at a higher
price.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Magnuson, for example, was selling a marketing course for
3,200 points on Wednesday. She insisted that she was not trying to
exploit her classmates. ``I'm just trying to prepare for next
semester,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anjani Jain, deputy vice-dean and director of the MBA program,
designed the auction almost three years ago. His plan was to mimic
a free market. Students cannot buy multiple seats in one class, but
they are allowed to purchase seats in an unlimited number of
classes, in the same time slots if they want.
</P>
<P>
   Students cannot see minute-to-minute market data, however. They
can only see what price the courses demanded in the last round, put
in their bids for the current round, and wait until the round ends
to see whether they were outbid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our students to be in the classroom instead of
watching a tickertape,'' Jain said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many students spend much of their first few weeks
watching _ and at times cursing _ the auction. Statistics from
previous auctions show that by the sixth and seventh rounds prices
soar as students worry about missing out on the courses they want.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the average seat price climbed from 423 in the
first round to 1,090 points in the seventh. The bubble popped by
the 10th round when the average seat price bottomed out at 172
points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, savvy bidders have not only learned about the
vagaries of supply and demand, Jain said. They have first-hand
experience of online auctions to take with them into the world of
electronic commerce. ``It has actually spawned some ideas,'' he
said, ``about Internet-based commerce using auctions.'' &QL;

   Fresh Out of Bread Crumbs? Try a Small Global Locator
</P>
<P>
   The technology that handles signals from the Global Positioning
System is getting so small that soon people will be able to discern
exactly where they are, where their children are and where the fish
are biting _ just by looking at their watches.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word from Sirf Technology, a company based in Santa
Clara, Calif., that has recently developed a GPS chip the size of a
postage stamp. Sirf's previous chip had the dimensions of a credit
card, and some of the earliest GPS units have been as large as
transistor radios. The newly shrunken device can be embedded in
mobile phones, handheld computers, watches and even lockets.
</P>
<P>
   Several wireless-communications companies have signed deals with
the company recently, and Sirf officials say that American
consumers will be seeing the fruits of those deals in mobile phones
that will be on the market in the next few months. Watches are not
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see these embedded in watches so that people can find
their way around while hunting or fishing,'' said Kanwar Chadha,
Sirf's founder. Large fishing boats use such technology already,
but with smaller, less expensive equipment, amateurs could also
save a record of the exact locations where they found the most
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Devices for tracking children, Chadha said, are a possibility as
well. A child might wear a locket, for example, that would send
signals to a parent's handheld computer whenever the child walked
outside a specified boundary. He acknowledged that such technology
could have Big Brother connotations, but he added that most parents
would like to have the security of knowing where their children
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of interesting applications for pinpointing
anything on earth,'' Chadha said. &QL;

   Using Your Voice Instead of Your Fingers
</P>
<P>
   You may never have to touch your computer again. That's one of
the more muted promises behind IBM's latest voice recognition
software, ViaVoice Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The new software package can automatically integrate itself with
either Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator or America
On Line's propriety software, enabling users to dictate e-mail and
chat room submissions and well as control the browser and e-mail
programs by voice. Going the other way, the software can also read
e-mail aloud to users.
</P>
<P>
   Similar integration with Microsoft's Office software means that
Via Voice users can now operate their computers entirely by voice
commands, although Ozzie Osborne, IBM's general manager for speech
and pen systems, acknowledged that this might not be its ``optimal
use.'' Instead, he expects that most users will settle into a
combination of voice commands and traditional keyboard and mouse
inputs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have run out of new things to say to your computer,
ViaVoice will attempt to cheer you up by creating little drawings.
Not great works of art, of course, but those tiny emoticons that
e-mail and chat-room users make with various combinations of
punctuation symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just say, `Smiley face' and it gives you the character,''
Osborne said. ViaVoice Millennium comes in three versions, with
varying levels of features, ranging in price from $59.95 to
$179.00. &QL;

   Bulbs Will Brighten New Year's Glitter
</P>
<P>
   In the first seconds after midnight on Dec. 31, the first light
millions of revelers are likely to see will be from the New Year's
Eve ball over Times Square. This year the 800-pound sphere, which
is being remade in Waterford crystal, is expected to be especially
dazzling, thanks to new high-tech light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Some 168 Halogena 2000 bulbs, a specially designed 60-watt
halogen bulb by the Philips Lighting Co., will dot the outside of
the ball, which will be six feet in diameter. An additional 208
40-watt Halogena bulbs will be arranged inside the ball. Both kind
of lights have facets, squared-off surfaces that create more
powerful lighting patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The bulbs fit into standard light sockets and are designed to
burn for two years. They will be available to consumers later this
year, said Steve Goldmacher, a spokesman for Philips. &QL;

`FOR COMMON THINGS ' : WHY SEINFELD (`IRONY INCARNATE') IS SO
MENACING 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds. Publication notes appear at end of review) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``An ironic man, with his sly stillness, and ambuscading ways,''
wrote Thomas Carlyle in ``Sartor Resartus,'' ``may be viewed as a
pest to society.''
</P>
<P>
   No, worse, argues Jedediah Purdy in his impressive if somewhat
pious first book, ``For Common Things: Irony, Trust and Commitment
in America Today.'' The ironic man, whom Purdy personifies as the
sitcom character Jerry Seinfeld, ``irony incarnate,'' is an
outright menace.
</P>
<P>
   With his ``style of speech and behavior that avoids all
appearance of naivete _ of naive devotion, belief, or hope,'' the
individual armored in the irony so prevalent among young people
today has withdrawn from the political arena just when it needs him
most. With good reason perhaps, Purdy concedes, politics these days
being, in his words, ``undignified, disreputable, vaguely
ridiculous and thoroughly outmoded,'' especially compared with an
earlier time in the century, when, as the German novelist Thomas
Mann wrote, ``The question of man's destiny presents itself in
political terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But politics today is both less and more than a Promethean
exercise intended to ``bring about basic changes in the human
predicament,'' Purdy argues. Politics can also serve the
maintenance of what he punningly calls ``common things,'' referring
all at once to what is public, what we all share and what is
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy says that the decline of the commons isn't as inevitable
as the ecologist Garrett Hardin described it as being in ``The
Tragedy of the Commons,'' which argued that self-interest must lead
everyone with access to the commons to take as much as possible _
that is, to overgraze or to clear forests _ until it is exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   If only, Purdy implores, the commons can be seen less narrowly
as three interrelated ecologies: first, ``an interpersonal, moral
ecology''; second, ``a broad social ecology,'' including ``the
institutions and practices that affect the shape of our lives,''
and third, the ``natural world.'' In this perspective then the
ironist's shunning of politics will become untenable.
</P>
<P>
   To reveal this vision of politics and the commons, he has
written ``so that I will not forget what I hope for now, and
because others might conclude that they hope for the same things.''
He continues: ``That would be the beginning of turning some of our
private, half-secret repositories of hope and trust into common
things. I think that some of them must be common, if they are to be
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As abstract as his ideas may sound, he has rooted them in the
realities of West Virginia, where his parents moved in 1974, the
year he was born. Growing up there until he went off to Phillips
Exeter Academy at age 14, he was inspired both by the way his
parents integrated their work and home lives with the community and
by the indifference of the coal-mining companies that he sees as
having ravaged the environment. He came away with a vision of work
that embedded thinking in the dirt of reality, precluding irony.
</P>
<P>
   By defining this work in moral terms, he hopes to unearth
another kind of irony, one that ``uncovers, in what is ordinarily
imagined to be unimportant or banal, something that elicits
surprise, delight and reverence.'' He concludes: ``This irony is
ecstatic, in the etymologically strict sense of drawing us out of
our stasis. It is the irony of discovery. It moves us.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is that little of what Purdy writes is new. As he
is the first to recognize, it takes us back to familiar thinkers
like Emerson, Thoreau, de Tocqueville, Marx, Camus, Orwell and
Weber, among others. On top of this, he labors at length such
crashingly obvious ideas as the ethical ambiguities of technology
(in particular genetic technology) and the decline of neighborly
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he often sounds self-righteous. He treats the global
market economy, which he anathematizes, as if it were something
that came into existence in the absence of human effort, whereas it
is arguably the consequence of decades of engaged political
striving. (Yet on the issue of mountaintop-removal strip-mining, he
takes the libertarian position that to pay the cost of
coal-mining's environmental damage you must factor it into the
price of coal.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he trivializes his opposition, not only by reducing all
ironists to Seinfeld but also by disdaining all those who seek
easier connections to reality than the thankless task of politics.
</P>
<P>
   One comes away from ``For Common Things'' feeling that the
superficial people he seeks to convert won't be bothered to fight
their way through his abstruse prose, with its sometimes complex
way of saying the most simple things.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you almost always sense what he's getting at, and you
have to admire him for taking on the disease of irony, which some
see as afflicting an entire generation. If many will not heed him,
at least he has articulated a cure.
</P>
<P>
   As his epigraph by Czeslaw Milosz puts it, ``What is
unpronounced tends to nonexistence.'' Now that ``For Common
Things'' pronounces the case against a static irony, it gives one
pause about reacting ironically.

EXAMINING THE CREATIVE MIND OF POET SHARON OLDS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' Sharon Olds said while flipping through her
new poetry collection, ``Blood, Tin, Straw,'' to be published next
month by Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so awful,'' she said. ``Omigod, it's all stories. I
just can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I wish I were better,'' Ms. Olds said of her poems, which
chronicle the daily life of a wife and mother not unlike herself.
``Why not just keep a diary?'' she asked, repeating a question from
her critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does this woman think anyone wants to read about her
private life?'' Ms. Olds asked. ``I have a prejudice that narrative
poetry is not as high an art as dense, mysterious, imagistic
poetry.'' But then, she points out, one always admires the things
one can't do oneself.
</P>
<P>
   There is almost no major American poet whose work is as sexually
explicit, and as intimately evocative of a distinct father, husband
and children as Ms. Olds, who is the New York State Poet Laureate
and who won a National Book Critics Circle Award for 1984 for her
collection ``The Dead and the Living.'' The critic Helen Vendler
famously referred to her poems as pornographic. Ms. Olds has
written poems about a son urinating, about a daughter on the brink
of puberty. She is particularly known for her 1992 collection ``The
Father,'' which chronicles in pitiless detail the death of an
abusive, alcoholic father from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   She has also written many poems about making love to a husband.
In her new collection, ``The Spouses Waking Up in the Hotel
Mirror,'' one poem reads:
</P>
<P>
   The man looked like himself, only more so,
</P>
<P>
   his face lucent, his silence deep as if
</P>
<P>
   inevitable, but the woman looked
</P>
<P>
   like a different species from an hour before,
</P>
<P>
   a sandhill crane or a heron, her eyes
</P>
<P>
   skinned back, she looked insane with happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the autobiographical flavor of her work, to
interview Sharon Olds is to play a kind of cat and mouse game. She
has agreed to cooperate, and yet she refuses to discuss her
personal life. She will not discuss her children; she has a son and
a daughter. She will not discuss the ending of her 32-year marriage
to a psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a pain,'' said Mrs. Olds, 56, apologizing when she
refused to say even what her father's occupation was. ``It makes me
seem like such a sensitive person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought anyone would read anything I'd written,'' she
said. ``If I'd known the number of readers I would have, I would
have used a pseudonym.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the privacy is to protect her family, she said.
``I promised I'd keep them out of this.'' She made a vow, she said,
many years ago, not to talk about them: ``Outing them is morally
wicked.'' But in a way, the wall she forms around herself also
enables her to continue to mine domestic life for the material of
her art.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even though her poems have been called diaries, ``I
don't think of it as personal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not messages in a bottle about me,'' said Ms. Olds.
``No!''
</P>
<P>
   She is often called a confessional poet, in the tradition of
Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, and Anne Sexton. Her work has a robust
sensuality, a delight in the physical that is almost Whitmanesque.
She has made the minutiae of a woman's everyday life as valid a
subject for poetry as the grand abstract themes that have
preoccupied other poets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olds has also been praised for her technique, her superb
attention to detail, for the pulse of her fast moving verse. ``Her
autobiographical material strikes, shines, deepens, spreads,'' Glyn
Maxwell wrote in The Times Literary Supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a boldness in her poetry,'' said the poet Galway
Kinnell, a teaching colleague in the graduate writing program at
New York University. ``She seems to speak where others are
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very direct way she is using herself as subject matter,''
Kinnell said, comparing her to Emily Dickinson, a poet for whom
``inner experience is primary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no attempt to portray the outer world without one's
self in it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olds is believed to be one of the best-selling literary
poets. She estimates that her collection ``The Dead and the
Living,'' published in 1984, has sold 50,000 copies, an enormous
amount for a serious poet. She is also a dedicated teacher. For the
last 15 years she has run poetry workshops for the severely
disabled at the Goldwater Hospital on Roosevelt Island in New York.
Audiences flock to her readings.
</P>
<P>
   She and Kinnell are known for giving riveting readings,
including one about sex, in which they stood side by side onstage,
reciting bits of poetry in counterpoint. Ms. Olds: ``In the middle
of the night, when we get up/after making love, we look at each
other in/complete friendship, we know so fully/what the other has
been doing.'' Kinnell: ``Now we lie together,/after making love,
quiet, touching along the length of our bodies,/familiar touch of
the long-married.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting for an interview full of feints and indirections
recently in a restaurant in Manhattan, Ms. Olds conceded that she
was born in San Francisco and that her background was ``middle
class.'' She was reared in Berkeley, Calif., in a ``medium-high
Episcopalian'' family, she said, going to church twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hearing about hell and God,'' she said. ``I was bringing
my own poor sick little head to it.'' Consequently, said Ms. Olds,
``I'm haunted by the fear of doing evil.''
</P>
<P>
   With her delicate features free of makeup and her straight, gray
hair, there is a Calvinist look about her.
</P>
<P>
   She refers often in conversation to Satan and God. A few years
ago, she said, she realized that her poetry, which she reads with
four stressed syllables to a line, and which she sees as
conceptually falling into quatrains, was an unconscious imitation
of hymns that she sang as a child. It was a shock, she said. ``I
thought I was writing free verse.'
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olds was sent east to the Dana Hall School in Wellesley,
Mass. She returned to California for college at Stanford, where she
met Elaine Pagels, future author of ``The Gnostic Gospels,'' who
became a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s she came to New York to Columbia University to get
a doctorate. Her dissertation was on Emerson's prosody. She felt an
affinity with Emerson, she said, because he did not always follow
conventional rules of poetry. ``Emerson couldn't pour what he had
to say into a smooth bottle of iambic pentameter form,'' said Ms.
Olds. ``Rather than being a sloppy and careless prosodist, he was a
forerunner of new forms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I write the same way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not always so. All the time she was studying Emerson
she was trying to write her own poetry. ``I was an artist trying to
be a scholar.'' She was ``stymied,'' trying to imitate the poetry
of Gary Snyder, ``all that white space, the immersion in nature,''
she said. ``Nonnarrative, a lot of times phrases instead of
sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, walking down the steps of Low library at Columbia,
she had an epiphany. ``It came to me as a vow to Satan,'' she said.
She would give up everything she had learned, and ``just write my
own stuff.'' Another epiphany occurred when she heard the poet
Muriel Rukeyser read. She was moved by her ``accessibility'' and by
the beauty of her voice, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only when she began to write about the passionate, messy
experiences of childbirth, mothering and sex, did she find her own
voice. ``Ordinary, understandable poems,'' she said. ``Other
artists may think it's nothing. There is something about wanting to
record what ordinary reality is like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started enjambing,'' she said, that is, carrying over
sentences from one line to the next, instead of completing them at
the end of the line, ``giving up end rhymes, and using sentences
with no comma, no period, no dash at the end of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s Ms. Olds married. She will not even give her
husband's name. ``Such a circumstance is devastating,'' said her
friend, Ms. Pagels, of the breakup of Ms. Olds' marriage. ``She is

resilience.''

   Today Ms. Olds lives in the same rent-controlled apartment that
she has had ``forever,'' she said. The lobby is faded, the plaster
on her ceilings is crumbling, but the apartment is filled with
light, with a wide view of the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when Ms. Olds is alone, she dances around her
apartment, she said, ``to late Beethoven or early Aretha.'' A poem
will come to her, usually out of ``ordinary life.'' In her new
book, for instance, there is ``The Native'':
</P>
<P>
   This touching of him, on the borders of sleep,
</P>
<P>
   my breasts and hip bones fitted to his long
</P>
<P>
   back, my lap curled to him,
</P>
<P>
   folded around him like a wing with a dark
</P>
<P>
   eye-spot,
</P>
<P>
   it feels to me like the most real thing
</P>
<P>
   ``Possibly it might have come to me as a thought like, `This is
the real thing,''' she said about the poem's origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're narratives,'' she said of her poems. Ms. Olds paused,
and then she added, almost wistfully, ``I wonder if they're art.''

NAVY BLAMES LOWER WARSHIP READINESS ON VIEQUES TRAINING FREEZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy said Wednesday that a warship sailing to
the Persian Gulf next week will be handicapped by a ``significant
degradation'' of its combat readiness because of a five-month ban
on target practice on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure was the latest effort by the Pentagon to crank up
pressure on President Clinton to allow the Navy and Marine Corps to
resume practicing air-to-ground bombing and naval gunfire at the
Caribbean bombing range used since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The destroyer USS John Hancock will sail Sept. 17 as part of the
USS John F. Kennedy carrier battle group without having completed
training with its two 5-inch guns, a senior Navy official told
Hearst Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The JFK is being escorted by 11 warships, including six guided
missile warships, two destroyers, two attack submarines and a
combat support ship. The battle group will be accompanied by a
Marine combat assault force on three assault ships.
</P>
<P>
   The Hancock, which was not permitted to practice firing its
5-inch guns in support of Marine troops landing on Vieques, is
``deploying with a significant degradation in combat readiness,'' a
Navy official said. ``It's not the way we like to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Combat rehearsals, including amphibious assaults by Marines,
have been suspended on Vieques since April when a Marine Corps'
bombing mishap killed a civilian Puerto Rican security guard and
injured four others.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders are increasingly complaining that the freeze
on training at Vieques is jeopardizing U.S. combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Adm. Harold W. Gehman Jr., commander of the U.S. Atlantic
Command, told Defense Secretary William Cohen in an Aug. 27 letter
that Navy and Marine Corps training on Vieques is ``part of a
complex training regime that allows us to send our men and women
into harms way with a clear conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehman urged efforts to ``retain the Vieques training area and
to continue this mission essential training.''
</P>
<P>
   Marine Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, commander of all U.S. operations
in the Persian Gulf, said continued suspension of air-to-ground
bombardment on Vieques would lead to ``less effective air-to-ground
weapons delivery accuracy'' by carrier-based U.S. warplanes
enforcing the no-fly zone across southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``This training is an absolute necessity to prepare our ships,
aircraft and aircrews for ongoing operations (Southern Watch) (and)
short notice contingencies,'' Zinni wrote Gen. Henry H. Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Both letters were obtained by Hearst Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Hancock, the Navy official who discussed the
ship's combat readiness said he would only discuss the militarily
sensitive issue on the condition that he not be publicly
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Navy headquarters at the Pentagon and at Atlantic
fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va., said they could not remember
the Navy deploying a warship on a routine six-month operation with
such a low rating for combat readiness in one of the ship's
``mission categories.''
</P>
<P>
   The 563-foot destroyer, commissioned in 1979, failed to meet
Navy standards for deployment in ``naval surface fire support,''
the use of the 5-inch guns to destroy surface targets and support
amphibious landings by Marine forces.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the Hancock had qualified for seven other mission
categories, including anti-air operations and surface combat
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni said in his letter that U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf
``will experience the first effects'' of the training moratorium on
Vieques when the Hancock arrives on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``The degradation of this ship is not significant in terms of
present operations and can be partly mitigated by other means,''
Zinni wrote. ``However, this shortcoming will continue to grow and
will degrade our standard of readiness for combat operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy Lt. Cdr. Mark McDonald, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet
in Norfolk, Va., said the Hancock and its crew of 376 will practice
firing the ship's two 5-inch guns at a range in Scotland en route
to the Persian Gulf assignment in an effort to increase the ship's
readiness rating.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald declined to discuss details of the ship's readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. William J. Fallon, the Atlantic fleet officer who
assesses naval forces' readiness for deployment, warned a Pentagon
review panel on July 23 that warships will begin to face ``serious
deficiencies'' in combat readiness unless live-fire training
resumes on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we say, `This is all too hard, we're not going to do it,' I
know in my heart we put people's lives at risk,'' Fallon testified.

<P>
   The armed forces' lobbying came as the White House awaits a
Pentagon recommendation on the future use of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders in Puerto Rico, their allies in Congress and
Puerto Rican political leaders in New York are demanding a
permanent cessation of live fire operations and the Navy's
withdrawal from 22,000 acres of land on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on persuading First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to
take up the cause in her prospective New York Senate race, Rep.
Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., and New York City Council member Jose Rivera
are organizing a three-day campaign in New York beginning Friday to
rally public support for demands that the Navy leave Vieques.

LOTT QUESTIONS FBI ROLE IN 1993 SIEGE; DANFORTH BACKED TO LEAD
PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Leader Trent Lott expressed doubts
Wednesday about who caused the huge fire that killed some 80 Branch
Davidian cult members in 1993. Other Congressional leaders said
they support the appointment of former Sen. John Danforth to lead
an independent probe of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders said congressional investigations into the
Davidian siege near Waco, Texas, will not be called off despite
Danforth's appointment Wednesday by Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Lott referred to the FBI's admission on Aug. 25 that, despite
previous denials, its agents fired two incendiary tear gas
canisters during the final government raid on the Davidian compound
on April 19, 1993. The bureau and its parent agency, the Justice
Department, still maintain that those canisters were fired several
hours before the conflagration and did not cause it.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott told reporters, ``There are doubts (about the cause)
because questions have been raised.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi senator, a frequent critic of Reno, added, ``I
am beginning to think that the attorney general should resign.''
Reno has said the FBI had consistently misinformed her about
whether it had ever used flammable tear gas during the 51-day
siege.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, defending Reno,
said Wednesday that she ``deserves commendation rather than
criticism,'' and that ``under no circumstances'' should she resign.
</P>
<P>
   Other congressional leaders expressed strong approval of
Danforth's appointment. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who chairs the
House Government Reform Committee, said, ``I have nothing but the
highest regard for Mr. Danforth and believe he is an excellent
candidate to run the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton added, ``We would be happy to work with Mr. Danforth, but
his appointment won't alter or change our investigation into what
happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's panel has already begun subpoenaing witnesses on why
the FBI denied for six years that it had used any flammable
canisters.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and other investigators are expected to focus on
whether the denials resulted from a bureaucratic slip-up or a
cover-up. The probers also will look into why military special
operations officers were on the scene with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department insists it was cult leader David Koresh
and his followers who started the fatal fire. The department also
says that military special operations officers were at the siege
only as observers and advisers, and not in an illegal capacity as
participants in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Lopatto, spokeswoman for Sen. Orrin Hatch, who heads the
Senate Judiciary Committee, said, ``We're moving forward with our
investigation regardless of what the Justice Department does.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, a former Missouri senator, brings to the outside
probe strong credentials as both an independent Republican and as a
law enforcement official for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Yale University's Law School and its Divinity
School, Danforth, whose grandfather William Danforth founded the
pet food empire Ralston Purina, became an ordained Episcopal priest
in 1968. That year he also his public-service career as Missouri
state attorney general and was known for hiring Democrats as well
as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he was elected to the Senate, where he developed a
reputation as a moderate who was willing to compromise in order to
get legislation passed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever polite and even-tempered, he also became known as the
``conscience of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth was a familiar face on television in 1991 when he
championed the nomination of conservative Court of Appeals Judge
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court during the turbulent
confirmation hearings that centered on law professor Anita Hill's
charges that Thomas had sexually harassed her. Thomas _ and
Danforth _ strongly denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, his last year in the Senate before retiring, Danforth
worked with Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., on a commission to shrink
ballooning federal entitlement programs such as Social Security and
Medicare. Kerrey praised him afterward as ``someone who can't be
pushed around.''
</P>
<P>
   Other former Senate colleagues said Wednesday that Danforth will
bring instant credibility to the independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said he has ``an excellent
reputation and the highest integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, called Danforth ``a straight
arrow ... who (will) give people confidence that everything will be
looked at in a completely fair manner.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of Reno's tenure, the White House has stood behind
her, but President Clinton has declined to give a similar vote of
confidence to FBI Director Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that Texas
Rangers have found flares that were apparently fired by federal
officials during the Davidian siege. The newspaper said the Rangers
discovered the expended military illumination flares amid tons of
evidence recovered last Friday from a storage facility near Waco.
Evidence logs showed that the flares were recovered in the weeks
after the Davidian compound burned.

TIMOR A TEST OF CLINTON RESOLVE TO HALT DEADLY VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton visited Rwanda last year on
the fourth anniversary of the genocide that left more than half a
million dead, he apologized to survivors and said the world should
have intervened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never again must we be shy about the evidence,'' Clinton said
then.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor is shaping up as a test of the president's word.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rwanda speech set the parameters for intervention on
humanitarian grounds,'' said an administration official, speaking
on the condition of anonymity. ``We'll see how this one unfolds.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence that has engulfed East Timor in the past week
apparently continued unabated Wednesday, as United Nations and
Australian officials said Indonesia's declaration of martial law
had not stopped the violence. So far, according to UN officials, as
many as 200,000 East Timor residents have fled, a quarter of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in violence began after East Timor residents
overwhelmingly voted for independence from Indonesia. The United
Nations, which sent a large team to observe the elections,
announced an almost complete pullout by Friday of the remaining
international and local UN staff in the East Timor capital of Dili.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said a skeleton crew would stay
behind to protect 2,000 East Timorese who have sought safe haven at
the UN compound. Starting Friday, they will be almost the only
foreign observers left in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ramos-Horta, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize and a
longtime advocate for East Timor's independence, made a chilling
prediction at the National Press Club in Washington, three blocks
from the White House:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next few days, thousands of people in East Timor will
die. Hundreds already have been shot dead. Thousands will die in
the next few days of summary and arbitrary executions.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``If there is not going to be in the next few
hours, a strong, determined decision by the US administration . . .
and the other members of the Security Council to commit
unequivocally to sending a peace enforcement mission to East Timor
. . . the people of East Timor are doomed. And let me say, the UN
will never again recover from this tragedy. Rwanda was one, Bosnia
one. And here, on the issue of East Timor, where the international
community could have succeeded, it is failing yet again.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal called for the immediate dispatch of international
peacekeeping troops to its former colony, but Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie said he would not approve any outside intervention,
and said the military would soon control the paramilitary forces
that have terrorized residents.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Clinton administration and the United Nations
reiterated that they would not intervene without Indonesia's
permission.
</P>
<P>
   US Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, who has been a strong
supporter of Indonesian interests dating to his days as US senator
from Maine, said the United States ``is not planning on any
insertion of peacekeeping forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said US officials have been ``talking and coordinating''
with Australian officials on a possible international force but had
not committed any troops.
</P>
<P>
   A second Clinton administration official, however, said there
have been long debates at the White House over the Pentagon's
strong recommendation against sending in peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The only conclusion was that the administration and the UN
Security Council should give Indonesia an unspecified amount of
time to see if its military could end the rampages by the militia
forces. Late Wednesday, Habibie was set to meet with a five-member
Security Council team to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton will be in New Zealand at the annual Asian
Pacific Economic Conference, which could be dominated by the
upheaval in East Timor if the violence remains unchecked. Habibie
said he and other top Indonesian officials will not attend the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence, Mahendra Siregar, the first secretary at
the Indonesia Embassy in Washington, said the first two days of
martial law ``showed some improvement in Dili. No has been killed
there in the last 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Indonesia has legal authority under a UN agreement signed
May 5 to look after security in East Timor, Siregar said no country
should be considering intervention. ``Pressuring Indonesia on this
issue will not solve the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the violence escalates?
</P>
<P>
   Several US senators and representatives called for economic and
military penalties, including ending US military assistance to
Indonesia and opposing any international financial assistance to
Habibie's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia cannot expect continued international financial
support unless it takes immediate steps to end the violence in East
Timor,'' said Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Others argued for immediately dispatching international
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and Security Council, of course,
didn't heed Ramos-Horta's call, and his was one of many voices
raising comparisons between East Timor, Rwanda and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor, said Hurst Hannum, a professor of international
law at the Fletcher School of Diplomacy at Tufts University,
``there is a much stronger case for intervention than the case for
Kosovo. In East Timor, the motivation to intervene would be purely
humanitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials have dismissed any comparison to NATO's war over
Kosovo, pointing out that other diplomatic avenues were closed with
Yugoslavia and that the Kosovar Albanians had never been permitted
to vote for independence _ two key differences from the current
East Timor situation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rwanda comparison, and Clinton's earlier words, isn't so
easily brushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   The first administration official said there has been much talk
among top policymakers about Rwanda, and not Kosovo, when it comes
to East Timor. ``Kosovo is the underbelly of Europe, where our
strategic interests are unquestioned,'' the official said. ``Here,
like Rwanda, it's farther afield, and the strategic importance
isn't so clear. Here, too, are people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, said the official, is keenly aware of Clinton's
words in Rwanda in March 1998, and some wonder whether his pledge
then carries over to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton to Rwandans: ``We did not act quickly enough after
the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to
become safe havens for the killers. We did not immediately call
these crimes by their rightful name: genocide.''

PARCELLS SAYS HE'S FOCUSED ON THRASHING PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ While the questions about That Subject
confronted him as inevitably as unsolicited Bob Kraft suggestions
once did, Bill Parcells's facial expression remained impassive. His
vocal inflection never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   No, sir. Let the Patriots worry about suffering a relapse of
testosterone overload Sunday at the Meadowlands in their latest
reunion/grudge match with their old boss and his New York Jets.
Parcells is having none of it. Never has.
</P>
<P>
   All this babble about Tuna Bowls and one-upmanship and poetic
justice that has engulfed each Patriots-Jets clash since Parcells's
acrimonious departure from New England for his beloved New Jersey
in the wake of his 1996 Super Bowl season? That's somebody else's
game. Parcells isn't playing. And if he's hiding his true emotions,
his demurrals certainly sound sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never really looked at it from that perspective,'' he
told the New York media and one Boston interloper Wednesday as the
fifth renewal of hostilities approached. ``I understand (the
buildup), but I've never been caught up in it. I never did look at
it as a personal thing. That was somebody else. Nobody knew what
was in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   What's in his heart is an unquenchable desire to beat the
stuffing out of the Patriots, but not for gloating purposes.
Parcells is too pragmatic, too obsessed with immediate objectives,
to worry about the nonessentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our opener and we don't want to start out 0-2 like we did
last year,'' he said of his defending AFC East champions and
conference playoff runners-up. ``They're a quality team in what top
to bottom is a very tough division. Offensively, they have a lot of
firepower _ top-flight receivers, quarterback, and tight end.
Defensively, they have a couple of top-of-the-line players.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's all that matters _ the strength of the opponent, not
its identity nor its psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought the Patriots' admitted overemphasis on
showing up their former coach would detract from their efforts _ as
it seems to have done while they've lost three of four meetings the
past two years _ Parcells said, ``I don't think so. I can't worry
about anyone other than my team. I'm just trying to put the best
team on the field I can for this week. That's all I worry about.
I'll worry about next week next week.''
</P>
<P>
   He presented a variation on that theme immediately after his
Long Island dissertation when he hooked up in a teleconference with
the Boston media at Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He offered a tribute to Drew Bledsoe, the quarterback he
alternately browbeat and coddled to stardom in New England. ``I'm
really pleased for Drew,'' he said. That provided a natural lead-in
to a question about whether Parcells would try to wreak havoc on
Bledsoe's thought process, as he reputedly has done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The scoff fairly crackled through the phone line. ``All that
stuff,'' said Parcells. ``I just don't believe in any of that. I'm
not the one playing. The players are playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And the press is hyping. So Parcells next took the opportunity
to dismiss the Tuna tempest before a new audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been kind of spiraling downward,'' he said. ``The
media makes more of it than really exists. There's not that many
players left in New England (who played for Parcells). And there's
not that many players from New England here. Hey, it holds its own
course.''
</P>
<P>
   He was partially accurate. The Patriots Alumni Association in
New York has been reduced to four _ Curtis Martin, Tom Tupa, Mike
Gisler, and Ray Lucas _ with the offseason departures of Scott
Zolak, Corwin Brown, and Keith Byars. It's not that Parcells isn't
nostalgic. But business is business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corwin Brown is a special kid; I have strong feelings for
him,'' said Parcells. ``Keith, too. It's hard. But you have to move
on. I'm not saying it's over. I'm not saying they won't be back.
But you have to do what you think is best to get ready for this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Parcells's math is awry. This week the Patriots
roster includes 24 members who either played for Parcells in 1996
or were on the practice squad. No wonder his successor in
Foxborough, Pete Carroll, has attributed his club's failure against
the Jets to hypertension _ or that the Patriots coach seems to be
foaming at the mouth to settle the score or at least make it more
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   That's news to Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you're talking about is some perception,'' he said. ``So I
can't say.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to anymore. The results speak for themselves.

GROUP OPPOSES $1 BILLION IN PROPOSED NASA BUDGET CUTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small group of lawmakers joined forces Wednesday
in opposition to nearly $1 billion in proposed NASA funding cuts as
Congress resumed work on a number of year 2000 appropriations
measures that President Clinton has threatened to veto.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from their monthlong summer recess, a half-dozen
lawmakers from affected states, such as Maryland and Texas, said
that the NASA budget reductions would force significant cutbacks in
space exploration and scientific research, slash up to 7,000 jobs,
and ultimately ``endanger the life of the nation.'' The lawmakers
cited the nation's dependence on NASA-funded research breakthroughs
in aeronautics and other fields as reasons they oppose the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers blamed Republican leaders in the Senate and the
House for the ``shortsighted'' budget proposal, charging that NASA
was singled out ``to take a hit'' as part of the Republican plan to
cut taxes by $792 billion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The funding reduction, already approved by the Senate and to be
voted Thursday in the House, would cut the space agency's budget by
nearly $1 billion below its current $13.7 billion level. Democrats
charged that the cut would betray a 1997 understanding between
Congress and the White House to keep the agency's funding at around
$13.5 billion a year through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Texas, said the agency had already made
cutbacks of 34 percent over the past decade, ``more than any other
agency,'' and could not afford to lose any more funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical cut that we absolutely can't take,'' said
Hall, the ranking Democrat on the House subcommittee that oversees
NASA operations.
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Democratic Reps. Ken Bentsen and Sheila
Jackson Lee of Texas. In a bitter attack, the two Houstonians
accused Republican leaders of playing politics with NASA in order
to help fund a tax cut measure that they know does not stand any
chance of becoming law because Clinton's has vowed to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee said the cuts would only end up punishing an agency
in a time of anticipated budget surpluses, despite its efforts to
curtail unnecessary spending in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gotten where we wanted to go (in balancing the budget)
and beyond. That's why this is a punitive measure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen also questioned why the Republicans would even propose a
cut to NASA funding when Clinton has promised to veto any bill
containing reductions in the agency budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just political posturing ... for an election 15 months
from now,'' Bentsen said, referring to efforts by Republicans to
appear as if they are still holding the line on spending while
cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican, Rep. Connie Morella of Maryland, agreed in part
with Bentsen. She said NASA funding would likely be restored in the
end and called on her GOP colleagues to acknowledge that spending
limits set in 1997 should be lifted in order to fully fund
important scientific research and development efforts, as well as
other needed programs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cut in the NASA budget, she said, ``just points out
that these caps have just got to be moved.''
</P>
<P>
   While he favors holding the line on spending, House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, is pushing for restoration of NASA
funding. Ironically, DeLay voted for the cuts last month in the
Appropriations Committee as part of a larger spending measure
designed to stay within the 1997 balanced budget agreement. But he
has promised to help restore the funding in conference with the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over NASA erupted as Congress and Clinton began
wrestling Wednesday with a number of contentious 2000 spending
issues, many of which are likely to be unresolved when the new
fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to veto the Republicans' $792 billion tax
relief package when it reaches his desk next week. And he has vowed
to veto several appropriations measures as well because of the NASA
reduction and cuts in other programs favored by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders planned to meet Thursday to consider how to
respond to the veto threats. In the meantime, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called on Clinton to at least open
negotiations with Congress on the tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen any indication that the president wants to work
with us,'' Lott told reporters. ``What the president wants is more
spending, more spending, more spending for everything. He is not
for tax relief for working Americans.''

 &HT;    DANFORTH TO HEAD JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S WACO PROBE
 &HT;    550&AMP;add. With WACO-CONGRESS.
 &HT;    By BOB DART and JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri has accepted
Attorney General Janet Reno's offer to head an independent
investigation of FBI actions during and after the fatal 1993 Branch
Davidian siege near Waco, Texas, Justice Department officials
confirmed Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Danforth were scheduled to appear at a news conference
Thursday morning at the Justice Department to officially announce
his appointment. The officials declined to discuss any details of
the investigation, such as how long it would last or the scope of
Danforth's powers.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also declined to comment on reports that an
assistant to Danforth would also be named Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno tapped Danforth, a Republican who earned wide bipartisan
respect in the Senate, after acknowledging that her credibility had
been damaged by recent FBI admissions that it had used flammable
tear gas grenades in the siege.
</P>
<P>
   Both Reno and FBI officials had denied for six years that such
grenades had been used at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said Wednesday
the belated disclosures have caused him to question who started the
fatal fire, and said Reno should resign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had doubts about who started the fire, Lott replied,
``There are doubts because of the questions that have been raised.
... How did that happen? Who did it? And why were we not given full
information or accurate information?''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's top Republican said the nation is worried that
``you cannot rely on information you get from the attorney general
or the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about that incident (at Waco). It's about a
bigger question,'' Lott told reporters at the Capitol. ``We have
the Justice Department ... not showing competence or probity. That
really concerns people. It scares people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott pointed to ``the pattern now that has developed over six
and a half years and the events involving not only the appointment
of independent counsels, her refusal to provide information or
answer questions by the Congress, the problem with the Waco
investigation, the situation with the Puerto Rican pardons. All of
that leads me to conclude that the attorney general should
resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a thorough probe is conducted by Danforth, Congress must
also hold hearings, Lott said. ``We have a responsibility here to
the American people, as elected officials, to conduct our own
investigation and ask questions.''
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing that Congress should take an investigatory role,
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., rushed to the defense
of the beleaguered attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Janet Reno deserves commendation, not criticism,''
said Daschle. ``She deserves every bit of the benefit of the doubt
here until all the facts are known. But under no circumstances do I
believe the attorney general should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the top Democrat in the Senate indicated that Justice
Department officials will be testifying soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ensure that all the facts are out,'' said Daschle.
``I do believe there is a constitutional role for the Congress to
be involved. But I hope it can be non-political or nonpartisan,
objective and swift.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, was regarded as politically independent during his
three terms in the Senate. After serving for two years as
co-chairman of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax
Reform, he left the Senate after the 1994 election.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Several committees are already looking into the Waco incident in
which 76 Branch Davidian members, including 21 children, died in a
fire that the FBI contends was set by leaders of the sect.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, federal officials have admitted that that two
incendiary tear gas grenades were fired but maintained that they
could not have caused the fire. The grenades were shot at a
concrete bunker more than 100 yards from the wooden compound and
several hours before the fire broke out, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lott became perhaps the highest-ranking official
in Washington to publicly express doubts about who started the
fatal fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a clear answer,'' he said. ``And I think we need
to find that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott is also the top Republican to call for Reno to step down,
albeit tentatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when you have an attorney general that has
developed a pattern of not acting when she should with regard to
investigations or, in this case, apparently not getting to the
truth'' the situation ``puts her in jeopardy in terms of her
ability to do the job,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait for more information and some final
conclusions, but I'm beginning to think that she should resign,''
Lott said.

THE PAIN RETURNS FOR COUPLE ARRESTED ON MARIJUANA CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GORDY HOLT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEABECK _ Dick and Linda Elsea say his snoring and apnea have
returned, along with a disfiguring facial tic. But even worse is
the return of her fibromyalgia, a muscle pain that racks her left
side day and night.
</P>
<P>
   It's all back, the Elseas say, because in March they were
arrested for growing marijuana and now can't smoke it. When they
did, it made them feel better, they insist.
</P>
<P>
   The Elseas thought the November passage of Washington state
Initiative 692 gave them license to grow and smoke marijuana for
their health problems. Their mistake. They neglected to find a
doctor to recommend the illegal drug, as required by the new law,
and now they're facing the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Kitsap County Superior Court Judge Jay Roof imposed fines of
$1,387 apiece and 240 hours of community service each. Both are on
probation for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Although jail sentences were not imposed, the penalties present
a serious economic challenge for the Elseas, neither of whom is
currently employed. Their only source of income was Dick Elsea's
workers compensation check, but that expired this week.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Elseas begin paying their debt to society, the
couple have found some solace in far-off Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Internet, they joined a class-action lawsuit that
seeks to end the federal government's ban on medicinal marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Pot in Washington state is illegal to possess, grow or use
unless recommended by a doctor. Nationally, it is one of 86 drugs
deemed by the federal government to have ``no currently accepted
medical use.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, eight people across the United States are being
supplied with marijuana under a special program sponsored by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   That program may be the government's undoing, at least according
to the Elseas' attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia lawyer Lawrence Elliott Hirsch is the mastermind
behind the class-action suit he filed in U.S. District Court. The
suit seeks to extend the principle of equal protection to people
who might benefit from the use of medicinal marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Hirsch argued that his clients should get the same
access to pot as do the eight people who already receive it from
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   District Court Judge Marvin Katz agreed that Hirsch should have
the chance to prove his case.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's equal-protection theory stems from a 1978 government
settlement reached with a litigant named Robert Randall, who has
glaucoma, a painful eye disease that can lead to blindness.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, Randall was arrested for possessing marijuana.
He was tried and acquitted. He then filed a civil claim, asking
that he be allowed to smoke pot as part of a special
``compassionate use'' program run by the government.
</P>
<P>
   He won.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Randall and 12 others were granted access to the
program _ and to rolled marijuana cigarettes produced under
government supervision at the University of Mississippi at Oxford.
The program now serves just eight people and has been closed to
newcomers since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government years ago validated the use of marijuana as an
effective medical treatment and even grows it,'' Hirsch said in a
recent telephone interview. ``What about equal access? Shouldn't
everyone else who needs it get it, too?''
</P>
<P>
   The Elseas and the other plaintiffs in the class-action suit
suffer from a list of maladies that range from AIDS to PMS. Pain
and nausea are a common thread. They say pot helps them cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marijuana helped us feel better,'' said Dick Elsea, a
60-year-old carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My snoring stopped and I could sleep with my wife again for
the first time in 17 years. But the best of it was that Linda's
pain went away, and she could actually sit still again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not any more. Near the end of a long morning interview at the
Elseas' home, Linda began to show discomfort, rocking and rubbing
the sore muscles of her left arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine yourself with a line drawn down the middle,'' said the
50-year-old. ``One side feels like you. The other feels like it
belongs to someone else. I get headaches, a stiff neck, some facial
numbness, shoulder, arm and hand pain and pain down my whole lower
left side. Sometimes it's like I'm on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Analgesics and anti-depressants have been prescribed. But
marijuana works better, Linda Elsea said.
</P>
<P>
   The Elseas say, however, that his doctors at the American Lake
Veterans Affairs hospital and her physician won't even discuss
recommending medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   And that angers Robert Killian, the Seattle doctor who helped
draft I-692.
</P>
<P>
   Killian said he is ``disappointed'' at the reaction of doctors
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear stories every day like this one, where physicians have
known their patients may be using marijuana or want to try it, but
refuse to authorize it or sometimes even discuss it, out of an
unfounded fear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may still be against federal law, but we have a First
Amendment right to discuss and to document. Our law was written to
protect patients from going to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in the discovery stage, the Philadelphia lawsuit represents
428 people around the country, including the Elseas and 27 others
in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The suit survived a critical test earlier this year when a
government motion to dismiss the claim was rejected by Judge Katz.
</P>
<P>
   Katz' ruling coincides with a suspicion here and around the
country that pot's medicinal effect isn't imaginary. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _Last November, passage of I-692 created the Medical Marijuana
Act, which exempts from criminal penalties use of pot for certain
medical conditions, but only with a doctor's approval. This is the
law the Elseas thought covered them.
</P>
<P>
   _On Sept. 24, for the first time, Washington's Medical Quality
Assurance Commission will hold a hearing to explore whether Crohn's
disease should be added to the list of ailments whose symptoms may
be treated by marijuana. The only conditions now on the list are
cancer, HIV or AIDS, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy or other seizure
or spastic disorders; intractable pain, and glaucoma. _In May, the
Clinton administration made it easier for state and local
governments to pay for research into the medical uses of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   _And in August, a Microsoft millionaire from Seattle donated
$100,000 to get Initiative 229 on the November 2000 ballot. I-229
would permit marijuana sales in state liquor stores and would
license farmers to grow it.
</P>
<P>
   For Dick and Linda Elsea, a puff of the stuff they grew in their
garage worked just fine. They never imagined what might happen if
caught.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a tip, a police SWAT team descended on the couple's
small rented home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick had taken an elderly uncle to the doctor, and I was
alone,'' Linda Elsea recalled. ``I came out of the bathroom and saw
a half a dozen police cars and all these cops in bullet-proof vests
coming down the driveway. I didn't count them, but there sure were
more than I wanted to see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minutes that followed, Linda found herself manacled and
on her way in a squad car to the Kitsap County Jail in Port
Orchard, where even her body cavities were searched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst thing I've ever been through in my life,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were growing, yes,'' Linda Elsea said. ``But we weren't
selling, or anything. There were no scales in the house. No money.
So the cops were very, very disappointed when they came in and
didn't find what they were looking for.''

   &UR; MURDOCH CHEERLEADS FOR CHINA IN EVERY GAME &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Media mogul  &UR; Rupert Murdoch &LR; , who's eager to do business in
China, told Vanity Fair that the  &UR; Dalai Lama  &LR; of Tibet _ whose
struggle is to oust the Chinese there _ is said by some to be a
``very political old monk shuffling around in Gucci shoes.''
Murdoch said that before the Chinese occupied Tibet, it was ``a
pretty terrible autocratic society out of the Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   As to China, Murdoch opined that ``the average Chinese person
doesn't care about democracy, he cares about his next bowl of rice
and getting a better standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan activists called Murdoch's remarks ``ignorant,''
``cynical'' and ``self-serving.'' ``Rupert Murdoch knows nothing
about Tibet. ...,''  &UR; Tashi Tsering &LR;  of the Tibet Fund told the
Daily Telegraph of London. `He is definitely not someone to make
moral judgments, particularly about someone like the Dalai Lama. He
should stick to making money.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch recently married 31-year-old  &UR; Wendy Deng &LR; , a Chinese
woman. Last year, his publishing company, HarperCollins, canceled
plans to publish the memoirs of former Hong Kong governor  &UR; Chris &LR; 
 &UR; Patten &LR;  because the book was critical of China; and five years ago,
Star TV, which he owns, stopped using the BBC because it was
critical of Chinese actions in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: In a story about China's new women, Marie-Claire magazine
says that the ``most exclusive residential compound in Beijing is
``Beijing Riviera Villas.''

</P>
<P>
   The document was ``ultra top secret,'' said the newspaper, but
was received by  &UR; Saji Philips &LR;  of South Auckland. A policeman
eventually showed up and took the document from the chicken man.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. In other duh news,  &UR; R.S. Bolton &LR;  forwards a Washington

</P>
<P>
   The first time he saw pictures taken in concentration camps, he

LOTT QUESTIONS FBI ROLE IN SIEGE; DANFORTH BACKED TO LEAD PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (EDs: CORRECTS lede to say Senate (not House) Majority Leader;
makes minor change in headline.)  
 By MARK HELM and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott expressed doubts
Wednesday about who caused the huge fire that killed some 80 Branch
Davidian cult members in 1993. Other Congressional leaders said
they support the appointment of former Sen. John Danforth to lead
an independent probe of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders said congressional investigations into the
Davidian siege near Waco, Texas, will not be called off despite
Danforth's appointment Wednesday by Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Lott referred to the FBI's admission on Aug. 25 that, despite
previous denials, its agents fired two incendiary tear gas
canisters during the final government raid on the Davidian compound
on April 19, 1993. The bureau and its parent agency, the Justice
Department, still maintain that those canisters were fired several
hours before the conflagration and did not cause it.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott told reporters, ``There are doubts (about the cause)
because questions have been raised.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi senator, a frequent critic of Reno, added, ``I
am beginning to think that the attorney general should resign.''
Reno has said the FBI had consistently misinformed her about
whether it had ever used flammable tear gas during the 51-day
siege.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, defending
Reno, said Wednesday that she ``deserves commendation rather than
criticism,'' and that ``under no circumstances'' should she resign.
</P>
<P>
   Other congressional leaders expressed strong approval of
Danforth's appointment. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who chairs the
House Government Reform Committee, said, ``I have nothing but the
highest regard for Mr. Danforth and believe he is an excellent
candidate to run the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton added, ``We would be happy to work with Mr. Danforth, but
his appointment won't alter or change our investigation into what
happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's panel has already begun subpoenaing witnesses on why
the FBI denied for six years that it had used any flammable
canisters.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and other investigators are expected to focus on
whether the denials resulted from a bureaucratic slip-up or a
cover-up. The probers also will look into why military special
operations officers were on the scene with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department insists it was cult leader David Koresh
and his followers who started the fatal fire. The department also
says that military special operations officers were at the siege
only as observers and advisers, and not in an illegal capacity as
participants in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Lopatto, spokeswoman for Sen. Orrin Hatch, who heads the
Senate Judiciary Committee, said, ``We're moving forward with our
investigation regardless of what the Justice Department does.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, a former Missouri senator, brings to the outside
probe strong credentials as both an independent Republican and as a
law enforcement official for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Yale University's Law School and its Divinity
School, Danforth, whose grandfather William Danforth founded the
pet food empire Ralston Purina, became an ordained Episcopal priest
in 1968. That year he also his public-service career as Missouri
state attorney general and was known for hiring Democrats as well
as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he was elected to the Senate, where he developed a
reputation as a moderate who was willing to compromise in order to
get legislation passed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever polite and even-tempered, he also became known as the
``conscience of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth was a familiar face on television in 1991 when he
championed the nomination of conservative Court of Appeals Judge
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court during the turbulent
confirmation hearings that centered on law professor Anita Hill's
charges that Thomas had sexually harassed her. Thomas _ and
Danforth _ strongly denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, his last year in the Senate before retiring, Danforth
worked with Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., on a commission to shrink
ballooning federal entitlement programs such as Social Security and
Medicare. Kerrey praised him afterward as ``someone who can't be
pushed around.''
</P>
<P>
   Other former Senate colleagues said Wednesday that Danforth will
bring instant credibility to the independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said he has ``an excellent
reputation and the highest integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, called Danforth ``a straight
arrow ... who (will) give people confidence that everything will be
looked at in a completely fair manner.''
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of Reno's tenure, the White House has stood behind
her, but President Clinton has declined to give a similar vote of
confidence to FBI Director Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday that Texas
Rangers have found flares that were apparently fired by federal
officials during the Davidian siege. The newspaper said the Rangers
discovered the expended military illumination flares amid tons of
evidence recovered last Friday from a storage facility near Waco.
Evidence logs showed that the flares were recovered in the weeks
after the Davidian compound burned.

&HT;        BOEING TILT ROTOR TECHNOLOGY TAKES OFF
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ted Monoson   c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 -- A futuristic looking plane-helicopter
aircraft wowed defense officials and Congress members as it flew
over the nation's capital region Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Officials who attended the flight demonstration of the aircraft
known as the V-22, which was in-part developed by Boeing of Ridley
Park, Pa., said it is about to take off in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials say it will have a huge impact on the future
of the military. Secretary of Defense William Cohen and a
contingent of congressmen including Curt Weldon, R-Pa. were
passengers on the flight. The Pentagon used the demonstration to
show off the aircraft that can take off and land like a helicopter
and fly like a turboprop airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology epitomizes what our forces are going to need
in the future,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was developed jointly by Boeing and Bell Helicopter
Textron in Fort Worth, Texas. The team created the V-22 tiltrotor
for the U.S. Marine Corps, Navy and Special Operations Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing handles the fuselage and all subsystems, digital avionics
and fly-by-wire flight control systems. Meanwhile, Bell Helicopter
Textron produces wing, transmissions, empennage, rotor systems and
engine installation. When the aircraft accelerates after the rotors
are shifted from a vertical position to a horizontal position, it
transforms the Osprey from a maneuverable helicopter-like aircraft
to a high-speed, high altitude aircraft that resembles a turboprop
airplane, according to Lance Cpl. Karen Bertrand. At the moment it
changed, the momentum sent water bottles on board flying,
passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed to be real impressed with the Osprey,'' Bertrand
said of the high-ranking passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, who was part of the
congressional contingent aboard the Osprey, confirmed Bertrand's
observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told what the aircraft can do,'' Thornberry said,
``But to experience it first hand is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to the Osprey on a parade ground beside the
Pentagon, Thornberry extolled the benefits of the aircraft for the
military and for the city of Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey will be ideal in situations where soldiers have to be
brought into an area quickly, said, who is a member of the House
Armed Services Committee. He added that conflicts and peace keeping
missions requiring rapid deployments will crop up often in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications for strategy are tremendous,'' Thornberry
said. ``This is clearly the future for all the services.''
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey was accompanied on its brief flight by XV-15, the
initial tilt-rotor aircraft which was built 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not old technology,'' Stinson said. ``What happened
was that the concept was way ahead of the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The V-22, which can carry 24 combat equipped personnel or a
15,000 pound external load, is significantly larger and faster than
XV-15.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the Marine Corps to purchase 360 of the V-22s,
the Air Force to purchase 50 and the Navy to purchase 48, according
to the Department of Defense. The aircraft built for each branch
will be slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   The Wednesday demonstration was also attended by military
officers from several foreign countries, including Poland, Ukraine
and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Defense Department has not yet given Bell
permission to sell the aircraft abroad, Stinson said the company
has already been approached by several foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Most foreign countries will wait until the United States has
used the technology for several years, Stinson added.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gaffney, an assistant defense secretary in the Reagan
administration questioned how many foreign countries will be able
to afford the V-22s, which sell for approximately $30 million
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not be able to afford it,'' Gaffney said. ``But they
will lust after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney, who is currently the president of a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, the Center for Security Policy, said the
V-22's future is in civilian uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an aircraft that can fly like a plane but also
land in midtown Manhattan, that is going to be a huge attraction,''
Gaffney said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bell has already sold a modified version that carries
six to nine passengers for civilian use, Gaffney predicted that
orders will increase significantly after the military has proven
the aircraft's reliability.

 &HT;    National Baptist Convention gathers to elect president
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ It was business as usual _ political power plays,
backstage deals and bickering _ as the nation's largest black
church group gathered here Wednesday to elect a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Politics and religion not only mixed, but seemed inseparable as
candidates for the presidency of the National Baptist Convention
USA Inc. kicked their campaigns into overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The Ice Palace Arena, home for this year's annual national
convention, is sporting all the trappings of a political convention
_ campaign hats, banners and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 50,000 delegates are playing a wait-and-see game as
candidates jockey for position, hoping to capture the leadership of
the organization when the new president is elected late tonight.
The convention _ festive and light, intense and serious _ has been
touched by moments both funny and bizarre since opening Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One presidential candidate brought a baseball bat to a public
forum Tuesday _ he said it was to honor his father who had played
in the Negro baseball league. Several other candidates and their
followers have stayed busy exchanging charges of fraud and
distortion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another candidate, E.V. Hill of Los Angeles, managed to
inject a note of levity, a freudian slip that nonetheless had a
sinister edge.
</P>
<P>
   Hill floored the convention crowd when he accidentally told them
that he had the ``sexual'' experience to lead the convention. He
quickly recovered by saying he had the ``secular'' experience to
become president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most critical election in the last 50 years,'' said
the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, a delegate from New York city and a
former colleague of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This week's session comes seven months after the resignation and
imprisonment of the organization's last president, the Rev. Henry
Lyons. Lyons was convicted on state and federal charges that
included bank fraud, tax evasion and stealing $4 million from
charities and companies trying to do business with the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debacle created by the corruption of Henry Lyons effected
every black church in America, irrespective of denominations,''
Walker said. ``All black churches were scarred by the behavior of
Henry Lyons. That is why it is so critical for this convention to
get a president who has integrity and a vision of where we will go
in the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven candidates are running for the five-year post, but three
_ Hill; the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson of Mount Vernon, N.Y.; and
the Rev. William J. Shaw of Philadelphia, Pa. _ are considered
front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   Both Richardson and Shaw ran against Lyons in 1994, when Lyons
became president. Some delegates insist that race was fixed.
</P>
<P>
   During a forum Tuesday, most of the candidates emphasized the
need for reform. Several said the organization should hire
independent auditors and fiscal officers in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problems today are not the problems of one man's mistake
but of a system,'' Richardson said. ``The presidency of the
National Baptist Convention is an imperialistic institution. The
president is the chief executive officer, the chief operating
officer, he appoints two thirds of the board of directors. That's
too much power for one person.''
</P>
<P>
   Although politics have dominated the first few days of the
convention, there are plenty of other distractions to amuse and
entertain delegates and visitors.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1,000 vendors have turned Tampa's convention center
into a Baptist bazaar. Delegates with enough money and daring can
buy purple suits, alligator shoes, derby hats, jewelry, choir
robes, hair care products and, yes, even Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   The convention center was full of massive, gray-haired preachers
in suspenders, throwing back their heads in laughter as they met
with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like coming to a family reunion,'' said Georgia Tolbert,
a delegate from Detroit. ``When I go to the convention, it's like
seeing what heaven is going to be like. People are going to be
coming from all nations, all tribes to walk on the streets of
gold.''

 &HT;    Viacom, CBS merger in tune with trend
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In merging, Viacom and CBS are following in the
well-ploughed footsteps of media giants such as Disney and Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street and many industry observers have come to view the
big media mergers of the past decade as the natural course of
things.
</P>
<P>
   The mergers, they argue, are part of an evolutionary process
leading to a day in the near future when four to six companies
control most of what the world hears on radio, watches on
television and sees on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger is part of the natural state of things, of the
natural trend of the industry,'' says Tom Wolzien, a media analyst
at Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wolzien believes, the process is nearly complete.
``There isn't much left to buy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the combination of Viacom and CBS will create the
second-largest media company in a deal valued at between $35
billion and $37 billion. It combines the Paramount film studio and
cable TV channels of Viacom with the television network and radio
holdings of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The new combined company knocks Disney back down to No. 3 but
the largest media company will remain Time Warner, which owns
Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The only media asset Time Warner doesn't own in its vast
portfolio is one of the big four television networks. It does own
the fledgling WB network, which caters to young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I compare this latest merger to that of Time Warner and Turner
Broadcasting three years ago,'' says Paul Raymond, a Atlanta-based
media consultant. ``There a lot of synergies between Viacom and
CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   More mergers to come
</P>
<P>
   Raymond and other observers believe the Viacom and CBS merger
will prompt yet another wave of consolidation within the media
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always get a wave of mergers following a big deal like
this,'' says Nick Trigony, president of Atlanta-based Cox
Broadcasting, a unit of diversified media company Cox Enterprises
Inc. Cox also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The last big network unaffiliated with a Hollywood studio is
NBC, owned by General Electric, which has been rumored for years to
be trying to sell it. Indeed, Time Warner Vice Chairman Ted Turner
has tried several times to persuade General Electric to sell the
network to his company.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives declined Wednesday to comment on the
Viacom-CBS merger and its implications for their many news and
entertainment businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Time Warner, others with the motive and the money, such
as Sony and Bertelsman, are foreign companies prohibited from
owning a U.S. Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the mere size of a deal like (CBS and Viacom)
brings people from across the media industry together to talk,''
says Leland Westat Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co.

brings people from across the media industry together to talk,''
says Leland Westerfield, a senior media analyst at PaineWebber.
``But there is nothing compelling about the merger that adds a new
competitive pressure that wasn't already there.''
</P>
<P>
   Westerfield and others doubt that the merger will change the
competitive landscape in local media markets in places such as
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet may be where the impact is felt.
</P>
<P>
   CBS CEO Mel Karmazin has made a number of major purchases lately
in the industry and has said CBS will become a major Internet
player.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the combined Internet assets of Viacom and CBS make the
new company a dominant player in the online distribution of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a company wants to promote, market and sell music online,
it needs to deal with the new Viacom,'' Jordan E. Rohan, an online
media analyst at Wit Capital, told the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Rise of new media kingpin
</P>
<P>
   The Viacom-CBS combination also marks the rise of a new media
kingpin in Karmazin, a New Yorker who began his career as a street
peddler. He rose to become chief executive of CBS, engineering a
turnaround of the television and radio broadcasting company. CBS is
now rated No. 1 among the four big networks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the merger, Karmazin has become heir apparent
to Sumner Redstone, the legendary chairman of Viacom. Under his
reign, Viacom had become the third-largest media company in the
past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin will serve in the new Viacom as Redstone's second in
command, with the title of president and chief operating officer.
All units of the combined company will report to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redstone has put in place the guy who is going to replace
him,'' says Cox Broadcasting's Trigony. Indeed, the two men will
receive identical compensation packages.
</P>
<P>
   Trigony described Karmazin, a friend and colleague for 30 years,
as an executive who focuses on revenue growth. He's also a
proponent of synergy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll enlarge the sales force and have them sell advertising
time across all of the combined companies outlets as a single
buy,'' says Trigony.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good idea, in Wall Street's point of view. ``Wall
Street believes in Karmazin,'' says Trigony.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the stock of both companies initially rose. That's
unusual. The stock of the acquirer, in this case, Viacom, usually
falls in a big merger. But Viacom's stock closed off slightly
Wednesday at $47.31.25. CBS's shares also fell slightly to
$50.1875.

BRADLEY   FIELDS CANDIDACY SOME SEE AS THREAT TO GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Bolstered by his recent surge in New
Hampshire polls, Bill Bradley promised voters ``big things'' and a
leader they can trust Wednesday, as he returned to the roots of his
career and launched the second phase of his quest for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, after waging a preliminary, low-profile effort to cast
himself as Vice President Al Gore's superior in electability and
political vision, moved to exploit those issues, formally
announcing his candidacy amid the nostalgia of the small town that
nurtured his rise to fame in the worlds of basketball and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley subtly struck at Gore's connection to questionable
fund-raising practices in 1996, his steadfast support for President
Clinton amid the White House sex scandal, and the administration's
pursuit of incremental policy changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that by Election Day, we will be choosing between
two people whom we esteem, not the candidate we can still
tolerate,'' Bradley told about 1,000 supporters in front of the
Crystal City High School, where his portrait has hung for decades
in the main hall.
</P>
<P>
   By raising nearly $12 million in the first six months of the
year and pulling into a statistical dead heat with Gore in New
Hampshire polls conducted last week, Bradley has shown the
potential to pose one of the most serious threats yet to an
incumbent vice president seeking the Demcoratic nomination for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bradley continues to trail by a wide margin in national
polls, he is counting on having the money, celebrity, and message
to catch Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel an urgent need to seize this moment in history, to
strengthen the weak and to challenge the strong to lead us into our
full greatness as a nation,'' Bradley told the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the American dream for all of us _ at last,'' he said.
``Come with me. Let us walk toward that dream together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in renewing his pledge to eradicate childhood poverty,
improve the education system, and dramatically expand access to
health-care coverage, continued to resist calls to provide details
of the ``big things'' he envisions and how he would achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mayor of Crystal City, Grant S. Johnston, counted
himself among those awaiting specifics of Bradley's sweeping ideas.
But Johnston, who told the crowd that he was taught in Crystal City
schools about Bradley's legendary commitment to detail and
achievement, said in an interview afterward that he expects Bradley
to elaborate soon on his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to hear more,'' Johnston said. ``But Bill is not
one of those people who just says something and doesn't back it up.
Bill will give us those details, I guarantee you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides said he plans to honor his pledge to fully
describe his agenda this fall. They described his formal
announcement as a forum for intimate personal reflection and a
broader view of how he would change the nation.
</P>
<P>
   On a dank, cloudy day near the banks of the Mississippi River,
Bradley maintained his characteristic reserve as he recounted in a
soft voice his course from Cystal City to basketball stardom at
Princeton University. From the Ivy League, he went to Oxford
University as a Rhodes scholar, won an Olympic gold medal in
basketball, and starred for a decade for the New York Knicks on his
way to the NBA Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Bradely then represented New Jersey in the Senate for 18 years
before returning to private life and planning his bid for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   As some spectators strained to hear him, Bradley credited his
father William, a Republican banker, and his mother Susie, a
grade-school teacher, as well as the Crytal City community for his
success.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many politicians who have romanticized their iddle
American roots, Bradley said the Missouri hamlet of his youth was
``where the world of possibility and hope all began, a world I want
to open for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The values he learned there, he said, would help him ``restore
trust in public service and confidence in our collective will.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley asserted that the public trust has been compromised by
special-interest pressures and campaign-finance abuses, an allusion
to Gore's role in the 1996 fund-raising scandal. And Bradley's vow
to change the system drew one of the loudest cheers of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Bill Bradley, nobody is going to buy him
off,'' said Ed Peterein, a retired construction worker who has
known Bradley's family since he was a child. ``If Bill gets
elected, all the lobbyists can quit and go home and start planting
cotton and tobacco.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Moving to carry out its latest agreement with the
Palestinians, the Israeli government Wednesday approved the
transfer of more West Bank land to Palestinian rule and prepared
for the release of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet vote, followed by an overwhelming endorsement of the
agreement in parliament, cleared the way to start carrying out the
accord before the Jewish New Year, which begins on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The first land handover will put another 7 percent of West Bank
territory _ about 147 square miles _ under Palestinian civil
control; Israel retains security responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The latest agreement, which was signed on Saturday, revived the
Wye River land-for-security accord reached last October.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement calls for Israel to withdraw from a further 11
percent of the West Bank. Together with previous pullbacks, this
will leave the Palestinians in full or partial control of 40
percent of the territory. The pullbacks were halted in December by
Benjamin Netanyahu, then the prime minister, who accused the
Palestinians of failing to keep their security commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet approved the first land transfer by 17 to 1, with
one abstention. Construction Minister Yitzhak Levy of the National
Religious Party, which supports the Jewish settlers in the West
Bank, cast the only nay vote. Interior Minister Natan Sharansky,
whose Russian immigrant party is also sympathetic to the settlers,
abstained.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers have criticized the planned withdrawals, arguing that
they will expose their communities to possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to his right-wing critics, Prime Minister Ehud Barak
asserted that ceding West Bank territory was a difficult step.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are separating from parts of the land that are dear to us
all,'' he told the Cabinet in remarks made public by his office.
``But we are a responsible government, and we must move toward a
permanent settlement and peace agreements throughout the region in
order to consolidate Israel's security and future.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking later in parliament, Barak struck a similar chord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep in our hearts, there is deep pain,'' he said, but he
added, ``In order to insure the future, sovereignty and strength of
Israel, we must make difficult, sometimes painful decisions to
separate peacefully from the Palestinians, to no longer rule over
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, the leader of the opposition Likud party, urged
lawmakers to reject the latest agreement, calling it a
``disgraceful diplomatic failure'' that included new and dangerous
concessions to the Palestinians. But the accord was endorsed by a
wide margin, 54 to 23.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner release will be the first step in carrying out the
accord. Israeli officials said the 200 Palestinians to be freed
first include people who had killed suspected informers or had
wounded Israelis. Their release is a break with longstanding
Israeli practice of not freeing prisoners ``with blood on their
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Barak forged ahead with his agreement, he faced a
threat by the ultra-Orthodox Shas party to bolt his coalition, a
move that would leave him without a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Shas members boycotted Wednesday's votes in the Cabinet and
parliament, demanding that the government approve funds for
Shas-run schools, which are deep in debt. Education Minister Yossi
Sarid, leader of the secular Meretz Party, has withheld the money,
saying Shas must first correct financial mismanagement.

 &HT;    Delta's involuntary bumping rates continue to soar
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines continued to lead the industry in
involuntary passenger bumpings by a wide margin during the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based carrier, embarrassed by a similar ranking last
winter, has vowed improvement. But a spokesman said programs to
correct the problem didn't start in time to be reflected in the
April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting in July we've seen major progress that will be
reflected in the next set of numbers,'' spokesman John Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Delta reported 5,519 involuntary bumpings
_ nearly half the total of 11,908 for all 10 major airlines. Delta
ranked worst in the industry with a rate of 2.07 involuntary
bumpings per 10,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines had the fewest involuntary bumpings, 170, and
the lowest rate, 0.13.
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary bumping occurs when planes are overbooked and some
passengers are forced to wait for later flights.
</P>
<P>
   Most bumpings are voluntary, with passengers agreeing to take
later flights in exchange for credits toward future flights. Delta
reported 45,221 voluntary bumpings in the second quarter. That was
second to American, which had 64,664 voluntary bumpings but only
717 involuntary.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Transportation Department compiles quarterly bumping
figures as part of its Air Travel Consumer Report, with airlines
ranked by their rates of involuntary bumping.
</P>
<P>
   Delta does better in other categories in the DOT report. It was
third in on-time performance for July, sustaining a marked
improvement over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   It usually places among the best three or four airlines in
consumer complaints to the DOT and lost luggage. But Delta's
involuntary bumping rates have soared in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said new computer programs to better manage overbooking
are being installed after several delays. He also said the airline
is trying to do a better job of anticipating overbooked flights
before boarding and offering incentives to generate volunteers.

 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines continued to lead the industry in
involuntary passenger bumpings by a wide margin during the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based carrier, embarrassed by a similar ranking last
winter, has vowed improvement. But a spokesman said programs to
correct the problem didn't start in time to be reflected in the
April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting in July we've seen major progress that will be
reflected in the next set of numbers,'' spokesman John Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, Delta reported 5,519 involuntary bumpings
_ nearly half the total of 11,908 for all 10 major airlines. Delta
ranked worst in the industry with a rate of 2.07 involuntary
bumpings per 10,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines had the fewest involuntary bumpings, 170, and
the lowest rate, 0.13.
</P>
<P>
   Involuntary bumping occurs when planes are overbooked and some
passengers are forced to wait for later flights.
</P>
<P>
   Most bumpings are voluntary, with passengers agreeing to take
later flights in exchange for credits toward future flights. Delta
reported 45,221 voluntary bumpings in the second quarter. That was
second to American, which had 64,664 voluntary bumpings but only
717 involuntary.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Transportation Department compiles quarterly bumping
figures as part of its Air Travel Consumer Report, with airlines
ranked by their rates of involuntary bumping.
</P>
<P>
   Delta does better in other categories in the DOT report. It was
third in on-time performance for July, sustaining a marked
improvement over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   It usually places among the best three or four airlines in
consumer complaints to the DOT and lost luggage. But Delta's
involuntary bumping rates have soared in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said new computer programs to better manage overbooking
are being installed after several delays. He also said the airline
is trying to do a better job of anticipating overbooked flights
before boarding and offering incentives to generate volunteers.

 &HT;    Creating a street life downtown a passion for head of Turner
sports department
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You think you've got a tough commute? Try Janet Marie
Smith's. Her office is in Atlanta, her home is in Baltimore, she
flies coach (with occasional frequent-flier upgrades to first
class) and her door-to-door time is three hours.
</P>
<P>
   That's the easy part. Fridays through Mondays in Baltimore Smith
raises three children under age 6 (who spent much of their prenatal
lives in flight over the Eastern seaboard), picks one of them up
from school, works out of her home via phone and e-mail, and with
luck gets reacquainted with husband Bart Harvey, a businessman who
builds homes for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesdays through Thursdays, Smith is at her CNN Center desk as
president of Turner Sports &AMP; Entertainment Development. She reached
the post after getting raves for turning ballparks _ Baltimore's
Camden Yards and Atlanta's Turner Field _ into veritable funtowns
with enough bars, restaurants and touches of traditional charm to
entice even the most casual baseball fan, spouse and child.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's current duties include redesigning the CNN Center and
overseeing construction of the $213 million Philips Arena, which is
due to be unveiled in 10 days to a curious universe. That and
taking flak in the local and national press for the gargantuan
``Big Ted'' billboard whose design she supervised. In a moment,
Smith will have more to say about this so-called ``abomination,''
which will loom over Centennial Olympic Park and shout the praises
of the arena's ``PHILIPS'' sponsor in the same subtle way that,
say, Russian leaders' faces presided over Red Square.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the 42-year-old native of Jackson, Miss., is giving a
bottle of Tabasco a good hard shake over a bowl of Oriental-style
chicken salad. Pretty in a willowy way, with light blue eyes and
brown hair so fine that it wafts around her ears, Smith is
conveying two key ideas about herself.
</P>
<P>
   First, on the rigors of the long-distance commute: ``I'm
uncomfortable with being held up as a superwoman _ it's the people
at either end of my spectrum who deserve the credit: my husband,
our deep bench of baby sitters, the Turner folks who carry the ball
for me,'' says Smith. ``The median age of Bart and me was
40-something when we married, so we're used to being on our own,
and he's very committed to his work in Baltimore. It's hard to say
how my kids will feel about it when they're older, but for now
they're easy with it. There's no confusion about who's Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   And second, on her job: ``I don't think of my work the past 10
years as being about sports so much as being about cities,'' she
declares. ``Sports are the avenue to something bigger _ this love I
have for America's cities. I'm passionate about the Philips because
it will be great for bringing street life to downtown Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what? Can this be the same person who masterminded the
55-by-150-foot billboard, with its electronic bulletin board of
video screen, clock, CNN logo and news ``zipper''? How does Smith
reconcile her urbanist soul with the seemingly soulless ``Big
Ted''?
</P>
<P>
   The more you talk to Smith and look at her work _ the way
``Eutaw Street,'' her food-retail-entertainment row at Camden
Yards, nuzzles comfortably between the ballpark and old warehouses
_ the more she appears sincere about her respect for urban
tradition. She says she'll continue to walk the walk, so to speak,
with Hawk Walk, a similar re-creation of a bustling city street
that she mapped out under the Philips roof.
</P>
<P>
   As Smith leads a hard-hat tour of the arena, which is nearing
completion, another surprisingly urban feature pops up: 96 private
suites filling an entire vertical wall, resembling the side of an
apartment building. The all-in-one-wall idea wasn't Smith's _ it
came from Stan Kasten, her boss _ but Smith can't stop talking
about how much she loves the innovation. It allows Hawk Walk to
come smack against the opposite wall of the arena, and the upper
deck of general seating to be low enough that, Smith says, ``the
worst seat in the house is closer to the action than it was in
Omni, even though there's 4,000 more seats: 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply,'' Smith says, proudly opening her arms, ``a
better place for Joe Fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Joe Fan gets a clear view of all the corporate execs and
guests lounging in their motorized chairs in their suites. In this
age of see-and-be-seen and unapologetic wealth, the audience
becomes part of the show, as in a turn-of-the-century opera house.
In this age of convergence, urban renewal means sports fans can be
converted into entertainment fans who are also eaters, drinkers and
shoppers, coaxed into a new ``downtown'' as attractive to the
cappuccino-sipping non-sports fan as the basketball purist with a
frank in his fist.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps no one understands all these connections better than
Smith, whose notion of sports facility as a multi-pleasure dome is
the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a single team in the country that doesn't want
Janet's services at some point,'' says Kasten, Braves and Hawks
president and chairman of Philips Arena. ``And she works so hard
that she was practically in labor before we could get her to slow
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith herself is a kind of convergence: a blend of talents in a
job of her own invention.
</P>
<P>
   She's the daughter of a medical-records technician mother and an
architect father who ``always had a game on the radio. My dad
idolized Joe DiMaggio.'' The elder Smith stopped at unexpected
moments to walk around a new building, ``And I can still remember
sitting in that hot car thinking, `I'll never be an architect,'''
the daughter recalls with a rueful smile.
</P>
<P>
   Drive and charm
</P>
<P>
   Though she holds a master's degree in urban planning from City
College of New York and pulls down an estimated $200,000 per year,
Smith can still stretch vowels in a down-home way. She sounds like
a true good ol' girl when male execs greet her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks good, dunnit?'' she drawls, as cool as if the Philips
opening were a year away. (In fact, the first ticketed event, a
Thrashers exhibition, is Sept. 18).
</P>
<P>
   The blend of hard-headed drive and Southern charm began to
emerge in New York in the early '80s, when Amanda Burden, now a
member of the board New York City Planning Commission, hired Smith
to assist her on building Battery City Park. Burden used to arrive
at her office at 8:30 a.m to find the young Mississippian had
already been on the construction site for over an hour _ even
though she was studying for her master's degree at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Marie asked a crew to pour a concrete sidewalk five
times, until they got it right,'' says Burden. ``The fact that she
looked great in 3-inch heels didn't hurt.'' ``I always knew I
didn't want to just make drawings of buildings, but I didn't know
there could be a job like I have now,'' Smith says. ``Luckily there
were those along the way who were willing to hear this long-winded,
disconnected description of what I wanted to do ... putting the
pieces together to create spaces full of energy, where people want
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime fan of the then-hapless Braves, Smith was curious
to see the one team that was contending to lose more games in 1988:
the Baltimore Orioles. Sitting in the Birds' old Memorial Stadium,
``I got to thinking: How can I make going to a stadium a wonderful
experience even if your team loses? The newer stadiums then were
concrete shells marooned in the suburbs. When I heard the Orioles
were building their new one downtown, I said, `That's for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lucchino, then part owner of the Birds, recalls, ``The
first question that I asked Janet was, `Which league uses the
designated hitter?' and she shot back, `Are you kidding? How can
you ask a question like that!' She never did answer _ it could have
been a grand bluff! But she had so much spunk, I hired her.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucchino cites ``a million details'' in Smith's Camden Yards
triumph, including her discovery of an 1891 Orioles logo that
became a park motif.
</P>
<P>
   Cool leader or good soldier?
</P>
<P>
   Which, again, doesn't sound like the person who'd erect the
high-tech ``Big Ted.'' Could it be that Philips, which is paying
close to $200 million over 20 years for its arena sponsorship,
threw its weight around and demanded such a billboard _ and Smith
is taking the heat for her Turner bosses?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding? Heat is my middle name!'' barks Kasten.
``Janet can be a good soldier, but that's not the case here. She
believes in that design, and she's very, very disappointed that a
few assassins in the media are presenting it unfairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she's teed off at the criticism, Smith takes a long
pause and says, ``I was irritated. No one took time to understand
it in context. The alternative would be for people to look at a
parking garage! I'd hoped that Turner would get credit for spending
some money it didn't have to spend, putting some street life out
there. Instead, people took an easy potshot at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to clarify what ``it'' is, Smith refuses to say
``billboard'' or ``sign'' and instead keeps repeating, ``the retail
building,'' meaning the low shedlike structure to which the
billboard is attached. This little building will be ready for shops
and an indoor-outdoor cafe by the end of the year, and will indeed
serve street life. But of course that's not what people are irked
about. For Smith to keep referring to the shed and huge sign
collectively as ``the retail building'' is like saying ``trunk''
and trying to pretend there's no elephant. By making it sound as if
the billboard critics are also against street improvements, Smith
seems like a spinmeister, and not a very deft one at that.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the building's awning-covered entrances and
tree-studded plaza do look better in her architect's original
drawings than the somewhat misleading rendering that she supplied
the Journal-Constitution, which made the sign appear to rise out of
an empty sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who bunks in a hotel suite overlooking Centennial Park on
her Atlanta nights, sees herself as helping a bad urban situation _
with a billboard that will present event information _ not wrecking
a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park is so beautiful, and there's nobody in it,'' Smith
says with a note of regret. ``We're trying to change that, letting
people know that there are all these wonderful events happening in
the park and close by.''
</P>
<P>
   She's still as cool as the polished granite floor tiles being
installed in the CNN Center. Does anything rattle Smith?
</P>
<P>
   ``I once rode in car with Joe DiMaggio,'' she says with a laugh.
``I was so overwhelmed, after the way my dad used to talk about
him, that I couldn't think of one single thing to say.''

BANK OF ENGLAND RAISES RATES IN A STEP AGAINST INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bank of England raised interest rates in the United
Kingdom &UR;  &LR; Wednesday, as the maverick nation that bowed out of a
unified Europe isolated itself further in setting a stiff course
for its monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of the US Federal Reserve Bank, Britain's
central bank raised a key interest rate from 5 percent to 5.25
percent, the first of what economists predicted would be a series
of rate hikes aimed at reducing the heat in an economy that has
started to boil. The surprise move, the first for the Bank of
England in more than a year, was meant to nip the threat of
inflation in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   But across the English Channel, the rest of Europe has been
extremely sluggish. There's little sentiment for higher rates
within the European Central Bank, which was established to set
monetary policy for a unified Europe. Such an action, economists
say, would stall growth just as the continent's economy showed the
first signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly true the UK has more monetary independence,''
said Nariman Behravesh, an international economist Standard &AMP;
Poor's DRI. The Bank of England's move ``is an indication of that
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate hike is a reaction, he said, to strong data coming out
of the British economy, including a gangbusters housing market and
strong consumer confidence and retail sales. Also industrial
production in July grew at annual rate of nearly 4 percent.
``That's pretty strong,'' Behravesh said, explaining the Bank of
England's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, like the US Federal Reserve, is seeking to undo a
series of rate reductions prompted last year by an unraveling world
economy that bounced back more quickly than was expected.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Fed's Open Market Committee voted to cut rates
three times last fall, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy
Committee in a similar time frame reduced rates seven times to
protect an economy viewed as more vulnerable than the robust US
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the United States, Britain kept going. Its annual
inflation rate is now running about 2.2 percent, and its jobless
rate, at 6 percent, is one of the lowest in Europe. Inflation on
the continent is running at a much tamer 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions look more threatening on the inflation front in UK
than they do anywhere else in the world, including the US,'' said
Bruce Kasman, chief international economist for J.P. Morgan in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the Bank of England has moved today, and it's
probably why you'll see more rate hikes coming from Bank of England
than from any other central bank,'' said Kasman, who recently
relocated from London.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England in a statement to explain Wednesday's rate
increase said it had considered both the housing and labor markets
in making its decision to raise the base rate by a quarter-point.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rise in interest rates was necessary to keep inflation on
track further ahead,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   British businesses doubted the wisdom of the bank's move. ``This
decision threatens to put a still tentative recovery into
reverse,'' said Ian Peters, an official of the British Chambers of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that kind of thinking has led global economists to
predict that any rate increases by the European Central Bank may be
months away.
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of Europe follows, American investors may see their
already unimpressive returns on European mutual funds continue to
drag. And US tourists who have enjoyed a long period of extremely
weak currencies in Europe might also start paying more for hotels
and meals across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that may be months away, economists said. Across Europe,
first-quarter growth across hasn't recovered to the levels
experienced in early 1998, before Asia's currency crises began.
Economic growth in Germany and France, the biggest economies, are
weak though production has increased. Germany's growth, based on a
sluggish second quarter, would be only 1 percent this year,
compared with modest 2 percent growth for the region overall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a ``pattern of improvement'' in the Continent's economic
indicators, Kasman said, a rate hike by the European Central Bank
``stands a little ways away, possibly toward the end of the first
quarter of next year.''

CONCERTS TO INTRODUCE   HUMANITARIAN WEB SITE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn; N.J., England, Switzerland)   By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three all-star pop stadium concerts on Oct. 9 _ in New Jersey,
England and Switzerland _ are to introduce Netaid.org, a Web site
that seeks to end poverty by bringing together relief organizations
with donors and volunteers. In a news conference Wednesday, Bono of
U2 described Netaid as ``the Yellow Pages of aid in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerts, produced by the people who assembled the Ethiopian
famine-relief benefit Live Aid in the 1980s, are to take place at
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.; Wembley Stadium outside
London, and the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   At Giants Stadium, the performers are to include Puff Daddy,
Celine Dion, Sting, the Algerian singer Cheb Mami, Mary J. Blige,
Busta Rhymes, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Counting Crows, Jon Bon
Jovi and the Italian rock singer Zucchero. Wyclef Jean of the
Fugees and Bono are to perform a song they wrote in honor of
Netaid, ``New Day.'' Giants Stadium tickets go on sale Friday
through Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   At Wembley the lineup includes David Bowie, Bryan Adams, Bush,
the Coors, George Michaels, Robbie Williams and the reunited
Eurythymics. A private concert in Geneva, where many of the relief
organizations have headquarters, is to feature Bryan Ferry, Des'ree
and the Scottish group Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel and Sheryl Crow have both agreed to perform, but their
location has not been decided. The concerts are to be televised on
VH1, MTV and, in Britain, on the BBC. Radio stations will carry the
events to 60 countries, and there will be an Internet Webcast.
</P>
<P>
   The concerts are not primarily for fund-raising, although the
immediate proceeds will be dedicated to aid refugees in Kosovo and
for relief work in Africa. Donations from listeners will be
directed to the Netaid Foundation, which will distribute
contributions under the direction of the United Nations Development
Program, its antipoverty agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the main purpose of the events is to draw worldwide
attention to Netaid, a novel alliance of the United Nations,
Internet entrepreneurs and musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about a billion hits against poverty, and we want to
punch that sucker out,'' Quincy Jones, the musician and producer,
said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Netaid will provide information and eventually direct
connections for people working on projects as diverse as
environmental problems, disaster relief or lobbying to cancel the
international debts of the 52 poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is for it to become the largest portal and directory
for antipoverty organizations in the world,'' said Bob Chlopak, a
spokesman for Netaid. After the concerts, the site will be overseen
by the U.N. Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, the networking company that has built the Web
site and donated $10 million to the Netaid Foundation, announced
that Netaid was 10 times larger than any other Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the United Nations,
appeared at the news conference. By satellite, President Clinton
and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain activated the Web site in
North America and Europe. Nelson Mandela, the former president of
South Africa, also appeared by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Internet reaches more and more communities,'' Mandela
said, ``they will gain access to new information and resources they
can use to uplift themselves.''

CAPTAIN MAC AT THE HELM OF US DAVIS CUP TENNIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Were those seismic rumbles you may have heard
Wednesday morning the aftershock of Dwight Davis (1879-1945) doing
situps in his tomb?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Davis Cup patriarch got the word via celestial fax
that John Patrick McEnroe Jr. _ the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of
tennis _ has been named United States captain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900 Davis, the epitome of gentlemanly bearing and
sportsmanship, donated the Cup that 129 countries pursued this
year, and was the initial US captain as well as a player. He could
no more have imagined McEnroe, a one-man conflagration in short
pants, as his 36th successor than, say, a contemporary, Jack the
Ripper.
</P>
<P>
   Davis sent the Cup into circulation in the hope of advancing
international good will. That has not quite been McEnroe's
strongest point, although he may have broken down the will of a
goodly number of umpires in more countries than any other man.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is 1999, and his first captaincy will be a century
up the road from Davis's, in a culture far different. Despite all
previous acts as a walking (and running) international incident,
Mac's time has surely arrived to lead the US out of a Cup mire.
Like that earlier headstrong and patriotic Mac, General Douglas
(``I shall return!'') MacArthur, he has reappeared to direct
campaigns on his old battleground, to turn around four years of
losing.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe at 40 deserves this shot. It's his to fly or flop with.
</P>
<P>
   After years of yearning for it, seven years beyond his fifth and
last Cup-lifting triumph, a doubles cameo, Mac is back on the
scene, and in charge.
</P>
<P>
   It took a longshot lady to rescue this longshot captain from a
limbo in which he chafed. Julia Levering, the lone female president
of the not particularly progressive US Tennis Association in its
119 years, made the decision to fire six-year pilot Tom Gullikson
and install McEnroe, considered too hot to handle by her male
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady showed some guts,'' says McEnroe, and he's right.
</P>
<P>
   But boil it down to this: Gullikson couldn't persuade the
world's two best, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, to do singles for
him at the same time. So Gullikson actually fell in Boston two
months ago, the 4-1 quarterfinal defeat by Australia. Then, for
whatever reason, Sampras's refusal to play singles or the coolness
toward the idea of teammates Todd Martin and Jim Courier, Gully was
cooked. McEnroe would have had to wait longer if the US had beaten
Australia and gone on to the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right time for John. He's the best person for
this. A passionate, outspoken advocate of Davis Cup,'' says
Levering, who had talked it over with the players _ a first for a
USTA boss.
</P>
<P>
   Levering may be taking a chance in believing McEnroe has matured
sufficiently to handle this sporting ambassasdor role. She's
gambling that the divinely performing but demonically behaving
Cupster has reformed enough to sit coolly in the captain's chair.
If she wins the gamble, Levering ought to consider commuting to Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe admits, ``I have a 10-15 percent dark side lurking, and
I make mistakes. But I'm working on it. I feel I can be intense,
and an ambassador, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would one of my captains, Arthur Ashe, say to me today?''
McEnroe smiles. ``Calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   Deportment aside, this is the leading question: Can McEnroe
deliver Agassi and Sampras to the lineup, thus guiding the US to
contention for two or three Cups?
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, yes. Andre's enthusiastic. ``He'll be the best captain
yet. Now all we need is to get Sampras on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete, who has said he would not play for McEnroe, is currently
noncommittal. His coy statement: ``It's something John's wanted for
a long time . . . he'll do a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, often knocking Sampras's avoidance of the team, says,
``I just can't understand anyone who wouldn't want to play for his
country.'' Mac always did as one of the most illustrious to show up
for the USA: 12 years, five Cups; 41-8 in singles, 18-2 in doubles.
``Pete said he loved me after we won the doubles and beat
Switzerland in the 1992 final. I hope he still does. We'll talk in
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The salary is to be about $100,000, but Mac concurs with Todd
Martin's belief that the players (getting a minumum of $50,000 per
engagement) shouldn't be paid for patriotic duty. ``Maybe I'll have
to set an example by being a dollar-a-year man.'' Excellent idea.
</P>
<P>
   Hyper, very bright and imaginative, complex, erratic, insisting
he's mellowed as the father of six, McEnroe has a new baby-sitting
job here. Davis Cup captains have seldom been controversial, but
that changes now. Will he be Calamity John, shooting from the hip
and lip too often? Or Johnny Appleseed, spreading the seeds of good
cheer and wisdom?
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Davis, who served a stint as Secretary of War under
President Coolidge, might be wary of McEnroe on the international
scene. But China isn't in the World Group with his Americans, and
the US could probably handle any other war he might start.
</P>
<P>
   It will be intriguing. Fasten your seat belts. Captain Mac is
the new boy in the cockpit.

HIGH-YIELD LEAF HURTS ANTI-DRUG EFFORT IN COLOMBIA 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ In an alarming trend that could mean a sharp
increase in the world's supply of Colombian cocaine, drug dealers
and peasant farmers have started growing a more potent variety of
coca plant, according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The new species of coca, the raw material for cocaine, contains
higher levels of cocaine alkaloid than the coca traditionally
cultivated in Colombia. What's more, nearly all of the new coca
bushes are located in southern Putumayo state, a guerrilla-infested
region that is out of reach of Colombian police cropdusters that
target the coca crop.
</P>
<P>
   The new coca species is common throughout Peru and Bolivia and
was introduced to Colombia a few years ago, the officials said.
``As this new coca reaches maturity, Colombia's potential cocaine
production may significantly increase, from 165 metric tons in 1998
to between 195 and 250 metric tons in 1999,'' the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to look like a big, ugly jump,'' added a U.S.
official who monitors Colombia. ``The word we use is `skyrocket.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Colombia produced about 80 percent of the cocaine
that entered the United States, according to U.S. government
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Bogota officials point out that actual cocaine exports from
Colombia this year will be smaller than the DEA estimates on
potential production because those figures do not take into account
police raids against drug laboratories and narcotics seizures. But
the Colombians too are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share these worries,'' said Col. Leonardo Gallego, who
heads Colombia's anti-narcotics police unit. ``The
narco-trafficking networks have access to a variety of coca that
will give them higher yields on smaller plots of land. That makes
detection and eradication more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Following government crackdowns in Peru and Bolivia, drug
dealers transferred part of their coca-growing operations to
Colombia in the early 1990s. Due to the poor soil quality in
Colombia's southern jungles, farmers favored a variety of plant
known as ``e. coca ipadu,'' or simply ``ipadu.''
</P>
<P>
   A rustic species that can be grown from tree cuttings planted
directly in the ground, ``ipadu'' bushes produce their first leaves
within 16 months and can be harvested up to four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first coca farmers and the narco-traffickers promoted this
type of coca because it is so easy to manage,'' said Luis Eduardo
Parra, a Colombian agronomist closely involved in police fumigation
program.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1995, the U.S.-backed aerial eradication program
carried out by the Colombian police has wiped out thousands of
acres of coca in Guaviare, Meta and Caqueta states. To escape the
air raids, coca farmers have pushed deeper into the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are growing about 86,000 acres of coca on vast
plantations in Putumayo, according to Colombian estimates. Richer
soils and higher altitudes in Putumayo, a remote state located on
the Ecuadorean border, have allowed farmers to cultivate a variety
known as ``e. coca coca.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this species requires seedbeds and constant care in the
initial stages, the mature trees live longer and produce more
foliage than ``ipadu.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the leaves are larger and contain between 0.7 and
0.85 percent cocaine alkaloid by weight compared to about 0.5
percent for ipadu leaves, according to Parra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putumayo is the new frontier and it's almost all e. coca
coca,'' Parra said. ``Will that mean more cocaine? Yes.``
</P>
<P>
   The conversion rate of coca leaf to powder cocaine depends on
the efficiency of clandestine drug laboratories that use a variety
of chemicals in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion rate for Colombian labs was unavailable. But in
Bolivia, Parra said that an acre of ``ipadu'' produces about 5.7
pounds of cocaine while an acre of ``e. coca coca'' produces about
6.4 pounds of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Planting the new species appears to be another way for
traffickers to stay one step ahead of authorities in the ongoing
drug war.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Colombia in July, U.S. drug czar Barry
McCaffrey warned that the new coca leaf could help drug lords
recover from Colombia's aggressive aerial fumigation program. Since
1996, police pilots have sprayed about 380,000 acres of coca.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a higher content plant, we may erase the gains of
the last three years in the coming year,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the police hope to start fumigating in Putumayo in the
coming months, for now, they lack spray planes, support helicopters
and other facilities to cover the region.
</P>
<P>
   The area is also a haven for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, the nation's largest rebel group known as the FARC. The
organization earns millions of dollars annually by providing
protection for drug traffickers and coca farmers.
</P>
<P>
   FARC rebels have shot down low-flying crop dusters and support
aircraft, killing dozens of Colombian pilots as well as three U.S.
civilian flyers contracted by the State Department. In July, a U.S.
reconnaissance plane on an anti-drug mission crashed in the
mountains of Putumayo, killing the five U.S. soldiers and two
Colombians aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is receiving about $289 million in U.S. aid for the
police and military this year and has requested another $500
million for next year. But critics say that the aerial spraying
program has failed to reduce drug production levels in Colombia
because coca farmers simply move on and plant more.

COMMENTARY: WELCOME TO `KREMLINGATE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Surprise, surprise: corruption has been rampant in
the Kremlin.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swiss investigators are finding funny money in secret bank
accounts of President Yeltsin's personal and official family
members. In the United States, the Bank of New York is being forced
to explain the laundering of billions ripped off by favored
oligarchs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago,'' says Grigory Yavlinsky, the reformist leader
who has long been blowing an unheeded whistle on the grandest
larceny of the century, ``you could have asked any little child in
the smallest village in Siberia about this, and he would have told
you all about the criminal conspiracies. Why is it news today?
Because of your elections and ours.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, with its hundreds of
junketeering bureaucrats, treated the corruption as a mere bump on
the road to a market economy. Vice President Al Gore even famously
scrawled a barnyard epithet across a CIA memo warning of the
diversion of foreign aid into the pockets of Yeltsin's clique. (Why
doesn't Al enliven his speeches with such colorful expressions?)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As 2000 approaches, the time ripens for exposure of the blind
eye Gore turned to ``Kremlingate.'' We Republicans smack our lips
here in the run-ups to our primaries, and the would-be successors
to Yeltsin rub their hands before elections to their Parliament
this December and their White House next June.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russia's second contested national election is similar in some
ways to our own tumultuous contest in 1800, when the established
Federalists John Adams and Alexander Hamilton fell out and deals
were made in Congress to help the anti-Federalist Thomas Jefferson
squeak in.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Russian politics, three main forces are also taking shape: On
the left is the Communist Party, its members aging and dying, its
Stalinists and Agrarians splintering off. Though it holds nearly
half the Duma seats now, that could drop to below a third in
December's elections.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the sinister center is the front-running team of the old
spymaster Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov. They
have the main money men and the media moguls behind them. Cozy
corruption would most likely continue in this ``Yevgeny and Yuri
Show.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the right is Yabloko, the democratic party headed by
Yavlinsky, the only reformer not to have been suckered and dumped
by Yeltsin. He's just been joined by Sergei Stepashin, also 47, one
of the revolving-door prime ministers; this cop expands the party
base by bringing along not-nutty nationalists. Yavlinsky insists
he's clean, and should help Yabloko in its goal of doubling its
strength to a fifth of the Duma seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's also an Inconsequential Right, ranging from the grumpy
economist Yegor Gaidar to the attractive young reformer Boris
Nemtsov to Yeltsin's cunning Anatoly Chubais. But this segment even
trails the sidelined Gen. Aleksandr Lebed and the wild Vladimir
Zhirinovsky.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond corruption, political Russians have to deal with a wild
card: the war in Dagestan. Even reformers who condemned the war in
Chechnya are calling for Russian action to repel the Islamic
fundamentalist invaders said to be helped by the terrorist
financier Osama bin Laden. Wars create unexpected heroes and
scapegoats and will affect the Russian elections. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What should America do to advance the cause of freedom in the
coming Russian elections? Should we pull our investigative punch
into Kremlingate lest ordinary Russians think we are abusing them
when their country is down ? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We should butt out of their politics. We have shown we do more
harm than good to genuine reform. At the same time, we should butt
into their predators' thievery _ following every lead to help
Russia recover funds spirited out by corrupt officials and Western
co-conspirators.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If it embarrasses President Clinton and Yeltsin, or if it means
we must wait six months for Communists to be replaced in the Duma
so that Russia can ratify our arms limitation treaty, so be it.
Both countries will be in business under new management in 18
months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky's advice on what America should do: ``Relax. You are
still looking for partnerships with people who may be shown to be
corrupt. Please _ just relax.''
</P>
<P>

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ Lloyd Carr would love to stand by his man. The
only problem facing the Michigan coach one game into yet another
season of high hopes and great expectations is which one?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Brady or Drew Henson? The question is as annoying as it is
incessant in and around Ann Arbor these days.
</P>
<P>
   It dominated the spring. It was all the rage in summer camp, and
it only intensified in the week leading up to the opener against
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Even a dramatic 26-22 win over the Fighting Irish failed to
provide an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how it goes,'' Carr said as he looked ahead to this
week's game against Rice. ``I like 'em both.''
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, Carr would like one of his quarterbacks just
a little bit more. Instead, what in some ways is an ideal situation
shapes up as a weekly headache for a coach and program with a Big
Ten championship _ and perhaps more _ on the '99 agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the Notre Dame game, Carr got
downright cranky when the talk turned to the quarterback spot, as
it often did. This week, his tone seems more resigned than
combative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most coaches like to go with one guy,'' he said. ``Sometimes
situations warrant that you do other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to let this thing play itself out. They may dictate
what I do. They probably will dictate what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady made the stronger case in Game 1. The fifth-year senior
started and finished, completing 17 of 24 passes for 197 yards and
leading the Wolverines to the game-winning touchdown in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that final drive, he played with poise like the senior that
he is,'' Carr said.
</P>
<P>
   But Henson, the highly regarded sophomore, had his moments, too.
Playing the second quarter, he completed three of eight passes for
40 yards and presided over a drive that produced a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henson showed you a little bit of why he's capable of being a
great quarterback,'' Carr said. ``He's a guy who can make a lot of
plays. He gets better every day.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching them split time for 30 minutes, Carr went with
Brady to start the third quarter, and the senior played well enough
to stay in the game. He'll get the start again Saturday when the
Owls visit The Big House, but Henson once again is scheduled for a
second-quarter audition that could lead to a longer stay.
</P>
<P>
   Intense? You bet, Brady says.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, he insists the competition between The Veteran
and The Next Great Thing has remained amicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very good relationship,'' Brady said. ``I respect
Drew immensely. He's young, and people have such high expectations
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just football people, either. Henson, a third-round draft
choice of the New York Yankees, received a $2 million signing bonus
from George Steinbrenner as part of a five-year contract. If
Michigan fans envision Henson as their next All-America
quarterback, Steinbrenner sees him instead as a future All-Star
third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   For Carr, that's part of the problem. With an attractive option,
a frustrated or unhappy Henson might decide to hang up his shoulder
pads for good. Should that prove to be the case, Michigan could go
from two good alternatives to none by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People try to tear this team apart, and that's not what we
need,'' Brady said. ``We're going to need Drew this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to go on next week, and I'm not
concerned about what's going to go on next week. I'm going to go
out and prepare for Rice like I'm the starter, and Drew's going to
do the same, and (third-teamer) Jason Kapsner is going to do the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Carr and his staff try to balance the present,
the immediate future and the long term at a school where last
year's 10-3 finish is considered a near-disaster and 1997's
national co-championship is ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Hope the matter resolves itself as painlessly as possible, Carr
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both handled a difficult situation,'' he said. ``These
guys are 21, 22 years old, and every time they turned around they'd
get questioned. They handled it all with tremendous poise and
class, and I appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd competed and performed to a point where I didn't think
it was fair to start one guy and not play the other. I could have
made one guy happy, but it wouldn't have been right not to play the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how close it was.''
</P>
<P>
   And still is, for the moment at least.
</P>
<P>
   Round 2 comes Saturday. At Michigan Stadium, the jury of 111,000
reconvenes to continue the debate.

<P>
   CALCUTTA, India _ This great and grotesque city has been called
many things, some of them not so nice. To Kipling, Calcutta was
``the city of dreadful night.'' And while such a literary moniker
may have seemed acceptably poetic to Calcutta's storied
intellectuals, there is one name they will no longer tolerate.
Calcutta is never again to be called Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   A determined clique of the intelligentsia recently proposed that
the city henceforth be known in English as Kolkata, which is how
the name is pronounced in the Bengali language. In July, the West
Bengal state assembly unanimously agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our city is pronounced in two ways, and I prefer it to be one,
and if it is one, why not in the language of the local
population?'' said Badhan Das, a well-known sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   To many, this may all seem so much silly and unnecessary
tampering, the way some Dutch undoubtedly regard the changing of
New Amsterdam to New York.
</P>
<P>
   But in India, the changing of various municipal names has become
a matter of post-colonial pride. A current map, if made here, will
have Mumbai but not Bombay, Chennai but not Madras, Kochi but not
Cochin, Thiruvananthapuram but not Trivandrum. The new names are
slowly overtaking the old in common usage.
</P>
<P>
   India, far more than America, is an amalgam. Its billion people
speak in 17 major languages and more than 22,000 distinct dialects.
Many here resent the ever-creeping influence of English, the mother
tongue of British imperialists and satellite television, and Hindi,
the language of the big shots in New Delhi and most of the Indian
cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Bengalis argue that the name Calcutta was certainly none of
their ancestors' doing. While its origin is a matter of some
dispute, it was most likely coined by marble-mouthed English
overlords who could not get their tongues around Kolikata, the name
of a village near where the British laid anchor 300 years ago in a
malarial swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its derivation, Calcutta has become one of the world's
most evocative of names, a three-syllable conjurer of images that
takes the mind by hand-pulled rickshaw from glorious white-columned
country clubs into the path of wretched one-legged beggars.
</P>
<P>
   To Bengali intellectuals, of course, the city is so much more
than that. Indeed, to them, Calcutta has the wondrous and unrivaled
virtue of being home to the Bengali intellectual himself _ by
culture and self-assessment a person of superior brainpower and
spirit, adept at debating all the isms and wasms of political
thought. He is the Indian who effortlessly quotes Marx and Marcuse
and McLuhan, all the while sipping coffee and scribbling poems on a
paper napkin. And he has yet to tire of sharing credit for the
Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to the Bengali poet Rabindranath
Tagore in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Bengalis have set the standard in all the arts,'' said
Sunil Gangopadhyay, an admired poet and novelist. ``We are an
emotional people. We love to create and we love to talk. Some would
say we talk too much. Whenever two or three people get together,
they stop all work and begin talking for hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddhadey Bhattacharya, a playwright and the home minister for
the state's Communist government, is similarly boastful.
``Intellectually, I humbly proclaim we are more advanced than
anyone else,'' he said, smoking imported cigarettes, with a
portrait of Lenin hanging behind him. ``We discuss the great
questions: What is postmodernism? What does Noam Chomsky have to
say about this or that?''
</P>
<P>
   To the Bengali intellectual's ear, however, too little of the
city's incessant talk is now being done in the mellifluous,
cultured Bengali language. So many outsiders have poured into
Calcutta in recent decades that only half of its 11 million
citizens are Bengali. Most advertisements and store names are
written in those two interloping tongues, English and Hindi.
</P>
<P>
   Gangopadhyay, who writes in Bengali, heads a movement that wants
to hold down this linguistic trespassing. The city's name change is
just an opening gesture. They also demand that Bengali be made a
mandatory subject in elementary schools, that television stations
broadcast more shows in the language, that every worker who serves
the public _ from bureaucrats to shopkeepers _ speak some
as-yet-unspecified minimum of phrases.
</P>
<P>
   To some here, Bengalis and non-Bengalis among them, this
business of changing names seems born less from affection for a
language and more from resistance to the handwriting on the wall:
that the Bengali is on the down slope in his own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This come from fear of marginalization,'' said Chittabaram
Panda, the curator at Victoria Memorial Hall museum. ``Calcutta or
Kolkata, who cares? Bengalis are trying to recover with symbols
what they have lost in so many other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to be said that what Bengalis think today, the rest of
India will think tomorrow. But that adage has long been passe. The
names of Bengali authors no longer sit on the tip of the Indian
tongue _ and Bengali political thought is widely seen as something
to be denigrated rather than emulated. After 22 years of Communist
rule, the state has pursued a utopia for its workers only to end up
frightening off the employers who hire them.
</P>
<P>
   Marwari businessmen, with roots in the state of Rajasthan,
dominate commerce here. And they, and others, frequently regard the
Bengali worker as someone who likes to come in late, go home early
and devote the hours in between to extraneous chatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are 10 Bengalis, there will be 11 opinions,'' said
B.G. Gupta, a retired bureaucrat originally from Uttar Pradesh.
``The Bengali may have no food on the table, but he's off arguing
somewhere about the Vietnam War or the last book he has read or
whether it is a good idea to change every signboard in the city
from Calcutta to Kolkata.''
</P>
<P>
   The official change of the name still awaits approval from the
Indian government's Home Ministry. A second planned alteration,
changing the state's name from West Bengal to Bangla, will require
a vote by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon, I assure you, we will be Kolkata, and this will be how
the world will know us,'' Bhattacharya said. ``It is what we want
and it is inevitable. These days, does anyone have the guts to say
Peking instead of Beijing?''

 &HT;    Bradley brings campaign home to proud supporters in Show-Me
state
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Bill Bradley took his surging presidential
campaign to his hometown on the banks of the Mississippi River on
Wednesday, highlighting his small-town roots and storybook rise to
fame.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of the high school where he spent hours
playing basketball as a teen-ager, the former NBA star pledged a
new kind of presidential leadership ``that puts people front and
center, not the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel an urgency to seize this moment in history, to
strengthen the weak and challenge the strong to lead us into our
full greatness as a nation,'' the Democrat told about 1,500 people
in front of Crystal City High School.
</P>
<P>
   If elected president, Bradley said he would reduce childhood
poverty, make health care affordable to more Americans, enact gun
control and take big money out of politics. ``We will do fewer
things, but they will be essential things, and we will do them more
thoroughly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what Bradley said was not new, and he steered clear of
offering specific proposals. But the trip home was less about
substance and more about creating a presidential image that he
hopes will capture the public's imagination and help propel him to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had Hope, Ark. Former Sen. Bob Dole had
Russell, Kan. And former President Harry Truman, another native of
the Show-Me state and a role model of Bradley's, had Independence,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley clearly sees Crystal City, a town of 4,000 about 30
miles south of St. Louis, as his version of such Norman Rockwell
settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a small-town boy,'' he said. ``I had a paper route and
every day I delivered copies of the Daily News Democrat to the
doorsteps of my neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal City, whose sole industry was a Pittsburgh Plate Glass
factory that closed in 1991, could indeed have been the backdrop
for the portraits of Americana that Rockwell popularized in the
1940s. Almost every house has a front porch. Leafy oak trees line
the main street, Mississippi Avenue, and residents say it's mostly
true that everybody knows everybody.
</P>
<P>
   And everybody knows of Bradley, whose basketball prowess and
subsequent election to the Senate in his adopted state of New
Jersey have become part of local folklore. Bradley, the son of the
local bank president, lived in a single-story limestone house
across the street from Grace Presbyterian Church. Both his parents
are dead, but Bradley still owns the house.
</P>
<P>
   Following his speech, Bradley escorted residents _ many of whom
had never seen Bradley before _ into the gym where he led the
Crystal City Hornets to two state championship tournaments. From
the elevation of the gym stage, childhood friends, former teachers
and coaches offered folksy testimonials to the boy they claimed
would become the nation's 43rd president.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman Bond, Bradley's aunt and the only surviving relative
from his mother's family, said that Bradley had learned from his
mother, a school teacher, ``to move quickly ... to be a good
Samaritan ... and to be a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Long before basketball, Bill had learned how to live life on
the run,'' Bond said, alluding to Bradley's book about his 10 years
with the New York Knicks called, ``Life on the Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Thuesen, Bradley's second grade music teacher, declared
Bradley had the ``same twinkle in his eye, the same smile he had
when he was in second grade, 7-years-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Evans, the catcher on Bradley's little league baseball
team, described how Bradley led the team out of a St. Louis
restaurant that had refused to serve the team because Evans was
black. ``Bill made a believer out of me,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign billed Wednesday's speech here as his
``campaign kickoff'' speech, even though Bradley formally announced
his candidacy in December. Since then, Bradley has managed to make
something of a contest that many predicted would be a lost cause
against the better-funded incumbent, Vice President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, a Boston Globe poll found that Bradley was in
a statistical dead heat with Gore among likely Democratic primary
voters in New Hampshire, the nation's first primary state. A
Washington Post poll this week, however, found that Gore still
maintains a nearly three to one advantage over Bradley nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to residents, Bradley cast himself as a political
maverick who would run a different kind of campaign. ``I'm
listening to America, not to the pundits,'' he said. ``I'm hoping
that by Election Day, we will be choosing between two people we
esteem, not the candidate we can still tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was warmly applauded by those gathered, many of whom had
decked their homes with signs such as, ``From Crystal City to the
White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal City Mayor Grant Johnston, who called Bradley a role
model, seemed to sum up the sentiments of the town when he
introduced Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator, we have waited a long time for this day,'' Johnston
said. ``Welcome home. We are all very proud of you.''

FRANK PERETTI: THE FATHER OF THE CHRISTIAN THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By DEBRA LESTER   Herald-Journal, Spartanburg, S.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Peretti is not sure what his duties are as the father of a
literary genre, the Christian thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call me the father of the genre. What does that mean?''
he asked with a laugh during a recent telephone interview from his
Pacific Northwest home.
</P>
<P>
   It may mean that Peretti, a former Pentecostal preacher, has
novels that have sold more than 8 million copies. ``The Oath,''
published in 1995, sold more than half a million hardcover copies
within the first six months of release, a phenomenon in Christian
publishing circles.
</P>
<P>
   But most likely it's because Peretti showed publishers there is
a market for Christian fiction. His new novel, ``The Visitation,''
was published in August.
</P>
<P>
   Peretti was a co-pastor with his father at an Assemblies of God
church when he had the idea to write a Christian novel. He shelved
the notion. He was having difficulties with his ministry and, in
1983, he left the pastorate, a victim of burnout.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work in a ski factory, but didn't forget his idea. He
wrote the spiritual warfare novel, ``This Present Darkness.'' It
was published in 1986 and, three years later, Peretti was able to
quit his factory job and write full time. ``Piercing the Darkness''
was published in 1989, ``Prophet'' in 1992 and ``The Oath'' in
1995. He also found time to write eight books for upper grade
school and junior high age students, ``The Cooper Kids Adventure
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Visitation,'' Peretti admits, ``is somewhat
autobiographical, it's more a reflection of what's going on in my
own heart. It made the book more difficult to write. I had to write
from the heart, write what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the banjo-playing-former-Pentecostal-pastor
character Travis Jordan isn't a self-portrait of
banjo-playing-former-Pentecostal-pastor author Peretti. He insists
Jordan is drawn from his experiences and composites of people he's
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Visitation,'' published by Thomas Nelson, has a different
format from Peretti's other books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a building-suspense type of story, but it's written
in the first person and more than any of the other books it depends
on the characters. More than what's going on outside, it's what's
inside the main character,'' Peretti said.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the author didn't realize he was on the cutting edge
of a mainstream trend. Speakers at a recent meeting of the Southern
chapter of Mystery Writers of America stressed character-driven
novels as the thing publishers are looking for right now.
</P>
<P>
   Peretti's earlier books met with criticism about his theology.
``I don't think about that criticism,'' he said. ``I want people to
read my books, enjoy them, then decide their own theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Peretti writes a solid five hours a day, using a kitchen timer.
If he's interrupted or takes a break, he stops the timer, then
starts it again when he resumes writing.
</P>
<P>
   He said it takes him about two years to write a major novel.
Once he recovers from his book tour he'll be working on four new
books for young readers similar to the Cooper Kids series but with
new characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad to quit touring and do some actual writing,''
Peretti said.

INDONESIA REJECTS U.N. PEACEKEEPERS AS VIOLENCE IN TIMOR WORSENS

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia on Wednesday rejected
international pressure to allow a foreign peacekeeping force to
restore order in East Timor, even as a high-level U.N. delegation
met with officials to press for action to end widespread violence
there.
</P>
<P>
   Under threat from armed men, running out of food and water and
with its power supplies cut off, the U.N. mission in East Timor
announced that it was closing its operations in East Timor and
evacuating the last 300 members of its staff on Thursday, then
reversed itself, saying it would postpone the decision for 24 hours
and that it was likely a skeleton staff would remain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a declaration of martial law in the territory on
Tuesday, witnesses said the situation was still worsening, five
days after an announcement that East Timor's 800,000 people had
voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign of killing, burning and forced evacuation, clearly
orchestrated by elements of the Indonesian military, continued
unabated in an apparent effort to devastate the territory that
Indonesia has occupied since an invasion in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with a five-member delegation from the U.N.
Security Council, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told reporters that
Indonesia could manage its own affairs and would resist any
deployment of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't talk about peacekeeping when we know and you know you
won't be able to get peacekeepers on the ground within a week
unless you want to shoot your way into East Timor, God forbid,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer of Australia estimated that
Indonesia now has 26,000 armed soldiers and police officers in East
Timor. Despite repeated promises from Jakarta, the security forces
have done nothing to stop the violence by military-backed local
militias. Witnesses said soldiers and policemen have also taken
part in the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign pressure on Indonesia was also constrained by the
fragility of the political structure here. A lame-duck leader whose
campaign for a new term is already in jeopardy, President B.J.
Habibie may have little power to enforce unpopular policies like
his offer of independence to East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here said they were concerned that tough action
regarding East Timor could jeopardize foreign ties with Jakarta at
a time when it is going through a delicate political transition and
struggling to overcome an economic catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how hard Habibie's armed forces chief, Gen.
Wiranto, is trying to enforce the government's assurances that it
will restore order, or how much influence he now has over the
rampaging troops on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our impression is that General Wiranto has issued appropriate
orders but that the behavior of the military on the ground is the
behavior of an army which is deeply divided,'' Downer said at a
news conference in Australia. He said renegade troops may include
some of about 6,000 soldiers who are native to East Timor and who
do not want to see it break from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the tenuousness of Habibie's political
position, Jakarta was swept Wednesday by rumors that he was being
forced by the military to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Both Habibie and Alatas canceled longstanding plans to attend
the annual summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Council,
which began Wednesday in Auckland, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, where local news reports have presented a
politically skewed picture of the situation in East Timor, there
were signs of a growing backlash against foreign pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In one of several demonstrations in the last two days,
protesters climbed a wall into the grounds of the Australian
Embassy on Wednesday, lowered the Australian flag, burned it and
replaced it with an Indonesian flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The imposition of martial law has done nothing to improve the
situation,'' said David Wimhurst, a U.N. spokesman. ``We are
running out of supplies of food and water. When we tried to get to
warehouses today we were attacked by heavy weapons, while the armed
forces who were with us did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alatas said Indonesia would only accept an armed U.N. presence
in East Timor after the Indonesian Parliament formally endorses the
vote for independence at a session scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
   His abrupt dismissal of mounting international demands drew
widespread condemnation from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Antonio Guterres of Portugal, the former colonial
ruler of East Timor, said, ``Asking to wait until November is
absolutely crazy because it is obvious that in November there will
be nothing left there to create a new country.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Auckland, a series of foreign ministers voiced their outrage
as they arrived for the meeting of the economic council.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that what we need to do is to start to
assemble, ourselves, the capability to provide security to East
Timor and we need to make it clear to the government of Indonesia
that they need to accept such a force,'' said Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But with Indonesia rejecting a deployment of foreign troops, the
options of foreign nations to try to halt the terror and killings
were limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indonesians have made it perfectly clear that they would
militarily resist that,'' Downer said. ``That would be a very, very
difficult military conflict. That is, in a word, war.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that it was extremely frustrating for foreign
nations to sit back and watch the carnage continue.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies said up to 200,000 people had been forcibly
evacuated from the territory of 800,000 people in a campaign that
baffled many outside analysts. Some suggested that the campaign
could have the extraordinary ambition of removing local East
Timorese _ nearly 80 percent of whom voted for independence _ and
replacing them with a new, pro-Indonesian population.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the evacuees were being trucked to neighboring West
Timor, which is part of Indonesia, where they were being placed in
guarded camps to which foreigners were denied access. Others were
being put on inter-island ferries heading for remote parts of the
Indonesian archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that tens of thousands of people have been forcibly
removed from East Timor and we don't know what their fate is at
all,'' said Wimhurst, the U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A parallel campaign of killings and destruction appeared to be
aimed at devastating the territory, perhaps as a lesson to other
Indonesian provinces where there are separatist movements and
perhaps in a gesture of spite toward foreign critics of the
24-year-long occupation.
</P>
<P>
   In the largely evacuated capital, Dili, witnesses said the tiny
central business district had been destroyed along with public
buildings and utilities including the telephone exchange. In rural
areas, witnesses said churches that were sheltering refugees were
being attacked and burned.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter Center in Atlanta, which has been monitoring the
situation, said four priests were killed Wednesday in the town of
Suai. According to other reports, the Roman Catholic bishop,
Basilio do Nascimento, was shot and wounded in the town of Baucau
and forced to flee, like other refugees, into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the residence in Dili of East Timor's other bishop,
Carlos Belo, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, was burned. He was
forced to flee to Australia.

BOND PRICES RISE AFTER FED'S STEPS ON Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices rebounded Wednesday as traders covered
short positions after the Federal Reserve took measures to insure
that there will be enough money in the banking system to counter
any year 2000 computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   The market's tone improved and remained firm after Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan spoke at Grand Valley State University in Michigan
but did not comment on interest rates, the economy or policy, as
had been expected. Remarks by other Fed officials Wednesday,
including Laurence Meyer, a Fed governor, in Philadelphia and
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers at the New York Economic Club
had little market effect and failed to put the market in a
defensive stance.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond rose 3/32, to 100 26/32. Its yield
was unchanged at 6.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the market was also aided by the announcement of a
Year 2000 program that will allow banks to use expanded forms of
collateral for repurchase transactions within 90 days, which will
add liquidity to the banking system. It eased concern that trading
Treasuries or other fixed-income paper might be difficult at the
end of the year. Some investors have had concerns the financial
markets might freeze up, causing some to postpone selling until
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's sparse economic data was virtually ignored, which
only goes to show that the market gave an inordinate amount of
attention to the Fed news, said Andy Bischel, director of investing
at Spare, Kaplan, Bischel &AMP; Associates in San Francisco. ``The Fed
is probably going to raise rates as soon as October,'' he said,
``but in the meantime the market has been in and out discounting
the increase.''
</P>
<P>
   July wholesale inventories rose 0.9 percent, another hint that
the change in business inventories during the third quarter could
add noticeably to growth in the gross domestic product, some
economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond market participants have begun to focus on the scheduled
release Friday of the government's report on producer prices, or
inflation at the manufacturing level, a key indicator of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the economic reports scheduled for release next week
will play a much larger role in determining whether the Fed will
raise rates again at its policy-making meeting Oct. 5, said Donald
Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. ``Market
participants will certainly pay particular attention to retail
sales, housing starts, industrial production, and capacity
utilization, but most keenly awaited of all will be the CPI, the
Fed's benchmark inflation measure.''
</P>
<P>
   A robust Consumer Price Index, coupled with retail sales data
that indicate continued momentum in consumer spending, would create
a considerable amount of consternation among Fed members and could
prompt another increase, Fine said.

POLITICAL CHANGE IN NIGERIA MEANS TENSION-FREE GAS STATIONS

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ The humble gas station, once the defining image
of Nigeria's seemingly willful collapse, has undergone a striking
transformation since the military rulers handed over power to
civilians three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the milelong lines that choked roads, made fistfights
part of the Nigerian streetscape and turned gas stations into
high-security zones swarming with soldiers, police officers, thugs
and the long-suffering ordinary Nigerians, citizens of the world's
sixth-largest producer of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Now most gas stations operate the way an Agip station on Iju
Road here does: Motorists pull up to a pump and drive away a minute
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is fundamental change in things,'' said Abiodun
Akinloye, 34, an attendant at the station for six years. ``Before,
the tension was too high. People were begging to buy fuel and
sometimes had to wait for days. Now you buy fuel at the actual
price and at your own convenience. Everything has become fine.
Everybody is feeling fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Africa's most populous nation inaugurated its
first civilian government in 16 years, gas stations offer perhaps
the clearest promise of what could become one of the most
remarkable political transformations on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 months ago, Nigeria was in the grip of a rapacious
military regime that had turned the country into an international
pariah and manipulated oil supplies so that Nigerians often had to
pay several times what Americans do for a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after a year of traumatic events that pushed this fragile
nation to the brink of civil war, Nigeria is intact, but its
president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has quickly pushed reforms that are
altering its face. Nigerians, an industrious people paralyzed until
last year by the brutally repressive military under Gen. Sani
Abacha, are now even talking of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like Joseph getting out of the pit to get to the palace
in Egypt,'' said Baba Adi, a lawyer and prominent member of the
governing People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even the government's fiercest critics, who argue that it has
yet to make lasting changes, acknowledge that there is greater
individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's temporary,'' said Beko Ransome-Kuti, a well-known
human rights campaigner who spent three years in jail under Abacha,
``it's a nice holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be too soon to talk of democracy, the end of the
military state has visibly affected daily lives here. Obasanjo
forbade politicians to drive in convoys with sirens blaring, once a
common practice. Several streets in Lagos were renamed for slain
pro-democracy activists.
</P>
<P>
   The notorious security forces that patrolled cities with
unchallenged authority _ known here as Operation Sweep _ have grown
tamer. In Lagos, the forces now go by the less sinister title of
Rapid Response Squad.
</P>
<P>
   On Iju Road, once frequently impassable because of motorists
waiting at its many gas stations, the soldiers and policemen once
posted at checkpoints every two miles have disappeared. Now, no one
shakes down Isaac Bodunrin, 45, and his fellow cab drivers for the
equivalent of 20 cents every two miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can continue like this, there will be progress in this
country,'' said Bodunrin, who often used to end the day with
nothing but now makes about $10. ``If we can drive free, I can do
my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo has already made changes in many of Nigeria's vital
sectors. He established a panel to investigate human rights
violations since the mid-1980s and another to look into government
contracts awarded since 1976. He has sent an anti-corruption bill
to the National Assembly, though many say the proposal goes too far
in potentially invading people's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   On the burning issue of the Niger Delta, the source of Nigeria's
oil wealth but still profoundly poor, Obasanjo proposed legislation
toward its development. In addition, in a highly symbolic act, he
permitted the family of Ken Saro-Wiwa, the writer who was hanged in
1995 for criticizing the government's oil policies, to claim his
body.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil industry, the source of almost all of Nigeria's hard
currency, he has cut out shadowy middlemen from sales of crude oil
and rescinded prospecting contracts awarded to cronies of the
military regime.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The president, a retired general who was Nigeria's military
ruler from 1976 to 1979, shook up the military by forcing about 100
top officers to retire. Most were northerners who dominated the
military and ruled the country for all but 10 years since
independence from Britain in 1960, and their successors were chosen
from diverse regions. His government also announced plans to cut
troop strength significantly.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, in his choice of ministers the president has tried
to strike a balance among the dominant ethnic groups and the
several hundred minorities. The move has drawn praise from pressure
groups and Western diplomats. But it has been criticized by
northerners, who say they are now being marginalized, and by the
Ibo from the east, who say they have not gotten any top ministerial
positions.

   Despite all the changes, critics say the Obasanjo administration
has not taken urgently needed steps to address the roots of
Nigeria's problems. According to the Constitution, which was handed
down by military decree, the appointments of judges, the control of
police officers and the direction of primary schools all still rest
with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics argue that unless the relationship between the
federal government and the 36 states is renegotiated _ and that
includes the formula by which oil revenues are shared _ Nigeria
will remain a divided nation, with most of its ethnic groups
feeling oppressed by another group. In the last three months,
hundreds have died in skirmishes across the country, including two
clashes between the Yoruba and the Hausa, who with the Ibo, are the
country's largest ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must sit down and decide what to say together,'' said Ayo
Opadokun, general secretary of the National Democratic Coalition,
the main civilian opposition group to the Abacha military
government.
</P>
<P>
   Until reforms are written into law, democratization remains too
dependent on the personality of Obasanjo, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   That is a dangerous situation in a country where one man,
whether Abacha or Obasanjo, can completely change the direction of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Obasanjo dies today, what happens to Nigeria?''
Ransome-Kuti asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Ashorobi, a member of the national executive committee
of the president's party, argued that Obasanjo had begun to lay
``the foundation for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The priority, he said, has been to try to meet the country's
essential needs, a task made easier by the recent rebound in crude
oil prices to more than $20 a barrel. In addition to the
availability of gasoline, electricity service has improved
noticeably in many areas, and the government recently announced
that the price of a telephone line would fall significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regarding the basic comforts of life, the current regime has
been able to bring some confidence into society where there was
only despair before,'' Ashorobi said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   On Iju Road, in a cacophony of human voices and engine sounds,
the two lanes teem with pedestrians, cars, motorcycles and peddlers
selling everything from vegetables to raw meat. With the gasoline
lines now gone, traffic moves in both directions, slowly but
surely.
</P>
<P>
   At the Agip station, three yellow fuel trucks were parked
waiting to discharge their load, two of them for the last seven
days because the station simply did not need more fuel. The
situation would have been unthinkable just months ago.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians have not seen such plentiful gasoline since 1993 when
Abacha let the country's refineries deteriorate, thereby forcing
refined products to be imported through his middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change came with the new government, so we are all
happy,'' said Adeniyi Johnson, 40, a civil servant who drove his
white Volkswagen Beetle to a pump. ``I hope it will continue this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The gas bounty even pleased those who had profited from the
artificial scarcity. In the past, soldiers would sometimes take
over the station and control the lines, moving drivers ahead in
exchange for a bribe. At the end of the day, the soldiers would tip
the thugs who informally controlled the lines, at the very bottom
of the food chain.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   One former regular, Eyo Kulaba, 25, said he had been able to
save enough money from the bribes he collected to buy a used
motorcycle. And so in Nigeria's peculiar job classification he had
moved up from being an ``area boy'' _ a jobless youth who hustles
for tips and bribes on the streets _ to an ``okada man,'' a youth
who ferries passengers around on his motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I benefited materially, I was not very happy that
people were suffering daily,'' Kulaba said. ``People were bashing
each other's vehicles to get fuel and there was always a lot of
fighting. It was really terrible.''

MEXICO IMPORTS AMERICAN-STYLE CREDIT REPORTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mexico, Ga., Ill.)   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The usual reason given for the failure of about a
third of Mexico's bank loans since 1995 is soaring inflation.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all loans pegged to the inflation rate, which at
times approached 100 percent, it was not long before many Mexicans
owed more in interest than they had borrowed. So many borrowers
have merely walked away.
</P>
<P>
   But many Mexican bankers now acknowledge that even without
inflation, touched off by a sharp devaluation of the peso, many of
the loans would probably have gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   A key reason was that bankers had made many of the loans with
little information about the borrowers. The kind of nationwide,
computerized credit reporting companies that have been standard in
the United States for decades simply did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   But now two of the biggest U.S. credit reporting companies, the
Trans Union Corp. of Chicago and Equifax Inc. of Atlanta, are at
work building files and computer systems in Mexico that will give
bankers here the same instantaneous credit profiles that bankers in
New York and Miami and Los Angeles take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch in late 1996, Trans Union, in a joint
venture with most of Mexico's banks, has compiled files on 25
million Mexican loans, representing most of the market, according
to Trans Union. Equifax says it has 8 million files and hopes to
have 20 million by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexico's economy has been recovering nicely, thanks to a
surge in manufacturing and relatively high oil prices, its banks
are still limping along, collecting what they can on old debts and
lending very little. The few mortgages that are being issued are at
interest rates of nearly 30 percent, with credit cards charging
more than 50 percent. Small and midsize businesses are starving for
cash. Housing construction is down.
</P>
<P>
   So the government is eager to strengthen the banks. Just a few
months ago, it made the credit reporting agencies a formal part of
Mexico's financial system, for the first time mandating that
bankers check out all prospective loans through one of the
agencies. In the United States, credit reporting has been integral
to lending for decades. But, industry executives say, it is
entirely discretionary for U.S. lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to inject discipline into lending in Mexico, the
government went on to require that, in the case of a bad credit
report, a loan of say $100,000 or any other amount, could only be
made if the bank were willing to set aside an equal amount in
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   It was a blunt sanction, that Federico Castro Rosas, the general
director of BC Buro de Credito, the joint venture in which Trans
Union is the largest investor, said would surely stop any lender in
his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of the rest of Latin America as well as Africa and
parts of Asia, Mexico had gotten along for decades with very little
credit reporting. There had been a credit reporting agency in
Mexico _ at least in name _ starting in the early 1970's. But it
was never really taken seriously and was eventually done away with.
Banks and other lenders refused to share their credit information
with the agency, and what little the agency could gather was
fragmented, often outdated and considered unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very poorly managed,'' said Ernesto Gomez-Gallardo, an
executive vice president at Banamex, the country's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Few felt an urgent need for better credit reporting, partly
because, in Mexico as in many other developing countries, the banks
lent to a fairly small elite. The bankers either knew their
customers or worked on referrals.
</P>
<P>
   But bank lending and the credit card business in Mexico exploded
in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the banks were reprivatized
after a decade of state control. Bankers who had paid high prices
to get into the business were eager to put their money to work and
began lending to almost anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, one banker said, ``you just didn't check people's
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were questions on the application form,'' the banker
said, ``but the customer could lie and tell you he hadn't had any
problems. And you would never know. The credit bureau wouldn't have
the information.''
</P>
<P>
   After the value of the peso was cut in half in late 1994,
inflation soared, and the banks and the government recognized that
big changes had to be made.
</P>
<P>
   As one measure, the Mexican Association of Bankers deputized the
five largest banks to begin negotiations with Trans Union, Equifax
and the other industry giant in the United States, Experian Corp.
Trans Union won the contest and three years ago began issuing
credit reports as part of the joint venture with the banks. Equifax
says it withdrew from contention and decided to go it alone before
the banking association announced its choice. Experian is not doing
business in Mexico. While Equifax has a few bank customers in
Mexico, its greatest following so far has been among retailers. But
it has its eyes on a stronger position with the banks. Equifax, the
only one of the three companies that is publicly traded in the
United States, had revenues in 1998 of $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexicans are interested in competition,'' said Bill
Phinney, a senior executive for Equifax in Latin America. ``They
want more than one player in their markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. companies have brought in sophisticated computer
systems that blend information from several sources and, in
seconds, produce reports on a person's debt history, the types and
amounts of loans, the timeliness of payments and any defaults or
repossessions. The companies charge corporations a negotiated fee
for each report. For individuals in the United States, the fee is
$8, except in a handful of states where one report a year will be
provided for free.
</P>
<P>
   For both Trans Union and Equifax, the move into Mexico was part
of a plan to expand from the saturated U.S. credit reporting market
into Latin America and other parts of the world. ``We see very good
growth potential in Mexico,'' said Phinney of Equifax.
</P>
<P>
   Lending has become a much more cautious and restrictive business
in Mexico. The bankers say, it is a tough adjustment for many
customers. ``This is a big shock to Mexican culture,'' said
Gomez-Gallardo. ``If you have a bad loan or a default, you won't be
getting credit. That is something new.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when one lender did not know what the other was
doing, he said, ``People didn't pay and nothing happened.''

COMMENTARY: MAKING KIDS SAFER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When kids pull out their guns at school and open fire on
classmates and teachers, it tends to get our attention. Which is
why school safety has trumped academic quality as the top concern
of parents whose children are returning to school this month.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and school board members are clamoring for metal
detectors, armed guards, see-through knapsacks, whatever it takes.
Some of the wackos at the National Rifle Association want to arm
teachers and administrators. Kids are being thrown out of school
for trafficking in violent fantasies and _ in the case of a second
grader in Maryland _ making a gun out of construction paper.
</P>
<P>
   Please, a little perspective.
</P>
<P>
   James Alan Fox, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern
University, reminds us that despite the tragedies in Littleton and
Jonesboro, the public schools are just about the safest places
available for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the school shootings for last year and the year
before, there were about four dozen homicides a year,'' he said.
``When you consider that there are about 50 million schoolchildren,
the chance that your child will get killed in school is literally
one in a million.''
</P>
<P>
   His point was not that we should be unmoved by the four dozen
homicides that occur annually at schools, but that we should be
taking steps to cut down on the violence that threatens youngsters
wherever they might be. And the most effective way to do that,
according to Fox and a sensible group in Washington called Fight
Crime: Invest in Kids, is to look beyond the quick fixes (metal
detectors and the like) to those difficult, long-term preventive
efforts that can bring about wholesale reductions in the amount of
youth crime and violence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving lives, you can enrich the environment of
enormous numbers of children by investing in early childhood
education programs like Head Start, by providing after-school
programs that give children and teen-agers something valuable to do
during the peak crime hours for juveniles (2 p.m. to 7 p.m.), and
by offering parenting programs and other assistance to young
mothers and fathers whose children are at high risk for getting
into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Fight Crime: Invest in Kids is a group of 550 law enforcement
officers and crime victims. Many of its members are fiscally
conservative, but the group is committed to public investment in
crime prevention programs that have been shown to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 40 kids being killed a week, 98 percent of them
outside of schools,'' said the group's president, Sanford Newman.
``We know how to dramatically reduce that violence.''
</P>
<P>
   After-school programs are among the easiest and most effective
crime prevention efforts. As Fox put it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring back the `frills' in school _ violins rather than
violence. In the wake of various taxpayer revolts, many of the
extracurricular options _ band, chorus, drama, various sports,
computer clubs, etc. _ were eliminated in a return to the basics.
This has made school increasingly distasteful and unpleasant for
those kids who fail to excel in academics, but could feel good
about their achievements in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts have restored after-school programs in
recent years but have undermined their effectiveness by placing
them off limits to the kids who need them most. In some cases
youngsters who do not maintain a C average are barred from
extracurricular activities. Or kids whose parents cannot provide
transportation at the end of the extended school day are excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done,'' said Fox, ``is made after-school programs a
privilege for the good kids as opposed to a necessity for the
marginal kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Fight Crime: Invest in Kids sponsored a poll in which 47 percent
of respondents said their chief concern as kids headed back to
school was the problem of crime and violence. Nineteen percent
cited academic issues as their top concern.
</P>
<P>
   Both Newman and Fox said the concern over school violence
presented an opportunity to generate support for programs that
target violence in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can understand the anxiety over violence in the schools,''
said Fox. ``What we should do is build upon that anxiety to do some
really meaningful things for children.''  &QL;

   NIGERIA-TRANSFORMATION (Lagos, Nigeria) _ Three months after
Africa's most populous nation inaugurated its first civilian
government in 16 years, gas stations offer perhaps the clearest
promise of what could become one of the most remarkable political
transformations on the continent. Only 15 months ago, Nigeria was
in the grip of a rapacious military regime that had turned the
country into an international pariah. Now most gas stations operate
the way an Agip station on Iju Road here does: motorists pull up to
a pump and drive away a minute later. By Norimitsu Onishi.

CLINTON TESTIFIES AT INQUIRY INTO ALLEGED ILLEGAL SOLICITATION OF
FUNDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Cameroon)   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton testified for an hour Wednesday
in the independent counsel investigation of allegations that Labor
Secretary Alexis M. Herman illegally solicited campaign
contributions for Clinton's 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, Ralph I. Lancaster, interviewed Clinton
under oath at the White House Wednesday morning as part of an
ongoing investigation into accusations of campaign finance
violations and influence peddling by Ms. Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was represented by his chief private attorneys, David E.
Kendall and Nicole Seligman, as well as three lawyers from the
White House counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster was joined by two lawyers from his office, David Barry
and John T. Kotelly. Kotelly last year represented Larry Cockell,
the lead agent in Clinton's Secret Service detail, during his
appearance before the federal grand jury investigating the Monica
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would give no details of the president's
testimony and Kendall declined to comment. Calls to Lancaster's
office were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer involved in the case said that Clinton was interviewed
as a witness and was neither a subject nor a target of the
investigation. The lawyer said that the interview of the president
suggested that Lancaster was moving toward a conclusion of his
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interview lasted one hour and was conducted under oath,''
the White House said in a terse statement. ``Consistent with prior
practice, no further statement about the interview will be made.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Ms. Herman has been virtually invisible
since Lancaster was named in May, 1998, as the fifth independent
counsel to investigate allegations against the president and senior
members of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   W. Neil Eggleston, Ms. Herman's attorney, said that contact with
Lancaster's office has been sporadic over the past year and that
inquiry has required little of his time and virtually none of the
labor secretary's.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said last year when she approved the
appointment of an independent counsel that she had found no
evidence clearly demonstrating wrongdoing on Ms. Herman's part. But
she said the allegations and the law compelled her to initiate the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation arises from accusations from Laurent Yene, a
businessman from Cameroon, that Ms. Herman took cash kickbacks from
a client of his seeking a federal license for a satellite telephone
system.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster is also looking into allegations that Ms. Herman used
her position as White House director of public liaison in Clinton's
first term to illegally solicit campaign contributions from clients
of the consulting firm she ran before joining the administration in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herman was appointed secretary of labor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Ms. Herman is the last to pose a threat to
a member of Clinton's cabinet. Henry G. Cisneros, the former
housing secretary, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of lying
to federal investigators on Wednesday and agreed to pay a small
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Espy, Clinton's former agriculture secretary, was acquitted
on bribery charges. The investigation of Bruce Babbitt, the
interior secretary, is winding down and the independent counsel
inquiry into former commerce secretary Ronald H. Brown ended when
Brown was killed in a plane crash in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated the
Lewinsky matter and business dealings of Clinton collectively known
as Whitewater, chose not to seek indictments of Clinton or Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Staff members are preparing a final report for
Congress.

ANNAN ORDERS, THEN POSTPONES, EVACUATION OF U.N. MISSION IN EAST
TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Security
Council walked up to the brink of confrontation with Indonesia on
Wednesday, then backed away when President B.J. Habibie and his
army chief, Gen. Wiranto, begged for more time to put East Timor in
order.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, after violence in the territory showed little
sign of abating despite two days of martial law, Annan decided to
evacuate the U.N. mission in East Timor _ several hundred foreign
and local employees and their families. He also asked officials at
the United Nations in New York to begin contingency planning for an
outside military force for the territory, a step the Indonesians
have rejected repeatedly in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot stand by and allow the people of East Timor to be
killed,'' a visibly drawn Annan said Wednesday morning after a
night of telephone conversations with world leaders, including two
with Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   But a few hours later, the Security Council was told that plans
for evacuating the United Nations' East Timor mission had been
suspended, to be reviewed in 24 hours. An official at the United
Nations in New York said that Wiranto had told Annan's top
political adviser that he needed another day to negotiate with
military chiefs in the territory _ an admission that he could not
insure even the safety of a U.N. withdrawal, or what would happen
after the mission left.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Security Council, meeting in private,
rejected a strong plea from Portugal to hold a formal, open Council
debate on the issue Wednesday, which would have forced the 15
member nations to state their positions in the face of the crisis.
Portugal, which is not a Council member, could not call the open
meeting, only request it.
</P>
<P>
   Peter van Walsum, the Dutch representative and this month's
Council president, said there was no consensus among members for
such a meeting. The Council, he said, preferred to wait until a
five-member mission that it sent to Indonesia on Monday had a
chance to meet Habibie and possibly Wiranto on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto, who replaced his commander in East Timor on Wednesday,
has very little control in the territory, said John Bresnan, an
expert on Indonesia at Columbia University's East Asian Institute,
who recently returned from Indonesia. In East Timor, he said,
officers connected to the former chief of Indonesia's most powerful
commando unit, Lt. Gen. Prabowo _ a son-in-law of Indonesia's
deposed president, Suharto _ have almost all the local power in
their hands, and they could defy Jakarta's efforts to end the
violence for essentially political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and officials at the United Nations in New York, like
Bresnan and other academic experts, said the East Timor crisis has
hit Indonesia at its most vulnerable political moment in decades.
There will inevitably be political fallout, they say, but they add
that no one can predict what it will be.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative at the United
Nations, said Wednesday that an acute awareness of this unstable
political situation plays a significant role in the thinking at the
United Nations during these tense days. ``There is a real crisis of
leadership in the country,'' said Bresnan, a former Ford Foundation
director in Jakarta and author of ``Managing Indonesia'' (Columbia
University Press). ``Nobody is really in charge very much. All the
institutions are down, including the army. They are divided by
factions, personalized factions. So you have people acting as
individuals, dealing with other individuals, and no institutions
functioning at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``People speak of the government,'' he said. ``There is no
single government. ``Habibie is still trying to get elected. He
needs the army's votes to get elected. He has to be very cautious
of General Wiranto. General Wiranto is very cautious because he is
also a survivor of the Suharto regime, like Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be primarily concerned with preserving what unity he
can within the army itself,'' Bresnan said. ``That is his top
priority, not what the IMF does, not what the Security Council
does.'' This partially explains why Indonesia seems to care so
little about public opinion as militias roam East Timor,
vandalizing towns and driving frightened people into exile, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in Indonesia don't care about East Timor,'' he
added. It is a very small part of a large nation trying to deal
with a political revolution and economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the Security Council, there is growing support for
international intervention, with China and Russia joining in
condemning the violence and asking for action. China's deputy
representative, Shen Guofeng, told reporters that his government
believed that the situation in East Timor was out of control. But
China later succeeded in toning down a sense of threat in the
Security Council statement that followed. However, all governments
continue to insist that Indonesia be given every possible chance to
reassert control.
</P>
<P>
   This poses a dilemma for the United Nations, which fears for the
safety of not only its own officials and local employees in East
Timor but also the 2,000 East Timorese who fled to the U.N.
compound in the capital, Dili, for protection. Annan said Wednesday
morning that their fate was also on his mind as he decided what to
do. Wednesday, officials were calling for volunteers to stay behind
if an evacuation was necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.N. mission in East Timor had been expected to remain well
into next year, by then bolstered with peacekeeping troops, to ease
the region's transition to independence. Officials have considered
asking Indonesia to move to that phase now, allowing international
troops into the territory without admitting a loss of control. But
government leaders seem insistent that this phase must wait until
after the newly elected Indonesian Parliament assembles in November
and chooses a president.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps, too, are surrounded by uncertainty now. Officials
here are watching the statements of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the
Indonesian opposition leader whose party finished first, but
without a clear majority, in national legislative elections. In the
past, she has opposed letting East Timor go, echoing the strong
nationalism of her father, Sukarno, who as Indonesia's first
president attacked and bombed rebels in Sumatra and Sulawesi when
they tried to secede.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Megawati has since changed her approach slightly,
saying Sunday that she is sorry about what the East Timorese are
going through at the hands of Habibie, she may be more acceptable
to the military than he is. Then, some diplomats ask, would the
entire East Timor agreement be in jeopardy?

LOTT CALLS FOR RENO RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republican leader Trent Lott said Wednesday
that he doubts the FBI's claim that it did not ignite the fire that
killed more than 80 Branch Davidians in the 1993 showdown in Waco,
Texas, and said Attorney General Janet Reno should resign.
</P>
<P>
   If ``these fires were caused and it should have been known they
were going to be caused, that is very bad,'' said Lott. ``There's
doubts because of the questions that have been raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno is set to announce Friday that former senator John
Danforth, a Republican, will head an independent inquiry into the
federal government's actions at Waco. Danforth has accepted the
responsibility and, barring any eleventh-hour glitches, is
scheduled to join the attorney general at the news conference,
government sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's counterpart, Senate Democratic leader Thomas Daschle of
South Dakota, called Lott's suggestion ``irresponsible'' and
defended Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about politics, once again, overriding the real,
honest, objective fact-gathering,'' said Daschle. ``Before we
comment publicly on any actions taken by federal officials, we
ought to know what the real facts are, and it's premature at this
point to come to any conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between the two Senate leaders came as Congress
returned from its summer break and considered news reports that the
FBI had used two military-style tear gas canisters in the early
morning of April 19, 1993. Four hours later, the Branch Davidians'
wooden compound erupted in flames.
</P>
<P>
   The tear gas canisters, under certain circumstances, had
flammable properties. The FBI said the rounds were fired at a
concrete bunker away from the main compound, as videotapes released
last week confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said last week she has no intention of resigning over the
Waco matter. Congressional leaders are considering the format and
scope of their planned probe into the Waco affair.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, is a former senator from Missouri and an
Episcopalian priest, with a reputation for probity and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Congress should go ahead with its own investigation of
the Waco matter. He asked Wednesday why the FBI's disclosure of the
two tear gas canisters came six years after the fiery showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Lott cited other run-ins that the Republican Congress has had
with Reno, over matters like the 1997 campaign finance probe, and
said, ``All of that leads me to conclude that the attorney general
should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous investigations, including those conducted by
Republican-controlled congressional committees, have concluded that
the Branch Davidians started the fire themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Reno ``has done an extraordinary job under very,
very difficult circumstances. . . . Under no cirumstances do I
believe the attorney general should resign.''

BRADLEY OFFICIALLY ENTERS PRESIDENTIAL RACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley officially offered
himself as the Democratic Party's fresh option for president
Wednesday by saying the nation has failed to convert the soaring
economy into better living for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shouldn't we be fixing our roof while the sun is shining in?''
he said in a speech delivered to a hometown crowd from the front
steps of the Mississippi River hamlet's only high school.
</P>
<P>
   It was a criticism by inference of the nation's performance
under President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Bradley is
Gore's sole challenger for the 2000 Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley presented his fix-up plan: Expand health care and gun
control, speak out against racial prejudice, do more to relieve
child poverty and ``mute the voice of big money in our elections.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do these things we will be safer, healthier and more in
control of our future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old red brick school, built four years before
Bradley's birth, was decorated in patriotic bunting in one of the
day's many small-town, heartland touches.
</P>
<P>
   At this school, Bradley launched a basketball career that led to
a 10-year stint with the New York Knicks. He parlayed sports
stardom into an 18-year stretch as a U.S. senator from New Jersey,
ending in 1996 when he declined to seek re-election and declared
that the American political system was seriously flawed.
</P>
<P>
   As if addressing his own kiss-off from three years ago, Bradley
said Wednesday that voters have a right to be skeptical about
politics and the influence of campaign contributions from special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have a right to try to change that skepticism,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Bradley loaded his campaign kick-off speech with
biographical details and policy matters, the biggest applause from
his audience of about 2,500 rewarded his assertion that, in his
low-key and brainy way, he is different from the average
politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we need a new kind of leadership,'' he said. ``A
leadership that puts the people front and center _ not the
president . ... a leadership that respects the people as well as
challenges them.''
</P>
<P>
   Vague as it was, the statement underscored some of Bradley's
perceived political advantages in his underdog race against Gore.
In contrast with the vice president, Bradley has no connections to
Clinton's personal scandals or to the campaign fund-raising
scandals that have shadowed Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say the scandals and so-called Clinton fatigue
partly explain why Gore has been unable to blaze a clear path to
his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore posts substantial leads over Bradley in national surveys of
Democratic voters, but a recent Boston Globe poll put the two in a
statistical tie in New Hampshire, site of the first primary
election early next year. Another independent poll of New Hampshire
voters showed Bradley in a tie with Gov. George W. Bush, the
leading Republican candidate, in a hypothetical general election.
The same poll showed Gore would trail Bush in such a match-up.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's event Wednesday was a close copy of Gore's June
announcement in scene and culture. Gore declared his candidacy in
front of the red brick courthouse in Carthage, Tenn., surrounded by
old friends in the town where he spent summers as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   Even though both candidates are known for inducing naps during
their speeches, the addresses were as different as Missouri and
Tennessee. Unlike Gore, Bradley did not use his speech to praise
Clinton, jab at Republicans, showcase education policies, propose
detailed new programs or warn about the threat of foreign
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that by Election Day we will be choosing between
two people we esteem, not the candidate we can still tolerate,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his ``different kind of presidential campaign'' included
raising money from ordinary people rather than political action
committees of special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive
Politics of the $11.7 million Bradley raised through mid-year shows
that his leading contributors are lawyers and investment bankers.
All but 3 percent of his contributions were of the larger kind,
between $200 and the limit of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has raised $19.5 million in a similar pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has staked out a few policy differences from Gore. He
said, for instance, that all handguns should be registered onto a
national list and that the Democratic Party should ban ``soft
money,'' or unlimited contributions to the party that can be used
on behalf of candidates. Bradley also opposed the welfare reform
bill championed by Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is expected to unveil a health-care plan later this
month that expands the federal role in providing health insurance
to millions of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps mindful of the impression that he is more liberal
than Gore, Bradley said Wednesday that the government ``cannot be
all things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in self-reliance and I think initiative deserves its
reward,'' said Bradley, who grew up in a Republican household as
the son of the town's banker. ``But I also know that disaster can
strike any of us, and when it does, it's important to know that
someone's there to help.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Crystal City High School was built by the federal
Works Project Administration, which helped create jobs after the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Racial unity has been one of Bradley's themes since he went into
politics after playing as a white man on a mostly black
professional basketball team. He returned to the theme Wednesday by
recalling that his Crystal City Little League team walked out of a
Missouri restaurant that refused to serve the team's black catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism disturbed me then, and still angers me now. For me the
only thing deserving of hate is hate itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he provided no details about using the thought as the basis
for government action.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, his almost exclusively white audience
adjourned to a reception in the gymnasium where Bradley became
famous as a methodical, hard-practicing basketball player. There, a
black named Eddi Evans praised Bradley as a leader for racial
equality ever since they played baseball together as children.
Evans joined Bradley's second-grade music teacher, his aunt and
others in providing testimonials about the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, Bradley took reporters on a tour of his
childhood home, church and other haunts.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent most of his campaign shunning TV appearances and
has declined to answer questions about his personal thoughts and
personal history. In his 1996 book ``Time Present, Time Past,'' he
used a chapter to upbraid the press for digging into candidates'
backgrounds, stating that ``the information gleaned from snippets
of biography ... cannot provide an adequate psychological profile,
much less determine that someone is unfit for office.''

COLLONS BACK IN PATRIOTS LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Defensive end Ferric Collons, who was let go
by the Patriots after last season, is back in the New England fold
after signing a one-year deal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Collons, who had played parts of four seasons
with the Patriots, had his contract terminated after last season
when the Patriots decided against paying his $2 million salary for
1999. The team felt that was too much money for a part-time player
and elected to let him become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Collons signed with the Oakland Raiders but was among the team's
final cuts last weekend. Collons, who lives in the Bay Area where
his wife works as a physician, wanted to return to New England
rather than an unfamiliar situation. Collons signed for the veteran
minimum of $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Collons started 11 of the 14 games he played in last season and
had 25 tackles. He always has been considered a good run stopper.
</P>
<P>
   Collons's agent, Angelo Wright, said Collons was in shape and
would be able to fit right back into the Patriots' defensive
scheme. The Patriots had signed veteran Bob Kuberski to add
interior depth on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Collons, who stands 6 feet 7 inches and weighs 300 pounds,
attended defensive meetings Wednesday and will undergo a physical
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A few Patriots players recommended to the coaching staff and to
the front office that Collons be resigned. Chad Eaton, who was
clearing out a adjacent locker for Collons Wednesday, was one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news,'' said Eaton. ``Ferric is a professional who
understands our defense. He's going to make quite a difference to
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Collons has had several lives as a Patriot. After the 1997
season, Collons was signed to an offer sheet by the Philadelphia
Eagles as a restricted free agent. The Patriots kept Collons by
matching the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will have to cut a player from their 53-man roster
to accommodate Collons. Veteran Sterling Palmer, out of football
the last two seasons, could be axed.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had been working with about $800,000 of available
cap room prior to signing Collons, but about $350,000 is allocated
toward the five players who were signed to the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   The team also signed supplemental draft pick J'Juan Cherry. He
was also on hand Wednesday.

WORLD WAR II, SEMINAL EVENT OF THE CENTURY, TAUGHT A VITAL LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
 (For release
Sunday,-HNS  
 &HT;    Sept. 12)   (EDs: CHANGES democracies in lede to democracy.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the evil forces of fascism swept through one
European country after another in 1940, a young John F. Kennedy
contemplated the weakness of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it competes with a system of government which cares
nothing for permanency, a system built primarily for war,
democracy, which is built primarily for peace, is at a
disadvantage,'' Kennedy wrote in a book extrapolated from his
Harvard honors thesis.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, ``Why England Slept,'' he sought to explain why a
great democracy, with an empire stretching around the globe, buried
its head, ostrich-fashion, while Germany's Adolf Hitler and his
fellow malefactor, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, gobbled up
other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Little did Kennedy, then just 23 years old, realize that one day
he would be president of the United States and have to cope with
democracy's weaknesses as he confronted a belligerent,
nuclear-armed Soviet Union in Cuba, Berlin and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   As a student and the son of Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, who
was emerging as a pillar of American isolationism, he had lived
briefly in England. But his views were at odds with those of his
father.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy recognized the need for America to play a major
role in Europe once the war was over and to maintain an ``armed
guard that will wake up when the fire first starts or, better yet,
one that will not permit a fire to start at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the young student had some question about the
survivability of democracy. He therefore admonished Americans to
``profit by the lesson of England and make our democracy work.''
</P>
<P>
   While any system of government will work when ``everything is
going well,'' he noted, ``it's the system that functions in the
clinches that survives.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he was prescient. He had no idea how long the
war would last, whether England could survive the nightly air
assault of German bombers or that the United States eventually
would be drawn into the conflict. He did, however, recognize that
the world was undergoing a monumental transition that would change
life as he and millions of others had known it.
</P>
<P>
   An old way of life was yielding to a new, as yet uncharted, way
of life.
</P>
<P>
   In a century that has witnessed great achievements and
horrendous tragedies, no event has had a more far-reaching impact
on the world than the war that began 60 years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   As dawn broke over Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, German tanks and
troops blasted their way across its borders, and German planes
peppered the landscape with bombs.
</P>
<P>
   England and France, which until then had appeased Hitler,
decided they no longer could slumber in silence while the vicious
dictator conquered lands occupied by peaceful peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler, after he had subdued much of Czechoslovakia in 1938,
told British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Premier
Edouard Daladier that that was ``the last territorial claim I have
to make in Europe.'' But he lied. One year later, when he invaded
Poland, England and France declared war on Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after that, Mussolini, who had subdued Ethiopia and
was about to invade Greece and British Somaliland, declared war on
England and France.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, imperial Japan had invaded Manchuria and was seeking
to control China. The Soviet Union moved its troops into eastern
Poland while Germany took control of western Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the war raged across Europe and North Africa. It eventually
spread around most of the globe, ushered in the Atomic Age and set
the stage for a 40-year Cold War that ultimately would end with the
downfall of communism and the rise of the United States as the
world's single super power.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1941 Japanese attack on America's fleet at Pearl
Harbor, the deadly conflict engaged the United States and enveloped
large sections of Asia and the islands of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier, especially when the war began in 1939 and even when
Pearl Harbor was bombed, America was deeply divided between
isolationists and interventionists. Had it not been for Franklin D.
Roosevelt's leadership in providing arms to England and other
allies, including the Soviet Union, and in building America's own
arsenal, the United States, like England, would have been asleep
when Japan propelled it into war.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, its men went off to war, its women went into war
production plants, and Americans as a whole proved they had the
character and courage to face any adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Lives of people everywhere have been changed in the 20th century
by the automobile, the airplane, radio, television, computers,
atomic power, dramatic breakthroughs in medical research, motion
pictures and other great discoveries and inventions.
</P>
<P>
   But World War II was the seminal event of a century crowded with
momentous happenings.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 20, 1945, less than three months before his death,
Roosevelt defined one of the most enduring lessons of World War II.
Taking the presidential oath for the fourth time, the ailing FDR
declared: ``We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace;
that our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of other
nations far away. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned to be citizens of the world, members of the
human community. We have learned the simple truth, as Emerson said,
that `the only way to have a friend is to be one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Americans have learned that lesson. But fortunately
every president, Democrat or Republican, since FDR has understood
that America cannot survive as an island isolated from the rest of
the world.

OBSERVER RECOUNTS EAST TIMOR TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Burning houses. Predatory militiamen. Refugees so
terrified that they flung themselves over razor wire in a frenzied
attempt to reach safety. These and scores of other images from a
month of living dangerously in East Timor crowded in on Michael
Bhatia Wednesday as he rested at his parents' home in Medway.
</P>
<P>
   Bhatia, 23, who graduated from Brown University this year with a
degree in international relations and nw is a researcher at Brown's
Watson Institute for International Studies, was one of 600
foreigners monitoring, under United Nations auspices, last week's
referendum on the future of the tormented Indonesian territory. He
arrived home around midday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was smoke, burning . . . gunfire everyhere,'' he said.
As panicky civilians realized events were spinning out of control,
their pell-mell flight from East Timor by any means possible was
``like those pictures of the fall of Saigon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhatia said the referendum in favor of East Timorese
independence, ``was clean, a free and fair election.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were signs from well before the voting began that
Indonesian police and armed forces personnel were on friendly terms
with the militias, who turned murderous after the vote went against
them. On Aug. 17, when Indonesian forces paraded through Dili, the
East Timorses capital, in celebration of Indonesian independence,
militiamen were close by them, forcibly affixing pro-autonomy
stickers to civilian vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, referendum day and the days immediately following
were calm, and full of hope that the situation would be peacefully
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was such joy in people's faces,'' Bhatia said, recalling
two old men who walked into a voting place confused, figured it
out, and emerged, smiling broadly, to hug and shake hands with
foreign observers. ``There was so much faith in the international
community,'' he said, ``and a sense that finally their hour had
arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian police did a good job of maintaining order during the
balloting, Bhatia said, and ``you could sense their indecision,
their sense that the tide was turning on them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions rose steadily during the days while the ballots were
being counted, and attacks on independence advocates and their
homes gradually increased.
</P>
<P>
   After the UN announcement last Friday of the overwhelming vote
in favor of independence, attacks by the militias swiftly
intensified, and the heavily armed Indonesian police and armed
forces did nothing to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Mahkota, where the announcement was made and where
many foreign media and observers were lodged, came under heavy
attack, and thousands of people sought refuge in the bishop's
residence, the International Committee of the Red Cross compound, a
Silesian nunnery, and a school near the UN compounds, and other
religious sites and schools. Bhatia was in a nunnery, then moved to
a UN compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The militias had complete control of the streets, and the
(Indonesian) soldiers were applauding them,'' Bhatia said. ``It was
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 10 Sunday night the compound came under massive fire, and
people in a neighboring refugee camp panicked. ``Terrified refugees
were climbing over razor wire to get in'' to the compound, Bhatia
said. ``They were screaming, crying, pushing down the gates.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, he and a colleague from Brown rode to the
airport in a UN convoy and began the long flight home. ``God only
knows what happened to the rest of the people in those areas of
asylum,'' he said Wednesday.

DANFORTH ACCEPTS JOB TO HEAD WACO PROBE 

</HEADLINE>

and STEVE LASH

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. John Danforth agreed Wednesday to lead
an independent investigation into the government's final assault on
the Branch Davidian compound and information the FBI withheld about
the attack for six years, government officials said late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, a Missouri Republican, earlier had responded favorably
to Reno's request that he lead a team of investigators and early
Wednesday finalized negotiations with her deputies about the scope
of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Reno plans to announce Danforth's appointment at a news
conference scheduled early Thursday, according to officials who
spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who retired from the Senate in 1995, was unavailable
for comment. His law office in St. Louis declined to discuss his
immediate plans.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, 63, was state attorney general of Missouri from 1968
until he was elected to the Senate in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The Danforth-Reno agreement was reached as Republican members of
Congress stepped up pressure on the attorney general to appoint an
independent investigator with broad authority to examine the Waco
case and alleged cover-up by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau recently disclosed information _ which had been
withheld for six years _ that conflicts with sworn testimony by
Reno and FBI officials about the April 19, 1993, assault in which
more than 80 people died.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., joined
the chorus of Republicans calling for Reno to resign, saying he now
has doubts about who started the fire that ended the siege near
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general is ``apparently not getting to the truth
and not supervising adequately what happened,'' Lott said. ``The
combination of a series of events puts her in jeopardy in ... her
ability to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said his doubts about the origins of the fatal fire stem
from revelations that the FBI may have fired incendiary devices at
the Branch Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh, while acknowledging that
potentially flammable tear gas canisters were used, continue to
maintain that the fire was started by members of the Branch
Davidian religious sect.
</P>
<P>
   Lott was skeptical. ``There are doubts because questions have
been raised,'' Lott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping to Reno's defense was Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D. He said Reno ``deserves commendation rather than
criticism,'' and that ``under no circumstances'' should she resign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican who chairs the House
Judiciary Committee, called Danforth's appointment ``an important
first step to getting the truth'' about the FBI's final assault on
the Branch Davidian compound and warned Reno not to limit the
inquiry's range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Danforth must be afforded total independence and given
the necessary latitude so that his investigation will be
comprehensive and can earn the full confidence and support of the
public and Congress,'' said Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Danforth's investigation is truly independent, Hyde said
he will seek creation of a five-member, bipartisan commission to
examine the Waco incident and the FBI's withholding of information
from Congress and the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years has been too long to wait for the truth,'' Hyde
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., whose House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee has begun subpoenaing witnesses as part of an
inquiry into the Waco case, endorsed Reno's selection of Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing but the highest regard for Mr. Danforth and
believe he is an excellent candidate to run the investigation,''
Burton said. ``We would be happy to work with Mr. Danforth, but his
appointment won't alter or change our investigation into what
happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, an ordained Episcopal priest, has been associated with
the St. Louis law firm Bryan Cave since leaving the Senate. He is
an heir to the Ralston-Purina fortune and had a blue-chip
education, including undergraduate work at Princeton and law and
divinity degrees from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Danforth was on the Finance, Commerce and
Intelligence committees. He was a ranking member of the dwindling
group of Republican moderates in the Senate. At the end of his
three terms he was perhaps best known for his strong defense of the
nomination of conservative Clarence Thomas, a former aide, to the
Supreme Court.

REEBOK LAYS OFF 120 IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reebok International Ltd. laid off some 120 employees Wednesday,
about 10 percent of its work force in Massachusetts, as the
second-largest shoe manufacturer in the United States cuts costs
and attempts to restructure its business.
</P>
<P>
   More layoffs among Reebok's international work force _ about 10
percent _ may be announced later this month, according to company
spokesman Dave Fogelson.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok had employed about 6,600 employees, about 1,200 of them
in Massachusetts. Total layoffs of 10 percent company-wide would
bring the total layoffs to 660.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some very, very difficult conversations with
people in Stoughton today,'' Fogelson said, referring to Reebok's
headquarters. ``This remains part of our continuing effort to get
costs down more within industry norms. We are trying to become a
much more focused organization that will put resources up against
those components that are going to directly effect sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok declined to specify who was layed off. Fogelson said the
layoffs occurred ``at all levels, from vice president down through
the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok's market share has declined from about 25 percent to 10
percent in the 1990s, while Nike, Reebok's chief competitor, has
risen from about 25 to 47 percent market share, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Reebok reported a net income of $4.6 million or 8 cents
per share for the quarter ending June 30, down from $6.1 million or
11 cents per share for the year previously. Net sales were $697.4
million for the quarter, a decline from $760.6 million in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, general and administrative costs totaled $243.4 million,
or 34.9 percent of sales in the second quarter, and those costs
were singled out by Reebok's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Paul Fireman as an area of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``While our overall spending did decline, we recognize the need
to lower our SG&AMP;A spending to more acceptable levels,'' Fireman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts, who have questioned Reebok's comparatively high
costs, are likely to be pleased that the company is now moving to
control them.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok stock closed unchaged at 11 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Observers of the athletic apparel industry had said their
concerns about Reebok's performance were heightened recently when
other companies, including Nike and New Balance, began showing
evidence that the two-year soft market for athletic shoes was
turning around.
</P>
<P>
   Fogelson said it would be ``premature'' to discuss how much
money the company is saving in any of the cost-cutting measures now
being instituted or under consideration. He emphasized that not all
of the spending reductions are coming from layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok is engaged in a new effort to refocus its business toward
women's fitness products, its so-called classic lines of shoes and
styles that appeal to youths, he said, and more of the strategy
will become clear over the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Yankowski, president of Reebok, said in a written statement
released last week that ``a number of actions'' are being taken by
the company to turn around its performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of utmost important,'' Yankowski said, ``we're returning to
our roots in fitness and women, and to our heritage of providing
the most comfortable, stylish athletic footwear on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   One industry observer, who asked not to be named, said: ``Right
now, this all seems like it is heading toward Reebok looking more
like the company it was in the 1980s, when its pitch was more to
women and kids and less to high performance shoes for the serious
athletes; the basketball players, the cross-trainers and the
runners.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok began shedding expensive, major sports figures as
endorsers two years ago. But Fogelson made it clear that any
de-emphasis on high performance shoes will not result in the loss
of two high-profile athletes currently under contract, the tennis
player Venus Williams and the National Basketball Association
player Alan Iverson. Both Williams and Iverson are viewed by sports
marketing experts as emerging, young stars who are much coveted by
other shoe and apparel manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus and Alan will continue to be part of the company
throughout their careers, and as we continue to move forward,''
Fogelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Substantial severence packages, employment counseling and help
with job hunting has been offered to all of the employees, he said.
``I think the company is doing the best it possibly can given the
circumstances,'' Fogelson said.

CRITIC'S CHOICE: COMPOSERS WHO DEFY CLASSIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Songs of Life'
</P>
<P>
   For many musicians, the American composer Ralph Shapey, now 78,
is a towering master, a composer of flinty, astringent and utterly
original works. The larger public has never caught on to Shapey in
the same way. But his advocates keep making the case, notably the
cellist Joel Krosnick and the pianist Gilbert Kalish, who are the
principal performers on a new disk of chamber works called ``Songs
of Life'' on the Arabesque label (Z6728).
</P>
<P>
   Shapey's ``Evocation II'' for Cello, Piano and Percussion from
1979 demonstrates how hard it is to classify his music and how hard
it is to resist. The work opens in a fit, with a grumpy, skittish
cello line and some crash-bang piano chords. But the percussion
intrudes, as if to quell the fracas.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't exactly work. The piano gets stuck on a series of
pungent treble-range chords, and the cello plays almost obsessively
as the percussion surrounds them both with volleys of drums and
cymbals. Throughout its three movements this is viscerally powerful
music, especially in this performance, with the percussionist
William Trigg joining Krosnick and Kalish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs of Life'' for soprano (the excellent Lisa Saffer), cello
and piano sets portions of Walt Whitman's poems, but the words are
boldly rearranged, inverted, and combined with those of other
authors. The work is really a wondrously imaginative trio with the
voice as just one instrument. There is brash humor in the work as
well. In an extended section for hushed soprano and plucked cello
line, you would think you were at a moody jazz club of Shapey's
mind. The finale of the ``Evocation IV'' for violin (Joel
Smirnoff), cello, piano and percussion gets wild and ornery. But by
then you may have gotten the point. This music is difficult in an
exuberant way.
</P>
<P>
   `Riff and Transfiguration'
</P>
<P>
   Lee Hyla's new disk on the Tzadik label, ``Riff and
Transfiguration'' (TZ 7048), presents recent piano works by another
hard-to-classify composer, now 47 and in his creative prime. Hyla
wrote ``Third Party'' for his friend, the superb pianist Judith
Gordon, who wanted a piece to precede the Liszt Piano Sonata in a
recital she was planning. But this ear-opening, head-clearing
five-minute work is no mere curtain-raiser. It beings with eruptive
frenzy, a modernistic answer to Liszt's transcendental pianistic
visions. But it then settles into a reflective episode of
shimmering, ethereal chords, with wisps of restless figures trying
to break in here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic Training,'' written for the prodigious pianist Stephen
Drury, is a 13-minute work that tries to depict in music the
development of this intense and uncompromising pianist from
elemental early ages of pounding thuds through increasingly
expressive, searching musical flights. Drury's performance is by
turns captivating and terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riff and Transfiguration,'' written for the pianist Mia Chung,
is an 18-minute suite of seven movements. In its 12-tone-like
riffs, keyboard-spanning leaps, crunchy chords and atmospheric
colors you can hear Hyla foraging through his musical storeroom for
this and that remembered item. Yet the result is music of
tremendous imagination. The disk also offers a wonderfully eclectic
work for clarinets, hammered dulcimer, violin, viola, cello and
piano, ``Amnesia Variance,'' conducted by the versatile Drury.
</P>
<P>
   `Human Gestures'
</P>
<P>
   Four recent works by Scott Lindroth, 41, a composer on the
faculty of Duke University, are offered on a new recording, ``Human
Gestures'' (CD 808), from the invaluable CRI label. Clearly, being
original for originality's sake is not Lindroth's purpose. Each of
these works is steeped in some older music that fascinates him. Yet
his ear and mind are so keen that he cannot help being fresh.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Light,'' which sets excerpts from a text by Hildegard von
Bingen, the vocal line, sung here with shimmering presence by the
mezzo-soprano D'Anna Fortunato, is arching and urgent. But it is
folded into an ecstatic instrumental piece where skittish lines
chase one another impishly, and the game comes close to getting out
of control. The Dinosaur Annex Music Ensemble, conducted by Scott
Wheeler, give a vibrant performance.
</P>
<P>
   Lindroth consciously tries to pay homage to the past in his 1997
String Quartet. If you listen just to its surface, it may sound
like Janacek or Ravel. But the music is filled with quirky touches
and pulsating figures that display Lindroth's inventiveness.
``Terza Rima'' for oboe (Libby van Cleve) and electronics finds
Lindroth in a more spacious and roomy mode. The duo for Violins
(played by Curtis Macomber and Veronica Macchia-Kadlubkiewicz) has
echoes of the Italian Baroque, with its playful hocketing between
the violins. This is engrossing music, but only for listeners who
can forget about placing Lindroth in some compositional category.

A LOOK AT CHINA'S OFFER OF CONCESSIONS TO JOIN WTO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mcd) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grab it. So say many economists, referring to the bold trade
deal that China offered the United States in April and President
Clinton rejected in what many deem a serious foreign policy
blunder. Clinton can reverse when he meets President Jiang Zemin on
Sunday in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   China wants to enter the World Trade Organization in time for
the group's next meeting in Seattle in November, when the member
nations are expected to embark on a new round of world trade talks.
But before China can join, it needs Clinton's approval. So it
offered huge ``concessions'' on nearly every front.
</P>
<P>
   Concessions is the lingo of tradespeak. But the term is wholly
misleading. China's promise in April to open its economy to foreign
goods and investment would serve its own self-interest yet would be
largely irrelevant to the economic fortunes of the United States.
Some concession.
</P>
<P>
   Critics make three arguments for rejecting the offer. Delay
could achieve better terms in the future. The deal's nice-sounding
terms are unenforceable. And China's entry into the trade group
would flood U.S. markets with cheap textiles and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from an analysis of Daniel H. Rosen and his
colleagues at the Institute for International Economics, the first
criticism appears weak, the second misleading and the third
misguided.
</P>
<P>
   The precise terms of China's offer remain unpublished, though
the administration published a summary. The breadth of the offer is
stunning. China would drastically cut tariffs to levels less than
those of most United States trade partners. It would eliminate
export subsidies, phase out quotas on industrial products and
comply immediately with World Trade Organization rules for
protecting foreign investors and intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   China also agreed to phase out regulations that restrict foreign
companies from importing, exporting, wholesaling and retailing. The
offer would permit foreign companies to buy substantial stakes in
insurance and telecommunications companies. China also agreed to
have its state-owned enterprises make purchases on
nondiscriminatory terms, based solely on price, quality and other
commercial considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Schott of the institute said that these terms were
``substantially more liberal than those the United States had hoped
to get out of negotiations and substantially more liberal than
those which a number of existing WTO members, like India, currently
adhere to. You can't say that the terms of the agreement don't
measure up.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mastel of the New American Foundation, a prominent critic,
says that the deal is deficient on telecommunications and financial
services. He has a point. There is, for example, no firm provision
to eliminate nonperforming loans from banks, which serve as
disguised subsidies to state-owned enterprises. This omission
raises questions about China's commitment to run its state-owned
enterprises on a commercial basis.
</P>
<P>
   Mastel also criticizes the deal because, he says, it cannot be
enforced. China is not, he warned, ``a rule-based society'' that
makes decisions in ways that can be monitored and challenged. He
points to China's repeated violations of patent and copyright
protections.
</P>
<P>
   But here the administration must ask, what is the alternative?
In the absence of membership, China could continue many of its
protectionist ways with impunity. But as a member, China becomes
subject to the trade group's disciplinary process that has proven
to be impartial and unflinching.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. would lose the right to impose unilateral trade
sanctions against China once it joins the organization. But in
return, the U.S. would gain international backing for trade
sanctions so that every dispute does not turn into a bilateral
foreign policy spat. Also, China would be held responsible for
meeting market-opening commitments that go well beyond anything the
U.S. can now demand.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point to the fact that as a member of the World Trade
Organization, China would escape restrictions now in place on its
exports of textiles and apparel to the United States. But Marcus
Noland of the institute estimates that most Chinese sales here come
at the expense of imports from other countries, not U.S.
manufacturers. Indeed, the institute estimates that U.S. exports to
China under the trade deal would rise by about $3 billion. Imports
from China would rise by slightly more, so the overall effect on
the $8 trillion U.S. economy would be minute.
</P>
<P>
   The United States already provides China nondiscriminatory
access. So why does China bother to fight for admission to a club
whose benefits it largely enjoys already? Jiang apparently needs
the weight of international commitments to help overcome domestic
opposition to his ambitious plan to drive his economy away from
state controls and toward markets. That would appear to be an
ambition that Clinton would want to propel rather than sabotage. &QL;

PRESIDENT'S EXPECTED VETO LIKELY TO DOOM TAX RELIEF THIS YEAR, LOTT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CONGRESS-SPEND.) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said on
Wednesday that President Clinton's promised veto of the
Republicans' $792 billion tax-cut bill likely dooms any tax-relief
legislation this year, and sets up a major campaign issue for the
2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Firing the opening salvo in the biggest political battle in
Washington this fall, Lott all but ruled out any compromise with
the White House, saying there is not enough time to negotiate a new
plan for taxes and spending for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how we do it,'' Lott, R-Miss., told reporters on
the Senate's first day back to work after the August recess.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lott's gloomy outlook may just be a bargaining ploy to pressure
the White House to budge from its top offer of a $300 billion tax
cut. But Senate aides say Lott has calculated that Republicans
stand to gain more politically by doing nothing this year and
wielding tax cuts as a major campaign issue next year, than by
bowing to the president now.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These issues will come up in November 2000, and they'll be
settled then,'' Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, told reporters.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But congressional Republicans are divided over this strategy.
Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, backs Lott's hard-line
approach. Other Republican leaders, however, including House
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Rep. Dick Armey of Texas,
the majority leader, are willing to discuss a smaller tax package,
especially if it involves repealing the estate or marriage taxes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always pushing for tax relief,'' said John P. Feehery,
Hastert's spokesman. ``We don't want to give up.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Armey, said that tax cuts are
still the ``number one issue'' for House Republicans, who will meet
Thursday morning with their leaders to discuss what approach to
take if Clinton fulfills his veto threat. ``It's always the case
that lower taxes are better than higher taxes,'' Ms. Davis said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The White House has floated the idea of a grand bargain of how
to divide the projected $3 trillion surplus among tax relief,
federal programs and debt reduction. Clinton said in his national
radio address on Saturday that he would support a smaller tax-cut
bill in exchange for Republican concessions on Medicare, the
federal health insurance program for the elderly, including a
voluntary prescription drug program for senior citizens, and other
spending. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress will send the president the tax-cut bill on Sept. 14 or
Sept. 15, Lott said, adding that Clinton has shown ``no statement,
no willingness of any kind'' to negotiate the kind of tax cuts that
Republicans find acceptable. Ms. Davis, Armey's spokeswoman, flatly
rejected any deal that included additional spending.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats now feel that the political peril
of doing nothing on tax cuts is less than they perceived earlier in
the year. The public has largely absorbed the idea that doing
nothing essentially means plowing back much of the surplus into
reducing the national debt, which is popular among conservatives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the national debt keeps interest rates low and provides
flexibility on other fiscal programs. So for political and
substantive economic reasons, the default position of reducing the
debt is attractive.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is in a take-it-or-leave-it position and, for the most
part, so are we,'' said a senior Senate Republican aide. ``That
wouldn't be so bad. We'd still get debt reduction, plus it would
clear away the clutter and focus attention on the appropriations
process.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are positioning themselves to blame the other if
lawmakers are forced to dip into the Social Security surplus to
keep the government running next year, as current spending plans
would require them to do.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Politically, both sides are convinced that the issue of taxes
and spending plays in their favor, and sets up a classic
ideological fight.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans can claim that Clinton denied Americans a tax cut,
even after protecting Medicare and most Social Security funds, and
instead is seeking to increase federal spending.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans say that, like welfare reform, Clinton would be
forced to approve a tax-cut bill in an election year, a position
that many political analysts say is highly unlikely. ``Maybe next
year we'll pass another good, pro-growth tax-reduction package,''
Lott said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats could argue that it is important to keep a Democrat in
the White House to stop Republicans from giving away the federal
surplus in tax cuts to the rich, without addressing problems in
Medicare, Social Security and other domestic programs that help

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A deep gap over politics and values has opened
between the nation's increasingly conservative military elite and
prominent civilians without military service over the last two
decades, sowing latent distrust despite the respect each group
professes for the other.
</P>
<P>
   These are the first findings of a major study of military and
civilian attitudes, focusing on a problem that Defense Secretary
William Cohen has called a major challenge for him: ``to somehow
prevent a chasm from developing between the military and civilian
worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were few disagreements about foreign policy among
the two groups, the single most striking finding was political.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Americans divide about evenly between calling
themselves Democrats or Republicans, but the study found that 64
percent of elite military officers called themselves Republicans.
Only 8 percent said they were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A more modest gap on political identification had been measured
before. Comparable 1976 data found that 33 percent of military
officers identified themselves as Republicans and 12 percent as
Democrats. The 1976 survey did not cover values .
</P>
<P>
   The remainder, in both surveys, said they were independent or
had no political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling differences were found between the military
leaders and the potential military leaders, like students at
advanced schools like the war colleges, and prominent civilians who
had never served in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians were selected at random from ``Who's Who'' and
from other lists, like prominent women, the clergy, foreign policy
experts, labor leaders and the news media. Prominent civilians with
military service fell in between.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 45 percent of the military group favored barring
homosexuals from teaching in public schools, while only 17 percent
of the nonveteran civilian group did. Only 10 percent of the
military leaders supported a ban on the death penalty, while 37
percent of the civilians did. And 74 percent of the military group
backed permitting prayer in public schools, compared with 46
percent of the civilian group.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the differences can be explained by the fact that the
officers were almost all male, while the nonveteran civilian group
was two-fifths female.
</P>
<P>
   The results were taken from nearly 4,000 interviews conducted in
late 1998 and early 1999 as part of a $500,000 study that will
ultimately produce at least 20 academic papers. The study is
coordinated for the Triangle Institute for Security Studies, a
North Carolina foundation, by Richard H. Kohn, a professor of
history at the University of North Carolina, and Peter D. Feaver,
associate professor of political science at Duke University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first findings were the hot topic last weekend at the 95th
annual meeting of the American Political Science Association in
Atlanta. Further data are to be made public at a conference by the
Triangle Institute in late October in Caughny, Ill., including a
comparison with the views of the general civilian public that may
show the nonveteran elite more at odds with ordinary Americans than
is the military elite.
</P>
<P>
   In papers presented at the Atlanta meeting, scholars had more
fear of potential dangers than evidence of any impact of the gap
thus far. Professor Ole R. Holsti of Duke, who longed for the days
when generals like George C. Marshall never even voted, said, ``A
political military is worrisome if it just becomes another interest
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Charles Stevenson of the National War College said it
was ``scary'' to have ``an officer corps so overwhelmingly
Republican.'' ``In the 19th century, officers frequently had
political alignments,'' Stevenson said, ``but they did not favor a
single party consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin O. Fordham, assistant professor of political science at
the State University of New York at Albany, said the gap in beliefs
had not affected either military spending or the rates of
enlistment and re-enlistment. But the professor said he worried
that Democrats might not take seriously warnings from a military
establishment that they perceived as overwhelmingly Republican.
</P>
<P>
   One clear finding was a widespread unhappiness in the military
with current trends in civilian society. But despite the generally
high regard the public holds for the military, there were some
clear measures of latent civilian distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Support for the military drops, even precipitously, as
connections to the military disappear,'' wrote Feaver and Paul
Gronke, assistant professor of political science at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one percent, for example, of the civilian nonveteran
elite said they would be disappointed if a child joined the armed
forces. Just 7 percent of the military officers felt that way. On
the other hand, 77 percent of officers agreed with the statement
that ``civilian society would be better off if it adopted more of
the military's values and customs;'' only 43 percent of civilian
elites with military experience agreed and just 25 percent of the
nonveterans agreed.
</P>
<P>
   One simple explanation for some of the gap is the differing
attitudes of men and women. Women comprise 41 percent of the
civilian nonveteran elite, but only 8 percent of the military
elite. Feaver said in an interview that on many of the issues
examined, as much as half the difference between military and
civilian opinions could be attributed to the relative conservatism
of men.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference between the Republicanism of the more than
600 almost all-male officers surveyed and the nearly 700 nonveteran
civilians is only marginally related to the preference of women for
the Democratic Party. The most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll
showed that 29 percent of the public were Republicans and 31
percent Democrats. Among men, 29 percent also said they were
Republicans but just 26 percent identified themselves as
Democrats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the nonveteran civilian elite, 30 percent called
themselves Republicans and 43 percent Democrats, while among
veterans, 47 percent identified themselves as Republicans and 23
percent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans averaged nearly 60 years old, while the nonveterans
averaged around 50.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two other military groups were also surveyed, nearly 400
officers in the active reserves and 1,700 students in the Reserve
Officers Training Corps in colleges and cadets and midshipmen at
the service academies, who were identified as ``pre-commissioned''
respondents. Among the reservists, 63 percent said they were
Republicans and 10 percent identified themselves as Democrats,
while 47 percent of the students said they were Republican and 12
percent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Holsti said it was clear that the Republican trend in the
military began well before President Clinton took office. There is
considerable tension between the administration and the military
over Clinton's avoiding the draft, his attempt to remove barriers
to homosexuals in the services, and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Holsti also said the Republicans in the military were not
extremists; only 13 percent called themselves ``very
conservative.'' They rejected propositions such as removing books
attacking religion or promoting communism or homosexuality from
library shelves by the same sort of overwhelming majorities as
others in the study.
</P>
<P>
   On military and foreign policy questions, there were a large
number of agreements between the nonveterans and the military
elite. Both overwhelmingly supported using the United Nations to
help settle international disputes and felt the American public
would not tolerate large numbers of casualties in military
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups heavily rejected the idea that military, rather than
political goals, should govern the use of force. Both disagreed
sharply with the statement, ``We shouldn't think so much in
international terms but concentrate more on our own national
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also clear differences. Among the nonveterans, 59
percent agreed with the statement that ``American national security
depends more on international trade and a strong domestic economy
than on our military strength.'' Only 37 percent of the officers
agreed. And 65 percent of the officers but only 43 percent of the
nonveterans agreed with the proposition that ``There is nothing
wrong with using the CIA to try to undermine hostile governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohn said in an interview that when the study is completed, ``We
are likely to have a set of conclusions that are complex.'' He said
the current level of discussion of the issue ``tends to be one of
extremes,'' either arguing that the differences between military
and civilians are of no consequence, or that they raise the threat
of a breakdown in civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   The professor said it was important to identify the differences
that were new, and also those that did not simply represent the
fact that the military was an ``unusual and very different
profession.''

60,000 CELEBRATE COMETS' THIRD STRAIGHT TITLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Red, white and blue confetti coated downtown Wednesday
as thousands of basketball fans congratulated the Houston Comets on
their third straight WNBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   They simultaneously celebrated the life of feisty point guard
Kim Perrot, who lost her battle with cancer in August.
</P>
<P>
   A party atmosphere permeated the parade from start to finish,
and the rally that followed, despite the crowds and the relentless
midday heat. The city Parks and Recreation Department estimated
that 60,000 people flooded downtown for the events.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd kicked it up a notch when the players _ holding the
three, Tiffany-designed trophies _ passed by, atop a fleet of fire
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got goosebumps,'' said Jessica Pompa, 26, who took a break
from cutting hair at Mueller's Barber Salon in downtown Houston to
watch the parade. ``This is so exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyesha Campbell, 15, a Furr Senior High School basketball
player, was too emotional to talk after she caught a Comets cap
forward Sheryl Swoopes threw to the crowd from her perch on a fire
engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came back to where we were, crying and shaking,'' said
Margie Martinez, 40, head coach of the school's girls basketball
team. ``I thought something had happened to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was still visibly moved, shaking like a leaf and her
eyes welling up with tears when anyone asked about the cap, signed
by Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Tezano, 37, did a little dance to a jock-jam song being
played by one of the high-stepping high school marching bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm dancing,'' he said, unembarrassed about his public
display of affection for the Comets. ``Why not? This is good. We
got a three-peat!''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Lee Brown gave all the players keys to the city,
proclaiming Wednesday ``1999 WNBA Champions Houston Comets Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it bears repeating that the Houston Comets are our
hometown heroes,'' he said. ``They built a dynasty. They put womens
sports on the map, and in doing so, they have forever, forever, and
ever, linked womens sports to the city of Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared loudest when Brown touched on how the Comets'
singular accomplishment has put Houston in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I said that the Houston Comets were the best in the
game,'' he said. ``This year, I want to say that I believe that we
can all say that the Houston Comets are one of the greatest teams
in sports history!''
</P>
<P>
   Office workers dumped bags of plastic foam packing peanuts from
the upper stories of skyscrapers, so much so that it looked like it
was snowing along some sections of the eight-block parade route.
</P>
<P>
   But there were solemn moments as well. Near the beginning of the
parade, the memory of Perrot was evoked by a fire engine with huge
white ribbons on the doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a sparkplug,'' said Barbara Wade, 55, who was wearing
a T-shirt with ``Three for Kim'' written on the back. ``I thought
her death would affect them, but they came through for her. I'm
sure she's here in spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   As a basketball coach and former player, Martinez marveled at
how the team persevered over its trials and tribulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider everything they had to overcome, and still take it to
that next level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also mentioned the Comets season of triumph and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to the WNBA championship was a bittersweet journey
for the Comets with the loss of our dear, beloved friend, Kim
Perrot,'' he said. ``But it was apparent, it was clear, that her
spirit was very much alive throughout this championship series.''
</P>
<P>
   When guard Cynthia Cooper stepped forward to speak at the rally,
the first thing she did was hold the index finger of one hand up,
and make a fist with the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anybody know what that means?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd knew that it was the symbol for 10 _ Perrot's
jersey number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well then raise your hand and don't be shy, I want to see
everybody all the way in the back, all the way in the back,''
Cooper said. ``That's right, Kim will always be with us.''
</P>
<P>
   She said of the championship, ``This was a tribute to Kim.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the irrepressible Cooper said, ``Can I get a boom
shakalaka!''
</P>
<P>
   And the crowd gave her one.
</P>
<P>
   Other players took the microphone in turn, to thank the fans for
their support.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the rally, the fans seemed reluctant to go. Some
stayed to hear a high school band play, while others lined up to
buy souvenir t-shirts from a vendor with the words ``three-peat''
emblazoned across the front in Comets colors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps diehard fan Christen Crawford, 22, of Houston, said it
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get any better than the Houston Comets.''
</P>

WEB VENTURE PUTS CLASS NOTES FROM COLLEGE LECTURE COURSES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ohio, Mich., Mass., Colo., Calif., Va.)  (bl) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Students at Ohio State, Boston and Michigan State Universities,
take heart: you may never have to take notes in a lecture again,
nor will your counterparts on 59 other large campuses across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   An upstart Internet venture called StudentU.com is hiring
students this semester at 62 universities and paying them to take
notes in as many as 50 core courses per campus. The note takers
post their jottings, within 24 hours, on a central Web site. Among
the dozens of notes already listed are those taken Tuesday during
John Syer's course on world politics at California State University
in Sacramento and on Aug. 24th during Robert G. Schwebach's lecture
on financial markets at Colorado State University.
</P>
<P>
   The service, which first went online Wednesday, is free. And the
stenographers, most of them hired through their fraternities and
enrolled in the courses, are paid $300 a semester to open their
notebooks to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The creator of the site, Oran Wolf, a 27-year-old graduate of
the University of Texas at Austin, who hopes to earn a profit
partly through advertising, said he started the service to help
students augment their own notes or to help them catch up after a
sick day. But he conceded that his offerings could be abused by
those with less legitimate excuses, like chronic oversleeping or
lingering hangovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't believe students should skip class,'' Wolf
said Wednesday from his Houston office, as he admitted that he, on
occasion, had done just that. ``It is important for them to attend
the class, use this information as supplements to the course and if
they do that, they are going to make A's.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of critics who believe that the arrival of
Wolf's venture _ along with other Web sites that sell sample term
papers and synopses of great books _ signals nothing less than the
erosion of liberal education, if not civilization.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Edmundson, a professor of English at the University of
Virginia, one of the schools where Wolf has set up shop, believes
that the problem lies more with universities _ and their reliance,
often for financial reasons, on 300-student lecture courses _ than
on those trying to beat the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something sleazy about students taking notes and
selling them on the Web,'' Edmundson said. ``But if you can buy the
notes and satisfy the course requirements, maybe the course should
have been distributed as a book, rather than having this charade of
somebody standing up and going through a lecture that, for all
purposes, doesn't change from year to year, and doesn't allow
students the possibility of discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Wood, a professor of anthropology and the associate
provost at Boston University, which is also on Wolf's list, said
the university might consider taking legal action once notes from
the school appear on the site _ which, as of Wednesday, they had
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am troubled by it because I, like thousands of faculty
members, spent a great deal of time developing my courses within a
specific intellectual context, a context that I control,'' he said.
``For someone who is not educated in my field to offer what could
be erroneous versions of that material, without my permission,
strikes me as something which could potentially be illegal. It's
certainly offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said the seeds of his idea were first sown while he was
studying economics at Austin, when he had occasionally taken
advantage of a similar service there: for $30 per class, a private
note-taking firm would arrange for him to get paper copies of any
notes that he might have missed.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1995 and moving to Houston, he learned that
the university there had no such service, and so he founded his
own. Initially taking 10 hours of notes a day himself, he quickly
expanded his operation to include about 3,000 subscribers _ they,
too, paid $30 for each of 120 classes _ and about 40 note-takers.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said professors at the University of Houston were initially
wary of helping him and his note-takers gain access to classes, if
they were not enrolled. But he said he won them over when they
realized that attendance did not drop as a result.
</P>
<P>
   When Wolf discovered that such services were rare on other
campuses, he said he decided to take his operation national. With
an investment from Net Strategy, a Houston company that has
nurtured other Web companies, and a rolling banner of
advertisements that includes the Capital One Visa Platinum Card,
Wolf began recruiting note-takers at fraternities at 62 of the
country's largest colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not necessarily looking to hire top students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of your best note-takers aren't straight A students,'' he
said. ``They might have a kind of learning disability, a test
anxiety, where they don't do well on tests. But they might take 15
pages of notes on a given lecture. What I look for is a dedicated
student who attends class religiously.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among those who were tantalized by his offer to pay $300 per
semester, plus $200 for every five note-takers recruited, was Anje
Castro, 22, a senior at California State University-Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that it was a really, really easy way to make
money,'' said Ms. Castro, whose major is international business.
``I have to go to class anyway. It's a good incentive to take
better notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Castro was hired to provide notes on Professor Wendell
McCulloch's international law class, which she was already taking.
So far, her correspondence has been brief, given that the class has
met just once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already have homework,'' she wrote, on Aug. 31.
``Bummer....Just read in the book pages 1,2,5,6,10-12, 17, and
26-28. All are in chapter 1: Introduction to International and
Comparative Law.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Because he has assembled his operation so quickly, using
students already in courses, Wolf said he would not be asking
professors for permission to broadcast their notes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many are likely to be as surprised as Syer at Sacramento,
who learned from a reporter Wednesday that his introduction to the
world's 10 largest countries had been reproduced by an anonymous
note-taker for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not unalterably opposed to this dissemination,'' he said.
``I'd just like to know how wide my audience is. I'm going to get
up there and take on the policies of the U.S. government, the
policies of the Indonesian government, the policies of the Chinese
government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think this is something that is going to be quoted
globally,'' he said, ``it may change what I say''

HUGE SINGER COLLECTION OF CHINESE ART IS BEQUEATHED TO THE
SMITHSONIAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Austria, Hungary)  By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Smithsonian Institution announced Wednesday
that its Arthur M. Sackler Gallery had been left one of the leading
collections of ancient Chinese art still held privately, 5,000
pieces from the estate of Dr. Paul Singer, a New York psychiatrist
who died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Milo Beach, the director of the Sackler, said that a preliminary
estimate put the value of the collection at $50 million to $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It places us in a position of extraordinary strength in terms
of the culture of ancient China,'' Beach said.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the bequest, the Sackler has displayed 18 objects from
the Singer collection, including a 3,000-year-old bronze bell, a
4,000-year-old jade disk, a marble sculpture of a bear, wine
containers in animal shapes and ceramic burial jars made to look
like farm buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell K. Hearn, the curator of Asian art at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York, who knew Singer well, said of the
collection, ``It is an assemblage that is distinguished by its
breadth of interest and exquisite quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearn said that the Met was not surprised that Singer had left
his collection to the Sackler. ``We realized that Singer's
intention was always to see his collection placed with that of
Arthur Sackler, whom he admired a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sackler, who died in 1987, was also a psychiatrist, a colleague
of Singer's and a leading collector of Asian art.
</P>
<P>
   Singer was born in Pressburg, Hungary, and started acquiring
Asian art as a boy in Vienna, where he grew up. He became a
neuropsychiatrist there, fleeing Austria in 1938 to escape the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   He went first to London, to await an American visa, and then New
York, where he was found after six weeks to be suffering from
tuberculosis and spent the next two years recuperating in the
Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He acquired Chinese art with renewed fervor in his adopted
country,'' Thomas Lawton, the former director of the Sackler, said,
adding, ``The Singer gift is the largest and most important group
of Chinese archeological material from a private American
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer died at the age of 92 at a nursing home in New Jersey,
leaving no family members as survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn, the Met curator, said that there was barely a space in
Singer's apartment not taken by an exquisite piece of art.
</P>
<P>
   Singer purchased his first East Asian object at the age of 17,
which Lawton described as a ``finely detailed bronze image of the
Bodhisattva Manjusri with a multicolored lacquer surface.'' Lawton

   The young collector, the Smithsonian said, ignored the
prevailing popularity for late Chinese porcelains and instead
collected early archeological objects that were just beginning to

Chu in southern China from the eighth to the third century B.C.

at the Met, where Hearn described him as ``a real mentor figure,''
and he was the author of scholarly papers and several books on
Asian art, including ``Early Chinese Gold and Silver'' (1971) and
``Early Chinese Miniatures'' (1977).

<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ By the time Dan Quayle made it to the Rotary
Club breakfast here at 7:30 a.m., he had already finished two radio
interviews and was bursting to offer this latest audience his
distinctive conservative refrain: an embrace of family values, a
call for a 30 percent tax cut and his lamentation over what he
views as the dark spiritual legacy of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But when the former vice president concluded his remarks, he was
met with another variation of the question he encounters at almost
every turn these days: Why, given his weak showing in last month's
Iowa straw poll, and the overwhelming signs of Republican support
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is Quayle staying in the race at
all?
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it is over,'' Quayle said, displaying just a slight
edge of frustration at hearing the question again, this time from a
Rotarian. ``It is NOT over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plead with my party members, `We need to have a serious
debate,''' Quayle continued, adding: ``The Republicans are on the
verge of saying to the Republican Party and the primary voter that
we're going to have a coronation, that we're not going to have a
serious primary. That would be most unfortunate, and it would
diminish our chances in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, whose slingshot career has given him a glimpse of both
the heights and the depths of American politics by the age of 52,
appears to be back at the bottom of his political trajectory. Since
his eighth-place finish in the Iowa straw poll _ only two
candidates fared worse, one of whom did not even compete in the
nonbinding contest _ some of Quayle's aides have quit for other
campaigns, his old friends from the White House privately describe
his presidential ambitions as hopeless, and he is drawing small
crowds and perfunctory attention from the news media. Even a
signing for his new book in Boston on Tuesday that was advertised
to last for 90 minutes petered out after 20, as the lunchtime line
of autograph seekers dwindled away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with poignant tenacity, Quayle perseveres, motivated by the
political vindication he has pursued since he was sworn in as vice
president 10 years ago, and by the dogged belief in the possibility
of success.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's daybreak schedule here over Labor Day was
typical: He managed two television shows, a parade and two picnics,
all before dinner. There is, it seems, no invitation that he will
not accept. Labor Day morning found the former vice president of
the United States hustling down a set of stairs into a basement
entrance to the Milford Town Hall, which was closed except for the
cramped room serving as the studio for the local cable television
show that was giving Quayle an hour of time.
</P>
<P>
   For Quayle, the prospect of becoming the Republican nominee for
president in 2000, as fanciful as that seems to many in his party,
remains a realistic goal, if admittedly a difficult one. It is
simply a matter of conservatives rallying around him as their
ideological alternate to Bush, Quayle said. And then, he continued,
it is simply a matter of Bush's campaign collapsing,
notwithstanding its continued signs of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, the conservatives will have to take a deep breath
and ask themselves this question: Who is the conservative candidate
that is most qualified, and has the best chance of defeating George
Bush and ultimately prevailing against Bradley or Gore?'' Quayle
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, if I didn't think I had a good chance of winning _
why spend 18 hours a day, six, seven days a week doing this?'' he
asked. ``There are other things in life. The moment I'm convinced
that I can't win, then I won't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt, as Quayle asserts at every chance, that
he brings a strong resume to the race. He has far more governmental
experience _ he is a former representative, senator and vice
president _ than any of his Republican opponents. Indeed, he was
serving as vice president to Bush's father when the younger Bush
had shown hardly a glimmer of interest in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the conservatives in the race, Quayle has won
election to public office. And he has a cogent ideological appeal
that impresses his audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that does not seem to be enough. As Quayle turns all his
attention to this state and its first-in-the-nation presidential
primary, he is finding that his most daunting opponent is not the
Texas governor, but himself _ or rather, the frozen image of
himself as a hesitant and intellectually slight figure that even
Quayle acknowledges is the legacy of his vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt about it: The introduction that I had to the
American people, that was totally unfair, is something that I have
to deal with today,'' Quayle said, bristling at the memory. ``The
unfair, outrageous, false coverage. From day one, from the
introduction, it was all BOOM _ totally, 100 percent negative.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is reminded of this more often than he would like. As he
marched cheerfully along the parade route in Milford on Labor Day,
Beverly Simpson, 75, met his smiling glance with a stern shake of
her head, turning away as he sought to greet her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he ought to drop out and let Bush have it,'' Mrs.
Simpson said. ``I don't think he is the man for the job. Mark my
words _ I don't think he has the makings of a president.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's most enthusiastic supporters, after ticking off what
they say should make him a particularly attractive candidate in
this conservative state, acknowledge that his candidacy remains
extraordinarily problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I call the next-door-neighbor-people problem,'' said
John H. Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire and Quayle's
biggest supporter. ``They say, `I really think he's great, but how
are you going to convince my neighbor to vote for him?' And you
talk to the neighbor and they say, `I think he's great, but how are
you going to convince my neighbor to vote for him?'''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle suggests that the only way to counter the argument that
he cannot win is, obviously, to win. Yet he acknowledges that there
are people who will not vote for him because of the perception
cited by Sununu, and seems flummoxed as he considers this
contradiction of his political situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rely on others to go back 10 years ago, or whatever the
case may be, to some false caricature that we know is totally not
true,'' Quayle pleaded to listeners on WGIR-AM in Manchester on
Tuesday morning. ``Go with what's in your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the candidate shows no signs of flagging,
offering an energetic and ideologically distinctive agenda that
inevitably invites a comparison with the more general agenda
offered by Bush. Quayle supports a 30 percent cut in taxes. He
advocates 12-year term limits for members of Congress or,
alternately, a constitutional amendment that would stop the
pensions and health-care benefits of lawmakers after 12 years. And
he believes students should be allowed to grade their teachers
anonymously, as a way of improving education.
</P>
<P>
   But Quayle's overwhelming theme is a return to what he describes
as traditional values. It is what has come to define his political
views since he gave a speech assailing the television character
Murphy Brown after she decided to give birth out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, Quayle said, are understandably jubilant about the
state of the economy and their material lives. ``But ask them how
are they doing inside,'' Quayle said. ``Their hearts ache. They can
see the cultural decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reclaim values that made America great in the first
place,'' he continued. ``Reclaim values like respect. Integrity.
The value of faith. The value of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Quayle's words have some appeal here.
``I like everything he stands for _ family values,'' said Kevin
Currie, 32, a forklift operator. ``I don't think the press treats
him fairly at all.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In pushing his quest for the presidency, Quayle takes solace in
his own history of come-from-behind victories, and he often
suggests comparisons to another once-discredited vice president who
went on to become president, Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon succeeded because he spent eight years creating a new
public image for himself; Quayle has resisted friends' advice that
he do the same thing, arguing that to attempt that would be to
affirm, in effect, an unfair caricature.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have advised Quayle over the years think that
given the crowded current field, which includes a number of
candidates who have Quayle's ideology without his history, it is
unrealistic to think that the former vice president could succeed
even if Bush were to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid I think that's fanciful,'' said William Kristol,
who was Quayle's chief of staff in the White House and is now
editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. ``That's
wishful thinking in the extreme. But I can see how he believes it.
I mean, maybe it should be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   And these days, as Quayle makes his last stand in New Hampshire,
it seems hard to quarrel with Kristol's assessment. As Quayle was
stepping briskly around a turn in the Milford parade, he came upon
a marquee. It was scattered with a jumble of letters, but one word,
evidently a greeting for Quayle, stood out: ``potatoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle looked toward the sign, and then his gaze floated away as
he turned to the other side of the street with a wave to the crowd,
and quietly finished his march to a van waiting to take him to his
next stop.

ON THE MENU AT PLANET HOLLYWOOD: BANKRUPTCY AND RESTRUCTURING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Ill., Saudia Arabia, Singapore,)   By DENNIS BLANK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Despite complaints about its food and
difficulties attracting younger people and repeat customers, the
glitzy Planet Hollywood restaurant chain can still flourish, by
closing unprofitable outlets and by ``going back to the basics,''
says Robert Earl, its co-founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Then, again, Earl does not see why the chain, which is known for
its celebrity tie-ins and movie memorabilia, has not flourished
yet. ``I can't give you one reason,'' Earl said when asked why the
chain, which also operates Official All-Star Cafe restaurants, had
suffered huge losses. ``I am the largest loser. I haven't sold one
share of stock from day one, but I am still as infused with it as I
was when we started.''
</P>
<P>
   According to documents filed with the Security and Exchange
Commission, Earl owns more than 22.8 million shares of stock that
traded at $32 each at their highest point in 1996 but are now
virtually worthless. Keith Barish, producer of the movie ``The
Fugitive'' and a co-founder, sold half of his 12 million shares at
a big loss. He resigned in March as chairman but is still a
director.
</P>
<P>
   Earl is still paid an annual salary of $600,000 plus expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted last week as
the price of Planet Hollywood dropped to 75 cents a share after the
company said it would file for bankruptcy by the end of the year.
The company has lost more than $306 million in the last year and a
half, including a loss of $28.2 million in the quarter that ended
in June.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and Ong Beng Seng of
Singapore have also both invested heavily in the company. As part
of its restructuring plan, they and Earl will each put $10 million
in cash equity in exchange for a 70 percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and lenders that hold $160 million in notes will be paid
off with $47.5 million in cash, $60 million in secured
payment-in-kind notes and new common stock representing a 26.5
percent equity state in the reorganized company.
</P>
<P>
   The company will cancel all existing shares of common stock and
issue stockholders 200,000 three-year warrants that will allow them
to buy stock at an undisclosed future price.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Earl brought in William Baumhauer, a former
accountant and chief executive of Unique Casual Restaurants in
Boston, to streamline operations and menus after complaints that
customers were not coming back to buy more $8 hamburgers. The
hamburger now costs $8.95, and Baumhauer left abruptly in June
after clashes with Earl. He did not respond to calls seeking
comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is getting them to come back the second time,'' said
Arnold Ursaner, an analyst with CJS Securities. ``They have got to
get consumers in local markets to come and continue to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl acknowledges that critics often cited the food quality, but
he maintains that the customers never complained. ``We are
attempting to upgrade,'' he said. ``Our basic menu is tried and
tested and is just what the consumer wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Lombardi, executive vice president of Technomic Inc. in
Chicago, a restaurant consulting firm, said: ``It is hard for them
to be competitive just as a restaurant. If you took out all the
movie stuff, would it still be a viable, competitive restaurant?
What has been their strength has also been a liability.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in getting repeat customers is like getting
someone to watch a movie more than once. By the fourth time, the
patron is not interested, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Isadore Sharp, founder of the Four Seasons Hotels based in
Toronto and a Planet Hollywood director until he resigned in April,
believes the downfall came from expanding too quickly. ``I think it
spread out too fast,'' he said, ``and there are many stores that
are still very profitable.'' He said the company needed to
eliminate the outlets that are not profitable and do some
``retrenching.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl would not say how many of the 80 restaurants would be
closed. It is expected that most of the nine All-Star Cafes,
including the one in Manhattan, which have promotional ties to
Tiger Woods, Andre Agassi and other sport celebrities, will be shut
down or sold.
</P>
<P>
   Ursaner, who is pessimistic about Planet Hollywood's chances of
recovery, is advising investors to seek ``better investment
opportunities.'' He also questions Earl's ability to manage
business operations when he is better at promotions and celebrity
connections. When Baumhauer left, Earl lost his ``operations
experience,'' the analyst said. ``Running the store day to day is
not his strength,'' he added.

DETROIT'S TEACHERS END STRIKE SENDING 180,000 STUDENTS BACK TO
SCHOOL   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBYN MEREDITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Detroit's public school teachers voted Wednesday to
end the strike that had kept the schools from opening this fall.
They, and the city's 180,000 students, will return to the
classrooms on Thursday, more than a week later than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the teachers back to school,'' said David Adamany,
leader of the Detroit School Board. ``We believe that the return to
schools will allow Detroit Public Schools to maintain the momentum
that was developed for improvements in the school system.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers voted Wednesday morning by an overwhelming measure
to return to work after their union and the school board reached a
tentative, three-year contract agreement on Monday night. They will
vote later this month on whether to ratify the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who had been scrambling to find child care breathed a
sigh of relief, and the union was also pleased that teachers voted
Wednesday to head back to the classroom, having received higher pay
and concessions on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have a staff that is much happier,'' predicted John M.
Elliott, president of the Detroit Federation of Teachers, the union
representing 11,500 public school workers, including 8,000
teachers. ``The kids aren't going to miss any days because we're
going to have to make it up,'' probably at the end of the school
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers voted 10 days ago to strike rather than to allow a
contract extension while negotiations continued between their union
and the school board.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers got some of what they wanted. Teachers with less
than 10 years' experience will get raises of 2 percent a year for
the next three years. Last week, when teachers were asked whether
to extend their contract so bargaining could continue, the school
board had offered raises of 1.75 percent in the first year, without
determining what raises would be in the second and third years.
</P>
<P>
   Because the most senior teachers in Detroit are paid less than
those in the surrounding suburbs, those with bachelor's degrees
will get raises of 4 percent and those with master's degrees will
get raises of 5 percent in the first year to bring them up to par.
In the second year, those teachers will get raises of 2.4 percent
and in the third year of the contract, they will get raises of 2.5
percent, Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   The school board agreed to reduce some class sizes starting next
year, rather than only to study the issue, which it promised last
week. There are as many as 41 students in some classes now, and the
board agreed to bring class size down to 17 students, where
possible, in elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have not formally ratified the contract and could still
reject it. The vote Wednesday only determined whether they would
end the strike. They are scheduled to vote on whether to accept the
contract over several days later this month, with results due on
Sept. 24. Because of the strong support displayed Wednesday for
ending the strike, Elliott said, ``I expect it to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled State Legislature earlier this year
transferred control of Detroit's 263 schools from an elected school
board to one appointed by Mayor Dennis W. Archer and Gov. John
Engler. Archer, a former special education teacher in the city's
public schools, said that he was pleased with the end of the strike
and that the tentative contract terms were fair.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle A. Zdrodowski, the mayor's spokeswoman, said Archer
believed the vote showed ``the teachers of the city of Detroit do
care about the kids, but they had some valid issues.''

MEYERS MOVING ON

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ I heard Terry Bradshaw the other day on a
radio show reflect on the fraudulence of public perceptions, and
how he himself throughout his career couldn't shake a widespread
belief that he had limited intellectual capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed up at the Pittsburgh Steelers' training camp my first
season with a heavy Louisiana drawl, and made a few mental mistakes
and the word got out that I was pretty dumb,'' said Bradshaw, who
turned out to be smart enough to lead the Steelers to four Super
Bowl titles and is now a high profile television personality. ``I'm
sure there are people who still think I'm dumb. Once someone hangs
a label on you, it's difficult to get rid of.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I constantly notice such a weird phenomenon. Jim Leyland
and Tony LaRussa have remained ``genius managers'' no matter how
badly their teams have played throughout the seasons, while
counterparts like Boston's Jimy Williams and San Francisco's Dusty
Baker haven't been similarly anointed even though the magic they've
performed with their teams has been infinitely more impressive in
recent times.
</P>
<P>
   I've read the prose of sporting authors who can't get out of
first gear and don't have even the faintest grasp of humor, and yet
such tedious types are revered figures on the national scene by the
fortuitous quirk of fate of being employed by a large-circulation
newspaper in a metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   I see people with big reputations on TV reading news that I
wouldn't hire to call out numbers at a bingo parlor. I've been
informed year after year by our elitist critics what unique
filmmakers Woody Allen and Spike Lee are, and the best thing I can
say about most of their work is that such rubbish is the perfect
antidote for insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   In our image-obsessed society in which people go hopelessly in
hock to wear flashy clothes, drive fancy cars and live in homes
that will inspire envy among friends, perception too often trumps
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Meyers, an All-Pac 10 guard and third team All American a
year ago for the UCLA football team, steadfastly believes that
perception is the reason he isn't playing in the NFL today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tag the pro scouts put on me was that I was slow and
didn't have the right kind of body,'' says Meyers, recently cut by
the Buffalo Bills. ``It didn't matter that I started 36 straight
games at UCLA, and graded out very high. It didn't matter that I
always did the job and seldom made mistakes. It didn't matter that
I was 6 foot 6 and weighed 315 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to the Bills' mini-camp in the spring, they
checked my fat content and told me to lose weight. So I came to
training camp in the summer weighing 295, and felt great. But I
didn't have the same power and strength I possessed when I weighed
315.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be a free agent in the NFL. Oh, there are some
who make it, but not very many. I know all the free agents I came
in with on the Bills are now gone. I think a team looks for ways to
get rid of you because of the fact you weren't drafted in the first
place and therefore you must not be that good. The guys drafted are
given all the opportunities at your expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, this is not sour grapes on my part. I'm not bitter
about my NFL experience. But it certainly wasn't enjoyable. I can't
believe how much politics is involved in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Meyers, Cade McNown's closest friend at UCLA and one of his
chief bodyguards for three seasons, understood that his chances of
sticking with the Bills were faint when he signed for a modest
$7,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I lost money trying to hook on with the Bills,''
says Meyers, who had a 3.5 GPA in earning a political science
degree at UCLA and is now weighing a couple of lucrative business
offers. ``You know what a free agent's pay is during the preseason?
Six hundred and seventy five dollars a game, which comes out to
four hundred and eighty dollars and eighty four cents after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets about my NFL experience because I know I
gave it my best. In our team's opener at Seattle, I played the
entire second half at tackle, and I thought I did a pretty good
job. I never got beat for a sack, and I graded out well. But it
made no difference. I was with the team for three more weeks, but
never got into a game again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved my line coach, Karl Mauck, who gave me great
encouragement and I think really liked me. If Mauck what have
gotten his way, I think the Bills would have kept me on the
practice team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was honest with me. He said team officials felt my legs
were too thin for my frame, and that they would be a hindrance when
a defensive lineman bull rushed me. Can you believe that?
Certainly, I don't have the perfect body. I'm not Jonathan Ogden
(former UCLA star now with Baltimore). But I can play this game,
and I think I showed it during that half I played against
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Meyers isn't exactly shedding tears about his brief NFL
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time for me to get on with the rest of my life
without football, anyway,'' he says. ``I've been playing the game
long enough as it is. I'm finished. No way I'm going to try again,
or play up in Canada, or in Europe, or in the Arena Football
League. I'm not going to chase a dream that's a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw guys out there playing ahead of me who made one mistake
after another, and just weren't doing the job. But they were
drafted, and that's why they were kept. I guarantee you had I been
drafted, I'd still be with an NFL team. But I wasn't, and I was cut
without being given much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really don't mind that much. I hated Buffalo. I'd rather
live in an outhouse in L.A. than a mansion in Buffalo. I have my
health. My knees are in one piece. I think getting cut was the best
thing for me. It didn't hurt a bit. Actually, I was relieved. But I
know in my heart I can play in the NFL despite what other people
think.''

CLINTON LEAVES TO ECONOMIC SUMMIT AS CRISIS SIMMERS IN EAST TIMOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As trouble brews in Asia, President Clinton leaves
Thursday for the region's annual economic summit where security
issues may dominate now that the Pacific Rim's trade engines are
humming again.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from 21 nations will arrive this weekend in New Zealand,
which is hosting the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. But
trade talks may take a backseat to the crisis in East Timor, the
recent China and Taiwan scrape and the renewed missile threats from
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants to press its Pacific Rim neighbors to
continue economic and political reforms that began with the Asian
economic crisis and could be slowed as the region shows renewed
vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news makes it all the more important yet also harder
to avoid complacency. This will be an important part of the
president's message at APEC. The work begun in crisis must be
completed, or Asia's bounce back may yet be the prelude to another
breakdown,'' said Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the president's national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, for instance, warned Indonesia it could face a loss of
international support for its economic reforms unless it quells the
violence aimed at independence-minded East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution of this crisis matters, not just for East
Timor, but for Indonesia as a whole. It is a test of whether
Indonesia is genuinely moving towards democratic rule and political
stability,'' Berger told reporters as he discussed the president's
APEC agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie and State Secretary Muladi
canceled plans to attend the APEC session because of the violence.
Marauding pro-Indonesia militiamen have murdered hundreds of East
Timorese and forced thousands from their homes since the
independence vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrives Saturday morning in Auckland after an 18-hour
flight and a move across the international dateline. Clinton plans
a series of sessions with other world leaders after his arrival,
beginning with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   He also will hold three-way talks with the South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. He
will meet later in the day with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin, Boris Yeltsin's latest choice in a string of premiers.
Clinton also will meet with New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's session with Jiang will be his first since the United
States mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia in May.
After the bombing, Jiang initially refused to accept Clinton's
telephone calls of apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seek in that meeting to restore momentum to our
relationship, to urge an easing of tensions between China and
Taiwan, and to resume discussion of China's accession to the (World
Trade Organization),'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The American and Chinese relations have been damaged by a series
of allegations such as accusations China tried to improperly
influence the 1996 election with illegal campaign donations and
that China stole U.S. nuclear secrets. China has denied these
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   China also renewed its saber rattling aimed at Taiwan, which it
considers a renegade province, after its leaders suggested
independence for the island. China and Taiwan also are at odds over
admission into the WTO. China wants the island admitted after its
acceptance; others want the two admitted at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will talk to the leaders of South Korea and Japan about
the situation in North Korea. Berger said the United States wants
to maintain a concerted approach with South Korea and Japan and to
discuss responses should North Korea again test a long-range
missile.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in three years, economic issues may not be at
the fore of an APEC session. The Asian economic crisis _ which
forced many nations into a deep recession _ appears to have faded
in most quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lasting economic recovery in Asia depends on more than open
markets. It will also require continued stability in the region,
which can never be taken for granted,'' Berger said. ``This is
where the United States plays an especially vital role, and it will
be an important part of our agenda at APEC, as the president's
schedule will make clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser, said the United
States and APEC leaders must ``send a strong message of support''
for launching a new round of World Trade Organization discussions
set to begin in Seattle this November. APEC members represent 45
percent of the global trade.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said a new WTO round ``would be one of the most
significant things that could be done worldwide for keeping up the
benefits that come with open markets in terms of growth,
innovation, competition and the free flow of ideas and freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   After APEC concludes, the president, traveling without first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, will fly to New Zealand's south island
to visit a Queenstown resort. He also may make an official state
visit to Prime Minister Shipley in Chirstchurch. The president will
return to Washington on Sept. 16.

INGRAM MICRO LOSES A CHIEF, AND ITS SHARES PLUMMET 31 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first two years after Jerre L. Stead took the job as
chief executive of Ingram Micro in August 1996, it looked as if he
had made an unconventional but smart bet by taking a big bunch of
stock options instead of a salary. His options gave him the right
to buy 3.6 million shares at $18 each, and the stock a year ago was
at $54.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, Stead's once-hot hand looked quite cold. He said
he would step down as chief executive, although he would remain
chairman, and with the stock closing at $13.31, the options were
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Stead is significantly behind because he exercised
options last December to buy one million shares for $18 million. As
of Wednesday, his position had lost $4.7 million, and he had had to
pay $8 million in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Stead has had quite a ride. Since taking over Ingram Micro, the
world's largest wholesale distributor of computer equipment, its
annual sales have more than doubled, to $25 billion from $12
billion. But margins have been squeezed because of heavy
competition and rapidly falling computer prices.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Ingram said it would earn 10 cents to 14 cents a
share in the third quarter, sharply below the 41 cents that
analysts had estimated. The company's profit margin will fall from
6.3 percent a year ago to below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third time in four quarters that Ingram has
disappointed Wall Street. Its shares Wednesday finished down $6, or
31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Stead said that in talking with Ingram's board
in several meetings over the last two weeks, he had decided to
initiate a search for a new chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came on board, I said I would only do this for three to
five years,'' said Stead, who is 57. ``Now it's clear that we get
more top level support and search for the person who will carry the
company forward.'' He also said he was confident that the company's
stock would rebound and that his paper losses would revert to
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, however, said it appeared that the move to find a new
chief executive was a direct result of the company's ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he was fired or he is falling on his sword,'' said Joel
Pitt, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Stead said the company had been suffering because there were too
many computer distributors, all trying to compete by lowering
margins. Earlier this year, Ingram decided to maintain its share by
lowering prices to match its competition, but now it is raising
prices again.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, however, is that computer manufacturers
have been cutting back on the rebates they have paid to Ingram and
other distributors as a reward for meeting certain sales goals.
</P>
<P>
   Stead insisted that the company's strategy was still sound.
Nonetheless, he said Ingram would not be able to regain health
until some of the smaller distributors failed or were acquired by
larger firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market will eventually consolidate and we feel good about
our ability to get a fair return,'' Stead said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCarthy, an analyst for Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said
computer manufacturers had an interest in supporting ailing
distributors to maximize the sale of their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Compaq's, Hewlett-Packard's and IBM's of the world are
keeping the weaker players alive by extending them credit,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pitt argued that however tough its industry, Ingram
appeared to have mishandled the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They attributed their problem to a horrendous competitive
environment, but we don't believe that,'' he said, pointing out
that Tech Data, the second-largest distributor, had not had as many
problems. Pitt attributed some of Ingram's poor results to a
cost-cutting campaign announced in March that eliminated 10 percent
of the company's 14,000 jobs. Morale is critical because much of
Ingram's business comes from its huge telephone sales force,
competing against other distributors every day for orders from
local dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kim Strohm, Ingram's investor relations chief, conceded
that the reorganization had slowed the company down.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were in too many meetings instead of being on the phone
selling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it would be difficult for Ingram to find a
suitable replacement for Stead, a veteran computer executive who
had been chief executive of Square D, AT&AMP;T Global Information
Systems and Legent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no success stories in this industry,'' McCarthy
said. ``The best companies are Ingram and Tech Data and that's only
because they have survived with mediocre performance. Jerre was
playing his hand pretty well for an industry that is oversupplied,
with low margins, and where prices change at the whims of the
manufacturers.''

U.S. PRIORITY IS TO MAINTAIN GOOD TIES WITH INDONESIA, OFFICIALS
INDICATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER and PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is resisting direct threats of
economic or military sanctions against Indonesia over the chaos in
East Timor in hopes of preserving its relationship with that vast
archipelago nation, even as the Clinton administration protests the
chaos that has left hundreds of Timorese dead, senior officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, these officials said, has made the
calculation that the United States must put its relationship with
Indonesia, a mineral-rich nation of more than 200 million people,
ahead of its concern over the political fate of East Timor, a tiny,
impoverished territory of 800,000 people that is seeking
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department is taking the lead in dealing with the
crisis. Hoping to make use of longstanding ties between the
Pentagon and the Indonesian military _ a relationship that dates
back to the early days of the Cold War, when Indonesia was seen as
a bulwark against communism _ the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, has telephoned Indonesia's military
commander, Gen. Wiranto, several times this week to discuss East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the two military leaders have discussed details of
Wiranto's plan to remove troops from East Timor who have allied
themselves with anti-independence militias and replace them with
soldiers clearly loyal to the central government in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian military leader is respected by Pentagon
officials for his military professionalism and is seen as the key
figure in the crisis, overshadowing President B.J. Habibie, who
appears to have little control over the situation and is distrusted
by many in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not unreasonable to give him at least 24 hours to get
folks there, and then you've got to give him a little time to bring
them under control,'' said a senior administration official.
``Wiranto knows that everybody expects to see real traction on this
very fast _ and very fast doesn't mean weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   While senior administration officials did not rule out the use
of sanctions, they acknowledged that the United States had no firm
plans to punish the Jakarta government if the violence continued.
The administration, they said, is willing to support an
Australian-led U.N. peacekeeping force in East Timor, but only if
it is invited by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we bombed in Kosovo doesn't mean we should bomb
Dili,'' said Samuel Berger, Clinton's national security adviser,
referring to the Timorese capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia is the fourth-largest country in the world,'' he
said. `It is undergoing a fragile but tremendously important
political and economic transformation, which the United States
strongly supports. The resolution of this crisis matters not just
for East Timor but for Indonesia as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that U.S. threats of a cutoff of economic or
military aid to Indonesia were not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of making threats,'' he said. ``It's a
question of stating what is simply a practical fact of life, which
is that it would be very hard for the international community to
continue to be of economic assistance if there is a chaotic
situation in Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The United States has little direct leverage over the Indonesian
military. As a result of human rights abuses attributed to the
military, Congress has sharply limited military aid and training to
Indonesia, and the total military aid package this year totaled
only $476,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if we have a military assistance program that
could be cut off,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a more potent means of punishing Indonesia
through what amounts to its veto power in the International
Monetary Fund, which has committed tens of billions of dollars in
emergency financial support to Indonesia as a result of the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington has been reluctant to threaten a cutoff of the
aid for fear that the result would be a new economic collapse in
Indonesia, further undermining its transition to democracy after
three decades of authoritarian rule under President Suharto, who
was forced from office last year. It could also harm U.S.
corporations that have large investments in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has focused its attention on
persuading Wiranto that he must step in personally to insure that
his troops stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said they are convinced that Wiranto is not
directing the violence in East Timor, but they said he has made few
efforts to reign in junior military commanders who may be
encouraging the violence as a means of blocking independence for
the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is trying to convince Wiranto that with order
restored, a U.N. peacekeeping force could be deployed to East Timor
and relieve him of the responsibility of controlling the militias
until there is a final decision on East Timor's political future.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a referendum last week that ignited the violence, an
overwhelming majority of Timorese voted for independence from
Indonesia, which invaded and annexed the former Portuguese colony
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official said Wednesday that the commander of
U.S. military forces in the Pacific, Adm. Dennis Blair, arrived in
Jakarta on Wednesday to carry the message to Wiranto ``that he has
the responsibility to bring this under control and he had better
belly up to that responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are also concerned that the crisis in
East Timor could disrupt the difficult relationship between the
Indonesian military and its civilian leaders, and could bring down
Habibie, who has been praised by the United States for pushing
ahead with democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that if the United Nations
sponsors an armed peacekeeping mission in East Timor, it will
almost certainly receive military support from the United States,
although not ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is not planning an insertion of any
peacekeeping troops,'' said Defense Secretary William Cohen. He
called upon the Indonesian government to act ``swiftly and
effectively'' to stop the militias. ``The government of Indonesia
is responsible for bringing order and peace to East Timor,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House news conference, Berger said that any
peacekeeping force would be ``overwhelmingly Asian in character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize that Indonesia is in Asia, and that the
Indonesians will respond much better to a solution here that is
dominated by the Asians and not dominated by the United States.''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Australia has volunteered to lead an
international peacekeeping force and provide 2,000 troops, but has
said that it will not go in alone.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have been in close contact with the
Australian government and that if the United States participated in
the mission, it would be likely provide communications, logistics
and intelligence support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at what is the appropriate level of assistance we
can give, whether it be logistical or technical support or other,''
said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``But I can tell you
that there's been no decision made on that.''

<HEADLINE>
HEY, ACADEMY, WHERE'S `BUFFY'? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  An open letter to the Academy of Televison Arts and Sciences (the
Emmy people): 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the first statuette is presented, before David Hyde
Pierce and Jenna Elfman blow their first air kiss, even before Joan
Rivers dresses down an overdressed celebrity, the 51st Annual Emmy
Awards (Sunday night on Fox) will go down in my book as a major
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   My ``Buffy'' isn't even a nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Neither are Sarah Michelle Gellar, Joss Whedon, Michelle
Williams or Joshua Jackson. Keri Russell was good enough to win a
Golden Globe, but she couldn't even muster a nomination for an
Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   Major oversights all, I say. ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,''
produced by Whedon and starring Gellar, was only the most
impressive series of the year on broadcast television. Russell and
her show, ``Felicity,'' created as much water-cooler talk as any
series on the air. And in 1999, Jackson and Williams settled once
and for all who the real stars of ``Dawson's Creek'' are.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these were deserving of the Academy's attention on Emmy
night, and that means more than as presenters. But the Academy,
either by oversight, geriatrics or lunacy, failed to honor these
worthy talents and their shows in major categories.
</P>
<P>
   Take notice, Academy: Your biases are showing. You waited a
long, long time to so honor anything on the young people's network
of a decade ago, Fox, until ``The X-Files'' came along. The Academy
still doesn't know what to do with one of the true classic series
of the '90s, Fox's ``The Simpsons.'' It gets shooed to animation
categories when it has deserved to be recognized as the best comedy
on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the advent of the teen drama on the young people's
network of this decade, the WB, may have sneaked up on those
dolting Academy members who don't know a ``Party of Five'' from a
restaurant reservation. But the simple, un-adult-erated fact is
that some of the most compelling shows during the 1998-1999
television season were dramas aimed at teens: ``Dawson's,''
``Felicity'' and my beloved ``Buffy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Academy, please read this and take notes: Gellar, who
portrays Buffy, happens to be one of the best actresses on
television. Your daytime counterparts thought so, too, which is why
she already has an Emmy on her mantle for her work on ``All My
Children.'' On ``Buffy,'' she has more than the shenanigans of a
mother like Erica to deal with; she is called on to carry a
prime-time show, spit out pages and pages of dialogue, cry and
laugh and, oh yeah, kick some vampire butt, and she handles it with
such command that it amazes me you haven't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   And you haven't noticed, because if you had, Gellar would be a
nominee this year, and Julianna Margulies or Gillian Anderson would
not.
</P>
<P>
   Gellar happens to work on one of the most inventive,
best-written shows on the tube. Which is why I was disappointed
(but not surprised) that ``Buffy'' was not nominated for best
drama. Creator-producer-writer Whedon, the most deserving ``Buffy''
person of all, deserves the right to take down all your names and
cast you as demons during Season 4.
</P>
<P>
   If you were paying attention, Academy, then Jackson and Williams
would be heavy favorites to win Emmys in supporting actor roles.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy, as I understand it, nominates by peer group.
Producers and actors submit examples of their work, and their names
and shows are placed on a big ballot. Actors vote for actors,
directors for directors, etc., then return the ballot to the
accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young. The results are tabulated and the
five top vote-getters receive nominations. The process is
fool-proof.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one thing: Most of the people who vote aren't teens
and obviously aren't watching all the nominees. If they were,
``ER'' or ``Law &AMP; Order'' would be off this year's list, and the
more deserving ``Buffy'' would be on.
</P>
<P>
   Academy, are you listening? Short of initiating teen Emmy
categories _ a slap in the face, if you ask me _ it's up to you to
DO YOUR JOB. The best deserve to be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Earnestly,
</P>
<P>

DANFORTH CHOSEN TO LEAD INQUIRY OF WACO RAID 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno has selected John
Danforth, the former Republican senator from Missouri, to lead an
independent re-examination of the FBI's tear-gas assault in 1993 on
the Branch Davidian compound, government officials said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After a hurried five-day search, Reno prepared to formally
announce Danforth's selection on Thursday, after meeting with him
on Wednesday at the Justice Department to complete discussions
about the scope and authority of his inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Wednesday, when Danforth was interviewed briefly by
Fox News after arriving in Washington, he said that the
investigation ``would be very daunting.'' Of his negotiations with
the Justice Department, he said, ``We've got to tie up some loose
ends,'' but did not discuss any details.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who during his three terms in the Senate established a
reputation for rectitude and independence, is said by officials to
have sought and received a broad grant of legal authority that will
permit him to look into any aspect of the tear-gas operation. He is
likely to have full prosecutorial powers to compel testimony,
demand documents and convene a federal grand jury if he decides it
is necessary to complete his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno turned to Danforth, after recent disclosures badly undercut
her credibility by showing, despite the agency's denials, that FBI
agents had fired combustible tear-gas rounds into a concrete bunker
near the cultists' ramshackle compound.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's choice of Danforth represented an attempt to quell the
bitter chorus of Republican criticism in Congress, an outcry that
grew louder on Wednesday when Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, told reporters: ``I am beginning to think that she
should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats quickly rallied to Reno's side. Sen. Thomas
Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said: ``I think
Janet Reno deserves commendation, not criticism. She has done an
extraordinary job under very, very difficult circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have kept up an almost daily battering of the
attorney general, accusing her of failing to aggressively dig out
the facts about who started the deadly fire at the Davidian
compound and misleading them about the ill-fated tear-gas
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism followed a succession of disclosures in the last
two weeks, including the fact that for more than six years the FBI
failed to say that it had infrared videotapes that clearly showed
that agents had sought and obtained approval to fire the
military-style tear gas rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Reno had said repeatedly in news conferences and
congressional testimony that the government had done nothing during
the 51-day siege of the Davidian compound that could have ignited
the deadly fire. Reno took responsibility for the government's
actions, but has steadfastly blamed the Branch Davidian leader,
David Koresh, and his followers for starting the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   None of the new evidence indicates that Reno has ever withheld
any information from Congress or that the FBI intentionally misled
anyone about the use of flammable tear gas rounds, although the law
enforcement agency has yet to officially explain how the new
evidence remained unnoticed for more than six years in the files of
the Hostage Rescue Team, the unit that carried out the assault.
</P>
<P>
   The new information has prompted Republican lawmakers to begin
plans to hold hearings on the Waco assault that could conflict with
Danforth's review by focusing on the same witnesses and evidence.
But on Wednesday, the leader of one inquiry said he would put off
his investigation. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, said he would withhold his planned
legislation to establish a five-member commission to study the
assault if the Justice Department cooperated with the Danforth
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, headed
by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., has issued subpoenas in preparation for
hearings. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah and chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, has said he had also planned to hold hearings.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, on the Senate's first day back after the August
recess, Lott criticized the Justice Department and the FBI for an
apparent lack of communication over the new information showing
that FBI agents fired the military-style canisters at the bunker
several hours before the main compound burst into flames.
Investigators later recovered the bodies of about 80 people from
the building.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott singled out Reno for his harshest remarks, saying that
the Waco revelations, as well as the president's decision on
Tuesday to offer clemency to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists over the
objections of law enforcement officials, ``lead me to the
conclusion that the attorney general should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest Waco developments culminate a long series of
Republican complaints about Reno. Lott, for example, has sharply
criticized Reno in the past for her refusal to refer a Justice
Department investigation of how the Democrats financed the 1996
campaign to an independent counsel. But never before had Lott
called on the attorney general to step down.

WHEN A MAN HATES A WOMAN ... IT CAN BE FUNNY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 2 stars

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Love Stinks'' is proof that even an awful,
poorly executed idea can be borderline entertaining if it has
enough funny jokes. This self-described un-romantic comedy will
make you feel dirty in the morning for laughing at it. But laugh
you probably will.
</P>
<P>
   A hateful little number that pretends to possess insight into
modern mating rituals, the film is basically an excuse for someone
_ our guess would be writer-director Jeff Franklin, who
incongruously also created the vanilla sweet TV series ``Full
House'' _ to work out rage against women. There's nothing merry
about this would-be ``There's Something About Mary.'' Still, the
consistently bilious wit at work here exerts a certain fascination.
</P>
<P>
   Not straining his imagination, Franklin cast the comically deft
French Stewart as sitcom creator Seth Winnick, a sweet-natured,
Elvis-loving boychild of a bachelor. He meets the charming, sexy
but ferociously marriage-minded Chelsea Turner (Bridgette Wilson)
at the wedding of his writing partner and best friend Larry Garnett
(MTV's Bill Bellamy). Chelsea is good pals with Larry's bride,
Holly (Tyra Banks), and the two women conspire to manipulate Seth
into proposing, like Holly did Larry.
</P>
<P>
   Two big differences, though: Larry was ready to settle down with
his lady, and Holly wasn't a borderline psycho.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after redecorating his bungalow, buying him a puppy,
moving in and seducing him with a drag number out of ``Viva Las
Vegas,'' Chelsea can't understand why Seth won't pop the question.
Frankly, neither could I; sure, she requires maintenance, but
Chelsea gives as good as she asks for, and she actually exhibits
more patience than Seth or the screenplay give her credit for.
</P>
<P>
   But since the story is told overwhelmingly from a male point of
view, Chelsea's tagged as the villain from the start. When matters
take a turn for the nasty at the movie's midpoint, her pranks are
portrayed as the cruelest and least reasonable. Our hero tossing
her cat off a pier and engineering a particularly vicious (but
pretty hilarious) bedtime gas attack is looked at as good, vengeful
fun.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is presented through anything like cinematography;
the visuals are pure sitcom setup (and the sound quality probably
doesn't even reach broadcast standards).
</P>
<P>
   But despite the movie's profound drawbacks, Stewart, Wilson and
Bellamy give the material all the commitment and comic zest they
can muster, former network executive Warren Littlefield makes an
amusing cameo as a network executive, and however unappetizing this
rancorous battle of the sexes gets, at least it sticks to its guns
and never goes soft-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-headed, maybe, but the ticker from which ``Love Stinks''
sprang is frozen to the consistency of battleship steel. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: ``Love Stinks'' (R; language, sex, mild violence). &QL; 
The stars: French Stewart, Bridgette Wilson, Bill Bellamy, Tyra
Banks. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress resumed the lifting on its spending
bills again Wednesday, what once looked like a spreading sea of
black ink in the federal ledger, the first surplus in 30 years, was
slowly turning to red.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are turning a projected surplus into a deficit, the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says. They may do so
despite cutting billions of dollars in pet projects and politically
popular programs, many members say.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to ``a ridiculous budget situation,'' Rep. David
Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations
Committee, said Wednesday on the House floor. No one rose to debate
that point.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House majority whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas,
said Republicans intended to empty the surplus and then force
President Clinton to sign their spending bills. The Republicans
were already using creative accounting to try to avoid appearing to
run the surplus into a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans spent the August recess talking about a
projected 10-year budget surplus that they said would underwrite
their proposed tax cut. But now Dan L. Crippen, the director of the
CBO, says no surplus is coming soon. The developing plans of
congressional Republicans could drain away at least $25 billion,
wiping out next year's projected $14 billion surplus and creating
an $11 billion deficit, he calculated during the recess.
</P>
<P>
   Making up that deficit could require tapping into Social
Security funds. Nevertheless, Republican leaders said Wednesday
that they were honor-bound to keep their hands off the Social
Security surplus. Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to restore
billions cut by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They are at an impasse with 15 working days to go until the new
fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. And Congress may not be able to pass
all 13 spending bills that finance the government before then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone expects us to get through all these bills
by Sept. 30,'' the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee,
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the bills are incomplete; two remain in draft. Beyond
that, the White House has threatened to veto seven bills because of
deep cuts made by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   With the deadline coming, the Republicans have three choices,
none pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   They can restore the cuts, and use billions of dollars of Social
Security funds to finance them. They can pass stopgap bills, called
continuing resolutions, temporarily financing federal agencies _ a
form of life-support system that can go on for months, but not
forever. Or they can shut down the government, and hope that voters
will not blame them next year.
</P>
<P>
   How did Congress arrive at this juncture?
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers blame themselves for passing the 1997 Balanced
Budget Act, which imposed strict spending limits on Congress and
has squeezed the spending bills, except the one financing the
military, uncomfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a total federal budget of $1.75 trillion dollars, roughly
one-seventh _ about $268 billion _ has been allocated under the
caps to pay for the operations of every government agency beyond
the Pentagon. The military will get about $270 billion, and the
rest goes to mandatory programs like Medicare and interest on the
federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Congress may have to resort to an extensive use of accounting
gimmicks to pass the bills. Wednesday Sen. Stevens said he favored
``an expanded use of an old mechanism'' that would juggle billions
of dollars to make the numbers appear to add up under the caps.
</P>
<P>
   He gave a hypothetical example of this mechanism. Say Congress
appropriates $12 billion for education. With a little legislative
legerdemain, Congress could say that $1 billion was spent in
September 2000, and $11 billion in the following 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   Then only $1 billion would count in fiscal 2000, and the rest in
fiscal 2001, the senator explained. This is perfectly legal. It is
also like putting credit card debt on another credit card.
Eventually, the bills come due.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the House began debate on a $92 billion bill
financing the Veterans Administration, the Department of Housing
and Urban Development and other agencies. It cuts about $7.6
billion from the White House's budget request, including $2 billion
from HUD, $1 billion from the space agency, and millions more from
various environmental programs.
</P>
<P>
   And the Senate once more took up a $14 billion Interior
Department spending bill. Several Republican senators have been
trying to amend the bill with measures favoring the oil, gas and
mining industries; Democrats have opposed them. Final votes on both
bills are expected on Thursday.

ALBRIGHT MEETS WITH CHINESE OVER RESUMING TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ After a period of high tension between
the United States and China, the two sides met here Wednesday to
set the stage for the resumption of negotiations for China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, the Clinton administration rebuffed an offer
that the Chinese thought would be acceptable, and Washington has
been trying to get the talks to resume almost ever since. But
tensions only grew worse with the accidental bombing by NATO of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and the renewed tensions
between China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In the first concerted activity to get the talks going again,
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky arrived here from
Washington, along with the two chief American trade negotiators who
came directly from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with the Chinese
foreign minister, Jiaxuan Tang, for 90 minutes Wednesday morning,
for an encounter that was described by an administration official
as ``free of any acrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Barshevsky emphasized Wednesday morning that meetings between
the Americans and the Chinese over the past day and a half in
Beijing on the trade accord were an ``ice-breaking session'' and
``very general'' in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Substantive talks about China's membership in the body that
governs world trade _ a membership that the Clinton administration
very much wants but on what it calls commercially viable terms _
had not resumed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, are
scheduled to meet here on Saturday, their first face-to-face
meeting since Clinton was in China in 1998. Since then the
relationship between Washington and Beijing has plummeted to its
lowest depths in years.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials hope that the presidential discussions
on Saturday will help right the course of the relationship and
result in the resumption of serious and speedy negotiations that
would allow China to enter the trade body. A new round of global
trade talks is being held in Seattle in November. If China fails to
enter the WTO before those talks, the Chinese would most likely
face more stringent entry requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between the two leaders has become the most
significant event of the annual economic summit of leaders of the
Asian region. They may be able to announce a resumption of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Barshevsky said that despite the visit of her team to
Beijing this week it was still not clear what the Chinese
intentions were. ``Do they want to re-engage for the look of it or
because they want to substantively re-engage to conclude an
agreement?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To pursue the resumption of talks further, Barshevsky was to
meet here Wednesday night with her Chinese counterpart, Foreign
Trade Minister Shi Guangshang.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, buffeted by criticism from the business
community and from some quarters in Congress for its failure to
seal a deal with China when it seemed possible in April, has been
pushing to resume the negotiations with the Chinese almost since
Clinton turned down the Chinese offer on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has been blocked by a series of unrelated
setbacks, chiefly the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
and the Taiwan-China spat.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult tasks for the negotiators now,
officials said, would be how to overcome the appearance that each
nation had caved to the demands of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton chose not to forge a deal when Prime Minister Zhu Rongji
was in Washington in April and when an agreement was very close,
officials said, because he wanted several more concessions from the
Chinese, particularly stronger safeguards for the American textile
apparel industry and concessions in the area of insurance.

 &HT;    GM hid evidence, judge says
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ General Motors Corp. defrauded the courts and
obstructed justice by withholding damaging documents in high-stakes
product liability litigation over the safety of vehicle fuel tanks,
a Fulton County judge has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   The order implicates GM's two lead law firms _ Atlanta's King &AMP;
Spalding and Chicago's Kirkland &AMP; Ellis _ because it suggests GM's
attorneys may have aided the automaker in committing fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain instances GM, by and through its counsel, toyed
with and ignored court orders, ethical constraints and legal
barriers,'' Fulton County State Court Judge Gino Brogdon wrote in
an order issued late Tuesday. ``Plaintiffs have exposed a shameful
scheme by GM to defraud and mislead several courts, to thwart and
obstruct justice and to enjoy the ill-gotten gains of likely
perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon's findings stem from a controversial collection of
lawyers' notes and memos about a crash-safety report written by GM
engineer Edward Ivey 26 years ago. GM withheld these documents from
plaintiffs for years, citing attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon ordered GM to produce the documents within five days and
said they can be used at a wrongful death trial scheduled to begin
Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Motors is disappointed by the ruling issued today by
the court,'' Atlanta lawyer William Hill of the firm Paul,
Hastings, Janofsky &AMP; Walker, which also represents GM, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Motors emphatically denies that either Mr. Ivey or
counsel for General Motors engaged in fraud on the court or
obstruction of justice,'' Hill said. ``General Motors intends to
pursue every available appellate avenue with respect to this
order.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrongful death lawsuit was filed by the widow of George Yaw
Bampoe-Parry, whose 1985 Chevrolet Chevette was allegedly clipped
in the rear on May 21, 1997, by a Volvo while he was driving north
through Atlanta on Interstate 85. The crash caused Bampoe-Parry's
fuel tank to leak and the car burst into flames, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Bampoe-Parry, a native of Ghana who operated a clothing business
and delivered pizzas, died almost three weeks later of burn-related
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Jim Butler of Columbus, who filed the suit, hailed
Brogdon's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens now is that the reckoning begins,'' he said.
``Two decades of concealing the truth and lying are coming to an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler has contended that former GM lawyer Kenneth Starr _ the
independent counsel who investigated Whitewater and President
Clinton _ participated in concealing the Ivey-related documents.
</P>
<P>
   Before resigning as a partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, Starr
represented GM in product liability litigation and successfully
argued that certain Ivey-related documents be shielded by the
courts under the attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland &AMP; Ellis has strongly denied Butler's allegations about
Starr. In his order Tuesday, Brogdon made no mention of Starr.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unusual motion filed before Brogdon last week, GM's
legal team asked the judge to prohibit Butler from referring to
Starr during the upcoming trial. Butler filed a reply strongly
opposing that request.
</P>
<P>
   In his order Tuesday, Brogdon said the evidence of GM's conduct
in fuel-tank fire product liability litigation ``soars beyond'' the
legal threshold that must be cleared before finding that the
automaker committed fraud on the court and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Ivey conducted a cost-benefit analysis of fire-related
deaths in GM vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The company engineer estimated that 500 people died annually in
GM autos ``where bodies were burnt'' and that GM could prevent such
fires and the resulting fatalities by spending $2.40 per vehicle in
safety improvements.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing Ivey in 1981 about the analysis, one GM
lawyer wrote: ``Obviously, Ivey is not an individual whom we would
ever, in any conceivable situation, want to be identified to the
plaintiffs in a (fuel-tank fire) case and the documents he
generated are undoubtedly some of the potentially most harmful and
most damaging were they ever to be produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey's analysis and notes of his interviews with lawyers have
been presented at trial on only a few occasions. In July, a
California jury that was presented with evidence on Ivey's analysis
awarded $4.9 billion in damages _ the largest product liability
verdict in U.S. history _ in a lawsuit over the explosion of a
Chevrolet Malibu gas tank in a crash. The judge presiding over that
case later reduced the jury's award by more than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a case in Florida, a jury that considered the Ivey documents
declined to award punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fulton County case, plaintiffs attorney Butler contended
GM directed Ivey to conduct the cost-benefit study and that Ivey
shared it with other employees in GM management. GM has countered
that Ivey's report was an independent intellectual exercise riddled
with crucial flaws and errors. For this reason, GM has argued, it
has never been adopted by the company and should not be put before
a jury.
</P>
<P>
   But Brogdon expressed concern with the engineer's apparent
memory loss.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, eight years after he prepared the analysis, Ivey could
recall who likely asked him to prepare it and who at GM received a
copy of it, the judge noted. Three years later, when interviewed by
GM lawyers, Ivey's memory was still largely intact, Brogdon said,
citing lawyer notes of the interview that indicate Ivey could
recall that the analysis was not solely his idea and that it was
sent to other GM employees.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months after those interviews, Ivey gave pre-trial
testimony on the issue for the first time. During this deposition,
Ivey ``suffered a complete memory lapse'' as to why he prepared the
report and whether the report ever left his desk, Brogdon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense, logic and mother wit demand the conclusion that
something happened to prompt Ivey to abandon information he had
retained regarding the Ivey report for 14 years,'' Brogdon wrote.
``Only Ivey knows what in fact caused him to scarlet his memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey would give similar pre-trial testimony about a dozen times
over the next decade in other product liability cases across the
country. ``The circumstances surrounding his evolving recollection
strongly suggest that Ivey willingly and unabashedly abandoned his
relationship with the truth,'' Brogdon wrote. ``The preponderance
of the evidence weighs heavily in favor of the conclusion that Ivey
lied.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Ivey said he was not
surprised that Brogdon's order was critical of him.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he intentionally forgot the critical information
about his analysis or whether someone persuaded him to forget it,
Ivey declined comment. ``I've been advised not to talk to the
press, as frustrating as that is to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Brogdon said the record offers no proof that GM or
its lawyers put Ivey up to lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There exists strong evidence in the record that GM, through
its lawyers, intended to explore every conceivable means of
secreting Ivey's recollection of his report from plaintiffs,''
Brogdon wrote. ``Necessarily, this universe of possible means would
include unethical and illegal means.''
</P>
<P>
   Brogdon said the record ``is simply void of any evidence that GM
or its lawyers took some specific action ... to cause Ivey's memory
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brogdon did say that GM ``covertly'' defied court orders as
to the existence of many of the documents at issue.
</P>
<P>
   When GM's lawyers initially interviewed Ivey about his
cost-benefit analysis, ``GM, by and through its counsel,
contemplated frauds,'' he wrote. In concealing the notes of these
interviews from court orders, Brogdon said, ``GM acted upon its
intent of concealing evidence regarding Ivey's memory and
successfully deprived the court of full opportunity to administer
justice.''

BRADLEY EXTOLS SMALL-TOWN VALUES IN START OF CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)  (js) 
 By JAMES DAO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ Returning to his hometown on the banks of
the Mississippi River, former Sen. Bill Bradley formally opened his
campaign for the Democratic nomination for president Wednesday,
pledging to fight racial strife, restore trust in government and
spread the nation's prosperity to the most downtrodden Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the dark sky rumbled threateningly but held back
its rain, Bradley delivered a 30-minute speech that was a paean to
small-town life, asserting that lessons learned in the classrooms
and basketball courts here had prepared him to be a more humble,
caring and selfless leader in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, above all, is not the time for complacency,'' he said,
standing outside his red-brick high school and before a crowd of
more than 2,000 banner-waving residents. ``I feel an urgency to
seize this moment in history, to strengthen the weak and to
challenge the strong to lead us into our full greatness as a
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Democrats, Bradley faces an uphill fight against his
only rival for the Democratic nomination, Vice President Gore, who
has built a formidable network of party supporters in seven years
in the White House. But Bradley's campaign kick-off comes at a time
when there are indications that he is gaining steam. Gore's lead
over Bradley, a former three-term senator from New Jersey and Hall
of Fame basketball player with the New York Knicks, had narrowed to
less than double digits in two polls of New Hampshire voters
released in the past week. One was by a Dover, N.H., television
station and the second by The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign has unsettled the vice president's advisers,
who say he has collected more money than they expected and
assembled a talented staff. ``He's gone through an important
initial phase where he has clearly gotten himself in the game,''
said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ``But there's a very big
next step in putting the substance into his themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bradley makes a strong run at Gore will depend heavily
on how he manages the next phase of his campaign, when he will come
under more intense public scrutiny and will be expected to release
a more detailed agenda than he has been willing to do so far.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's relatively low-key campaign may have helped him avoid
damaging controversy or criticism. But his aides say that in the
next few weeks, he will begin releasing more detailed policy
prescriptions. And those proposals, the aides hope, will lead to a
more lively debate with Gore, who has studiously avoided engaging
his Democratic rival so far, preferring to set his sights on the
leading Republican candidate, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's celebratory homecoming, Bradley avoided
mentioning Gore, at least directly. But in describing his desire to
help working families, he took what could be viewed as a veiled
shot at the Clinton administration, which has been attacked by some
liberal critics as offering too many small-bore programs to solve
big problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do fewer things,'' Bradley said. ``But they will be
essential things, and we will do them more thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will also try to differentiate himself from Gore on
character issues, his aides say. Though his camp does not bring up
Clinton's impeachment and repeated ethical travails, they sense
that Gore will be hurt by his association with a scandal-plagued
administration. Indeed, a poll published in The Washington Post
Wednesday suggested that voters are tired of Clinton and are
looking for a president who will take the country in a new
direction.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With that in mind, Wednesday's event was intended to present
Bradley as the antithesis of a polished Washington insider _ as he
has described Gore.
</P>
<P>
   From start to finish, there was an almost studied homeyness to
the day. Many of the town's clapboard and stone houses had
home-made ``Bradley for President'' signs on their trim lawns. The
high school band that performed before Bradley's speech
occasionally played out of tune. And at a reception for in the
school gymnasium, home-baked cookies were served with iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was something paradoxical about the way Bradley's
campaign sought to cast the day as a natural outpouring of support
for a hometown favorite while also trying to orchestrate it as a
huge media event.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning, campaign officials wandered through the
high school halls barking orders through portable radios and cell
phones. Before the event started, aides distributed copies of
Bradley's nostalgic description of Crystal City in his memoir,
``Time Present, Time Past,'' along with a fact sheet noting the
precise number of stop lights in town: five.
</P>
<P>
   And at sunset, Bradley led reporters and town residents on a
guided tour of his boyhood haunts, including the house where he was
reared, the church where he worshiped, his father's bank and the
local baseball fields.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's parents are both dead, but he still owns the family's
house, as well as a 100-acre farm.)
</P>
<P>
   But amid all the media management, it was also clear that
Bradley has remained a revered figure here since he left 38 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could do it all on the basketball court, but he didn't try
to do it all,'' said Ralph Boyer, 65, a retired teacher and
basketball coach at the local Catholic school who saw Bradley play
in high school. ``And what made him a great ball player will make
him a great president.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bradley described himself as a ``small-town boy''
who learned about hard work and discipline from his father and
about honesty, courage and integrity from his mother, a school
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In the Little League, he said he learned about racism when a
black teammate was denied service at a restaurant. ``Racism
disturbed me then and still angers me now,'' Bradley said. ``For
me, the only thing deserving of hate is hate itself.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Bradley said, he would try to redirect some of the
nation's wealth toward reducing childhood poverty and providing
affordable health care to working class and poor people.
</P>
<P>
   ``In so many ways, we have failed to use our prosperity to
improve the well-being of all our citizens,'' he said. ``Shouldn't
we be fixing our roof while the sun is shining?''
</P>
<P>
   But like many other candidates this year, including Gore, he
also spoke of his desire to address the nation's spiritual
yearnings as well as its material needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need in America is a deeper prosperity,'' Bradley
said. ``Deeper in the sense that we have a prosperity that adds up
to more than the sum of all our possessions; a prosperity that
makes us feel rich inside as well as out.''

Y2K: COMING SOON TO A COMPUTER NEAR YOU 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 By JESSAMY BROWN 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does ``Y2K'' mean?
</P>
<P>
   It stands for ``year 2000,'' and it has come to be associated
with the potential computer problems that will occur when 2000
rolls in. (The letter K is used as shorthand for ``thousand.'')
</P>
<P>
   The terms ``millennium bug'' and ``millennium virus'' are also
nicknames for the Y2K problem, used even though the potential
problems have nothing to do with a computer virus (a computer virus
is something that is deliberately inserted into software to be
destructive.)
</P>
<P>
   What is the problem?
</P>
<P>
   When clocks around the world reach midnight on Dec. 31, 1999,
the internal clocks of computers will change from 99 to 00.
(Computer programs were made to calculate dates for years using two
digits instead of four digits; for example, instead of using 1996,
computers use ``96,'' and systems are programmed to recognize the
date as 1996.) Some computer programs might interpret the change to
00 to mean that the year is 1900, not 2000, say some computer
experts, including Doug White and Alan Rea, professors at Western
Michigan University who issued a Y2K report in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows what exactly will happen: Even experts disagree on
how severe computer malfunctions might be. But what is clear is
that society relies on computers. And if a computer doesn't
``understand'' the date, it could go haywire or get confused and
shut things down, according to Rea and White.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, major problems may occur in the United States if
computers that help control the supply of electricity, telephone
service, banking records and airline travel are affected.
</P>
<P>
   Computer glitches could knock out school crossing lights, shut
down school heaters and disable classroom computers.
</P>
<P>
   And computer chips used in household appliances such as
microwave ovens and televisions could malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   How did the problem come about?
</P>
<P>
   Computer programmers began using the two-digit year system (99)
rather than writing out the full year (1999) to save computer
memory space, which in the early years of computers was scarce and
expensive. Programmers continued this after the need for saving
space diminished. Also, because technology was advancing at such a
rapid pace, some people thought that the software would be obsolete
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't think the technology would last,'' Rea explained
in a recent phone interview. ``There are no easy answers to give.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not just change the date on every computer?
</P>
<P>
   It's not that easy. Every reference to a date in every program
and file that is in use or stored in every computer must be
changed. This is a major undertaking, and computer programmers have
been working feverishly for the past few years to meet the Dec. 31
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some computer glitches have already started. As early
as 1996, the credit-card company Visa had to recall 12 million
cards with expiration dates of 2000 after authorization systems
refused to accept the card, according to Ed Yourdon, a software
engineering consultant and Y2K activist.
</P>
<P>
   How are people preparing for problems?
</P>
<P>
   Some people expect small-scale inconveniences, like not being
able to get money from cash machines for a day or two. Others are
concerned that the problem will create major disasters, essentially
crippling government, law enforcement, medical care and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be neither,'' Rea said. ``I'm not so
much worried about the technology (in the United States,) but about
other countries. Internationally, there are many countries that
aren't ready. I don't think people realize how interconnected we
are and how dependent we are on technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Some families are stockpiling months' worth of food and water
and buying electric generators and guns to protect their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Elenburg has been storing food and water for about two years
and has a generator. Elenburg, who heads the Dallas Area Y2K
Preparedness Group, has converted most of his money into precious
metals and cash instead of stocks and bonds, because he is
concerned that computerized records could be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government recommends that families prepare as they
would if a storm knocked out electricity for a few days. According
to the U.S. General Services Administration, items to have on hand
include flashlights, batteries, a battery-powered radio, food,
water and candles.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross recommends storing enough food and water
to last three days to a week.
</P>
<P>
   What is being done to prevent problems?
</P>
<P>
   Cities and businesses across the world are working to make their
computer systems ``Y2K-compliant,'' meaning fixing them to
recognize 2000 as a date. The federal government's computers and
the nation's infrastructure are in good shape, says John Koskinen,
head of the White House panel on Y2K.

MOVIE REVIEW: ``A DOG OF FLANDERS'' 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>
  World rights. 
 By MICHAEL THOMAS, Middle School Student Reporter 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A DOG OF FLANDERS''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Jack Warden, Jeremy James Kissner, Jesse James, Jon
Voight and Cheryl Ladd.
</P>
<P>
   Plot: Don't let the title fool you. This movie is not about a
dog, it's about Nello, an orphan boy who finds a dog beaten in a
field and nurses it back to health.
</P>
<P>
   Nello has one great talent: He loves to draw. When Nello meets
the town's most famous artist, Michel La Grande, they quickly
become friends.
</P>
<P>
   But things go bad when the boy is accused of causing a fire.
Nello decides to enter an art contest in the hopes of winning
enough prize money to pay off a mean landlord and save his
grandpa's house.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: This is a movie for people who like art and are
interested in famous artists. In the beginning, too much of the
plot is given away so viewers know what's going to happen, but I
loved the movie. I felt connected to Nello, and even though he was
poor and bad things happened to him, he still didn't give up on
life.
</P>
<P>
   Rating and reason for rating: PG for language, violence and
animal cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1 - 10 rating: 9.

<P>
   ``YOU'RE INVITED TO MARY-KATE &AMP; ASHLEY'S FASHION PARTY''
</P>
<P>
   Price: $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Plot: The twins decide they want to learn about fashion design
and coincidentally, they meet some boys whose sister attends Los
Angeles' Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   The boys get their sister to take Mary-Kate and Ashley for a
tour of the college. Before they know it, the girls are in a major
fashion show that is broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The girls had some cute outfits. But they overact _
for instance when they laugh it is exaggerated and corny and goes
on too long. They sing a lot of songs but the songs aren't good
because they sing the same verses over and over and the beat is
just not interesting.
</P>
<P>
   There really wasn't a story line and I couldn't help but yawn.

   ``SEEDFOLKS''
</P>
<P>
   Publisher: Harper Collins, 1999.

<P>
   Ages: 10 and older.

<P>
   Cost: $13.95 hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   Kim wants to honor her father's memory and make him proud of
her, so she plants lima beans in the vacant lot near her house. She
wants to show him that she can be a farmer, as he was.
</P>
<P>
   Young Kim is one of 13 voices that come together to tell one
story about a community garden.
</P>
<P>
   Readers hear from Curtis, who risks being made fun of by his
friends when he grows tomato plants in the garden to win back his
girlfriend. Then there's Maricela, a pregnant 16-year-old, who
grows radishes so she can learn to take care of living things.
</P>
<P>
   I thought this was an inspiring story of motivation,
determination and teamwork. It is also interesting because each
chapter tells a first-person account of how working in the garden
helped or changed them. This book has a distinctive point of view
and vivid characters.

MUSIC REVIEW: CD: ``THE VERVE-PIPE''

   CD: ``THE VERVE-PIPE''
</P>
<P>
   Band: The Verve Pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Don't repeat our mistake by confusing this group with The Verve,
a British pop band that hit the charts in 1997 with a single,
``Bitter Sweet Symphony,'' from their album ``Urban Hymns.'' That
group has since broken up.
</P>
<P>
   The Verve Pipe, fronted by lead vocalist Brian Vander Ark, has a
style that's more alternative/rock than pop. The Michigan band had
a 1996 hit, ``The Freshmen,'' on the CD titled ``Villains.''
</P>
<P>
   On The Verve Pipe's album, overall, the tunes are perfect to jam
to, but a few of the topics are inappropriate for kids under 12.
There's a whole song all about a bad word. There's a nice song
about a young guy waiting for his girlfriend so the couple can
share their first kiss. It's called ``Kiss Me Idle.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't waste your allowance buying this CD. You can download the
songs from the Internet at www.thevervepipe.com.

 FACES: MEET JALEEL WHITE (Urkel on ``Family Matters'')  World rights. 
 By JESSAMY BROWN 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JALEEL WHITE
</P>
<P>
   Age: 22.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: You knew him as Urkel. Now he stars in and
produces a new TV show, ``Grown Ups,'' on the UPN network.
</P>
<P>
   Give geeks a chance.
</P>
<P>
   As Steve Urkel on ``Family Matters'' in the early 1990s, Jaleel
White was the ultimate geek, a 5-foot-tall skinny kid with
Coke-bottle-thick glasses. His voice squeaked. He wore a bow tie,
suspenders and high-water pants.
</P>
<P>
   But White, today 5 foot 11, is all grown up now _ and he's
looking pretty, well, cool. ``Grown Ups'' is, in fact, the title of
his new fall show in which he plays J. Calvin Frazier, or ``J,'' a
single young man living in an apartment in the same building as his
longtime best friend, Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   White, who graduated from the University of California at Los
Angeles, says he's not worried about his Urkel-esque image trailing
him into the new project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have an image that I have to outgrow or
anything,'' says White. ``I think that the bottom line is you're in
a constant state of reinventing yourself if you're in Hollywood.
Period. And I have many characters inside of me.''
</P>
<P>
   White says he gets his inspiration from watching regular,
everyday people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never taken an acting lesson in my life,'' he explains.
``I basically watch people.''
</P>
<P>
   What's his character like in the new show? Will he be doing
slapstick comedy, as he did for 215 episodes as Urkel?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is less slip-on-a-banana-peel kind of comedy,'' he
says. ``So because of that, the comedy will be more verbal.''

JETS-PATRIOTS: IT'S NOT JUST ANOTHER GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By GERALD ESKANAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Just the other day Pete Carroll conceded, in
his still boyish fashion, that, yes, the Jets do matter more than
most teams for Patriots fans.
</P>
<P>
   But what about for Carroll, the Patriots' coach, who once led
the Jets?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing to say,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While that hardly echoes the general reaction regarding Sunday's
opening game at the Meadowlands, a meeting between the teams simply
does not have the revenge factor it once had for both coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a Jets-Patriots game has enough going for it now: a
season opener between division rivals, one of them picked by many
oddsmakers to go to the Super Bowl. The Jets don't need motivation
to prove themselves anymore, as they did just two years ago, when
Bill Parcells took them over after having led the Patriots to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was New England's new coach then, his first top job
since the Jets dismissed him three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Jets have captured three straight games from the
Patriots. The Jets toppled them as division winners. The Jets are
more highly regarded these days, and are the favorites for Sunday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   So is this game different now, Carroll was asked. ``The Jets are
high-flying and on top right now,'' he answered. ``They're
obviously the team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have enjoyed the highest percentage of season-ticket
renewals in club history, about 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The team has sent players to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It will star on three ``Monday Night Football'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson is going to be profiled in Sports Illustrated
and Parcells has been part of a cover story in GQ magazine.
</P>
<P>
   So the Jets are no longer defined by games such as the one
coming up Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the other parts of the Jets-Patriots drama _ the revenge
factor, the hunger to defeat their old coach _ are points that
Carroll has addressed in the past, but he won't address them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to make sure we're mentally right,'' he said,
which was as close as he would come to touching the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of time has passed from now and from when Bill
was here,'' quarterback Drew Bledsoe said Wednesday. ``There is
still some of that there _ where you want to beat your old coach
and what is now a very good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is still emotion in this game, no matter how hard
Carroll tried to sidestep the overriding issue of Parcells' past,
and no matter how many times Parcells repeated Wednesday that he
was preparing for Sunday just as has for any other game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you the truth and you have to believe it,''
Parcells said Wednesday. ``I'm thinking about one week, one game,
this practice.''
</P>
<P>
   But is this game less personal now? ``Hey, I never said it was
personal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's more personal for some players than others. Ray Lucas broke
into the league at New England in 1996. ``I know that if I were
them,'' Lucas said, ``I'd want to be beating me.'' And Jets punter
Tom Tupa, the most recent former Patriot on the Jets, said ``Of
course,'' when asked whether New England players still had special
feelings playing the Parcells-led Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said of his first meeting against the Jets, in 1997: ``I
was off a little bit and was a little too pumped up for it. But
there has been some time between that and a little bit of it has
died down.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of people care, besides the players and coaches. The
New England news media, for instance, has requested 55 press box
seats for Sunday _ more than double the usual demand and the
highest number in club history for a regular-season road game. The
Boston Globe alone is sending six reporters to the game.
</P>
<P>
   And for members of the Jets' family, there will be an additional
boost for the game. The team will unveil a special logo on the
front of the jerseys memorializing their late owner, Leon Hess.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets manhandled the Patriots in the regular-season finale
last year at the Meadowlands. But this is a significantly different
Patriots team from that one, which started Scott Zolak at
quarterback for the sidelined Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   For Bledsoe, this will be his first regular-season appearance
since Game 14 last year. Bledsoe's shattered index finger on his
right (throwing) hand is fine now, the quarterback said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe noted that Larry Bird once had a similar injury. ``And I
guess he was an OK player,'' said the quarterback who has thrown
more passes in his first six seasons than any other player in
history. &QL;

BRADLEY GOES HOME TO ANNOUNCE CANDIDACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRYSTAL CITY, Mo. _ He stood at the front entrance of his old
high school Wednesday, a middle-aged valedictorian giving a
different kind of commencement address.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, a native of the ``Show-Me'' state, showed that you
can go home again when he formally launched his campaign for the
presidency Wednesday before hundreds of admirers who live in his
small hometown and consider him part of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised here in Crystal City _ I'm a small-town boy,''
Bradley said. ``I have come back to my hometown because, for me,
this is where the world of possibility and hope all began, a world
I want to open for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's small-town roots stand in sharp contrast to a career
spent in the spotlight. He was an All-America basketball player and
Rhodes scholar at Princeton, then was an integral part of two world
championship teams in 10 years with the New York Knicks. He entered
politics in New Jersey in 1979 and served three terms as a U.S.
senator from his adopted state.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Democrat did not seek a fourth term in 1996 and
has spent the past four years preparing for a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   His hometown of 4,000 was decked out in a sea of red, white and
blue Wednesday, with flags, bunting and Bradley campaign signs
decorating storefronts, trees and homes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a holiday for the people of Crystal City and neighboring
Festus as their daily routine came to a halt. ``You can feel the
electricity; there is a festive air,'' said Bettie Easter, a
Crystal City resident for 12 years. ``They love Bill around here.
He belongs to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, during a reception in the school gymnasium where Bradley
honed his basketball skills, childhood friend Eddi Evans remembered
a conversation he had with Bradley during their youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 13, Bill was 12, and we were walking down Mississippi
Avenue one day,'' Evans said. ``He told me that one of these days,
`I'm going to become president of the United States.' He made me a
believer, and he's going to make believers out of all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is often criticized as short on oratory spit and
polish, looked relaxed and at ease in front of a sea of familiar
faces that included boyhood friends, teachers and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   His speech borrowed heavily from his second book Time Present,
Time Past, as he described his affection for his hometown, his
parents (both deceased) and the values they instilled in him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and his wife, Ernestine, spent Tuesday night in the
house on Taylor Street where he was raised. It is across the street
from Grace Presbyterian Church and a stone's throw from the
overpass that leads into quaint downtown Crystal City.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley grew up comfortably in this blue-collar setting. His
father worked his way up to bank president and his mother was a
schoolteacher, but their son is admired for his politics of
inclusion and idealism.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the American Dream is not just for the lucky among
us,'' Bradley said. ``It is not just an ideal to wish on; it should
be a possibility available to all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the American Dream for all of us _ at last.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley offered no specifics on issues Wednesday. His advisers
said he will deliver specific proposals as the campaign unfolds
this fall. Wednesday was for setting a campaign theme, and Bradley
emphasized integrity, honesty and moral fiber..MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said that even in this time of unprecedented
prosperity, not enough Americans are reaping the benefits. He
questioned the state of the health care system, schools and the
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In so many ways, we have failed to use our prosperity to
improve the well-being of all our citizens,'' Bradley said.
``Shouldn't we be fixing our roof while the sun is shining?
Shouldn't we be shoring up our foundation before the rain gets in?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel an urgency to seize this moment in history, to
strengthen the weak and to challenge the strong to lead us into our
full greatness as a nation.''

BUSH CRITICIZED FOR STATEMENTS ON IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas drew criticism
Wednesday for recent remarks suggesting he did not believe that the
federal government was obligated to reimburse states for providing
services to illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments seemed to contradict his support, as governor,
of a lawsuit that sought restitution from the federal government
for money that Texas had spent educating, incarcerating and
providing medical care to people who had slipped across borders
patrolled by federal law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush, said late Wednesday that
he still believed that the federal government should compensate
states for those costs. Ms. Tucker said Bush seemed to suggest
otherwise to The San Francisco Chronicle last week because he
misunderstood a reporter's question.
</P>
<P>
   But the confusion and criticism triggered by Bush's response
raised other questions about his oratorical poise and underscored
the intense scrutiny that he is under as the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Ms. Tucker's statement, Steve Forbes, one of
Bush's rivals for the nomination, said Wednesday night, ``Maybe he
ought to get his ears checked.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush clarified his position, the speaker of the
California Assembly, Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat, released a
statement taking issue with Bush's seeming opposition to
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle reported that Bush had been asked specifically
whether, as president, he would compensate California for the
billions of dollars it spends every year on services for illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he reportedly said, ``because that's not a federal
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tucker said Wednesday that he had thought he was being asked
about federal involvement in education.
</P>
<P>
   She said that he supported more aggressive federal policing of
borders to stop illegal immigration, and that he believed that if
the federal government failed, states should not bear the financial
penalties.

TV PROVES MOST POTENT CAMPAIGN TOOL IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A few weeks back, when four politicians who were
seeking the governing party's presidential nomination made a joint
appearance in a sleepy town on the Pacific Coast, one candidate
stood out from the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the man we've seen on television?'' a woman asked,
arriving in a clamorous throng to see Roberto Madrazo Pintado, a
former governor of a backwater state whose television campaign had
transformed him almost overnight into the current leader of the
primary race by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they saw Madrazo, they practically jumped him,'' recalled
a party official who attended the event in Tepic, Nayarit. ``They
didn't remember his name, but they wanted to be with him. It was
all because of his TV campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's first presidential primaries are rupturing traditions
after decades in which presidents chose their own successors.
Equally stunning, however, has been the emergence of the television
campaign commercial, a tectonic shift that is rattling the entire
system.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the governing party primary on Nov. 7 and for the
general election in July is the first nationwide campaign in which
all major parties are communicating with voters primarily through
television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Although televised presidential campaigns have been common in
the United States since the 1960s, the governing party here
introduced television campaign commercials only in 1994, and
Mexico's opposition had been unable to buy airtime until recently.
</P>
<P>
   But the government now appears to be relinquishing some control
over the airwaves, as part of a broader move toward competitive
politics and a loosening of the political system.
</P>
<P>
   The effects have rippled through the political system.
Newspapers and the government-influenced television news programs
are losing their monopoly on political information. Traditional
power brokers like labor and peasant bosses are being stripped of
their influence.
</P>
<P>
   Telegenic politicians like Madrazo and Vicente Fox Quesada, the
strongest opposition candidate, are gaining important advantages.
Also winning influence are the millionaires who are financing the
commercials. Campaign laws allow them to remain anonymous. Perhaps
the biggest winners are the media consultants and advertising
wizards who are producing the electronic campaigns. Some
presidential candidates have begun to seek media advice from
prominent American consultants, although the extent of the
foreigners' influence to date appears limited.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the standout has been Carlos Alazraki, 51, a Mexican
publicity agent who created Madrazo's commercials and whose
prestige has soared along with his client's. Rival candidates are
seeking to hire him away, and talk show hosts are soliciting his
punditry.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians and intellectuals are complaining that
television is debasing political discourse into a cacophony of
American-style sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combine money, television and the large number of Mexican
voters who are nearly illiterate, and you could elect a cow as
president,'' said Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leader of the main
leftist party. Similar criticisms are being hurled at Alazraki.
</P>
<P>
   ``How valid is it to play with the ignorance of a hungry people
just to help some candidate?'' one questioner asked in a recent
Internet chat discussion with Alazraki.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican people are more intelligent than many
intellectuals and pseudo-intellectuals believe,'' Alazraki shot
back. ``You can't fool people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been attacked a lot for my campaigns,'' he said in an
interview later at his Art Deco office. ``But a publicist has to
make sure his candidate or his product wins market share. You've
got just 20 seconds to work magic, to make consumers react and make
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Because newscasts tend to flatter the president and belittle the
opposition, some analysts applaud the new television campaigns,
arguing that voters will now receive information unfiltered by
pro-government commentators. But the awesome cost of television
campaigning is another concern, because airtime is just as pricey
as in the United States, said Rafael Gimenez, a leading pollster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is going to play an even greater role, because the
plutocrats can now back candidates without deferring to the office
of the president,'' John Womack, a Harvard University historian who
studies Mexico, said. ``Candidates will have to negotiate with the
people paying for their TV time.''
</P>
<P>
   The first politician made over by television advertising was
Fox, the governor of Guanajuato from the center-right National
Action Party. Broadcasting a two-year stream of commercials that
portray him as a down-to-earth leader who is defying an
authoritarian regime, Fox has built a sweeping advantage over his
opposition rivals in public opinion. When he started, he was known
mainly by a national elite. Today more than eight of 10 Mexicans
recognize Fox's name.
</P>
<P>
   But Alazraki has worked an even more dramatic makeover on his
candidate. The son of a Mexican film director, Alazraki founded his
own agency in 1977, attracting corporate clients that include
Telefonos de Mexico and the National Lottery. His first political
race was in 1994, when he produced the commercials for Ernesto
Zedillo's victorious presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But he has attracted more attention over his work for Madrazo,
who had been mainly known because of a confrontation in 1994 with
President Zedillo over reports of fraud in his election to the
Tabasco state house. That changed after August 1998, when Alazraki
began producing commercials in which Madrazo extolled his own
efforts to build roads, comfort orphans, and nurse the sick.
</P>
<P>
   The ads turned Madrazo into a national leader, recognized by 9
of 10 Mexicans. The extraordinary success of that campaign spurred
Madrazo and other candidates to seek the advice of foreign experts
in television image making. Last month, Madrazo hired three
American media consultants, including Douglas Schoen, who has
conducted polling for President Clinton, Alazraki said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play a minor role, because they know television and
polling, but they don't know the mentality of the Mexicans,''
Alazraki said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's preferred candidate, former Interior Minister
Francisco Labastida Ochoa, has also begun to seek television image
makers. In May, Labastida met Alazraki to sound him out about
switching candidates, but Alazraki declined. Francisco also has met
James Carville, who led Clinton's 1992 campaign, and other media
experts, but has not hired any foreigner, a campaign spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Labastida hired a Mexican company to produce
commercials that highlight his assertions of personal honesty, an
indirect jab at Madrazo's checkered ethical reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 37 years of public service, my hands are clean, and
they'll be clean all my life,'' Labastida says in his most recent
commercial. Polls show, however, that few people remember
Labastida's slogan, ``I have the will, together we'll have the
power.''
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere Madrazo goes, Mexicans greet him with his
television jingle, ``Who says it can't be done?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   King-sized media mergers like the $37.3 billion one that Viacom
Inc. and the CBS Corp. announced on Tuesday immediately provoke
cries of concern about the stifling of creativity and competition.
</P>
<P>
   Will independent producers and small studios have slimmer
chances of getting a show onto the prime-time schedule at CBS now
that CBS has three big production studios _ Paramount, Viacom and
Spelling Entertainment _ in its corporate family?
</P>
<P>
   When a hit Paramount film like this summer's ``Runaway Bride''
gets auctioned for future showing on television, will CBS have a
nepotistic edge over rival bidders?
</P>
<P>
   Television executives said Wednesday that while tinges of
favoritism might color certain deals, experience shows competition
will prevail, and they cited two reasons. One is that networks are
best served when they can choose from a smorgasbord of offerings.
The other is that Mel Karmazin, the president and chief executive
of CBS who will become the chief operating officer at the new
Viacom when the deal is concluded, has a track record of
encouraging competition within his companies.
</P>
<P>
   When he melded the Infinity radio empire with the CBS radio
network, he found himself owning competing stations in big markets.
For example, WINS-AM and WCBS-AM, the two dominant all-news radio
stations in New York, are both owned by CBS, but they continue to
operate independently and to compete with each other as they did
before the merger.
</P>
<P>
   In the elaborate food chain of network television, though,
competition is more complicated, and favoritism can be subtle.
</P>
<P>
   If CBS were to buy only Paramount shows, or if Paramount and the
other Viacom studios were to tailor their shows only for CBS,
financial disaster would be a more likely result than financial
windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't consolidate creativity,'' said one television
industry executive. ``At the end of the day, is it a fair deal?
That's got to be the test, or nobody can succeed. You can't get too
cute.''
</P>
<P>
   But for CBS, getting cute with such Viacom partners as Spelling,
MTV or Nickelodeon Studios has to be tempting. Although the CBS
network, under Leslie Moonves' leadership, has rebuilt itself and
was the most-watched in the Nielsen household ratings this last
season (September 1998 to May 1999), it lags way behind ABC, Fox
and NBC in the competition for young viewers, the 18-to-49-year-old
audience that advertisers covet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Paramount Television makes ``Frasier,'' one of the
biggest hits on NBC, especially with 18-to-49-year-olds. Now six
years old, ``Frasier'' has already been sold into syndication. But
say, for argument's sake, that ``Frasier'' was coming up for
renewal at NBC after the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Would Paramount be tempted to sell it to CBS instead, to help
bolster the earnings of a Viacom corporate sibling? Or would
Paramount be better off keeping the show at NBC, where, as the
centerpiece of that network's popular Thursday-night lineup, it is
likely to fetch a greater price when sold in syndication?
</P>
<P>
   Syndication is where the producer makes a profit. Most
prime-time shows are so expensive to produce that the studios
cannot make a profit unless the show goes into syndication, meaning
its rerun rights are sold to local stations or to cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks _ ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, WB and UPN _ must
keep a show on the air for four years or more to accumulate enough
episodes for syndication. If the network broadcasting the show also
has an ownership stake, then the network is more likely to pick
that show up for a fourth season and protect its syndication
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two shows are equal,'' one studio executive said, ``the
show you own is going to get favored when you're deciding whether
to pick up for a fourth year. But as an outsider, you only have to
fear favoritism if all other things are equal. If you have a hit
show, these things won't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``E.R.,'' the most popular show on television, were owned by
NBC instead of Warner Brothers, NBC would still have to pay
handsomely to renew it, because the others who make money from the
show's success _ producers, actors, writers _ would squawk
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened with Tim Allen, the star of ``Home
Improvement,'' whose production company, Wind Dancer Productions,
sued Walt Disney Co. Disney had co-produced the show with Wind
Dancer, and when it came up for renewal at ABC, Allen and his
company charged that Disney, which owns ABC, gave ABC a favorable
deal and did not try to sell the show to the highest bidder. (The
litigants settled the case earlier this year, under terms that were
not disclosed.)
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Disney moved its television production studio and
its ABC network entertainment division into a joint operation,
under the same two executives (prompting Jamie Tarses, president of
ABC Entertainment, to resign), and has made it clear the studio's
first priority is to supply ABC.

<P>
   Fox's Twentieth Century Fox Television, by contrast, and Time
Warner Inc.'s Warner Brothers Television, make a point of producing
a variety of shows for a variety of networks. And Paramount
supplies the biggest hit on the WB network, ``7th Heaven,'' even
though WB is a major rival to Paramount's corporate sibling, the
UPN network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be more like Fox than like Disney,'' said Moonves, the
president of CBS Television and former chief of Warner Brothers
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Twentieth Century Fox's chief executive, Sandy
Grushow, Moonves said: ``Sandy has about 20 shows, and they're not
all on Fox. He has two with us, he has two with NBC, he has three
with ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount has shows on NBC, UPN and CBS (it already has five on
CBS, even before the merger). Viacom Productions has shows on ABC,
CBS and UPN, as well as ``Oz'' on HBO. Spelling Entertainment,
which is 80 percent-owned by Viacom, has shows on Fox, WB and UPN.
</P>
<P>
   The new Viacom will also be a powerful force in syndication
sales. Viacom owns Paramount Domestic Television. CBS owns Eyemark
Entertainment and is in the process of buying perhaps the most
powerful syndicator, King World Productions Inc., which sells
``Oprah,'' among other shows. King World's shareholders were
scheduled to vote on the deal Tuesday, but put that vote off
because of the Viacom-CBS announcement.

   WACO-INQUIRY (Washington) _ Attorney General Janet Reno has
selected former Republican Sen. John Danforth of Missouri to head
an independent investigation into the FBI's 1993 assault on the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas.

   TIMOR-U.S. (Washington) _ Determined to preserve its
relationship with Indonesia and support early moves towards
democracy, the United States is warning Indonesia's military leader
to end the chaos in East Timor within days or face a disruption in
relations that could undermine Indonesia's economic recovery,
according to senior administration officials. (Developing) By

   RUSSIA-YELTSIN-CLINTON (Washington) _ Russian President Boris
Yeltsin told President Clinton in a telephone conversation
Wednesday that accusations linking Yeltsin and his family to a
corruption inquiry involving high-level Kremlin officials were
politically inspired, the White House said Wednesday evening. By
David Stout. (See also RUSSIA-BRIBES-YELTSIN, which will move by 10

<P>
   CONGRESS-TAX (Washington) _ Majority Leader Trent Lott said
Wednesday that President Clinton's promised veto of the
Republicans' $792 billion tax cut bill will likely doom any
tax-relief legislation this year. Firing the opening salvo in the
biggest legislative and political issue in Washington this fall,
Lott virtually ruled out any compromise, saying there is too little
time to negotiate a new plan for taxes and spending. By Eric
Schmitt.

   QUAYLE-PROFILE (Goffstown, N.H.) _ Dan Quayle, whose slingshot
career has given him a glimpse of both the heights and depths of
American politics by the age of 52, appears to be back at the
bottom of his political trajectory. Since his eighth-place finish
in the Iowa straw poll some of Quayle's aides have signed on to
other campaigns, his old friends from the White House privately
describe his presidential ambitions as hopeless, and he is drawing
small crowds and perfunctory attention from the news media. Yet
with a tenacity that is poignant, Quayle perseveres. By Adam
Nagourney. (With a photo.)

   INTERNET-CLASSNOTES (Undated) _ A new Internet venture,
Studyfree, is hiring students at each of 62 universities and paying
them to take notes in about 50 core courses. The note-takers then
post their jottings on a central Web site. The 25-year-old founder
of Studyfree said he intended the service to help students augment
their own notes or to help them catch up after a sick day. But he
concedes that his wares could easily be abused by those with less
legitimate excuses, like chronic oversleeping or lingering
hangovers. By Jacques Steinberg.

   TIMOR-RDP (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ Indonesia on Wednesday rejected
international pressure to allow a foreign peacekeeping force to
restore order in East Timor, even as a high-level U.N. delegation
met with officials to press for action to end widespread violence
there. Despite a declaration of martial law in the territory on
Tuesday, witnesses said the situation was still worsening, five
days after an announcement that East Timor's 800,000 people had
voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia. By Seth

   NIGERIA-TRANSFORMATION (Lagos, Nigeria) _ Three months after
Africa's most populous nation inaugurated its first civilian
government in 16 years, gas stations offer perhaps the clearest
promise of what could become one of the most remarkable political
transformations on the continent. Only 15 months ago, Nigeria was
in the grip of a rapacious military regime that had turned the
country into an international pariah. Now most gas stations operate
the way an Agip station on Iju Road here does: motorists pull up to
a pump and drive away a minute later. By Norimitsu Onishi.

Bradley says he feels an urgent need to seize the moment in

essential things, and do them more thoroughly than his opponents.

press conference Wednesday. McEnroe, the former world No. 1 who was
perhaps the most successful player in Davis Cup history, got his

has not won the title since 1995. ``It's one of the proudest

career has given him a glimpse of both the heights and depths of
American politics by the age of 52, appears to be back at the
bottom of his political trajectory. Since his eighth-place finish
in the Iowa straw poll some of Quayle's aides have signed on to
other campaigns, his old friends from the White House privately
describe his presidential ambitions as hopeless, and he is drawing
small crowds and perfunctory attention from the news media. Yet

of Studyfree said he intended the service to help students augment

Africa's most populous nation inaugurated its first civilian
government in 16 years, gas stations offer perhaps the clearest
promise of what could become one of the most remarkable political
transformations on the continent. Only 15 months ago, Nigeria was
in the grip of a rapacious military regime that had turned the
country into an international pariah. Now most gas stations operate
the way an Agip station on Iju Road here does: motorists pull up to
a pump and drive away a minute later. By Norimitsu Onishi.

A PAINSTAKING WEEK IDENTIFYING RARE ENCEPHALITIS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just the kind of phone call the New York City
Health Department welcomes, however troubling: Dr. Deborah S.
Asnis, an infectious disease specialist at Flushing Hospital in
Queens, called to report she had two elderly patients with symptoms
suggesting neurological illness. It might be botulism, a deadly
form of food-borne illness, or Guillain-Barre syndrome, a form of
paralysis. But it looked more like encephalitis, a potentially
fatal inflammation of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department officials encourage calls like this, in hopes
they will reduce chances of missing an outbreak of an unusual or
dangerous disease. This call set in motion intensive medical
sleuthing that led to the discovery of the first cases of St. Louis
encephalitis ever in New York City. The detective work is expected
to continue for weeks as baffled federal and local health officials
seek an explanation for how the outbreak occurred and how to
prevent its recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Health Department said another death
from the virus had been confirmed, bringing the total to three. In
all, nine cases of St. Louis encephalitis have been confirmed, and
48 more cases are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcella Layton, the head of the Health Department's Bureau
of Communicable Diseases, took that first call on Monday, Aug. 23.
Dr. Asnis told her that tests of the patients' spinal fluid
suggested a viral infection, either meningitis or encephalitis. Dr.
Layton urged Dr. Asnis to send specimens of the patients' spinal
fluid and blood to the New York State Health Department laboratory
in Albany for additional tests to detect a virus.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is the season for certain infections of the central
nervous system caused by viruses like ECHO or Coxsackie. One
possibility was Eastern equine encephalitis, a type occasionally
seen near New York. That afternoon, Dr. Layton sent an
epidemiologist to the hospital to review the charts of the two
patients and to try to find a link between them.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Aug. 24, Dr. Layton's staff discussed the cases at
its regular weekly meeting to review ongoing investigations of
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they were reviewing the information they had, more
cases were occurring, unbeknown to them.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Aug. 27, Dr. Layton and her associate, Dr. Annie
Fine, called Dr. Asnis to discuss her two patients. There has been
a third, Dr. Asnis told them, and even as the three doctors were
speaking, another doctor interrupted to tell Dr. Asnis of a fourth
case.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Dr. Layton called the Federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to discuss the
possibility of botulism. Dr. Layton considered the diagnosis
unlikely because most of the patients had a fever, which generally
is not a feature of botulism. CDC experts agreed. But a test was
done to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Aug. 28, a fifth case was reported from another
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Layton and Dr. Fine, concerned about the small but growing
number of cases, went to Flushing Hospital to review the patients'
charts. ``As we were sitting in the hospital we heard of another
case,'' the sixth, Dr. Layton said.
</P>
<P>
   The six patients' symptoms were not identical. Nevertheless, Dr.
Layton and Dr. Fine said they were struck by certain similarities
of clinical and laboratory findings. All the patients had been
active and healthy with only minor medical problems before this new
illness. Now muscle weakness was a striking feature. Fever and
mental confusion were also present, but in varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
   By now the Health Department doctors were worrying about a
possible widespread problem. They issued an e-mail bulletin asking
doctors at other hospitals in New York City to report patients with
a similar illness.
</P>
<P>
   That Saturday, Dr. Layton and Dr. Fine interviewed patients'
families. But there were no common threads _ no other illnesses in
the same household or among their friends, no recent travel, trips
to the same beaches, or shopping, eating or socializing at the same
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only common thread was they spent time outdoors in their
backyards,'' Dr. Layton said. ``Some were gardeners.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Layton went to her office that Saturday night to consult
textbooks for information on encephalitis, so she and Dr. Fine
could review it.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, St. Louis encephalitis virus became a strong suspect
in part because of its tendency to cause more severe illness among
older people. It is most common in the Southern and Western states,
although a small number of cases have been reported in upstate New
York as far north as the Canadian border over the years. But it had
never been reported in New York City. The infection is usually
transmitted by certain breeds of mosquitoes that usually feed on
migratory birds. Humans are infected as bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Aug. 29, Dr. Layton and Dr. Fine were on the
phone to the CDC's emergency number, and then to Dr. Duane J.
Gubler, an expert in arboviruses, which are spread by insects, at
CDC's field station in Fort Collins, Colo.

 NEW YORK: Fort Collins, Colo.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their suspicions were focusing on St. Louis encephalitis, and
tests of blood and spinal fluid confirmed them last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they know what caused the outbreak, the doctors want to
know why it happened here, and why now. ``Queens is not where you
expect it to occur,'' Gubler said in an interview. ``The key
question is: Why did it occur in the summer of 1999?''
</P>
<P>
   To help solve the mystery, the federal center is joining with
New York State and City health officials to expand the team of
epidemiologists, virologists, entomologists and other scientists.
This week they are studying the ecology of mosquitoes and birds and
trying to determine the extent of the outbreak in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, such investigations are aided by information from
Health Department surveillance programs aimed at detecting unusual
activity of birds and the insects that transmit viral diseases to
them and humans. New York City, however, has not had an arbovirus
surveillance system in place because of the rarity of transmission
of such viruses in the city, the health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will go into the areas of known and suspected viral
transmission to determine the density and distribution of
mosquitoes there and to collect a variety of bird species. The
collections will be sent to Albany and Fort Collins for viral
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of all the testing is to document the species of
mosquitoes and birds involved in the transmission of the virus,
determine whether spraying efforts have been effective, and find
out what environmental factors might have led mosquitoes to breed
in larger numbers this year.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely culprit is the Culex pipiens mosquito, Gubler
said; the hypothesis is that mosquitoes in New York City bit
infected birds migrating from Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Textbooks say that the following climatic scenario favors the
transmission of St. Louis encephalitis virus: a relatively mild
winter, wet spring and hot, dry summer. Although they fit the
conditions in New York City this year, many places have had similar
weather, abundant mosquitoes and no encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global warming has nothing to do with'' the outbreak in New
York City, Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   Although infected mosquitoes can carry the virus during the
winter and transmit it next year, it is impossible to predict
whether St. Louis encephalitis will reappear next summer, Gubler
said.

CBS NEWS MAY FACE MORE CUTS

 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For people at the news division of CBS, corporate
takeovers and the attendant cost-cutting are nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   They saw it in 1995, when Westinghouse Electric bought the
network. And they saw it during the nine-year reign of the man who
made that deal with Westinghouse, Laurence A. Tisch, whose Loews
Corp. was a major stockholder of CBS. So when it comes to cutbacks
in newsgathering operations, CBS News has been there and done that.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the news division will have to do it
again, now that Viacom and CBS have announced their $37.3 billion
merger. ``The news division suddenly becomes very small slice of a
very large corporate pie,'' said Ken Bode, who was a national
political correspondent for NBC when it was acquired by GE in 1986,
and, who is now the dean of Northwestern University's Medill School
of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The president of CBS News, Andrew Heyward, ``is putting a good
face on it,'' Bode said. ``But privately, he has to be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyward, though, does not sound worried. ``If you look at
today's media world,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``the
survivors and the thrivers are going to be those companies that
operate successfully across many media. Very clearly this company
has a track record that indicates it's going to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, since big corporations began to take over the three
major broadcast networks _ including GE's acquisition of NBC, and
ABC's sale, first to Capital Cities in 1985 and then to the Walt
Disney Co. in 1995 _ network news divisions have been gradually
recast as profit centers.
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis is on the prime-time news magazine genre of
journalism, and there is a disinclination to underwrite the
expensive infrastructure of foreign bureaus and full-time
investigative or documentary news units that once were centers of
prestige, if not profit. CBS, in particular, has been through at
least two painful bouts of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is becoming pretty old hat for those of us in the
television news business,'' said one journalist who has worked at
both ABC and CNN, a unit of Time Warner Inc., and spoke on
condition that his name not be used. ``We've all been taken over
and merged so many times, we're used to seeing a lot of our old
friends go off and do something else for a living.'' What is most
unsettling, he added, ``is the fear of what might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heyward at CBS indicated that, if anything, the network's
news division has been more stable lately than in much of the past
decade. And he noted that, even with Viacom's acquisition of CBS,
the same people will continue to determine the news division's
destiny: Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS television, and Mel
Karmazin, who became the chief executive of CBS last year and is to
serve as president and chief operating officer of the proposed new
company, under Viacom's chairman, Sumner M. Redstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining an editorially independent news division is easier
to do when the company is thriving,'' Heyward said. ``And Les and
Mel have been respectful of our goals and out editorial
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate about the future of network news divisions in the
corporate era between pessimists and optimists is not a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Bode, argue that the best days of the news divisions
were in the era before corporate cost controls, when each network
sent correspondents to 8 or 10 foreign postings and the evening
news broadcasts were heavy with news from branches of the federal
government and from foreign capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, argue that it was a waste of money to have all
three networks getting the same film from the same news conference
in the same foreign capital, when the video now often supplied by
Reuters or APTV would suffice.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating that kind of redundant coverage, they argue, was no
loss, and the savings can be channeled into other coverage. More
broadly, they say, news itself has changed, particularly in the
years since the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of three all-news cable channels and the Internet,
``there are more different kinds of news and information available
to viewers than there ever were before,'' Heyward said. ``Even in
the so-called golden days of network news, there were huge areas of
life that were being woefully undercovered _ like the women's
movement. I think there was a very narrow definition of what was
considered news.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, point to episodes in recent years when network
news decisions have seemed to serve the interests of a division's
corporate parents.
</P>
<P>
   One well-publicized example was the decision in November 1995 by
the CBS news magazine ``60 Minutes'' not to broadcast an interview
with Jeffrey S. Wigand, the former head of research for the Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Co. CBS lawyers feared the prospect of a
multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown &AMP; Williamson at a time when
Tisch was in the final stages of selling CBS to Westinghouse. The
interview was broadcast three months later.
</P>
<P>
   But Don Hewitt, the executive producer of ``60 Minutes,'' said
in an interview Wednesday that the Wigand episode was atypical.
``With the exception of the tobacco story, which was so out of the
mainstream of anything that's happened here, I've never seen us
knuckle under to anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC News last year, an investigative report intended for the
``20/20'' broadcast, involving accounts of pedophilia and lax
security at theme-park resorts, including Walt Disney World, was
derailed. The network remained close-mouthed about its reasons, and
executives at ABC's owner, Disney, said in a statement they had no
role the the decision.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, with two corporate takeovers behind it, ABC News
provides fodder for both the pessimists and the optimists.
</P>
<P>
   Like its rivals, ABC News has closed foreign bureaus and
investigative units over the years. But it has continued to plow
resources into its highly regarded ``Nightline'' program, and its
evening news broadcast, ``World News Tonight'' once a perennial
ratings laggard, has been the top-rated news broadcast for most of
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have discontinued the Close-Up unit and closed a couple
of foreign bureaus,'' said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for ABC
News. ``But there are many, many units of our news division that
have grown significantly in the past 10 or 15 years, including our
huge presence on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   At NBC News, Alex Constantinople, a spokeswoman said, ``There is
no major news story anywhere in the world that a viewer would miss
watching any of our programs.''

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. _ By the time Dan Quayle made it to the Rotary
Club breakfast here at 7:30 a.m., he had already finished two radio
interviews and was bursting to offer this latest audience his
distinctive conservative refrain: an embrace of family values, a
call for a 30 percent tax cut and his lamentation over what he
views as the dark spiritual legacy of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But when the former vice president concluded his remarks, he was
met with another variation of the question he encounters at almost
every turn these days: Why, given his weak showing in last month's
Iowa straw poll, and the overwhelming signs of Republican support
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is Quayle staying in the race at
all?
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it is over,'' Quayle said, displaying just a slight
edge of frustration at hearing the question again, this time from a
Rotarian. ``It is NOT over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plead with my party members, `We need to have a serious
debate,''' Quayle continued, adding: ``The Republicans are on the
verge of saying to the Republican Party and the primary voter that
we're going to have a coronation, that we're not going to have a
serious primary. That would be most unfortunate, and it would
diminish our chances in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, whose slingshot career has given him a glimpse of both
the heights and the depths of American politics by the age of 52,
appears to be back at the bottom of his political trajectory. Since
his eighth-place finish in the Iowa straw poll _ only two
candidates fared worse, one of whom did not even compete in the
nonbinding contest _ some of Quayle's aides have quit for other
campaigns, his old friends from the White House privately describe
his presidential ambitions as hopeless, and he is drawing small
crowds and perfunctory attention from the news media. Even a
signing for his new book in Boston on Tuesday that was advertised
to last for 90 minutes petered out after 20, as the lunchtime line
of autograph seekers dwindled away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with poignant tenacity, Quayle perseveres, motivated by the
political vindication he has pursued since he was selected as a
vice presidential candidate 11 years ago, and by the dogged belief
in the possibility of success.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's schedule here on Labor Day was typical: He
managed two television shows, a parade and two picnics, all before
dinner. There is, it seems, no invitation that he will not accept.
Labor Day morning found the former vice president of the United
States hustling down a set of stairs into a basement entrance to
the Milford Town Hall, which was closed except for the cramped room
serving as the studio for the local cable television show that was
giving Quayle an hour of time.
</P>
<P>
   For Quayle, the prospect of becoming the Republican nominee for
president in 2000, as fanciful as that seems to many in his party,
remains a realistic goal, if admittedly a difficult one. It is
simply a matter of conservatives rallying around him as their
ideological alternate to Bush, Quayle said. And then, he continued,
it is simply a matter of Bush's campaign collapsing,
notwithstanding its continued signs of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, the conservatives will have to take a deep breath
and ask themselves this question: Who is the conservative candidate
that is most qualified, and has the best chance of defeating George
Bush and ultimately prevailing against Bradley or Gore?'' Quayle
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, if I didn't think I had a good chance of winning _
why spend 18 hours a day, six, seven days a week doing this?'' he
asked. ``There are other things in life. The moment I'm convinced
that I can't win, then I won't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that he brings a strong resume to the
race. He has far more governmental experience _ he is a former
representative, senator and vice president _ than any of his
opponents. Indeed, he was serving as vice president to Bush's
father when the younger Bush had shown hardly a glimmer of interest
in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among the conservatives in the race, Quayle has won
election to public office. And he has a cogent ideological appeal
that impresses his audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that does not seem to be enough. As Quayle turns all his
attention to this state and its first-in-the-nation presidential
primary, he is finding that his most daunting opponent is not the
Texas governor, but himself _ or rather, the frozen image of
himself as a hesitant and intellectually slight figure that even
Quayle acknowledges is the legacy of his vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt about it: The introduction that I had to the
American people, that was totally unfair, is something that I have
to deal with today,'' Quayle said, bristling at the memory. ``The
unfair, outrageous, false coverage. From day one, from the
introduction, it was all BOOM _ totally, 100 percent negative.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Quayle is reminded of this more often than he would like. As he
marched cheerfully along the parade route in Milford on Labor Day,
Beverly Simpson, 75, met his smiling glance with a stern shake of
her head, turning away as he sought to greet her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he ought to drop out and let Bush have it,'' Mrs.
Simpson said. ``I don't think he is the man for the job. Mark my
words _ I don't think he has the makings of a president.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's most enthusiastic supporters, after ticking off what
they say should make him a particularly attractive candidate in
this conservative state, acknowledge that his candidacy remains
problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I call the next-door-neighbor-people problem,'' said
John H. Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire and Quayle's
biggest supporter. ``They say, `I really think he's great, but how
are you going to convince my neighbor to vote for him?' And you
talk to the neighbor and they say, `I think he's great, but how are
you going to convince my neighbor to vote for him?'''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle suggests that the only way to counter the argument that
he cannot win is, obviously, to win. Yet he acknowledges that there
are people who will not vote for him because of the perception
cited by Sununu, and seems flummoxed as he considers this
contradiction of his political situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rely on others to go back 10 years ago, or whatever the
case may be, to some false caricature that we know is totally not
true,'' Quayle pleaded to listeners on WGIR-AM in Manchester on
Tuesday morning. ``Go with what's in your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the candidate shows no signs of flagging,
offering an energetic and ideologically distinctive agenda that
inevitably invites a comparison with the more general agenda
offered by Bush. Quayle supports a 30 percent cut in taxes. He
advocates 12-year term limits for members of Congress or,
alternately, a constitutional amendment that would stop the
pensions and health-care benefits of lawmakers after 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Quayle's overwhelming theme is a return to what he describes
as traditional values. It is what has come to define his political
views since he gave a speech assailing the television character
Murphy Brown after she decided to give birth out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, Quayle said, are understandably jubilant about the
state of the economy and their material lives. ``But ask them how
are they doing inside,'' Quayle said. ``Their hearts ache. They can
see the cultural decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reclaim values that made America great in the first
place,'' he continued. ``Reclaim values like respect. Integrity.
The value of faith. The value of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Quayle's words have some appeal here.
``I like everything he stands for _ family values,'' said Kevin
Currie, 32, a forklift operator. ``I don't think the press treats
him fairly at all.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In pushing his quest for the presidency, Quayle often suggests
comparisons to another former vice president who went on to become
president, Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon succeeded because he spent eight years creating a new
image for himself; Quayle has resisted friends' advice that he do
the same thing, arguing that to attempt that would be to affirm, in
effect, an unfair caricature.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have advised Quayle over the years think that
given the crowded current field, which includes a number of
candidates who have Quayle's ideology without his history, it is
unrealistic to think that he could succeed even if Bush were to
fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid I think that's fanciful,'' said William Kristol,
who was Quayle's chief of staff and is now editor of The Weekly
Standard, a conservative magazine. ``That's wishful thinking in the
extreme. But I can see how he believes it. I mean, maybe it should
be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   And these days, as Quayle makes his last stand in New Hampshire,
it seems hard to quarrel with Kristol's assessment. As Quayle was
stepping briskly around a turn in the Milford parade, he came upon
a marquee. It was scattered with a jumble of letters, but one word,
evidently a greeting for Quayle, stood out: ``potatoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle looked toward the sign, and then his gaze floated away as
he turned to the other side of the street with a wave to the crowd,
and quietly finished his march to a van waiting to take him to his
next stop.

EX-MOBSTER STRIKES DEAL, SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla., Okla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- John Martorano, a ruthless hit man who has admitted
killing 20 people _ including a Tulsa millionaire and a pair of
unwitting Roxbury teenagers _ could walk free in less than eight
years under a deal secretly approved by prosecutors from
Massachusetts, Florida, and Oklahoma after more than a year of
negotiations, according to sources familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where criminals cut deals by trading up, Martorano,
58, has offered to give up two notorious gangsters who betrayed him
for years while working as FBI informants: fugitive South Boston
crime boss James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen ``The Rifleman''
Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano, a former member of Somerville's Winter Hill Gang
along with Bulger and Flemmi, is willing to reveal his own role in
a string of brutal, unsolved slayings spanning three decades and
three states, apparently in the hope that he can bring Bulger and
Flemmi down with him.
</P>
<P>
   While Martorano admits to murders in two states that carry the
death penalty _ Florida and Oklahoma _ he has been assured that
he'll never go to trial on those charges. Both states, however,
have the right to call Martorano as a witness if anyone else
implicated in the slayings goes to trial, the Globe has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes 14 months after Martorano first broke ranks with
Bulger and Flemmi and offered to cooperate in exchange for
leniency.
</P>
<P>
   His cooperation comes at a critical time. Martorano has agreed
to plead guilty to January 1995 racketeering charges just days
before Judge Mark L. Wolf is expected to rule on a defense request
to drop the case against him, Bulger, Flemmi, reputed New England
Mob boss Francis ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, and Robert DeLuca amid
evidence of FBI corruption and misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi has alleged that he and Bulger _ both longtime FBI
informants _ were promised immunity by the FBI in exchange for
leaking information to the bureau about their Mafia rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano has refused to meet with the FBI, but has spent
hundreds of hours being interviewed by the Massachusetts State
Police, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and more recently
by investigators from Oklahoma and Florida, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Martorano's brother, Jimmy, who is serving a
15-month prison term on racketeering charges, said his brother
stepped forward to stop Bulger and Flemmi from using the FBI to
blame others for things they had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone in this case is contending they were an
angel,'' Jimmy Martorano said in an interview earlier this year.
``But we weren't informants and we didn't do things and blame other
people for them. Stevie and Whitey were the biggest criminals of
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Martorano will plead guilty to federal
racketeering, race-fixing, bookmaking, and extortion charges that
have been pending against him since January 1995 in federal court
in Boston. And he'll also plead guilty to a newly crafted federal
``information'' charging him with being part of a gangland
racketeering enterprise that involved 10 murders, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Accomplices to most of those murders are identified as ``John
Doe 1 and John Doe 2,'' but sources identified them as Bulger and
Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have agreed to recommend that Martorano be sentenced
to 12 1/2 to 15 years in prison. But since Martorano has already
spent nearly five years in jail awaiting trial in the racketeering
case, he'll get credit for time served. He could be a free man in
eight to 10 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement has been approved by Boston attorney Francis J.
DiMento Sr., who represents Martorano, US Attorney Donald K. Stern,
Suffolk County District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II, Middlesex
District Attorney Martha Coakley, Miami-Dade County Attorney Robert
A. Ginsburg, and Tulsa District Attorney Tim Harris, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the parties involved in the delicate, secret
negotiations would comment Wednesday, but relatives of some of the
victims said that Martorano's confessions would bring closure.
</P>
<P>
   As with any deal, the sentencing judge _ in Martorano's case US
District Judge Wolf _ is not compelled to go along with it. But if
Wolf refuses to sentence Martorano within the 12 1/2-to-15-year
range agreed upon by his lawyer and prosecutors, then Martorano has
the right to withdraw his guilty plea and the deal would be off.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators would be prohibited from using any of the
information Martorano provided to the State Police and the DEA to
build cases against him or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stunning deal, observers say, the likes of which haven't
been seen in Boston's underworld since 1968, when Joseph ``The
Animal'' Barboza admitted killing 26 people, but served less than a
year in prison after testifying against the hierarchy of the New
England Mafia. He was gunned down in San Francisco in 1976 by
avenging mobsters from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano has confessed to killing even more people than the
nation's most celebrated mobster-turned-government witness, Gambino
family underboss Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano.
</P>
<P>
   By Martorano's own admission, according to sources, he pumped a
bullet into Roger Wheeler's head on May 27, 1981, just after the
millionaire chairman of Telex Corporation and owner of World Jai
Alai had finished a round of golf at the Southern Hills Country
Club in Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Martorano has implicated the late Winter Hill Gang
member Joseph McDonald as his accomplice in the slaying. But,
sources said, Martorano claims the murder was orchestrated in
Boston by Bulger and Flemmi, who were FBI informants at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's handling of the Wheeler murder investigation has come
under heavy criticism from state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after Wheeler's murder, Winter Hill Gang member
Brian Halloran told FBI agents in Boston that the plot had been
orchestrated by Bulger, Flemmi, and former World Jai Alai president
John ``Jack'' Callahan of Winchester. Halloran told the FBI that
Callahan had asked him to help kill Wheeler because Wheeler
suspected that the Winter Hill Gang was using employees who
remained loyal to Callahan to skim profits from the company's
frontons in Florida and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran said he didn't participate in the murder, but
identified John Martorano as the triggerman and claimed Bulger and
Flemmi were at the scene in getaway cars.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI refused a deal with Halloran, concluding he wasn't
credible. He was gunned down on May 11, 1982, on Boston's
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Aug. 3, 1982, Callahan's bullet-riddled body was found
in the trunk of a Cadillac at Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Martorano has admitted killing Callahan as well and
provided investigators with information about Halloran's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after Wheeler's slaying, investigators speculated it
was the work of a professional hit man who cooly executed the crime
and fled without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   They were right about the killer. By then, Martorano had already
killed 17 men and a woman in Massachusetts, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Most were swift, a gunshot wound to the head. And most were
victims of gangland feuds. But others were innocent victims, people
caught in the wrong place or involved with the wrong people.
</P>
<P>
   Some murders Martorano did alone. Some, he alleges, were with
the help of Bulger and Flemmi. And others, he claims, were done at
Bulger and Flemmi's urging.
</P>
<P>
   Martorano has admitted that he killed for the first time when he
was 24, just six years after graduating from Milton High School,
where he co-captained the football team.
</P>
<P>
   That victim, Robert Palladino, 32, of Winchester, had testified
before a Suffolk grand jury that indicted Martorano's brother,
Jimmy, for being an accessory in the murder of a young waitress
whose body was stashed in the loft of a restaurant owned by the
Martorano family.
</P>
<P>
   Palladino, who had allegedly been a suspect in the murder of the
waitress, was found dead under the expressway near North Station on
Nov. 15, 1964. He had been shot behind the ear.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, according to sources, Martorano killed
another man who testified before the same grand jury. John Jackson,
a bartender, was gunned down outside his Back Bay apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Jan. 6, 1968, came perhaps the most brutal, inexplicably
ruthless killing of all.
</P>
<P>
   The man Martorano was gunning for was Herbert ``Smitty'' Smith,
an assistant manager at the Basin Street South nightclub in
Boston's South End who apparently had gotten into an underworld
beef, according to sources. But when Smith arrived for a meeting
with Martorano, he had two passengers in his car, Elizabeth
Dickson, 19, and Douglas Barrett, 17. Martorano has admitted
killing all three with a gunshot to the head, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived, they found the three inside a car parked on
Normandy Street in Roxbury, a cigarette still smoldering in
Dickson's hand.
</P>
<P>
   There were other innocent victims as well. Michael Milano, a
bartender at a North Station nightspot, was mistaken for the club's
owner by Martorano and other gunmen who sprayed his Mercedes Benz
with gunfire at a Brighton traffic light on March 8, 1973, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Milano, 30, was killed and his two passengers injured.
</P>
<P>
   Milano was one of five people that Martorano murdered in 1973,
according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   The killings stopped for awhile when Martorano fled
Massachusetts in 1978 to evade a race-fixing indictment. He
remained a fugitive until his arrest in Boca Raton, Fla., in 1995.

MANAGING THE DOLLAR WILL BE SUMMERS FIRST BIG TEST AT TREASURY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his two months as secretary of the Treasury,
Lawrence Summers has tried to leave no daylight between his
policies and those of his predecessor, Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Rubin's approach was considered stellar both on Wall
Street and in Washington, and that Summers was his deputy for four
years, it seems a logical approach. It was on full display
Wednesday when Summers made his first major speech in his new job,
to the Economic Club of New York, and broke no new ground on
domestic or international issues.
</P>
<P>
   The question now, though, is whether an evolving economic
situation and intensifying political pressures will allow Summers
the luxury of leaving policy on automatic pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration faces a showdown with the
Republican-controlled Congress in the next two months over how to
apportion projected federal budget surpluses. The administration
will have to make tough choices about how hard to push its free
trade agenda, balancing a growing trade deficit against its desire
to bring China into the world trading system and start a new round
of trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   The White House will work to help keep the political
deterioration and repression in Indonesia from derailing the
nascent economic recovery in the rest of Asia, while trying to
defuse criticism from Republicans that it has turned a blind eye to
Russian corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In all these debates, Summers will be in the middle and will
have considerable opportunity to put his own stamp on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue where he is most on the spot is in managing the
administration's policy on the dollar, which is shaping up as the
first big test of his ability to step into Rubin's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's tenure as treasury secretary was marked as much as
anything by his advocacy of a strong dollar, an approach that
contributed to the economic prosperity and bull market of recent
years by helping to keep import prices low and to attract a flood
of capital to the United States from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some doubts on Wall Street about Summers' commitment to
keeping the dollar as strong as it has been, he has so far given no
indication that there will be the slightest change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday and in a separate interview, Summers
repeated word for word Rubin's mantra that a strong dollar is in
the interests of the United States, and said that policy would not
be determined by short-term considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the secrets of our success has been that we have not
tried to manage economic policy to the markets, but instead have
focused on strengthening economic fundamentals,'' he said in the
interview. ``Certainly that is the approach I will take.''
</P>
<P>
   But when speaking generally about the process of emerging from
Rubin's shadow, Summers suggested that while his goals remained the
same, the course he will take to get there might have to be
adjusted along the way. Events in the real world, he said, could
ultimately force him to reassess the way he approaches all the big
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important themes and principles that have guided our
policies _ fiscal discipline, international engagement, a
commitment to making the economy work for people, managing
government well _ those principles require constant new application
as circumstances change,'' Summers said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances are certainly changing in the economic backdrop
for dollar policy. As a result, questions on Wall Street about
Summers' commitment to a strong dollar are being joined by
questions about whether it is possible or even desirable to keep
the dollar strong _ through intervention in foreign exchange
markets, higher interest rates or other tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was able to keep the dollar strong over the last few years
without much difficulty because the economies of most other big
nations were weak or weakening, making the United States the
logical place for investors to keep their money. Now, most of the
rest of the world, including Japan and Europe, is rebounding
economically _ attracting capital that would have been invested in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the nation's trade and current-account
deficits are rapidly increasing, creating an imbalance that many
investors and analysts fear could eventually lead to a weaker
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   With the trade deficit growing _ and the 2000 election campaign
already heating up _ there is bound to be pressure from exporters
and labor groups to fight the loss of sales and jobs to foreign
competitors by weakening the dollar, which would make American
goods cheaper to foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 111.08 Japanese yen in late trading Wednesday,
up slightly for the day but down from its 1999 peak in May of more
than 124 yen to the dollar. After strengthening through the first
half of the year against the major European currencies, the dollar
weakened over the summer against the euro before leveling off
again. Wednesday, it settled at $1.0595 to the euro, compared to
its strongest level just over $1.01 in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals do not line up for the dollar they way they
did before,'' said Allen Sinai of Primark Decision Economics. ``The
question for Summers, from a market point of view, is whether what
he says about the dollar, if he says anything at all, is credible
against the reality of the changed situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, investors seem to be testing Summers, pushing the
dollar down against the yen as if to dare him to back up his words
with action and disprove their doubts about his resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the influence of Rubin, Larry Summers has
credibility,'' said David Hale, an economist at Zurich Kemper
Investments. ``But the dollar is a sensitive area for him. There
are a large number of people out there who believe that in his
heart of hearts, Larry Summers wants to devalue the dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale said that some of the suspicions about Summers' resolve
stemmed from a historical pattern in which Treasury secretaries who
came from backgrounds on Wall Street, like Rubin, presided over
periods of dollar strength, while secretaries from other
backgrounds saw the dollar fall on their watch. Summers is an
academic economist.
</P>
<P>
   By this theory, those from outside Wall Street _ people like
James A. Baker III, the Texas lawyer who served under President
Reagan, and Lloyd W. Bentsen, the former senator from Texas who was
Rubin's predecessor under President Clinton _ are more sympathetic
to arguments that a weaker dollar can help stimulate exports and
protect jobs at home.
</P>
<P>
   If the dollar is shaping up as a test of Summers' economic and
financial acumen, dealing with economic policy toward Russia may
prove to be the first big test of his ability to operate in a
political minefield.
</P>
<P>
   A federal investigation into whether money from Russia was
laundered through the Bank of New York has prompted criticism from
some Republicans that the administration, and the Treasury
Department in particular, have not been tough enough in demanding
that government in Moscow crack down on corruption. With elections
next year, analysts say the issue could well lead to pressure on
the administration to scale back Russian financial aid through the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``To quarantine Russia, or to write it off as some have
suggested, would I think be a potentially disastrous error,''
Summers said. ``The policy challenge is to find a balance between
being supportive of the Russian people, in whose support for market
democracy we have an enormous stake, while at the same time
protecting our own basic interests.''

ACCOUNTING BOARD MOVES TO BAN `POOLING' IN MERGED COMPANIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By MELODY PETERSEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite opposition from Wall Street investment bankers and
numerous big companies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
released a proposal Thursday that would ban an accounting method
used in many of the largest recent corporate mergers and
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which sets the nation's accounting standards, said it
planned to eliminate the accounting method, which is known as
pooling of interest, because it had confused investors and been
abused by some companies.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the pooling method, including federal securities
regulators, say that by employing pooling, corporate executives can
use shareholders' money to make expensive acquisitions, but never
disclose the price of those decisions in the company's financial
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a pooling,'' said Edmund L. Jenkins, chairman of the
accounting board, ``an investor can't tell what price was actually
paid for the companies to merge, nor can they track the
acquisition's subsequent performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But many companies and Wall Street deal makers have come to rely
on pooling accounting because it allows merging companies to avoid
expensive charges that reduce future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges must be reported in the only alternative method,
known as purchase accounting. They relate to the intangible asset
known as goodwill, which is the difference between the price paid
for a company and the value of its assets. The goodwill can amount
to billions of dollars in mergers of large companies and must
slowly be written off over the years, hurting the acquiring
company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Under pooling accounting, on the other hand, rather than record
the price paid for a company, the acquiring company combines the
other company's financial statements with its own.
</P>
<P>
   Pooling accounting has been used in deals like those between
Exxon and Mobil, Daimler-Benz and Chrysler, and Allied Signal and
Honeywell.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accounting board's proposal, companies now get 90 days
to comment. In an unusual move, the board said it would hold public
hearings on the plan in February in both New York and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting board said it expected the new rules to be
effective for mergers or acquisitions announced after Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and investment bankers contend that a ban on
pooling would slow the whirlwind of mergers and acquisitions now
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   In a report this summer, Merrill Lynch said the elimination of
pooling would be a ``serious mistake'' that could discourage
mergers that were otherwise strategically sound.
</P>
<P>
   However, some analysts say that if pooling accounting is banned,
the impact will not be so great. Gabrielle Napolitano of Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co. said that she did not believe that a ban on pooling
would significantly slow the overall pace of mergers and
acquisitions. Only a few industries may be affected, she said,
including advertising, health-care information technology, medical
devices and precious metals.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting board appeased some of its critics recently by
proposing changes to purchase accounting and the related reporting
of goodwill to make it more appealing to companies.
</P>
<P>
   It proposed allowing companies to show the annual reductions to
earnings caused by the amortization of goodwill as a separate line
on their financial statements. That means that investors will be
able to see how much the company earned from its daily business
activities before that amount is reduced by the goodwill charges.
</P>
<P>
   The board also recently proposed that companies be allowed to
write off the value of the goodwill over 20 years; earlier it had
suggested a 10-years. Allowing a longer write-off period lessens
the hit to companies' bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Willens, a managing director at Lehman Brothers, another
Wall Street investment bank, said that he believed that the board
had quieted many of its opponents by allowing for the separate
disclosure of goodwill amortization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition will be strong,'' Willens said. ``Many people
are saying, `Why fix the present system? It's served us well.' But
I don't think it will be nearly as vociferous as it might have
been.'' &QL;

PETE PLAYS THE MEDIA GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Pete Carroll has never wanted to act the
same way as Bill Parcells at daily Patriots press conferences.
Carroll just wanted to coach and not worry about the media or the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   But he must now realize there was a method to Parcells's
madness: If he entertained the media and gave them all they wanted,
the players would be left alone and free of the hype that surrounds
big games.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Carroll became that act.
</P>
<P>
   It probably wasn't planned or contrived. In fact, three-quarters
of his press conference Wednesday consisted of many short, concise
answers. He appeared unwilling to give any details on subjects he
felt were top secret just a few days before Tuna Bowl V at the
Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll grew animated when questions were asked about his
demeanor, his growth as a coach, and his new style. It was a
relatively old topic, one which had been discussed aplenty during
training camp, but his responses this time were different and
entertaining. Nothing the players could have said would have
matched or topped it. It was just like Parcells used to act.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his comfortable manner and high confidence,
Carroll asked, ``There's no deer in the headlights here?''
</P>
<P>
   some Carroll detractors have used that phrase in describing the
look on his face on the sidelines or after a loss.
</P>
<P>
   He boldly said he doesn't care what the media or the fans think
because he feels he's doing the job he was hired to do. He's acting
confident and cocky and even predicted, ``We're gonna win this.''
He's carried this bulldozer mentality throughout the offseason and
into the preseason, and he's not backing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are saying how come you're not backing off of it;
aren't you afraid of it? Uh . . . uh. I'm feeling a little
dangerous right now. A little dangerous,'' said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get into their (the players') minds and do a great
job with these guys. I have a part and they have a part. If we
connect real well and collaborate the way it's necessary to, we
have enough good things around here to make great things happen,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a really good offseason for me,'' Carroll continued.
``It's been . . . I'll tell you this quite frankly . . . a
tremendous offseason of introspection . . . of evaluation. The
process of getting right before the season to present myself to
this team and the tasks which are ahead. I'm excited about what
we're doing, I'm excited about what we're up against this season.
</P>
<P>
   I like the tone . . . it sounds like the odds are stacked
against us. I'm pumped about it. If you're seeing something that
you see is different, I told you a while ago, each year we grow
with this and there's no question that you grow with this community
that follows us, the fans and the media and all of that. I've come
to highly regard them and I respect where they're coming from and
what they want. And I kind of dig what we're up against right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're seeing that . . . I hope you're seeing me at my best
and what I best represent. I'm looking forward to the thing and I
don't care how tough it is, or how challenging it is, or what the
odds are, I think we're going to get something great done. That's
how I'm going about it and I don't care what you think, or what you
feel about that, you can't change me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Carroll is ``fired up,'' why aren't his players always
following? Will this highly excitable version of Carroll rub off on
the players?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to ask them. I've been jacked and fired up about
eerything we've done about this season. I don't know if they sense
it, but in time they will. If that helps them good. If it doesn't,
I don't care about it. That isn't important to me. I know I'm going
to do a great job at what I'm doing. I'm excited about it and what
a great way to get started, is this great or what? We'll see how it
turns out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The oddsmakers don't give Carroll's team much of a chance this
week _ already, the Patriots are 6 1/2-7 point underdogs. The
Patriots have lost the last three meetings against Parcells, and
one would think with only 24 of his old players remaining he would
not have such an effect on them anymore. But who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has to avoid either a letdown after a win or a letdown
before the game. He needs to be able to transfer the fire he feels
to his team. If he can do that, he'll have succeeded in ridding the
noose around his neck that has been there since he took the
coaching reins in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out fine the first year. We came out fine from the
Denver problem,'' said Carroll, whose '97 Patriots started 4-0 and
then lost to the Broncos, 34-13. In 1998, the Patriots lost, 27-21,
at Denver and then won four straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned that loss into four wins or whatever after that.
We'll find out how strong we are mentally. Looking at things from
the bright side; we look at this like we're getting a great win on
the road, I'm concerned about us coming back and being focused and
playing the next game (vs. Indianapolis) at the same level as that
one and better. It's not a one game season and we can't approach it
that way. Everybody else can, but we can't,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that he expects Drew Bledsoe to lead the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an exciting time for the Patriots, and Drew
will be leading the charge and if he doesn't, I'll be surprised,''
said Carroll. ``Drew will have to have a good game. In preseason he
threw a touchdown pass to Terry (Glenn) and he got hammered as he
threw it. I said, `You got hit pretty good,' and he responded,
`Sometimes you've got to take a hit like that.' That showed me a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Carroll well, such as Carolina coach George
Seifert, claim this is the Carroll he knew as his defensive
coordinator for two years in San Francisco calling him ``one of the
most energetic coaches I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   But will that energy transfer? Will the players ever get it as
much as he does?
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is do the best I can about the stuff I'm doing .
. . and I feel really good about it,'' he said.

``A STAR CALLED HENRY'' &QL; 
By Roddy Doyle (Viking, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You'll forgive us if we cut to the chase: This is one of the
best novels we've read all year, and better than Doyle's previous
books, although they were fine indeed. It's broader, richer than
``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' and less introspective than the somber
``The Woman Who Walked into Doors.'' Doyle's narrator is Henry
Smart, who tells us the story of the first 20 years of his life. He
begins just before the turn of the century with the meeting of his
parents, a teenage maker of rosary beads and a one-legged bouncer
who turns lowlifes away from a Dublin brothel. They are doomed, and
we know it _ babies arrive sick and die, poverty closes in, and we
see their love fade into the dirt and disease of the Dublin slums.
But before it does, Henry Smart is born, handsome, inexplicably
healthy and full of a promise that is too bright for such a dark
place. By the time he is 5, he is living on the streets, smart but
illiterate, and aware of his own gritty charm. When he is 14, he
takes part in the Easter Rising of 1916, and later becomes a
terrorist for the Irish Republican Army. Through it all, Henry's
savvy, rock-confident voice gathers us in. We know he is telling us
a true story, and yet at the same time spinning a tale _ he
survived childhood, after all, by dazzling and conning the adults
around him. In the end, ``A Star Called Henry'' is not just a novel
about one man but about Ireland itself, from a gifted writer who
knows that misery and laughter are not strangers to one another,
and that even the most rancorous place is not a hell if dreams are
still alive there. This is the first volume of a trilogy that will
take readers through modern Irish history by way of the life of
Henry Smart _ and won't we be glad to see him again. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FOOTBALL'S GREATEST PLAYERS'' &QL; 
(Sporting News, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Make sure when anyone tackles you he remembers
how much it hurts,' '' John Mackey said. ``He lived by that
philosophy and I always followed that advice.'' Mackey was talking
about Jim Brown, the Cleveland Browns' offensive powerhouse from
1957 to 1965 and the man this book calls ``the greatest pure runner
in the history of the NFL.'' Brown is top dog on the list of the
100 best football players of all time, compiled by editors of the
``Sporting News.'' Unlike its counterpart, last year's ``Baseball's
100 Greatest Players,'' this volume doesn't dabble much in the
early days, although the list has Jim Thorpe (at No. 88), Bronko
Nagurski (35), Don Hutson (6) and Otto Graham (7). Among the top 10
are Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Johnny Unitas, Lawrence Taylor and
Dick Butkus. There are photos and a brief overview of each player's
career, and it's all football _ there's only a mention of the
acting career for which Brown left the game at 29, and no notice at
all of O.J. Simpson's retirement activities. Best of all are ``Top
10'' lists (they range from ``Best Players I've Ever Seen'' to
``Defensive Linemen I Admire'' and ``Smartest Quarterbacks'')
solicited from some of the great players themselves, including
Merlin Olsen, Deacon Jones, Charley Taylor, Lance Alworth, Jack Ham
and Troy Aikman. Clear some time before you pick this one up,
because you won't put it down any time soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE RIGHT SET'' &QL; 
Edited by Caryl Phillips (Vintage, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We began to enjoy this anthology of writings on tennis round
about Page 45, when James Thurber suddenly appeared and described,
delightfully, the 1926 match between France's Suzanne Lenglen and
American Helen Wills, which caught the world's attention at the
time (Thurber's piece is followed by an essay from Wills herself,
which is also great fun). Earlier essays on the history of the game
have interesting titles (``Lawn Tennis: The Sturdy Bastard'') but
are for tennis zealots. For a more general audience, Phillips
includes excerpts from books by John McPhee, Arthur Ashe, Martina
Navratilova, Billie Jean King and Althea Gibson, and writings on
Chris Evert, Jimmy Connors, Boris Becker and Andre Agassi. There's
a section on tennis etiquette, with a preponderance of attention
paid to the nasty demeanor of the young John McEnroe, although
there's a short essay by Martin Amis in which those other bad boys,
Connors and Ilie Nastase, are mentioned. It ends with a few pages
from Alistair Cooke, titled ``My Life with Gabriela Sabatini,''
which are blissfully free of bad manners _ just what tennis should
be. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WORDS FAIL ME: WHAT EVERYONE WHO WRITES SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
WRITING''By Patricia T. O'Conner (Harcourt Brace, $18.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The best writer may not follow every rule every time,''
O'Conner says, ``but they follow most of them most of the time. And
even if you're a Tolstoy or a Balzac, a Thurber or a McPhee, it
doesn't hurt to learn the rules before you break them.'' O'Conner
was an editor at the ``New York Times Book Review'' before she
wrote her first book, the very popular ``Woe Is I: The
Grammarphobe's Guide to Better English in Plain English.'' Now,
she's a self-described ``grammar maven'' (she's kidding) who
sometimes writes the ``Times' ''``On Language'' column when William
Safire is on vacation. She's obviously following her own advice _
know your audience _ because her approach to words and writing is
as engaging as it is authoritative, and she quotes lots of her
(and, presumably, your) favorite writers. Her justification for
writing this book, oddly enough, is the Internet _ we're all
writing more now that we have laptops and send e-mail, so we need
to brush up our skills. But truly, no hook was necessary. O'Conner
can be our grammar maven any day. &QL;

WILLIAMS, RED SOX KEEP THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ There has never been a Red Sox manager like
Jimy Williams. Joe Morgan comes closest, but folks in New England
understood Tollway Joe because he spoke their language, delivered
their fuel oil, and plowed their streets.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy is different. He's a Californian, but his is not the
California of surfboards or the Grateful Dead. Jimy's California is
is the land of fruits and valleys. The man has a bachelor of
science in agribusiness, which we all know is the study of animal
science.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that Pinky Higgins or John McNamara ever studied
animal science. Jimy is different. He's a Sox manager born without
a predisposition for self-promotion, paranoia, or last call. He's
never going to be a darling of the electronic media, but maybe
that's not such a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife likes listening to him give interviews,'' chuckles Sox
closer Derek Lowe. ``She thinks he sounds very plain.''
</P>
<P>
   He does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too simple,'' admits Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. Jimy might be dumb like a fox, but he is not dumb
like a Butch Hobson. There appears to be a lot more going on inside
his head than he wants us to know about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know about that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way he likes it. Have a good laugh, everybody. Play
those funny sound bites (``if a frog had wings''). Paint him like a
character from Green Acres. Dis him in Manager of the Year voting.
The man doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they have sports radio shows in Boston?,'' he asks. ``I
don't know about that. But to say I don't read the paper, that's
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   So why not fight back? When he's proven correct after we call
him a nitwit for skipping Pedro in Game 4 against Cleveland, why
not gloat a little, or take critics to task?
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave in in the clubhouse,'' he says, flatly _ as flat as
the boring bill of his cap. ``I'm not trying to be right. I'm
trying to do right.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimy had a Baby Ruth candy bar during the Seattle series and
claimed it represented the Curse of the Bambino. He won't say if he
still has the chocolate treat in his possession.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's 6-2 loss to the Athletics, the Red Sox are 4-2
in the first half of what was supposed to be a make-or-break,
killer trip. They are 18 games over .500 and have won 10 of their
last 13. Going into Wednesday's games, they were as close (5 1/2
games) to the Yankees as they were to the Blue Jays. Despite losing
their slugger and their closer, the '99 Sox were supposed to be
average, or below average, but have been in contention all season
and are on a pace to win 90 games and make the playoffs for the
second straight season.
</P>
<P>
   There has been only one major, off-field crisis in this season,
and that came when Williams stood up to Pedro Martinez and pitched
Bryce Florie on a day when Pedro was late for work. Fallout lasted
several days, and it's fair to guess that Pedro still resents the
move by his manager. But it's interesting to note that no teammate
came to Pedro's defense. The manager probably helped himself by
standing up to the ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that situation,'' says Jimy. ``All it was was
Pedro showing up late. It's behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him if the tough stand helped him (Pete Carroll, like
McNamara and Kevin Kennedy before him, prefers to bully the
rookies), Williams issues the usual, ``We take care of things in
the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis has been in the big leagues since 1990 and played
for Tony LaRussa and Dusty Baker. Like most of the Red Sox, Lewis
is a Jimy fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking last night about how he's underrated as a
manager,'' says the outfielder. ``His style is low key. But he
knows all facets of the game and he's very consistent as a person.
He keeps everybody in the mix, so you don't have guys rotting on
the bench for two weeks. You have to show up prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams gives more instruction than most major league manager.
He loves to work with middle infielders and knows a lot about
hitting for a man who only had 13 big league at-bats (he played one
game with the 1967 Cardinal team that beat the Red Sox in the World
Series). Veteran lefty Kent Mercker says Williams could be a great
pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy likes his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what they bring to the park every day. I believe in
them. I never asked them if they believe in me, but I do believe in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There will always be unhappy faces in a 25-man clubhouse, but
Williams says, ``That doesn't bother me. If a guy is maybe not
smiling because he's not in there, all that tells you is he
believes in his own skill and that's good. That's not a negative to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe says, ``Jimy doesn't ever panic. I came in playing for one
of the toughest managers for young players _ Lou Piniella _ and now
I have one of the best. I may have a bad game or two but Jimy puts
you back in there. Everyone in here respects him and goes out and
plays hard for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got us together in spring training and said, `Mo's not
here. We know that.' But he got it in our heads that we're gonna be
OK, and here we are 20 games over .500. He trusts us. He trusts
that we'll find a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And they usually do.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple.

RETURNING TO PUBLIC LIFE: JOHN CLAGETT DANFORTH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   (With WACO-INQUIRY) 
(nk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On most Tuesday mornings in his tenure in the
Senate, Jack Danforth would slip away from Capitol Hill and travel
a few miles to the small St. Alban's parish church at the National
Cathedral to preach.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly sermon away from Congress, he told friends, was an
opportunity to indulge an unquenchable ecclesiastical urge. In
preparation for what would turn out to be a career as a successful
lawyer and politician, Danforth collected not only a law degree but
also one in divinity studies from Yale University. He went on to be
ordained as an Episcopal minister.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cathedral he would deploy the same splendid baritone in
delivering small-scale homilies about God that he used in speeches
on the Senate floor about trade and finance.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of some and the dismay of a few, he retained some
of the same preachiness when dealing with earthly matters in his
three terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he was widely respected by his colleagues for his
earnestness and principled approach to issues. He was even admired
by those who often disagreed with him, like Sen. Russell B. Long,
the guileful Louisiana Democrat who served for years as the
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Long became as much a mentor to the young Republican from
Missouri as an adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth was sometimes called ``Saint Jack'' by his colleagues
and others, a nickname that embodied both general admiration for
his undeniable rectitude but also a whiff of annoyance at his
occasional moralizing tone.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth retired from the Senate in 1994 with only a few
specific intentions. He wanted to practice law, quietly support a
few St. Louis charities, go fly-fishing on the stream that crossed
his Missouri farm and watch from afar as events unfolded in
Washington, his friends said. He told The New York Times that he
was leaving the capital because he ``did not want to end my days in
government'' where one is ineluctably consumed by politics.
</P>
<P>
   With the decision by Attorney General Janet Reno to have
Danforth head an investigation into the events of the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in April 1993, he will be
returning not only to public life, but to an issue where the glare
is expected to be intense.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hilton, who was a senior aide to Danforth in the Senate
for 13 years, described him as someone who would take on the task
because ``he is a person who cares deeply that justice is done and
that the public has confidence they know the truth about important
events.''
</P>
<P>
   John Clagett Danforth was born Dec. 5, 1936, in St. Louis, into
the family that started and still owns much of the Ralston Purina
company, a family whose wealth was founded on cereal and maintained
by kibble.
</P>
<P>
   In his 18 years in Congress he would be known for such issues as
favoring free trade while trying to limit the number of Japanese
auto imports, his relentless support for increasing U.S. aid to
countries for hunger relief, and his independence from Republican
congressional leaders, as when he joined with Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., to enact a civil rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   He championed airbags in autos and drug testing for
transportation workers, a campaign he undertook after his daughter
almost boarded a train that crashed because of an engineer high on
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end he would become best known for his emotional
defense of Judge Clarence Thomas, who was nominated in 1991 by
President George Bush to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's devotion to Thomas was almost familial. When he was
Missouri's attorney general, he hired Thomas just out of Yale Law
School and they had forged a close bond.
</P>
<P>
   When Thomas' confirmation hearings turned from difficult to
tumultuous after Anita F. Hill accused him of sexual harassment,
Danforth displayed an unexpected ferocity. He prayed with Thomas
and loudly complained that Thomas was being unfairly smeared.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission he went overboard, joining in Republican
attempts to paint Ms. Hill as a possible psychopath who had
imagined the accusations she made against Thomas. ``I believe I
went too far,'' he wrote in an account of those difficult weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth had almost single-handedly created a flourishing
Republican party in Missouri. When he was elected attorney general
in 1968 he was the first Republican to hold statewide office there
in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   He came close to achieving the impossible two years later, when
he came within three percentage points of unseating Sen. Stuart
Symington. When Symington retired in 1976, Danforth was elected to
the seat.

CELLUCCI COURT NOMINEE IN QUESTIONABLE DEAL WITH INMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Francis X. Spina, whom Governor Paul Cellucci
nominated to the state's highest court last week after praising his
conservative views on criminal justice, paid $20,000 in public
funds to a convicted murderer to perform paralegal work on a
Mafia-related case Spina took on as a court-appointed lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The payment to Jerome A. Napolitano, who is serving two life
sentences for killing two people, violated Department of
Corrections regulations, and caused the state's court-appointed
lawyers' agency to revise its policies to ban such arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Legal observers called the payment _ which Napolitano collected
while imprisoned in Norfolk _ highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Spina said Wednesday he hired Napolitano on the recommendation
of his client, convicted cocaine trafficker Francesco (Frank)
Campiti of Agawam, who was serving a sentence alongside Napolitano
at the Bay State Correctional Center in Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are sensationalizing this,'' said Spina now a
state appeals court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Spina described Campiti's case as ``factually convoluted'' and
said it was convenient to hire Napolitano because he could devote
time to it while in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do it alone,'' said Spina, noting that he lived 100
miles away from the prison. ``I needed someone who could work with
Campiti and could go over the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's legal counsel, Leonard L. Lewin, who helped the
governor screen nominees for the Supreme Judicial Court, said
Spina's 1991 hiring of Napolitano did not come up during his
interview for the court vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   When told of the facts Tuesday, Lewin said he did not think they
were relevant to Spina's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Spina, 52, who has served on the appeals court since 1997, said
he was not aware at the time he hired Napolitano that paying
inmates for legal services was prohibited by the Department of
Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Some criminal justice experts said the hiring of Napolitano,
whose victims included a 16-year-old boy, could be troublesome to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is rare and it will look outrageous to people,'' Jack
Levin, director of the Brudnick Center on Violence at Northeastern
University. ``We are in a punitive mood when it comes to inmates.
We want to take their color televisions away and their exercise
facilities. So I can't help but think many citizens are going to
feel it is inappropriate to pay a murderer so much money for this
kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement also runs counter to Celluccis' emphasis on
law-and-order in his administration's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Spina, a former assistant district attorney who was practicing
law at a Pittsfield firm in 1991, was given the Campiti case by the
Committee for Public Counsel Services.
</P>
<P>
   Campiti, a Mafia associate has been convicted in 1988 for
operating a cocaine-importing ring and sentenced to 40 to 60 years
in prison. Campiti was appealing the conviction, arguing taped
recorded conversations should not have been allowed as evidence at
trial. The conviction was eventually upheld in the state appeals
court and is now before a federal judge in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After accepting the case, Spina hired Napolitano as a paralegal,
paying him $10 an hour. By 1993, Spina had paid the inmate $19,907,
according to CPCS records. Spina, who was paid $25 an hour,
collected $16,906 for his work during the same period. He dropped
the case in 1993 after he was appointed by then Governor William F.
Weld to the Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Spina said he had received written DOC approval for Napolitano
to work as a paralegal, but the issue of compensation was not
raised. He said he only learned it was a violation of the DOC rules
well over a year after he dropped the case.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano remained on the case when another lawyer took over
the appeal, but in 1993, William Leahy, the CPCS general counsel,
raised questions about a $4,902 payment to the inmate. In the
process of reviewing the bills, Leahy and his staff were informed
by the Department of Corrections that regulations bar inmates from
being paid for legal work.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said records indicate the DOC disciplined Napolitano for
accepting the fees, but a DOC spokesman had no comment. The CPCS
decided it was not worth litigation to seek recovery of the
payments.
</P>
<P>
   The case prompted CPCS to issue new guidelines requiring any
paralegals hired to have completed formal training.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation that Spina paid Napolitano with public funds
could undermine the tough-on crime image that Cellucci promotes for
himself and his administration.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference last week, Cellucci praised Spina as a
conservative jurist who, he said, supported his criminal justice
positions, including the death penalty and tougher sentencing. He
said Spina and his other nominee for the two vacant SJC seats,
Judith Cowin, display ``uncommon good sense.''
</P>
<P>
   However, under death penalty bills repeatedly filed by Cellucci,
a double murder like that Napolitano was convicted of could be
grounds for execution.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano was convicted in 1978 in the brutal shooting deaths
of Thomas Willett, 16, and Hugh Maguire, 21, both of Jamaica Plain,
and given two concurrent life terms.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, Willet and Maguire and several other men
were engaged in a wild street fight near a Brighton nightclub when
an apparent stranger appeared from the darkness and pumped 14 shots
into the head, chest and groin areas of the two victims.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano claimed he was in his Beacon Hill apartment at the
time of the killings. But several eyewitnesses, including a man
involved in the fight who said he lay at the feet of the assailant
at the time of the shootings, identified him as the gunman. They
said Napolitano coldly fired several times into both victims and,
as one victim pleaded for his life, reloaded and fired again.

 By SERGIO R. BUSTOS 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    StarMedia founder and CEO Fernando Espuelas is the hottest of a
growing number of Latin American Internet entrepreneurs. The
high-strung digital maverick has raised more venture capital than
anybody else, has taken his company public and has led the firm to
a market cap in excess of US$2 billion. Espuelas spoke with Latin
Trade associate editor Sergio R. Bustos.
 &HT;    Excerpts of their discussion:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LATIN TRADE: You were recently quoted as saying, ``I was 29 and
making really good money but really unsatisfied.'' You are now 33
and making even better money. Are you satisfied?
 &HT;    ESPUELAS: It has never been about the money for me. StarMedia
represents an opportunity for me to build a new Latin America for
the new century.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What do you mean ``build a new Latin America?''
 &HT;    The Internet is comparable to the French Revolution. Before the
revolution, the individual in French society had no role unless he
or she was a nobleman. After the revolution, every individual
became important. That's what the Internet will do in Latin
America. We are talking about a complete and permanent shift at
every level of society. For me to be in the middle of it all is a
very exciting opportunity.
 &HT;    The name StarMedia seems an odd name for a company that targets
people who speak Spanish and Portuguese. There are very few words
that translate both into Spanish and Portuguese. We wanted to have
one brand that could be identified in both languages. In fact, we
wanted to have a name with no meaning, so that we could create the
meaning.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Everybody's launching Spanish-language sites. With the field so
crowded, who's gonna make a buck?
 &HT;    That's the million dollar question. If you want to know how it's
going to shake out just look at the U.S. market. You have five top
brands that control 65 percent of the audience and collect 85
percent of the (advertising) dollars. I see four or five brands in
Latin America: StarMedia, AOL, Yahoo! en Espanol and Telefonica.
Everybody else is either going to be acquired or will go out of
business.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    You didn't mention billionaire Carlos Slim's Telefonos de
Mexico.
 &HT;    I believe they will be a successful ISP (Internet Service
Provider). But being a strong monopoly is no guarantee you can be a
strong and successful portal site. Not to pick on Telmex, but these
companies have a brand problem.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Projections show e-commerce in Latin America doubling on average
over the next five years to $8 billion. How will StarMedia get in
on this market?
 &HT;    At StarMedia, we simply want to connect buyers and sellers of
goods and services. To do this, we need three things: First, we
need to bring more merchants that communicate in Spanish and
Portuguese because Latin American consumers want information in
their own language. Secondly, we need a uniform credit card
acceptance system. We are currently working with banks and others
to create that. Finally, we need to give Latin American users a
one-stop system to ship goods through customs in a predictable way.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What is your biggest fear?
 &HT;    Are we organized the right way? Can we execute our plans as well
as we did in the past? For example, last year we had 30 people on
staff, but by the end of the year we could have 400 to 500. I'm
very focused on internal organization.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    You raised millions of dollars with your IPO in May. Why not
simply sell StarMedia, move on and pursue other ambitions? Like
becoming president of Uruguay?
 &HT;    I always wonder why I'm asked about being president of Uruguay
so often. For me, there is absolutely no challenge greater than
running StarMedia.

WITNESS IN RUSSIAN-SWISS PROBE LINKS YELTSIN AND KIN TO
CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland _ A central figure in an investigation of
corruption in the Kremlin said Wednesday that he had seen credit
card bills and photocopies of credit cards bearing the signatures
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his daughters, and that the
cards had been provided by a Swiss construction company that has
done $1.5 billion worth of work for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The informant, Felipe Turover, a Soviet emigre who carries
Spanish and Israeli passports and who worked for a Swiss bank as a
debt collector in Russia, also said senior officials of the bank
had described to him a Kremlin meeting at which senior Russian
officials accepted money and gifts from the Swiss company, Mabetex
Project Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of those receiving a gift was Pavel Borodin, the
powerful property management director for the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   The executives of the bank, Banca del Gottardo, ``said they were
a little surprised,'' Turover said, ``and asked, was this the
normal way of doing business there?''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has denied that Yeltsin or his daughters ever
received such credit cards or similar favors. In a telephone
conversation with President Clinton on Wednesday, Yeltsin denied
any involvement in the broadening money-laundering scandal, White
House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Banca del Gottardo spokesman Massimo Antonini said the bank
would not comment on Turover's claims. But in the past it has
firmly denied such allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin has denied ever having pocketed bribes from Mabetex. In
a statement issued by the Kremlin on Wednesday, he described the
allegations against him as ``rubbish.'' He said some might be based
on forged documents, saying it was ``very easy to falsify credit
cards and signatures on them.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no charges have been filed against any Russian officials
or others involved in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Turover, 35, has been a key witness in the Swiss investigation,
which was opened this year in response to a request by Moscow Chief
Prosecutor Yuri Skuratov, who was later fired by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turover boasts of broad past acquaintances in the
Kremlin, including reformers like Anatoly Chubais and Yegor Gaidar,
and of visits to the President's office in days gone by, he makes
no secret of his contempt for Yeltsin, whom he accuses of presiding
over corruption and decline.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Turover has been questioned several times in
Moscow by Russian magistrates, including Skuratov and Georgi
Chuglazov, who was prevented last week by the Kremlin from
traveling to Switzerland to investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   Turover has also been questioned by Swiss Prosecutor-General
Carla Del Ponte. Officials in Mrs. Del Ponte's office said it was
in part in response to information that Turover provided that
Skuratov sent his detailed request for help.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians under investigation, in addition to Borodin,
include members of his family and about two dozen other senior
Kremlin officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the most serious charges raised by Turover regard the credit
cards reportedly issued to Yeltsin and his daughters, Yelena
Okulova and Tatyana Dyachenko. Mrs. Dyachenko is considered to hold
considerable influence in Kremlin affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov said Tuesday that an estimate of how much Mabetex had
paid Russian officials in bribes _ about $10 million _ was supplied
by Mrs. Del Ponte in March when she visited Moscow to discuss the
case. He said part of the money was managed by Mabatex head Beghet
Pacolli, who used Mabatex-controlled accounts to pay credit card
bills for Yeltsin and his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov also said Yeltsin and his daughters should be
questioned about the credit cards. ``Naturally, the president
should be asked whether he knew about the situation,'' Skuratov
said in a television interview. ``And his daughters should be asked
as well. How did they look at this money? Why did they consider it
possible to spend it? These are basic questions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Turover, who left the Soviet Union in 1982, when he was 18, to
move to Spain, worked in the early 1990s with Banca del Gottardo in
Lugano, Switzerland, collecting corporate debt for Western
companies in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   About 1994, he said, a Banca del Gottardo executive responsible
for Eastern Europe, Franco Fenini, showed him photocopies of the
Yeltsin family's credit cards, including the signatures of Yeltsin
and his daughters, and copies of credit card bills that Fenini said
were paid from Mabetex accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Turover could not recall the amounts or creditors on the bills.
According to published reports, Yeltsin had an American Express
card and his daughters had Eurocards. Yeltsin reportedly used his
card only for minor purchases and largely out of curiosity, while
his daughters made some larger purchases through a Swiss shop.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss magistrates have confirmed that in a raid on the Mabetex
headquarters in Lugano in January, they confiscated credit card
records and copies of the cards themselves in Fenini's office
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Reymond, Mrs. Del Ponte's spokesman, said Wednesday
that all the confiscated documents had been sent to Moscow in two
shipments this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Turover, sipping beer and puffing cigarillos during an interview
Wednesday, said he had met Fenini about 1990 through an Italian
businessman, a mutual acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, foreign companies'
inability to collect debts in Russia prompted Banca del Gottardo,
which specializes in trade finance, to start a collection
operation. For this, the bank hired Turover, who worked in Moscow
and reported to Fenini.
</P>
<P>
   Turover said he is not afraid to speak out, and said that if he
is threatened, he will release documents from an ``archive,''
although he insisted that he has never illegally stolen or copied
confidential documents.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Turover spends much of his time these days at an expensive hotel
in the hills above Zurich, and his phone book bulges with the
numbers of important people in Russia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Turover's own career is fraught with conflict and
recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of his relationship with Fenini, according to
Filippo Ferrari, Fenini's lawyer, the men got along well. They
traveled together to Mexico, where Turover had lived for several
years after leaving the Soviet Union. When Turover was in Lugano,
he often stayed at Fenini's house.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men's friendship and business relationship broke up
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Banca del Gottardo's debt-collection program,
Turover said, about 40 percent to 50 percent was destined for the
company that was owed the money, while 10 percent to 15 percent
went to the bank and the rest to him.
</P>
<P>
   But almost from the start, Turover said, Fenini had demanded and
received from Turover a share of his commission. In 1995, when
Turover complained to the bank's management, Fenini was fired _ and
was quickly hired by Pacolli at Mabatex to work as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Turover would not say how much he earned collecting debts for
Banca del Gottardo, only that the figure had `'more than six
zeros.'' But someone familiar with his work said he had made about
$6.5 million. Now, Turover says, he is demanding that the bank
repay him the money Fenini took from his fees, which he estimates
at more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pacolli denies that his company paid any kickbacks, and says he
has no knowledge of the Yeltsin family credit cards. At a news
conference in Lugano last week, he threatened to bring charges
against Turover for violating Swiss bank secrecy, implying that
Turover had supplied investigators and perhaps others with
confidential documents from Banca del Gottardo.
</P>
<P>
   As he describes it, Turover's role helps illustrate the dynamics
of the cooperation in fighting organized crime that has developed
between Swiss and Russian investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Turover said he was interrogated by Mrs. Del Ponte before the
Russians made their request for legal assistance. In April last
year, Mrs. Del Ponte and Skuratov signed an agreement to supply
each other with better information about Russian organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of testimony given by Turover, officials in Mrs.
Del Ponte's office said, she suggested to Skuratov that he
formulate a clear request for legal help, a move that enabled the
Swiss to move energetically with their investigation of people
suspected of money laundering and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In his effort to recover the money he says Fenini skimmed from
his fees, Turover has sued Fenini for extortion and forgery,
accusing him of forging his signature on withdrawal slips. Fenini
is countersuing.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets the $3 million, Turover says, he will donate it to
handicapped children.

   WINDHAM, N.H. _ Texas Governor George W. Bush hopskotched from
taxes to East Timor Wednesday, throwing in a barb at Vice President
Al Gore, as the Republican candidate for president addressed more

campaign after a visit Tuesday to the Peter Woodbury Elementary
School in Bedford. Fifth graders there asked the governor questions
that had been pre-screened by their teachers so as not to make
their guest uncomfortable. They also sang a song praising Bush for
his ``leadership'' in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``For George W. Bush to stand in a public school and tout his
anti-education plan is dishonest and hypocritical, since his plan
would rob kids in public schools to pay for private school
vouchers,'' said Kathy Sullivan, chairman of the New Hampshire
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bush cancelled a visit to the Ella Risk Elementary
School in Central Falls, Rhode Island. But his campaign said it was
stormy weather, not criticism, that upset the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about a weather delay and it's really unfortunate that
some have chosen to use children as political pawns,'' said Scott
McClellan, a spokesman for Bush. ``Education has been Governor
Bush's top priority and he has visited children in schools all
across America.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats were criticizing Bush for his mock press
conference with fifth graders, Bush had his own zinger for Gore. He
told the Chamber of Commerce crowd that he thought it was
interesting that when it comes to education, the vice president
talks about ``bricks and mortar'' while he talks about children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to Texas to talk about buildings the day before I gave
a speech about children,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech last week focused on the need to repair crumbling
schools in order to provide a proper learning environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vice President made clear that Texas has one of the worst
records in the country with regards to the state of their
schools,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, noting that
three-fourths of all Texas schools need repair and modernization.
``You cannot simultaneously support education and support the
Republican tax cuts, which would gut funding for our kids
education.''sounds like the texas two step to me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chamber of Commerce breakfast, Bush said he opposes
sending American troops to quell the unrest in East Timor, he
favors lowering tax rates to stimulate the economy and return money
to the taxpayers, and he doesn't believe gun manufacturers should
be held liable for the actions of people who use their guns.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush left one Republican cold when he brushed aside his
question. Philip Pearson, the father of a 25-year-old mentally
retarded adult, asked Bush what he would do to help people like his
son, William, find employment and integrate into society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I use the bully pulpit of the presidency to encourage
people to be compassionate to their neighbors in need? Yes,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Pearson said that wasn't a good enough answer, Bush
shrugged and said, ``Sorry,'' ending the question-and-answer
session.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson said he was not looking for Bush to throw money at the
problem, but said he would like him to sit down with the leaders of
corporations and urge them to provide more jobs to the mentally
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said Wednesday that no one in his family asked Sidney
Adger, the late Houston oilman, to help him get into the Texas Air
National Guard. Former Texas House Speaker Ben Barnes, a Democrat,
had told friends that Adger asked him to help Bush get a spot in
the guard, according to the Dallas Morning News.

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Fernando Espuelas, fundador y presidente ejecutivo de StarMedia,
es el ejecutivo mas celebre entre el gran numero de empresarios
latinoamericanos de la Internet. El campeon de la tecnologia
digital ha recaudado mas capital de riesgo que cualquier otra
compania de la Web y dio a la firma una capitalizacion de mercado
de mas de US$2.000 millones despues de su salida a bolsa. Espuelas
hablo con Sergio Bustos, director adjunto de Latin Trade.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LATIN TRADE: Hace poco citaron esta frase suya: ``Tenia 29 anos
y ganaba mucho dinero pero estaba insatisfecho.'' Ahora tiene 33 y
gana todavia mas dinero. Esta satisfecho?
 &HT;    ESPUELAS:El problema nunca ha sido de dinero. StarMedia
representa una oportunidad para mi de construir una nueva
Latinoamerica para el nuevo siglo.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Que quiere decir con ``construir una nueva Latinoamerica''?
 &HT;    La Internet se puede comparar con la Revolucion Francesa. Antes
de la revolucion, el individuo no tenia ningun papel en la sociedad
francesa a menos que fuera de la nobleza. Despues de la revolucion,
todos los individuos ganaron importancia. Eso es lo que la Internet
hara en America Latina. Estamos hablando de un cambio completo y
permanente en todos los niveles de la sociedad. Para mi estar en
medio de todo esto es muy emocionante.
 &HT;    El nombre StarMedia parece raro para una compania dirigida a
personas que hablan espanol y portugues. Es dificil encontrar
palabras comunes al espanol y al portugues. Queriamos tener una
marca que se pudiera identificar en ambos idiomas. En realidad,
queriamos un nombre sin significado, para poderle crear un
significado.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Todo el mundo esta creando paginas en espanol. Con tanta
competencia, quienes van a ganar dinero en serio?
 &HT;    Si quiere saber cual va a ser el resultado, observe el mercado
norteamericano: hay cinco marcas que controlan el 65 por ciento de
la audiencia y recaudan el 85 por ciento de los dolares [de la
publicidad. En America Latina veo cuatro o cinco marcas: StarMedia,
AOL, Yahoo! en Espanol y Telefonica.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    No menciono a Telefonos de Mexico, del multimillonario Carlos
Slim.
 &HT;    Creo que seran un exitoso ISP (proveedor de servicios de
Internet). Pero ser un fuerte monopolio no garantiza que uno sea un
portal exitoso. No critico a Telmex, pero estas companias tienen un
problema de marca.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Las proyecciones indican que el comercio electronico en America
Latina crecera en los proximos cinco anos a US$8.000 millones. Como
entrara StarMedia en este mercado?
 &HT;    Lo que queremos es unir a los compradores y vendedores. Para eso
hacen falta tres cosas: primero, que mas comerciantes que se
comuniquen en espanol y en portugues, porque los consumidores
latinoamericanos quieren informacion en su idioma. Segundo, un
sistema uniforme de aceptacion de tarjetas de credito. Estamos
trabajando con los bancos para crear ese sistema. Por ultimo, hay
que ofrecer un sistema sencillo para enviar productos a traves de
la aduana.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Cual es su mayor temor?
 &HT;    Nos hemos organizado bien? Podemos implementar nuestros planes
tan bien como en el pasado? Me concentro mucho en la organizacion
interna.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    En mayo recaudo millones de dolares con su salida a bolsa. Por
que no vende StarMedia y se concentra en otras ambiciones, como
postularse a la presidencia de Uruguay, por ejemplo?
 &HT;    Siempre me pregunto por que me piden tantas veces que sea
presidente de Uruguay. Para mi no hay mayor desafio que dirigir
StarMedia.

YELTSIN SAYS CORRUPTION CHARGES ARE POLITICALLY INSPIRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-BRIBES-YELTSIN.) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin told President
Clinton in a telephone conversation on Wednesday that accusations
linking Yeltsin and his family to a corruption inquiry involving
high-level Kremlin officials were politically inspired, the White
House said on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, said
Clinton specifically asked about reports that Yeltsin's credit card
bills and those of his two daughters had been paid by a
construction company that did vast renovation work on the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Yeltsin denied those reports,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   But another White House official, who commented on the condition
that he not be named, said on Wednesday evening that the Russian
president's repudiation of the accusations was less categorical.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin did not state his total innocence in so many words, the
official said; rather, he insisted that the accusations were not
substantive.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption inquiry, which is focusing on allegations of
international money-laundering and bribes to Russian politicians in
exchange for lucrative construction contracts at the Kremlin
itself, came up during part of a 40-minute telephone call, White
House spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin called Clinton to discuss a variety of topics, including
disarmament negotiations and the Asian economic summit meeting in
New Zealand this weekend, according to Berger.
</P>
<P>
   As Berger recounted at a news briefing, Clinton broached the
subject of money-laundering and corruption by commenting that it
would be good if Yeltsin could sign money-laundering legislation
recently passed by the lower house of Russia's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin said he was prepared to sign a money-laundering bill if
the Parliament passes one that is consistent with the Russian
Constitution, Berger said. Yeltsin said he had doubts about a law
passed this summer, and vetoed it for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, responding to a question, said Clinton then got to the
point, asking Yeltsin about the reports that Swiss authorities have
copies of receipts purporting to show that the credit card bills
were paid out of accounts of Mabatex Project Engineering, a
Swiss-based construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Yeltsin's press aides have categorically denied that
Yeltsin has anything to hide. And even people who detest Yeltsin
personally and politically agree that he has plenty of enemies
happy to say damning things about him.
</P>
<P>
   The White House official said about 40 percent of the total
conversation was devoted to government-corruption issues. The two
national leaders _ neither of whom speaks the other's language _
spoke through interpreters. The official said Yeltsin called
Clinton late Wednesday morning, which was early evening in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   A team of Russian law-enforcement officials is coming to the
United States early next week to take part in the continuing
multinational investigation, whose scope now includes allegations
that money from Russia was laundered through New York banks. The
Russian contingent will include a high official of Russia's
equivalent of the FBI, tax investigators and the Kremlin version of
a national attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The White House official who commented on Wednesday evening said
Clinton did not indicate whether he felt totally reassured by
Yeltsin's assertions. The American president did not disagree when
his Russian counterpart said that the odor of scandal could damage
relations between the two countries, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Swiss authorities investigating suspected
money-laundering by powerful Russians ordered Swiss banks to
provide information on two dozen Russians thought to have accounts
in Geneva. The Swiss have frozen at least 59 bank accounts in the
past two months in the search for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Russians known to be under scrutiny include the head of
Yeltsin's property-management team; his wife, daughter and
son-in-law; and a former deputy prime minister involved in the
military industry and arms exports.
</P>
<P>
   And though no definite link has yet been established between the
Swiss investigation and the one in the United States, American
authorities are looking into possible laundering of Russian money
through the Bank of New York. The bank has said it is cooperating.

RED SOX DROP ONE TO A'S, 6-2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ There would be no executioner's song here
Wednesday. The Athletics live for another day, and may yet be
drawing breath in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox? On an afternoon in which a killer's instinct would
have been as welcome in Boston as it always is here in nearby
Alcatraz, the Sox spared the A's, making three errors in a 6-2 loss
to Oakland that kept the wild-card differential at three games with
22 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three errors, five hits _ you know it's going to be a long
day,'' said center fielder Darren Lewis, whose fifth-inning
overthrow of third base was sandwiched between misdirected
offerings from rookie Donnie Sadler in the first and rookie third
baseman Wilton Veras in the sixth, the three errors leading to four
unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm human, I make mistakes,'' said Lewis, who has made a
career of keeping those mistakes to a minimum and has the Gold
Glove to prove it. ``That's just the way the game goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was going to be a tough trip. Up to this point
it's been great. We've been playing good baseball. Today was a bad
day. You can't look ahead and you can't look behind. You've just
got to take it on a game-to-game basis. We're going to New York,
looking them right in the eye, and will just be ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox could have headed to New York and the Yankees with a
five-game cushion over the A's, whose clumsy play in Tuesday
night's 5-3 Sox win was as embarrassing as the cartwheeling
streaker (supposedly an aspiring Lutheran minister, no less) whose
only concession to decency was the Minnesota Twins cap he wore on
his head.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sadler, in untimely mimicry of Oakland shortstop Miguel
Tejada, who opened Tuesday's game by dropping a popup, threw high
to first base on Rich Becker's routine grounder to open the A's
first Wednesday. Sadler started at short in place of sore-ankled
Nomar Garciaparra, who sat out after fouling a pitch off his left
foot Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde followed Sadler's error with a base hit, and two
outs later, Oakland DH John Jaha, whose ugly feet scared off the
Sox last winter but who has left big footprints all over the Sox
ever since, doubled over Lewis's head for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs singled home a run in the fifth, and another scored
when a charging Lewis fielded his base hit on the second hop and
nearly threw it over the A's dugout. Olmedo Saenz homered to lead
off the sixth to make it 5-0, and Becker doubled following Veras'
two-base throwing error for the final Oakland run.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just a team you can't give four or five outs to, and
there were a couple of innings we gave them extra outs,'' said Sox
pitcher Pat Rapp, who hadn't lost since June 17 but couldn't escape
a beating Wednesday. ``I tried to pick us up, but it wasn't to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier saw to that. The pitcher who wouldn't be on the
Left Coast if Dan Duquette had had his way _ the Sox tried since
last fall to talk Kansas City into trading Appier to Boston, only
to see him shipped off to their wild-card rival for three
minor-league pitchers _ stymied the Sox on four hits in six
innings. Lewis's bloop single in the fifth made it a 4-2 game, but
when the Red Sox put the tying runs on base in the sixth after
walks to Scott Hatteberg and Veras, Appier struck out rookie Trot
Nixon and pinch hitter Reggie Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is right up there in importance for me,'' Appier
said. ``I've been in the hunt before (the Royals made a bit of a
run in '95), but not this close or this late. I didn't focus on the
pressure, but on the task at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, whose RBI double Tuesday had jump-started the Sox,
worked Appier to a full count before going down swinging at an
Appier slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fools people,'' Jefferson said of the decisive pitch, which
broke down and in. ``It acted like a splitter. The rotation was so
tight, it looked like a fastball. I had no chance. I had a good
at-bat until that pitch. I missed it by four feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox would have just one baserunner the rest of the way. Mike
Stanley singled off A's reliever Doug Jones in the eighth, but was
erased on Troy O'Leary's double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great, great big shot in the arm,'' said A's manager
Art Howe, who will be splitting Manager of the Year votes with Jimy
Williams. ``We have to go hard in the last three weeks, but we're
in a better position than I thought we'd be in going into (the
final stretch).''
</P>
<P>
   The A's, of course, have surprised almost as many people as the
Red Sox, who won four of six games in the West Coast portion of
this 12-game road swing. Three games apiece in the Bronx and
Cleveland remain before the Sox touch down again at Logan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good team, we're a good team, these things happen
sometimes,'' said a tight-lipped Williams, who never barbecues
anyone for making an error. ``It's not for a lack of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams refused to offer any mid-voyage perspectives when asked
if he were pleased with his pilgrims' progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied with the way we played basically all year,''
Williams said. ``I didn't see any of our kids back off, regardless
of the situation or the score. That's all. We'll keep doing that.
We're going to be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who never has treated this game as kids' stuff, had no
room in his duffel bag for this one as he packed up for the trip to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened (Wednesday), you don't expect,'' he said. ``But
the key is to bounce back. That's what we've been doing all year,
and that's what we expect to do in New York.''

A LOT OF BLAME TO SHOULDER IN BOULDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhere in Seattle on Saturday night was the happiest coach
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Rick Neuheisel hadn't coached a game yet, but
you can bet he was savoring Colorado State's 41-14 thumping of his
former employer, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Colorado like a scoundrel in the midst of its
biggest recruiting weekend _ and in the opinion of many,
dismantling a once-powerful program _ Neuheisel was no doubt
thrilled to see the Buffaloes stumble.
</P>
<P>
   But where does this leave new Buffs coach Gary Barnett, who is
trying to clean up this mess?
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said quarterback Mike Moschetti's game-week comment to a
Denver television crew should have raised a red flag. Moschetti
said Nebraska was Colorado's rival and not Colorado State, a sound
bite that played nicely in Fort Collins.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that, Barnett believes he ``should have been more
perceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Moschetti, however, said his coach merely sought to shoulder
responsibility: ``I said it last year, and we went out and beat
(Colorado State) up pretty good. . . . I think we knew it was a big
game. It's the first game of the season. We didn't execute. He's
not playing, we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss has led to much soul-searching in Boulder. Colorado's
defense tackled poorly, failed to shed blocks and lined up wrong on
eight plays.
</P>
<P>
   Most puzzling to Barnett was why his team reacted with almost
complete surprise to Colorado State's offensive and defensive
schemes. Barnett said his position coaches and coordinators have to
``sit down and talk to players and determine why we had trouble
handling what we prepared for, then find out if we have any
inadequacies in our offensive and defensive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's probably commonplace to stand here and say, `Well,
we'll just move on to the next game.' But it won't be that easy. We
have to find out why this happened. It's going to hurt a lot _ as
it should _ and it will. I'm fully aware of that. We have to assess
everything that happened. You just can't write it off as a bad day
at the office. . . . We need to feel the hurt. Maybe that'll drive
home a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, Colorado's players had to leave the field
through a tunnel and were pelted with debris. Denver police in riot
gear first sprayed fans hanging over the mouth of the tunnel, then
tossed a couple of canisters of tear gas into the stands. At least
two canisters were tossed back onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   __ Unusual punishment: Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary coached
his team against Navy from the press box. Not because he wanted to
but because he had to.
</P>
<P>
   This was part of the NCAA's punishment for O'Leary providing an
improper loan to former Tech running back C.J. Williams. He was
also barred from Tech's final spring scrimmage and could not
recruit off campus in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong. I shouldn't have done what I did,'' O'Leary said.
``I thought it was over with, but it's still here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have seven ecstatic coaches and three coaches who
are down in the dumps because they found out I was going upstairs
(with them). The coaches down on the field feel pretty good about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Scott drops: Neuheisel named true freshman Cody Pickett as
Washington's backup quarterback, ahead of third-year sophomore J.K.
Scott of Burroughs High.
</P>
<P>
   During training camp Scott was having trouble with the
center-quarterback exchange and was benched during one scrimmage in
favor of Pickett. Scott has said he won't transfer.
</P>
<P>
   __ Beaver fever: Oregon State brought nearly 7,000 fans _ about
10 times its usual traveling party _ to its victory over Nevada in
Reno.
</P>

   Season-ticket sales are at a record 10,600, and officials are
expecting a crowd of nearly 30,000 (capacity is 35,362) for

   __ Boller update: Former Hart quarterback Kyle Boller entered
his first college game for Cal to the chants of his name from the
student section, then promptly fumbled on his first play.
</P>
<P>
   Boller completed his first pass attempt, a bullet to Ronnie
Davenport that covered 26 yards. Boller hit on his first five
attempts for 60 yards and a touchdown, then was 3 for 10
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who would start vs. Nebraska, Cal coach Tom Holmoe said:
``It'll probably be Sam (Clemons), but Kyle will play, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite it being Boller's first game he wasn't shy about taking
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Senior center John Romero recalled this scene when Boller
returned to the huddle during at the end of a timeout: ``The guys
were all talking in the huddle. He came in and said, `Everybody
quiet down.' Then he called the play and told the receivers to be
sure to hold onto the ball.''

<P>
   __ Point guard vs. point guard: When Indiana plays North
Carolina on Saturday, two unique athletes will be in the spotlight.
Both quarterbacks _ Indiana sophomore Antwaan Randle El and North
Carolina sophomore Ronald Curry _ also play point guard for their
college teams during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lateral career move: New Northwestern coach Randy Walker
might regret his decision to take the job after the Wildcats' 28-3
loss to Miami of Ohio. Walker coached Miami for nine years before
replacing Gary Barnett in January.

CANADIAN AUTO WORKERS UNION WILL LEAD OFF NEGOTIATIONS WITH FORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Mich., Germany)  (dw) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Ford Motor Co. will be the pattern-setting company
in labor negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers Union, the
union announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get a good settlement,'' Basil E. ``Buzz'' Hargrove,
the president of the Canadian union, said. ``It is time working
people in our nation got a pay raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford praised the move. ``We're pleased to be the lead company,''
Donald J. McKenzie, the chief negotiator for Ford of Canada, said.
``There are advantages to being the lead company in that you have
the opportunity to fashion an agreement that is better suited to
Ford of Canada's needs and the needs of its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Richer pensions for current and future retirees is ``our No. 1
priority,'' Hargrove said. In addition, he said the union would
demand improved cost-of-living adjustments, expansion of four-day
workweeks, better prescription drug coverage, tuition
reimbursements and child care provisions. He said the union wanted
Ford, the General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG to help
insure that their suppliers remain neutral in drives to unionize
those companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove noted that each of the three companies had earned
spectacular profits over the last five years and that in the last
six months, Ford had earned more than the others, with $4.3 billion
in net income. ``The issue isn't the ability to pay, it is about
the ability to force the companies to share,'' he said. Workers
deserve ``to share in the incredible wealth that we helped produce
with the auto companies,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts predicted that unionized auto workers in Canada
and the United States would likely get strong raises this year at
all three companies. ``There's more of an emphasis on pay than
we've seen in recent years,'' said Harley S. Shaiken, a professor
specializing in labor and global economic issues at the University
of California at Berkeley, noting the recent, rich deal the Boeing
Co. cut with its union.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union will first try to reach a deal with Ford,
then plans to follow the industry tradition of demanding that GM
and DaimlerChrysler accept its terms. Canadian labor contracts
expire at midnight on Sept. 21, and Hargrove said he would call a
strike if no deal was reached by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``There shouldn't be a work stoppage if the companies come to
the table recognizing the contribution of our members,'' Hargrove
said. The Canadian union has $60 million in its strike fund, which
would support workers in the event of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said the union chose to bargain first with Ford in part
because the leader of the American union, Stephen P. Yokich, had
narrowed his choices to GM and DaimlerChrysler. ``I talked to Steve
Yokich this morning and he told me it could be either one,''
Hargrove said, adding that Yokich indicated a decision would be
made within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and labor experts are betting the United Automobile
Workers will name DaimlerChrysler as its lead company and will try
to quickly reach a deal with the German auto maker, then will
insist that GM and Ford accept those terms. The companies'
three-year contracts with UAW workers expire on Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   A GM spokesman echoed his words. ``Everyone would like to be
first, but that's strictly up to the union, so we're waiting it
out,'' the spokesman, Edd Snyder, said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hargrove said the Canadian agreement would cover the
traditional three-year time frame, the agreement between the United
Automobile Workers is likely to go longer, industry and labor
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler proposed a five-year agreement and Ford proposed
a six-year deal with the UAW, according to a person close to the
talks. A four-year agreement was the most likely, another person
close to the talks said. In the United States, no auto labor
contract has lasted longer than three years since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The issues at DaimlerChrysler are perhaps more straightforward
for the UAW than at the other two companies. Because of GM's past
poor labor relations and because of the company's size and
complexity, the union has a host of national and local concerns to
work through. At Ford, historically strong labor relations have
soured lately as the company considers spinning off its giant auto
parts unit, Visteon.
</P>
<P>
   At DaimlerChrysler, it mostly comes down to a matter of money _
raises, benefits improvements and the like. One thorny issue _
whether Mercedes unionizes its factory in Vance, Ala. _ might be
moved off the table if the UAW fears it cannot muster enough
support from the workers there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, GM was pushing to be named the target. Last week, it
offered the UAW lifetime employment guarantees for workers with
more than 10 years of seniority. However, Hargrove said he would
not be likely to accept such a deal in Canada because the promise
can be renegotiated later.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the record auto industry profits, Hargrove predicted
difficult negotiations. ``Ford will bargain tough,'' he said. ``In
spite of all of the money they are making, they are still saying,
`We can't afford this.'''  &QL;

A LITTLE RAIN, A LITTLE LUCK, A BIG VICTORY FOR DAVENPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Through the first four rounds, she had scooted
through her first Grand Slam title defense like a kid riding
no-hands on a shiny two-wheeler: 6-foot-2-inch Lindsay Davenport,
who embellished her breakthrough U.S. Open crown with a Wimbledon
championship this July, was back to being unbeatable after an
August letdown.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Wednesday's harrowing quarterfinal, a
rain-interrupted stadium ordeal in which Davenport's momentum hit a
serious snag when she collided with a regal speed bump in the form
of Mary Pierce. Pierce, like Davenport, is a power hitter with a
pulverizingly flat forehand, a two-fisted laser backhand and a
bullying serve.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Davenport _ whose daydreams of back-to-back Open titles
had been three rounds away from becoming a happy reality _ was
pacing the baseline with a frown on her face and two match points
on Pierce's racquet. Suddenly she was as glum as the weather.
Suddenly she had stage fright on her favorite stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who says they don't get nervous is lying,'' said the
second-seeded Davenport, who ultimately benefited when her opponent
became more nervous than she was in this 2-hour-1-minute game of
baseline chicken. Using torque as their tactic, each dared the
other to back down first. Finesse was not a factor, but fitness
was.
</P>
<P>
   After Davenport ran Pierce off the court in the first set and
Pierce claimed cruise control in the second, Davenport fended off
two match points to break Pierce for 5-5 in the third, plopped down
on a couch and pretended to relax through an hourlong rain delay,
then sneaked into the semifinals, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5, when Pierce
produced a billowing double fault at match point.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams also advanced to the semifinals, beating Monica
Seles, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting closer to defending, had a little stumble, but I'm
still around,'' said the relieved Davenport, who out-aced Pierce by
9-5 and had no double faults. Pierce plunked out seven, the last of
which came at the worst of times for her. ``Finally able to get a
double fault, which is a sad way to end,'' said Pierce, a
three-time Grand Slam finalist who captured her sole Grand Slam
title at the 1995 Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport had sympathy for Pierce but wasn't about to request a
more interesting display for her second match point. ``I fought off
a lot of game points in that game, so I'm happy,'' she said. ``I'm
excited the way I handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Davenport had to survive a scare to keep her title defense
alive, third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the 1999 Australian Open
champion, had to feel the sting of a record 48 aces from
12th-seeded Richard Krajicek, one of the three men Kafelnikov had
deemed capable of winning this Open. But Kafelnikov used his
passing shot to keep Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon winner, from
making a complete recovery from a two-sets-to-none deficit and,
with a magnificent parting shot, sent Krajicek home a loser by
slamming an ace of his own, his 10th of the match, to seal a 7-6
(7-0), 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5) victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the best matches I played in my career,'' said
Kafelnikov, who won his first Grand Slam title at the 1996 French
Open and spent six weeks this year at No. 1, a position he can
regain by winning the Open.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian had sprinted ahead by 6-2 in the final tie breaker
only to watch the Dutchman creep back into contention. A flawed
forehand on his first match point made it 6-3, Krajicek's 47th ace
made it 6-4, and Kafelnikov put his hands over his eyes in
disbelief when Krajicek spoiled his third match point by drilling
his 48th ace. But Kafelnikov, intent on facing his other tournament
pick, the second-seeded Andre Agassi, in the semifinals, jumped for
joy when his ace at 6-5 advanced him into the Open semifinals for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek's aces broke the previous record held by Goran
Ivanisevic, who fired 46 in a losing effort against Magnus Norman
at Wimbledon two years ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was rain spattering the Arthur Ashe Stadium as
fifth-seeded Pierce, wearing a two-piece Lycra outfit and a
three-plait braid, marched to the slippery baseline to serve for
the upset, and her first spot in a U.S. Open semifinal, at 2-6,
6-3, 5-4. Though Davenport put a sneaker to the line, watched her
foot skid, and sent a quizzical glare in the direction of the chair
umpire Dessie Samuels, play was not halted.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce pasted a serve-and-forehand combination that sent her to
match point, at 40-30. But Davenport nullified that by snapping a
crosscourt backhand off the sideline. Pierce used a crosscourt
forehand blast to set up a second match point only to undermine it
with a backhand approach that turned too boisterous as it crossed
the net: She turned angrily on her heel to try again for a third
match point, but this time Davenport broke her, and the umpire
halted the 5-5 stalemate by announcing a suspension of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right decision to stop play,'' said Pierce, who
viewed her tough treatment of Davenport as a positive development.
``I mean, she won this tournament last year. She's No. 2 in the
world, was No. 1. I had two match points. This match probably
motivates me more, opens my eyes to what I need to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as her shot selection on match points. ``You know, I'm
human,'' she said. ``I got a little bit nervous and a little
tight.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pierce had an hour during the rain delay to chastise
herself for losing her own match points, Davenport used her time to
regroup. ``I was just thinking, you know, `Hold your serve,' just
basic things, nothing too mind-blowing,'' Davenport said of the
conversation she had with herself during the rain break.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the court in the fading sunshine, Davenport started the
11th game with a pair of crisp, cruel aces, didn't fret when Pierce
pushed her to deuce, and held for a 6-5 edge. In trouble on her
serve, Pierce tackled a break and match point for Davenport by
belting a forehand winner down the line, but another overblown
forehand from Pierce granted Davenport a match point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just lucky to be here; you have to go with that,'' she
said of her quarterfinal escape. ``Sometimes it just turns the
tournament around, and you play even better.''

THE BULLPEN IS SHAKY, BUT BENITEZ REGROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Armando Benitez received the ball from Mike Piazza
and began circling the mound, head down, mind working. He wiped his
brow with his forearm, squatted behind the pitcher's rubber and
stared at home plate. There were two outs and a man on first, and
Benitez had just fired consecutive balls to J.T. Snow, who
represented the tying run for the San Francisco Giants. The Mets'
hard-throwing closer had two strikes on Snow but was losing control
of his overpowering fastball and needed to reel himself back in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little wild,'' Benitez said. ``I needed to get stable.
I needed to relax, step back and calm down. I told myself to take
my time, to take the pressure off, to do what I know I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a long thought and a deep breath, Benitez showed
some savvy by tucking away his signature fastball and slipping an
88 mph splitter past Snow for the game's final out Wednesday. With
the pop of the mitt, 26,499 relieved fans at Shea Stadium rose and
cheered, and a thankful group of Mets players exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez's 18th save of the season secured the Mets' 7-5 victory
over the Giants and kept their suddenly appetizing bullpen from a
second straight collapse. Tuesday night, the Mets' vaunted relief
corps had failed to protect an eighth-inning lead and tied the club
record for most relievers used in a game at seven.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the typically reliable Pat Mahomes and Dennis Cook
inserted tension by allowing four runs in the eighth inning in what
had been a six-run cushion for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every part of the team is going to misfire once in a while and
it's good to see people pick each other up,'' said Manager Bobby
Valentine, whose Mets begin a seven-game West Coast trip Thursday
in Los Angeles. ``Armando picked up the other two guys and the
offense came out swinging. The signature of this team is that they
do whatever it takes to pick each other up. And that's what this
was.''
</P>
<P>
   After notching only four hits in each of the last two games, the
offense arrived just in time. Shawon Dunston keyed a four-hit,
three-run third inning with a two-run single, and Piazza smacked
his 33rd home run off the reliever Miguel Del Toro in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's 377-foot blast over the right-field wall brought home
Edgardo Alfonzo and John Olerud, both of whom had singled, and gave
the Mets what they thought was a comfortable 7-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a tough homestand for Piazza up to that point. He
had gone two for 17 and had stranded six base runners in his first
three at-bats Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was taking good swings but obviously didn't have
anything to show for it,'' said Piazza, who pinch-hit in Tuesday's
7-4 loss to the Giants. ``I was just trying to get a base hit, but
he gave me a pitch that I could drive and I stayed on it pretty
well. I didn't think it would mean anything. I thought it was just
some good insurance for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets coasted while the starter Octavio Dotel (7-1)
controlled the Giants through the first seven innings. Scattering
four hits _ he allowed no more than one in an any inning _ the
right-handed rookie won his seventh straight decision. Though Dotel
was cruising and looked capable of completing the game, Valentine
opted to replace him with Mahomes at the start of the eighth
because of his high pitch count (120).
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes, who threw well the night before, had nothing. With his
ball moving all over the place, he walked the first two batters he
faced, then gave up a single to Bill Mueller that scored the
Giants' second run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cook entered and was not much better. After getting Snow to fly
out, he was tagged for a three-run homer by Ellis Burks. Two
batters later, he walked Rich Aurilia, forcing Valentine to summon
Benitez an inning earlier than he usually does.
</P>
<P>
   While Benitez closed out the game, he was not dominating.
Mueller singled in the top of the ninth before Benitez got Barry
Bonds out on a fly ball and struck out the game's last two batters.
Acknowledging that the bullpen might be tired after being used so
heavily throughout the season, Piazza expressed concern about
things falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been outstanding the whole year, and hopefully we can
score enough runs to give them that insurance,'' Piazza said.
``They are tired and they are struggling, so we hope we can score
some runs and give them that margin for error, but that's not
always going to be the case. We sure hope it's just a bump in the
road for them and that they can straighten it out.''

SPORTS COLUMN: DOTEL PASSES A TEST OF FIRE IN 3 PITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three pitches. Three strikes. Three auspicious demonstrations of
a live-armed rookie who has no fear, and chose the final out of the
visitors' fifth inning at Shea Stadium to make his boldest bid yet
for a post-season start.
</P>
<P>
   Fastball, at the knees, outside corner, strike one. Breaking
ball, down and in, fouled straight down, into the dirt, strike two.
Fastball up, inside part of the plate, a handcuffed checked swing,
strike three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I throw the fastball on the outside and the umpire called it a
strike,'' Octavio Dotel said. ``Then I don't want to come back with
the same pitch because that's when they say, `I got you,' so I
throw the curve. Then I just want to come back with my high
fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really got to Dotel Wednesday, least of all Barry Bonds,
the challenge he faced in the crossroads sequence of a 7-5 victory
over the Giants that featured Dotel at his seven-inning, one-run,
four-hit, nine-strikeout best. The startling aspect of the
confrontation with Bonds wasn't that Dotel got him out, or that he
even struck him out with two on in the fifth, with Dotel and the
Mets holding a 3-1 lead. It was that he went after a man on the
All-Century list as if he were the opposing pitcher, wasting not a
moment or a pitch. No fear, none at all, and maybe
English-as-a-second-language explains why Dotel generically
referred to Bonds as ``they'' but Al Leiter was willing to guess
not.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of Dotel's leap from the minor leagues to the heat
of the pennant race reminded Leiter of a dugout conversation he had
a couple of summers ago with Livan Hernandez, the Cuban defector
who was then a Florida Marlins rookie on his way to post-season
glory. They were watching San Diego take batting practice from the
dugout one day when Hernandez turned to him and said, ``Al, Ken
Caminiti, he have power, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at him at first like he was pulling my leg,'' Leiter
said. ``I mean, you're in the major leagues and you have to ask if
Ken Caminiti has power? Then I realized he wasn't kidding and it
also hit me that none of these guys made all that much of a
difference to him. His focus was on making pitches, on execution,
on that catcher's glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Greg Maddux has been the best pitcher in the decade, it's
because all he thinks is the next pitch. If you're a young pitcher,
if you've got talent and you're able to block out the distractions,
you have a reasonable chance to throw a good game. I look at
Octavio, and he reminds me of Livan. There's the barrier of being a
young Latin American player, so he's probably not driving in his
car, turning to his radio dial, right to the FAN. He may not be
reading every word about himself in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, on a shelf in Dotel's locker stall was a thin stack of
newspaper clippings, and if his English isn't perfect, it was
certainly good enough for a post-game appearance Wednesday on
``Kiner's Korner.''
</P>
<P>
   He says winter ball in the Dominican Republic, pitching against
major leaguers there as a 20-year-old, has removed any sense of
awe.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone around Dotel in the clubhouse, from Leiter to Mike
Piazza, says this 23-year-old from Santo Domingo is a good
listener, a fast learner. Orel Hershiser, off to Los Angeles early
Wednesday for his start Thursday night against Kevin Brown and the
Dodgers, appointed himself mentor upon Dotel's arrival from the
minor leagues in June, and has counseled him on everything from how
to deal with a disappointing start to packing his long underwear
for a trip to chilly San Francisco last month. It was Hershiser who
tracked Dotel to the clubhouse after he lost a no-hitter in San
Diego, helped to calm him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orel comes to me and says, `Forget it, that happened to me,'''
Dotel said. ``He talks to me all the time, about everything. I say,
`I appreciate that and thank you.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is baby-faced, bright-eyed, with a peach-fuzz mustache and an
affectionate air that runs contrary to his manager's claim that
Dotel ``doesn't fool around,'' and that he has a fearlessness that
``I've seen right along.''
</P>
<P>
   He has the toughness, the talent and a 7-1 record. The Mets are
10-3 in games Dotel has started. In deciding how to factor Dotel
into a post-season equation, Bobby Valentine only has to talk to
Leiter about Livan Hernandez, or remember that Joe Torre handed the
ball to the other Hernandez, Orlando, for the Yankees' pivotal
playoff game last year at Cleveland. Then consider that no one on
his staff has Dotel's golden arm, and the answer should come as
easy as Dotel disposed of Bonds. &QL;

   WACO, Texas _ Plaintiffs in the Branch Davidian lawsuit against
the government Wednesday asked for a status conference to find out
when they can look at stored evidence and whether the trial date
next month is likely to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mike Caddell of Houston, who represents several
plaintiffs including fire survivor Misty Ferguson, asked U.S.
District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco to approve a conference
as soon as possible. Caddell's motion also laid out other issues
for discussion, such as whether there should be separate trials for
liability and damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government asked to bifurcate the trial, separate it into
two parts,'' Caddell said. ``Try only the liability in the first
part; damages in the second part, if necessary. The judge never
issued a decision on that. We need to know if we go to trial
whether we have to present our whole case or just the case on
liability.''
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Justice spokesman did not return a telephone
call requesting an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he is not opposed to splitting up the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, when you've been burned to death or committed
suicide or shot to save you the agony of burning alive, I don't
think a lot of time has to be spent on the issue of damages,''
Caddell said. ``It's not a sore back case where you have to worry
if the guy is faking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Splitting the liability and damage phases of trial could save
both sides time and money, Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all would save time if we didn't have to put on damage
claims for someone the court eventually decides has no claim to
liability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell also asked Smith for a chance to discuss an earlier
motion for a continuance. The plaintiffs would like to move the
trial date from Oct. 18 to either Dec. 6 or Jan. 10, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The government filed a motion Tuesday asking Smith to either
strike all expert witnesses for the plaintiffs _ claiming they have
not been given enough information on the expert witnesses' proposed
testimony to even know whether to seek rebuttal witnesses _ or
grant a continuance.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he discussed the issue of having a status
conference with Marie Hagen, a Department of Justice attorney, who
was not opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides agree there should be a delay in the trial,''
Caddell said. ``We disagree as to the length. We think we could be
ready to go to trial in December. The government would like at
least six months to get ready. I think six months is way too long.
If anyone could use six months, it's not the government, who has
had access to the evidence for six years. Really, that argument is
kind of laughable.''

HERBERT STEIN, 83, ECONOMIST, ADVISER TO NIXON AND FORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herbert Stein, a free-market economist who used careful analysis
and sharp wit to persuade business constituencies in the 1940s to
rally behind the ``unnatural'' idea of using federal budget
deficits to regulate the economy, died Wednesday at a hospital in
Washington. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Rachel Epstein
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Most famous as a member and later chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers during the Nixon and Ford administrations, Stein
seldom let ideological purity stand in the way of what he thought
was economic common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Stein made news in the 1960s and '70s, but he made economic
history in the 1940s. He served as an economist for the Committee
for Economic Development for 22 years, starting in 1945. The
committee, formed during World War II by executives and educators
to study economic issues, adopted early on the idea, associated
with John Maynard Keynes, of running deficits to moderate economic
downturns.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Solow, a Nobel laureate from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, applauded Stein's role in bringing the business
community, a potentially hostile audience, behind the strategic use
of deficits, a linchpin of economic thinking in the Kennedy,
Johnson and Nixon administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He convinced a powerful business lobby that there was no
ideological reason not to pursue Keynesian fiscal policy,'' Solow
said Wednesday. Stein argued that while government spending and
revenue could be matched over the long run, it could be
economically destructive during recessions to raise taxes or cut
spending to eliminate deficits in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   By now, this idea is commonplace. But it was an uncomfortable,
heretical notion in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, at the suggestion of professor Milton Friedman of the
University of Chicago, served on President Richard M. Nixon's
Council of Economic Advisers from 1969 to 1972 and as chairman of
the council until 1974, under President Gerald R. Ford. During that
time, he helped design Nixon's 90-day freeze of wages and prices
and its aftermath _ an uncomfortable position for a conservative
who preached the benefits of unfettered markets.
</P>
<P>
   After he left government, he became a professor at the
University of Virginia and joined the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative research group. He gained more fame by
writing pointed, often humorous columns for The Wall Street
Journal, The New York Times and other large newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Because his writing often defended surprisingly liberal
positions, he became known as the liberals' favorite conservative _
a tagline, Solow said, that made Stein cringe because he wanted his
ideas to be applauded for their sensible, pragmatic underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   Stein came to what others perceived as contradictory positions
because he followed the nonideological logic of the economist's
tool box. He argued against those, including fellow Republicans,
who focused on a relatively small number, the federal deficit, when
what they should be analyzing, he said, is the entire composition
of national spending. With that figure in mind, Stein argued that
the nation could afford to spend not only more on the military,
which he often favored, but also more to combat poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schultze of the Brookings Institution praised Stein for
refusing to give into fads. He understood that taxes depress
economic activity, but he refused to follow those who fell in love
with extreme versions of supply-side economics _ the notion,
popular in the 1980s, that tax cuts would unleash waves of more
work and investment. Schultze recalls a conference at which Stein
punctured a speaker's faddish claims about the revolutionary effect
of computers and the Internet by simply observing that the effect
of those technological changes did not compare to that of the steam
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Stein was born in Detroit, received a bachelor's degree from
Williams College in 1935 and a doctorate in economics from the
University of Chicago in 1958. His most important academic work was
``The Fiscal Revolution in America,'' published in 1969, which
examined decades of U.S. fiscal policy and its effect on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, Stein is survived by a son, Ben, of
Los Angeles, the host of the Comedy Central quiz program ``Win Ben
Stein's Money''; a sister, Pearl Weiss, of Sarasota, Fla., and
three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Stein was famous for making sensible economic points with wit
and style. He frequently noted that ``if a thing cannot go on
forever, it will stop.'' His point was that economies adjust to
growing trade deficits, accelerating prices and ballooning deficits
and that to project that bad things will continue indefinitely
makes no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning against attaching religious significance to the
governmental deficit, Stein wrote: ``I have consulted a concordance
on the Bible. Apparently the world `budget' does not appear in
either the Old or the New Testament. The world `balance' does
appear about eight times, but never in connection with fiscal
policy.''

   CANADIAN AUTO WORKERS TO BARGAIN WITH FORD FIRST
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor will be the pattern-setting company in labor
negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers Union, the union
announced. The union will first try to reach a deal with Ford, then
it plans to follow the industry tradition of demanding that GM and
DaimlerChrysler accept its terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union said it chose Ford in part because the leader
of the American union, Stephen P. Yokich, had narrowed his choices
to General Motors and DaimlerChrysler. Industry and labor experts
are betting the United Automobile Workers will name DaimlerChrysler
as its lead company.

   GREENSPAN TALKS, BUT NOT OF RATES
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested
in a speech that the U.S. economy's expansion could continue,
thanks to advancements in technology. But he did not discuss his
views on interest rates, inflation or current economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS END MIXED AHEAD OF REPORT
</P>
<P>
   Stocks ended mixed as investors remained cautious ahead of the
producer price index. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.21
points, to 11,036.34. The Nasdaq composite index fell 28.52 points,
or 1.02 percent, to 2,808.74, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index declined 6.30 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to
1,344.15.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices edged up as traders covered short positions after
the Federal Reserve took measures to insure there would be enough
money in the banking system to counter any Year 2000 computer
problems. The yield on the 30-year issue was unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   SEC FINES VAN KAMPEN $100,000
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission censured and fined Van
Kampen Investment Advisory $100,000 for marketing the Van Kampen
Growth fund's hot track record without disclosing how its returns
were actually obtained. The SEC said Van Kampen improperly failed
to disclose to investors that more than half of the fund's 1996
return of 62 percent came from hot initial offerings. The fund was
able to buy these initial offerings while it had only a few hundred
thousand dollars of assets and was closed to the public.

<P>
   BRITAIN RAISES KEY INTEREST RATE
</P>
<P>
   Britain's central bank raised a key short-term money rate for
the first time in more than a year in a pre-emptive move against
inflation. The quarter-point increase in the securities repurchase
rate, to 5.25 percent, broke a series of seven modest rate cuts. In
response, the pound rose, settling in London at $1.6209 and in New
York at $1.6192, up from $1.6049. Stocks moved lower, closing down
slightly less than 1 percent in London.

WITNESS IN RUSSIAN-SWISS PROBE LINKS YELTSIN AND KIN TO
CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>

   ZURICH, Switzerland _ A central figure in an investigation of
corruption in the Kremlin said Wednesday that he had seen credit
card bills and photocopies of credit cards bearing the signatures
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his daughters, and that the
cards had been provided by a Swiss construction company that has
done $1.5 billion worth of work for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The informant, Felipe Turover, a Soviet emigre who carries
Spanish and Israeli passports and who worked for a Swiss bank as a
debt collector in Russia, also said senior officials of the bank
had described to him a Kremlin meeting at which senior Russian
officials accepted money and gifts from the Swiss company, Mabetex
Project Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of those receiving a gift was Pavel Borodin, the
powerful property management director for the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   The executives of the bank, Banca del Gottardo, ``said they were
a little surprised,'' Turover said, ``and asked, was this the
normal way of doing business there?''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has denied that Yeltsin or his daughters ever
received such credit cards or similar favors. In a telephone
conversation with President Clinton on Wednesday, Yeltsin denied
any involvement in the broadening money-laundering scandal, White
House officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Banca del Gottardo spokesman Massimo Antonini said the bank
would not comment on Turover's claims. But in the past it has
firmly denied such allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin has denied ever having pocketed bribes from Mabetex. In
a statement issued by the Kremlin on Wednesday, he described the
allegations against him as ``rubbish.'' He said some might be based
on forged documents, saying it was ``very easy to falsify credit
cards and signatures on them.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no charges have been filed land _ A central figure in an

cards and signatures on them.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no charges have been filed against any Russian officials
or others involved in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Turover, 35, has been a key witness in the Swiss investigation,
which was opened this year in response to a request by Moscow Chief
Prosecutor Yuri Skuratov, who was later fired by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turover boasts of broad past acquaintances in the
Kremlin, including reformers like Anatoly Chubais and Yegor Gaidar,
and of visits to the President's office in days gone by, he makes
no secret of his contempt for Yeltsin, whom he accuses of presiding
over corruption and decline.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Turover has been questioned several times in
Moscow by Russian magistrates, including Skuratov and Georgi
Chuglazov, who was prevented last week by the Kremlin from
traveling to Switzerland to investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   Turover has also been questioned by Swiss Prosecutor-General
Carla Del Ponte. Officials in Mrs. Del Ponte's office said it was
in part in response to information that Turover provided that
Skuratov sent his detailed request for help.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians under investigation, in addition to Borodin,
include members of his family and about two dozen other senior
Kremlin officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the most serious charges raised by Turover regard the credit
cards reportedly issued to Yeltsin and his daughters, Yelena
Okulova and Tatyana Dyachenko. Mrs. Dyachenko is considered to hold
considerable influence in Kremlin affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov said Tuesday that an estimate of how much Mabetex had
paid Russian officials in bribes _ about $10 million _ was supplied
by Mrs. Del Ponte in March when she visited Moscow to discuss the
case. He said part of the money was managed by Mabatex head Beghet
Pacolli, who used Mabatex-controlled accounts to pay credit card
bills for Yeltsin and his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov also said Yeltsin and his daughters should be
questioned about the credit cards. ``Naturally, the president
should be asked whether he knew about the situation,'' Skuratov
said in a television interview. ``And his daughters should be asked
as well. How did they look at this money? Why did they consider it
possible to spend it? These are basic questions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Turover, who left the Soviet Union in 1982, when he was 18, to
move to Spain, worked in the early 1990s with Banca del Gottardo in
Lugano, Switzerland, collecting corporate debt for Western
companies in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   About 1994, he said, a Banca del Gottardo executive responsible
for Eastern Europe, Franco Fenini, showed him photocopies of the
Yeltsin family's credit cards, including the signatures of Yeltsin
and his daughters, and copies of credit card bills that Fenini said
were paid from Mabetex accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Turover could not recall the amounts or creditors on the bills.
According to published reports, Yeltsin had an American Express
card and his daughters had Eurocards. Yeltsin reportedly used his
card only for minor purchases and largely out of curiosity, while
his daughters made some larger purchases through a Swiss shop.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss magistrates have confirmed that in a raid on the Mabetex
headquarters in Lugano in January, they confiscated credit card
records and copies of the cards themselves in Fenini's office
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Reymond, Mrs. Del Ponte's spokesman, said Wednesday
that all the confiscated documents had been sent to Moscow in two
shipments this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Turover, sipping beer and puffing cigarillos during an interview
Wednesday, said he had met Fenini about 1990 through an Italian
businessman, a mutual acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, foreign companies'
inability to collect debts in Russia prompted Banca del Gottardo,
which specializes in trade finance, to start a collection
operation. For this, the bank hired Turover, who worked in Moscow
and reported to Fenini.
</P>
<P>
   Turover said he is not afraid to speak out, and said that if he
is threatened, he will release documents from an ``archive,''
although he insisted that he has never illegally stolen or copied
confidential documents.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Turover spends much of his time these days at an expensive hotel
in the hills above Zurich, and his phone book bulges with the
numbers of important people in Russia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Turover's own career is fraught with conflict and
recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of his relationship with Fenini, according to
Filippo Ferrari, Fenini's lawyer, the men got along well. They
traveled together to Mexico, where Turover had lived for several
years after leaving the Soviet Union. When Turover was in Lugano,
he often stayed at Fenini's house.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men's friendship and business relationship broke up
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Banca del Gottardo's debt-collection program,
Turover said, about 40 percent to 50 percent was destined for the
company that was owed the money, while 10 percent to 15 percent
went to the bank and the rest to him.
</P>
<P>
   But almost from the start, Turover said, Fenini had demanded and
received from Turover a share of his commission. In 1995, when
Turover complained to the bank's management, Fenini was fired _ and
was quickly hired by Pacolli at Mabatex to work as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Turover would not say how much he earned collecting debts for
Banca del Gottardo, only that the figure had `'more than six
zeros.'' But someone familiar with his work said he had made about
$6.5 million. Now, Turover says, he is demanding that the bank
repay him the money Fenini took from his fees, which he estimates
at more than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pacolli denies that his company paid any kickbacks, and says he
has no knowledge of the Yeltsin family credit cards. At a news
conference in Lugano last week, he threatened to bring charges
against Turover for violating Swiss bank secrecy, implying that
Turover had supplied investigators and perhaps others with
confidential documents from Banca del Gottardo.
</P>
<P>
   As he describes it, Turover's role helps illustrate the dynamics
of the cooperation in fighting organized crime that has developed
between Swiss and Russian investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Turover said he was interrogated by Mrs. Del Ponte before the
Russians made their request for legal assistance. In April last
year, Mrs. Del Ponte and Skuratov signed an agreement to supply
each other with better information about Russian organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of testimony given by Turover, officials in Mrs.
Del Ponte's office said, she suggested to Skuratov that he
formulate a clear request for legal help, a move that enabled the
Swiss to move energetically with their investigation of people
suspected of money laundering and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In his effort to recover the money he says Fenini skimmed from
his fees, Turover has sued Fenini for extortion and forgery,
accusing him of forging his signature on withdrawal slips. Fenini
is countersuing.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets the $3 million, Turover says, he will donate it to
handicapped children.

<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ Superior National Insurance Group announced
Wednesday it has filed a contract fraud suit against two
reinsurers, seeking more than $200 million in damages for canceling
workers' compensation coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges American
Re-Insurance Co. and Inter-Ocean Reinsurance Co. Ltd. have
illegally backed out of a 1998 agreement to provide Superior's
Business Insurance Group subsidiary with $175 million in coverage.
It seeks compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fraudulent actions of American (Re-Insurance) and
Inter-Ocean that Superior National has alleged are, in my opinion,
the most egregious that we have seen in the recent history of the
reinsurance industry,'' said Robert Nagle, Superior's general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Superior bought its Business Insurance Group from Foundation
Health Systems in late 1998 after, as a condition of the $285
million sale, requiring FHS to obtain the reinsurance for the group
in order to boost its $522 million in reserves. According to Nagle,
FHS accepted American Re-Insurance's offer of $175 million in
coverage for $28 million, even though one actuary estimated the
reserves might go as much as $275 million higher.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, Superior, based in Calabasas, northwest
of downtown Los Angeles, made a claim with the reinsurer to cover
an additional $175 million in losses at the group. New Jersey-based
American Re-Investment and Inter-Ocean, a Bermuda-based affiliate,
notified Superior in July that the agreement had been rescinded and
demanded arbitration of the issue, claiming they had been misled
during the due diligence period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The reinsurers did not respond Wednesday to a request for
comment on the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle said the dispute reflects a growing trend among reinsurers
to stall and force renegotiation of contracts after obtaining the
contract by underpricing the potential losses. ``Superior National
views their actions as an attempt to bully a smaller company into
an arbitration process in which American (Re-Investment) and
Inter-Ocean perceive they have little or nothing to lose,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Superior's stock has lost about 40 percent of its value since
July and declined 37.5 cents to $14.375 a share Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Superior employs about 400 people locally and 1,400 worldwide.
In August, it reported $654 million in premiums in force as of the
end of June and posted second-quarter earnings of $2.2 million, or
13 cents a share.

COMMENTARY: DO DOGS GO TO HEAVEN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday, Sept. 10)  
(bl) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   c.1999 N.Y.
Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who haven't already screamed themselves hoarse over
the creationism/evolution thing, Dog Fancy magazine offers an even
more controversial topic in its September issue: ``Do Dogs Go To
Heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders from a variety of denominations were posed the
question, as was Mary Buddemeyer Porter, author of ``Will I See
Fido In Heaven?'' and Stephen H. Webb, author of ``On God and
Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the jokes where the priest, the rabbi and the minister
are stranded in a lifeboat, there was plenty of disagreement. A
priest, the Rev. Brian McSweeney of New York, said that a dog had
to have a relationship with a human in order to get into heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious follow-up question is: What kind of relationship are
we talking about here? Are we talking about a dog that chews shoes
and pees on the furniture or a dog that pulls children from burning
buildings and digs mountain climbers out of snowbanks?
</P>
<P>
   What about the vast majority of dogs that fall somewhere between
the two extremes? Are they like minor-league baseball players who
get called up to ``The Show'' for a ``cup of coffee'' (or, in this
case, a doggie biscuit) every few years but spend the vast majority
of their time riding in a hot bus with a bunch of mutts?
</P>
<P>
   A minister, the Rev. Andrew Linzey of England, thought the whole
good dog/bad dog question was irrelevant in terms of getting into
heaven, if not in terms of shoe-destruction and furniture-staining.
He said that dogs, like other animals, are incapable of making
moral choices. Buddemeyer Porter agreed, saying that dogs will get
to heaven regardless of their behavior on Earth because dogs are
innocent of any sin.
</P>
<P>
   My personal opinion is that if there is a heaven, dogs will
certainly get into it, though what they will do once they get up
there (out there? over there?) is anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   I'm imagining a place where dogs outnumber people, oh, about
10,000 to 1, so it will be plenty noisy and probably not smell all
that great. To pass the time (assuming that concept has any meaning
in heaven) there will be garbage cans to knock over and angel
mailmen to chase.
</P>
<P>
   The random oxygen molecules that some dogs, like mine, like to
bark at so much on Earth will be visible in heaven and will have
the shape and flavor of cheese curls. Dogs in heaven will be able
to eat as many of these snack molecules as they want without being
scolded or gaining weight.
</P>
<P>
   I will leave it to the theologians to decide whether cats get
into heaven, but I'm inclined to think that if they do, it will be
a heaven separate from dogs. After all, what kind of heaven would
it be to be chased for all eternity by a pack of slobbering
Rotweillers? A mighty fine heaven for the Rotweillers, I'd think,
but considerably less so for the cats.
</P>
<P>
   Whether only dog-lovers will be allowed to join dogs in doggie
heaven is another thorny question. Some people love dogs, some
people hate dogs and some go back and forth depending on whether
the dog is sleeping or crotch-sniffing. This raises the possibility
of a compartmentalized heaven, sort of like modern doctor's offices
where you get shuttled into ever-smaller, ever-colder rooms until
you finally find yourself alone in something the size of an Amana
freezer, naked save for a paper napkin across your lap, staring at
a color photograph of a smokers lung for the remainder of eternity
or until the doctor arrives, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   So what we're looking at here is a vision of doggie heaven
that's devoid of cats, light on people, is cold, harshly lit and
smells like a doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Not much of a reward for a lifetime without sin, if you ask me.

ANNAN ORDERS, THEN POSTPONES, EVACUATION OF U.N. MISSION IN EAST
TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 5th graf for clarification) (bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Security
Council walked up to the brink of confrontation with Indonesia on
Wednesday, then backed away when President B.J. Habibie and his
army chief, Gen. Wiranto, begged for more time to put East Timor in
order.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, after violence in the territory showed little
sign of abating despite two days of martial law, Annan decided to
evacuate the U.N. mission in East Timor _ several hundred foreign
and local employees and their families. He also asked officials at
the United Nations in New York to begin contingency planning for an
outside military force for the territory, a step the Indonesians
have rejected repeatedly in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot stand by and allow the people of East Timor to be
killed,'' a visibly drawn Annan said Wednesday morning after a
night of telephone conversations with world leaders, including two
with Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   But a few hours later, the Security Council was told that plans
for evacuating the United Nations' East Timor mission had been
suspended, to be reviewed in 24 hours. An official at the United
Nations in New York said that Wiranto had told Annan's top
political adviser that he needed another day to negotiate with
military chiefs in the territory _ an admission that he could not
insure even the safety of a U.N. withdrawal, or what would happen
after the mission left.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Security Council, meeting in private,
rejected a strong plea from Portugal on Wednesday to hold a formal,
open Council debate on how to respond to the crisis, which would
have forced the 15 member nations to state their positions in the
face of the crisis. Portugal, which is not a Council member, could
not call the open meeting, only request it.
</P>
<P>
   Peter van Walsum, the Dutch representative and this month's
Council president, said there was no consensus among members for
such a meeting. The Council, he said, preferred to wait until a
five-member mission that it sent to Indonesia on Monday had a
chance to meet Habibie and possibly Wiranto on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto, who replaced his commander in East Timor on Wednesday,
has very little control in the territory, said John Bresnan, an
expert on Indonesia at Columbia University's East Asian Institute,
who recently returned from Indonesia. In East Timor, he said,
officers connected to the former chief of Indonesia's most powerful
commando unit, Lt. Gen. Prabowo _ a son-in-law of Indonesia's
deposed president, Suharto _ have almost all the local power in
their hands, and they could defy Jakarta's efforts to end the
violence for essentially political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and officials at the United Nations in New York, like
Bresnan and other academic experts, said the East Timor crisis has
hit Indonesia at its most vulnerable political moment in decades.
There will inevitably be political fallout, they say, but they add
that no one can predict what it will be.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Monteiro, Portugal's representative at the United
Nations, said Wednesday that an acute awareness of this unstable
political situation plays a significant role in the thinking at the
United Nations during these tense days. ``There is a real crisis of
leadership in the country,'' said Bresnan, a former Ford Foundation
director in Jakarta and author of ``Managing Indonesia'' (Columbia
University Press). ``Nobody is really in charge very much. All the
institutions are down, including the army. They are divided by
factions, personalized factions. So you have people acting as
individuals, dealing with other individuals, and no institutions
functioning at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``People speak of the government,'' he said. ``There is no
single government. ``Habibie is still trying to get elected. He
needs the army's votes to get elected. He has to be very cautious
of General Wiranto. General Wiranto is very cautious because he is
also a survivor of the Suharto regime, like Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be primarily concerned with preserving what unity he
can within the army itself,'' Bresnan said. ``That is his top
priority, not what the IMF does, not what the Security Council
does.'' This partially explains why Indonesia seems to care so
little about public opinion as militias roam East Timor,
vandalizing towns and driving frightened people into exile, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people in Indonesia don't care about East Timor,'' he
added. It is a very small part of a large nation trying to deal
with a political revolution and economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the Security Council, there is growing support for
international intervention, with China and Russia joining in
condemning the violence and asking for action. China's deputy
representative, Shen Guofeng, told reporters that his government
believed that the situation in East Timor was out of control. But
China later succeeded in toning down a sense of threat in the
Security Council statement that followed. However, all governments
continue to insist that Indonesia be given every possible chance to
reassert control.
</P>
<P>
   This poses a dilemma for the United Nations, which fears for the
safety of not only its own officials and local employees in East
Timor but also the 2,000 East Timorese who fled to the U.N.
compound in the capital, Dili, for protection. Annan said Wednesday
morning that their fate was also on his mind as he decided what to
do. Wednesday, officials were calling for volunteers to stay behind
if an evacuation was necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.N. mission in East Timor had been expected to remain well
into next year, by then bolstered with peacekeeping troops, to ease
the region's transition to independence. Officials have considered
asking Indonesia to move to that phase now, allowing international
troops into the territory without admitting a loss of control. But
government leaders seem insistent that this phase must wait until
after the newly elected Indonesian Parliament assembles in November
and chooses a president.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps, too, are surrounded by uncertainty now. Officials
here are watching the statements of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the
Indonesian opposition leader whose party finished first, but
without a clear majority, in national legislative elections. In the
past, she has opposed letting East Timor go, echoing the strong
nationalism of her father, Sukarno, who as Indonesia's first
president attacked and bombed rebels in Sumatra and Sulawesi when
they tried to secede.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Megawati has since changed her approach slightly,
saying Sunday that she is sorry about what the East Timorese are
going through at the hands of Habibie, she may be more acceptable
to the military than he is. Then, some diplomats ask, would the
entire East Timor agreement be in jeopardy?

COMMENTARY: THE VISION BEHIND THE CBS-VIACOM MERGER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A merger like the one announced Tuesday between CBS and Viacom
is usually accompanied by bold predictions and the release of a
flock of superlatives. This merger was no exception. Listen to
Viacom's press release: ``The union of the two companies offers a
dramatic opportunity to drive revenues and enhance shareholder
value. Reaching the greatest number of viewers and listeners of any
media enterprise, spanning all ages and demographics, the new
Viacom will be the premier outlet for advertisers in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This is tall talk, but it offers a glimpse of how Sumner
Redstone and Mel Karmazin, the chief executives of Viacom and CBS,
imagine that the media world, which has been reformulating itself
rapidly, now looks.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, all that will happen when CBS and Viacom merge is
that two self-referential systems will become one system with a
wider range of self-reference, directing a larger, more diverse
audience to a broader array of entertainment products and services,
all of them owned by Viacom. Like other recent media mergers, there
is something almost hydraulic about the vision underlying this
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been talking about this union as though it were
the solution to a jigsaw puzzle, a matter of pieces fitting. But
what is really at stake is distribution, the ability to create a
seamless pipeline that delivers advertising, properly diluted with
programming, all across the demographic spectrum, where it will at
last ooze into the presence of the audience, young (MTV) and old
(CBS), through its medium of choice: movies, broadcast television,
cable, radio, billboards, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed synergy _ not from the creative side of these
companies, the side where synergy is always being touted, but from
the business side. Obviously, advertising sales depend to a certain
degree on the quality of a television show, for instance, as well
as its distribution. But the audience this merger most clearly
serves is the shareholders. On the creative side, synergy is still
largely an illusion. On the business side, it is just common sense.
</P>
<P>
   In a different business climate, less relentlessly focused on
short-term stock performance, the scale of the new Viacom might
guarantee creative independence, even experimentation. One
anonymous television executive, quoted in Wednesday's Times, said:
``They've now created a company so big that the relative
performance of next week's new movie and next week's television
show is diminished. You've insulated the stock from weak
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   What this executive means is that shareholders are protected
from the effect of unpopular shows. But that same insulation from
stock market pressures could also be used to encourage and protect
creativity. That, however, is not a likely outcome of this kind of
merger.
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost hopelessly old-fashioned to worry about the
consolidation of media outlets at a time when, so the accepted
wisdom goes, media outlets are being created faster than they can
be consolidated. Cable and now the Internet have dramatically
unsettled what was once a stable, familiar media landscape. The
Internet, especially, creates the illusion that mergers of the
CBS/Viacom kind will inevitably be offset by a radical, almost
uncontrollable independence on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But the furious capitalization of Internet companies tells us
that they too are game for consolidation, as does Internet usage,
which is driven more and more by fewer and fewer Web sites of the
kind already owned by Viacom. When it comes to media companies,
bigger does not necessarily mean better. It merely means more of
the same.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A deep gap over politics and values has opened over
the last two decades between the nation's increasingly conservative
military elite and prominent civilians without military service,
sowing latent distrust despite the respect each group professes for
the other.
</P>
<P>
   These are the first findings of a major study of military and
civilian attitudes, focusing on a problem that Defense Secretary
William Cohen has called a major challenge for him: ``to somehow
prevent a chasm from developing between the military and civilian
worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were few disagreements about foreign policy among
the two groups, the single most striking finding was political.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Americans divide about evenly between calling
themselves Democrats or Republicans, but the study found that 64
percent of elite military officers called themselves Republicans.
Only 8 percent said they were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A more modest gap on political identification had been measured
before. Comparable 1976 data found that 33 percent of military
officers identified themselves as Republicans and 12 percent as
Democrats. The 1976 survey did not cover values.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder, in both surveys, said they were independent or
had no political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The most startling differences were found between the military
leaders and the potential military leaders, like students at
advanced schools like the war colleges, and prominent civilians who
had never served in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians were selected at random from ``Who's Who'' and
from other lists, like prominent women, the clergy, foreign policy
experts, labor leaders and the news media. Prominent civilians with
military service fell in between.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 45 percent of the military group favored barring
homosexuals from teaching in public schools, while only 17 percent
of the nonveteran civilian group did. Only 10 percent of the
military leaders supported a ban on the death penalty, while 37
percent of the civilians did. And 74 percent of the military group
backed permitting prayer in public schools, compared with 46
percent of the civilian group.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the differences can be explained by the fact that the
officers were almost all male, while the nonveteran civilian group
was two-fifths female.
</P>
<P>
   The results were taken from nearly 4,000 interviews conducted in
late 1998 and early 1999 as part of a $500,000 study that will
ultimately produce at least 20 academic papers. The study is
coordinated for the Triangle Institute for Security Studies, a
North Carolina foundation, by Richard H. Kohn, a professor of
history at the University of North Carolina, and Peter D. Feaver,
associate professor of political science at Duke University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first findings were the hot topic last weekend at the 95th
annual meeting of the American Political Science Association in
Atlanta. Further data are to be made public at a conference by the
Triangle Institute in late October in Caughny, Ill., including a
comparison with the views of the general civilian public that may
show the nonveteran elite more at odds with ordinary Americans than
is the military elite.
</P>
<P>
   In papers presented at the Atlanta meeting, scholars had more
fear of potential dangers than evidence of any impact of the gap
thus far. Professor Ole R. Holsti of Duke, who longed for the days
when generals like George C. Marshall never even voted, said, ``A
political military is worrisome if it just becomes another interest
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Charles Stevenson of the National War College said it
was ``scary'' to have ``an officer corps so overwhelmingly
Republican.'' ``In the 19th century, officers frequently had
political alignments,'' Stevenson said, ``but they did not favor a
single party consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin O. Fordham, assistant professor of political science at
the State University of New York at Albany, said the gap in beliefs
had not affected either military spending or the rates of
enlistment and re-enlistment. But the professor said he worried
that Democrats might not take seriously warnings from a military
establishment that they perceived as overwhelmingly Republican.
</P>
<P>
   One clear finding was a widespread unhappiness in the military
with current trends in civilian society. But despite the generally
high regard the public holds for the military, there were some
clear measures of latent civilian distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Support for the military drops, even precipitously, as
connections to the military disappear,'' wrote Feaver and Paul
Gronke, assistant professor of political science at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one percent, for example, of the civilian nonveteran
elite said they would be disappointed if a child joined the armed
forces. Just 7 percent of the military officers felt that way. On
the other hand, 77 percent of officers agreed with the statement
that ``civilian society would be better off if it adopted more of
the military's values and customs;'' only 43 percent of civilian
elites with military experience agreed and just 25 percent of the
nonveterans agreed.
</P>
<P>
   One simple explanation for some of the gap is the differing
attitudes of men and women. Women comprise 41 percent of the
civilian nonveteran elite, but only 8 percent of the military
elite. Feaver said in an interview that on many of the issues
examined, as much as half the difference between military and
civilian opinions could be attributed to the relative conservatism
of men.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference between the Republicanism of the more than
600 almost all-male officers surveyed and the nearly 700 nonveteran
civilians is only marginally related to the preference of women for
the Democratic Party. The most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll
showed that 29 percent of the public were Republicans and 31
percent Democrats. Among men, 29 percent also said they were
Republicans but just 26 percent identified themselves as
Democrats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the nonveteran civilian elite, 30 percent called
themselves Republicans and 43 percent Democrats, while among
veterans, 47 percent identified themselves as Republicans and 23
percent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans averaged nearly 60 years old, while the nonveterans
averaged around 50.

   Two other military groups were also surveyed, nearly 400
officers in the active reserves and 1,700 students in the Reserve
Officers Training Corps in colleges and cadets and midshipmen at
the service academies, who were identified as ``pre-commissioned''
respondents. Among the reservists, 63 percent said they were
Republicans and 10 percent identified themselves as Democrats,
while 47 percent of the students said they were Republican and 12
percent Democrats.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Holsti said it was clear that the Republican trend in the
military began well before President Clinton took office. There is
considerable tension between the administration and the military
over Clinton's avoiding the draft, his attempt to remove barriers
to homosexuals in the services, and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Holsti also said the Republicans in the military were not
extremists; only 13 percent called themselves ``very
conservative.'' They rejected propositions such as removing books
attacking religion or promoting communism or homosexuality from
library shelves by the same sort of overwhelming majorities as
others in the study.
</P>
<P>
   On military and foreign policy questions, there were a large
number of agreements between the nonveterans and the military
elite. Both overwhelmingly supported using the United Nations to
help settle international disputes and felt the American public
would not tolerate large numbers of casualties in military
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups heavily rejected the idea that military, rather than
political goals, should govern the use of force. Both disagreed
sharply with the statement, ``We shouldn't think so much in
international terms but concentrate more on our own national
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also clear differences. Among the nonveterans, 59
percent agreed with the statement that ``American national security
depends more on international trade and a strong domestic economy
than on our military strength.'' Only 37 percent of the officers
agreed. And 65 percent of the officers but only 43 percent of the
nonveterans agreed with the proposition that ``There is nothing
wrong with using the CIA to try to undermine hostile governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohn said in an interview that when the study is completed, ``We
are likely to have a set of conclusions that are complex.'' He said
the current level of discussion of the issue ``tends to be one of
extremes,'' either arguing that the differences between military
and civilians are of no consequence, or that they raise the threat
of a breakdown in civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   The professor said it was important to identify the differences
that were new, and also those that did not simply represent the
fact that the military was an ``unusual and very different
profession.''

DELTA AIR LINES DISMISSES SAATCHI &AMP; SAATCHI  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill., Minn.)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another giant airline is changing agencies. If only
the planes would move as fast as the accounts do.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines in Atlanta ended a two-month review late
Wednesday by dismissing its agency of two and a half years, Saatchi
&AMP; Saatchi in New York, and shifting its worldwide account to the
Leo Burnett Company in Chicago. Delta has spent $45 million to $50
million annually on advertising in recent years, but trade
publications have reported billings on the account at an estimated
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very sad,'' said Jennifer Laing, North American
chairwoman and chief executive at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, part of
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC. ``We have great affection for the brand, and
we wish Delta well.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a new broom sweeps clean,'' she added, referring to a
shake-up in top management at Delta that left ``no one there who
hired us'' in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have at Delta is a brand in transition with management
change,'' Ms. Laing said. ``They wanted their own team. I've won
and lost on those before; it's common in our industry. That's life
on the fast track.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Burnett referred calls to Delta. There was no
response to several messages left for Delta public relations
executives.
</P>
<P>
   The decision returns Burnett to the lofty ranks of agencies with
big, blue-chip airline accounts. Burnett was blindsided in 1996
when it lost one of its flagship clients, the United Airlines unit
of the UAL Corp., which left for Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis
and Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A familiar theme of Burnett's popular campaigns for United,
which began in 1965, was ``Fly the friendly skies.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi's work for Delta did not seem to
strike similar chords with consumers. A theme that the agency
introduced in 1997, ``On top of the world,'' was recently
discontinued, airline executives said, because research among
flyers showed that they perceived the slogan as a boast by Delta
about its status in the airline industry rather than the intended
meaning that Delta lifted its passengers, as the song goes, up
where they belong.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta review began in July, when the airline disclosed that
it was holding talks with Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, the incumbent, and two
other agencies, Burnett and TBWA Worldwide in New York, part of
Omnicom Group. Last month, there were also meetings with two
additional shops, Grey Advertising in New York and the J. Walter
Thompson Company in New York, part of WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson subsequently withdrew from consideration, leaving four
finalists: Burnett, Grey, Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi and TBWA. Burnett had
been considered a front-runner because Leo F. Mullin, Delta's chief
executive, became familiar with top managers at that agency when he
was a top banking executive at the First Chicago Corp., now part of
the First Chicago NBD Corp..
</P>
<P>
   The saying ``When it rains, it pours'' apparently applies to
advertising as well as to salt because Burnett, which had been
without an airline client since United's departure, will now have
two. The agency's Stockholm office was named in July to handle the
account of Scandinavian Airlines System, with billings estimated at
$13 million. The trade publication Advertising Age reported that
SAS would not consider it a conflict for Burnett to work on its
account as well as Delta's.
</P>
<P>
   Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi will try to keep in place the employees who
have worked on the Delta account, Ms. Laing said, because ``we hope
to stay in the airline industry.'' That worked before, when the
agency landed Delta after losing the British Airways account.

ACLU SUES A SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR CLOSING ON THE JEWISH HIGH HOLY
DAYS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.J., N.Y.)   By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUE ASH, Ohio _ It began with Good Friday. Seven years ago a
group of Jewish parents here in the Sycamore Community School
District asked why the schools were closed for Good Friday and not
for the Jewish High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   When the school board eventually voted to cancel classes for the
High Holy Days, a group of Muslim and Hindu parents asked why the
schools did not also close for the most holy of their holidays. But
they got no satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in escalation of a fight that portends further growing
pains as the nation becomes more religiously diverse, the American
Civil Liberties Union is suing the Sycamore schools on the ground
that they are favoring one religion over others.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU says the district is giving preference to Jewish
families, and so violating the First Amendment. For its part, the
district says it closes on the High Holy Days only to avoid the
disruption of high absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict poses a challenge to the standard religious pecking
order that has evolved in many American cities and suburbs, where
Christians are the dominant majority, Jews a vocal minority, and
those of other faiths so few or unorganized as to be virtually
invisible. Here, parents of various minority religions have
asserted their presence by uniting and demanding treatment equal to
that of Jews _ holidays for all, or for none.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to give a holiday to the Jews, you ought to
give holidays to the Muslims, to the Hindus, to the Buddhists, to
the Sikhs _ and that is impractical,'' said Zeinab Schwen, a Muslim
parent with three children in Sycamore schools. ``If we're all
minorities, we're all minorities together. We shouldn't have
degrees of minority.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish High Holy Days bracket a 10-day period of
introspection and repentance that begins with Rosh ha-Shanah, which
this year starts this Friday at sundown, and ends with Yom Kippur.
Officials of the Sycamore schools, a well-heeled suburban district
15 miles northeast of Cincinnati, say they decided to close for
those two days only because so many students had been absent on
them. Bruce Armstrong, the superintendent, said about 15 percent of
the district's students, who number more than 6,200, did not go to
school on Rosh ha-Shanah or Yom Kippur before the policy of
shutting down then began. On major Muslim and Hindu holidays, he
said, only about 6 percent of students are absent, including a 3.5
percent routine rate of absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, other school districts, including New York
City's and some in New Jersey and Connecticut, also close for the
Jewish holidays. If the reason for the closing is that a high
proportion of teachers or students will be absent and cause
disruption, then that is fine, said Marc D. Stern, a lawyer with
the American Jewish Congress. ``You don't have to be a majority,''
Stern said. ``You just have to be enough of a minority for your
absence to disturb education.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``I have argued in districts that used to have
large numbers of Jews and don't anymore that it makes no sense, nor
is it morally right, to close down and leave the other kids with no
school, their parents working, and nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the lawsuit has alarmed school superintendents
elsewhere, concerned that their districts could also be sued
because they too close for the High Holy Days, ACLU officials said.
``I have been explaining to superintendents all over the east side
of Cleveland that this case is highly fact-specific, and it does
not mean anyone else is going to be sued,'' said Raymond Vasvari,
legal director of the ACLU of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The civil liberties union says the particular history of how the
schools came to be closed in the Sycamore district is evidence that
the reasons were not purely educational or secular.
</P>
<P>
   After Jewish parents first petitioned seven years ago for a High
Holy Days closing, the board appointed a calendar committee to
examine the issue. But the committee, whose members included
rabbis, a Protestant minister and parents of various religions,
recommended that the schools stay open, because ``an effort to
select some religious days as holidays while ignoring others does
not equate to equal treatment or religious sensitivity.'' The
schools did stay closed on Good Friday, because a day off on that
holiday had been written into the staff's union contract years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The High Holy Days issue remained a cause among some Jewish
parents, however. So in 1995 the board decided that if absenteeism
on a holiday reached a threshold 18 percentage points above the
average student absentee rate of about 3.5 percent, the schools
would be closed on that holiday as of the following year. In a
concession to Jewish parents, the board recommended that on the
High Holy Days, teachers not give tests or introduce new material.
</P>
<P>
   But ``it didn't work,'' said Armstrong, the superintendent. The
students who did attend were not provided ``a quality school day,''
he said, and some parents agree. They say their children spent the
day in class reading or reviewing. Even some non-Jewish parents
started keeping their children home.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1997 the board again revisited the issue, which was
introduced this time by Renee Roth, who by now was the board's
president. Ms. Roth, a former teacher, was one of the Jewish
parents who had initially petitioned the board to close for the
High Holy Days. In this 1997 vote, the board decided to try what it
called a ``pilot program'' in which the schools would shut on Rosh
ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur for the next two years. The vote was 3 to
2.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim and Hindu parents complained, and were joined by some
Jewish parents. The opponents presented the board a petition with
90 signatures. When that did not work, they hired a lawyer. The
ACLU got wind of the episode, and took the case on. The volunteer
lawyer is Stephen R. Felson, a Jew who lived in Israel for 14
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of using a governing body to vote in your
religious preference is bad in general,'' Felson said, ``and even
worse for minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of the Muslim or Hindu parents, or their Jewish or
Christian allies, were willing to sign on as plaintiffs, Felson
said. (Instead, the sole plaintiffs are the ACLU of Ohio and its
members.) Few of those parents were willing to be identified by a
reporter. They said they did not want to be seen as anti-Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roth and the other board members are all named as defendants
in the ACLU's lawsuit, and said they had been advised by the
district's lawyer not to give interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the case brought by the civil liberties union is
that the absenteeism rate never hit the 18-percentage-point
threshold the board itself had set, said Vasvari of the Ohio ACLU.
``The threshold policy is a sham,'' he said. ``Having set a
standard, they chose to disregard it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside an open house at Sycamore Junior High School one recent
evening, there were Christian parents who favored the closing, and
those who opposed it. There were also Jews who supported it, and
Jews who opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Several Jewish parents said they understood why the Muslims and
the Hindus felt offended. But one Jewish father saw the lawsuit as
hate-mongering by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it as a personal kick in the face,'' he said. ``They'll
do anything to bash a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Among many Jews, though, the issue is a difficult one, and the
prevailing sentiment is one of ambivalence. Waiting for school to
start one morning recently, a Jewish parent, Linda Rosner, said she
had always kept her daughter Margo home for the High Holy Days.
Margo added that in her elementary school class, 6 of the 21
students were Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it would cause disruption,'' Ms. Rosner said, ``that's a
good enough reason to close.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``I wouldn't think it's right to put any
religious group ahead of the other.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 9:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman's decision not to run for the U.S. Senate
stunned New Jersey politicians and disappointed those who had hoped
that a successful Senate campaign would give this personable,
middle-of-the-road Republican broader national exposure. Her
decision does not necessarily end her career in politics. By not
running for the Senate she leaves herself available should George
W. Bush want her as his running mate or, if he wins, in his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision also opens the door for an entirely different kind
of Senate contest in New Jersey. Democrats are abruptly cheerful at
the prospect of a primary brawl between Jon Corzine, a wealthy
political neophyte, and Jim Florio, a former governor. A half-dozen
state and congressional Republicans are grabbing for the banner
that Mrs. Whitman dropped. The entire spectacle is a reminder that
many prominent Senate careers have been forged by unknowns who
darted through an unexpected opening.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about Mrs. Whitman's action will probably last until
Election Day. Her stated reasons about unfinished business and
fund-raising seem plausible but incomplete. So while the mystery
may linger, Mrs. Whitman has assured that the history of the 2000
race in New Jersey will be written on an entirely new and
unexpected page.

EDITORIAL: BRADLEY ENTERS THE RACE

   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, September
9:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, who announced officially Wednesday that he is a
candidate for the Democratic nomination, has toyed with the idea of
a presidential campaign before. In 1992 his name appeared on the
long list of Democrats that finally narrowed down to Bill Clinton.
Almost four years later, after resigning from the Senate and
declaring the political system ``broken,'' Bradley briefly flirted
with presidential possibilities again, hinting at a run as an
independent candidate. Now, as a suddenly prominent alternative to
Vice President Al Gore, Bradley's timing is finally right. Since
all the other plausible Democrats were scared away, Bradley will
get more than a fair chance to test Gore's staying power.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the vice president's inevitability card, Bradley is
playing the outsider card. His kickoff was designed to underscore
his theme that he grew up in the kind of small town that Gore only
visited on summer vacation. As for message, the studious former
basketball star seems to be speaking to Americans who are wary of
Washington, weary of Clintonism or still stirred by the belief
system of the old Democratic Party. He spoke Wednesday of directing
national wealth toward child poverty and health care. He labeled
race relations a pressing issue. But most of all he wants Americans
to believe that a life started outside Washington, and his
rejection of Senate life, would make him and Gore ``very different
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for all his early stumbling, still has a solid foundation
of party support that will be difficult to overturn in this
concentrated primary season. Still, the very polls Bradley
dismissed in his announcement speech now show him virtually even
with Gore in the first primary in New Hampshire. That is not a bad
place to start in a state that likes to surprise front-runners. &QL;

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The misnomer that is the European Champions League has
an initial draw unkind to many of the reigning champions. But the
future of the world's richest club tournament rests not on
rewarding teams who prevail at home, but with ensuring that the
biggest and most glamorous sides show up and therefore enhance an
increasingly lucrative revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   Once open only to the winners of Europe's domestic leagues, the
expanded Champions League begins the first phase of group play
Tuesday, features 32 teams, eight more than last year. Two years
ago, the number was 16. Included in the field are the top four
finishers in Germany, the top three in Spain, Italy and England and
the top two in France, Holland, Norway and Portugal. The two
minnows still alive, Maribor Teatanic of Slovenia and Molde of
Norway, had to go through three qualifying rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new format, the top two teams in each of the eight
groups will advance to the second round, starting in November.
</P>
<P>
   UEFA, the European soccer federation, revised the competition in
response to the threat of a breakaway European league spearheaded
by AC Milan owner and broadcasting mogul Silvio Berlusconi. The
Champions League will earn an estimated $750 million, and the pot
of gold for the winner is about $60 million, compared with the $22
million victorious Manchester United took home from Barcelona in
May.
</P>
<P>
   United should be able to handle a Group D field that includes
Olympique Marseille, Croatia Zagreb and Sturm Graz. But the Red
Devils have an English Premier League and international schedule
and have injuries that could sap their depth. Bayern Munich, which
United defeated in the final moments of their thrilling 2-1
European Cup title match, has stumbled out of the gate in Germany
and will have a battle in Group E with Valencia, Glasgow Rangers
and PSV Eindhoven.
</P>
<P>
   AC Milan won Italy's Serie A but opens on the road Wednesday
against Chelsea _ 2:30 p.m., ESPN2 _ in Group H. Barcelona, which
cruised to the Spanish Primera Division crown, got no favors in
Group B with Arsenal and Fiorentina. The latter two square off
Tuesday in the best match of the opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Euro 2000: France, England hang on
</P>
<P>
   Norway, Spain and Sweden on Wednesday clinched berths in next
summer's European championships, but defending World Cup champion
France will need some help in the final round of qualifying next
month to advance. The French defeated Armenia 3-2, with Zinedine
Zidane breaking a 1-1 deadlock in the 67th minute. France is tied
with Russia for second place in Group 4. The Ukraine took a
one-point lead by edging Iceland 1-0, while Russia had a tough time
beating lowly Andorra 2-1. On Oct. 9, France hosts Iceland, while
Russia meets the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   England is on the brink of elimination after finishing its
qualifying slate with a 0-0 draw at Poland. The only way England
can reach the playoffs is if Sweden beats the Poles next month.
</P>
<P>
   The game matched the mood beforehand, as riot police were
dispatched in Warsaw to quell disturbances between rival fans. Nine
people were injured.... Italy blew a chance to win Group 1 as Jon
Dahl Tomasson scored in the 63rd minute to give Denmark a 3-2
victory. Italy, which led 2-0 in the first half, is tied with
Denmark at the top with 14 points apiece as both teams secured at
least playoff spots.
</P>
<P>
   The other photo finish is in Group 8, which Yugoslavia leads
with 16 points after a 4-2 win over Macedonia on Wednesday. Savo
Milosevic scored in the first 10 seconds, one of the quickest goals
in international history, to set the pace. Ireland is a point
behind after edging Malta 3-2, thanks to a late free-kick goal from
Steve Staunton. Croatia has 14 points after beating Ireland 1-0
Saturday on a goal by Davor Suker in the fifth minute of injury
time.

BALLOT-MAIL _ For the first time, more than half of Phoenix voters
in Tuesday's municipal elections cast their ballots without going
to the polls. It was a harbinger of things to come. Scottsdale City
Clerk Sonia Robertson predicted Wednesday that an all-mail election
_ as Oregon has _ could be held in that city as early as 2001.
Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
IMMIG-BRACERO _ Arizona Gov. Jane Hull is hoping to enlist the
support of her Southwestern border counterparts for a new guest
worker program aimed at satisfying the demand for low-skilled labor
in Arizona and helping to combat illegal immigration. Hull wants to
revise and expand the 1940s bracero program, allowing foreign job
seekers to apply for temporary work permits to fill jobs in
industries where there's a shortage of workers. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DEVELOP _ In four months, two Arizona grass-roots groups that
scraped together war chests with collection jars triumphed over
wealthy developers who wanted public backing to help construct a
legacy. Now, with two similar votes set for Nov. 2, developers of a
proposed Phoenix Coyotes hockey complex in Scottsdale and
convention compound in Tucson may have to tone down slick campaigns
and rethink how to convince voters to let them keep a share of
sales tax dollars. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

 &HT;    Davenport outslugs Pierce after rain delay
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Pierce isn't known for her mental perseverance,
but this was not a choke Wednesday. It was the best women's match
of the U.S. Open so far.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, pegged as dangerous but fragile during her erratic
10-year career, served for the match at 5-4 in the third set
against defending women's champion Lindsay Davenport. When Pierce
didn't capitalize on two match points, Davenport escaped to the
semifinals with a 6-2, 3-6, 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``She won this tournament last year, she's No. 2 in the world,
was No. 1, and I had two match points; I have to look at it that
way,'' Pierce said. ``My game is coming along, and I need to work
to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The final three games were classic baseline slugfests. Pierce
struck three winners in each game, but Davenport played the first
24 points without an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who says they don't get nervous is lying,'' Davenport
said. ``You know what to do: Hit the ball hard but don't aim for
the lines and don't go for a winner return. Go for deep and down
the middle. Make first serves.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce missed her first match point at 5-4, 40-30 when Davenport
hit a winner on the 14th stroke of the point. Another match point
got away when Pierce hit a backhand just wide, close enough to
initiate a brief victory leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for that shot, which I really didn't need to do,''
Pierce said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, seeded fifth, then made a pair of backcourt errors that
evened the set at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Then it began to rain, delaying play for one hour. It was
reminiscent of the 1994 French Open, when Pierce, a French citizen,
gave up just 10 games in her six matches to the final, and that
included a 6-2, 6-2 wipeout of Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
   The final against Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario didn't start until
6:22 p.m. and was stopped again after three games. Pierce couldn't
hold a 3-1 lead and lost 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping it wasn't going to rain,'' Pierce said.. ``I just
went back to the locker room and tried to focus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have been home when the rain came,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport opened game 11 with consecutive aces and went up 6-5
after Pierce had brought it back to deuce.
</P>
<P>
   Serving to stay in the match, Pierce twice hit winners to stay
in the match, but Davenport won a game of four deuces when Pierce
double-faulted on match point. Next for Davenport is Serena
Williams, who defeated Monica Seles 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.

FIRST LADY DENIES ROLE IN CLINTON'S CLEMENCY OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAY SHORE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that she
had played no role in any of the decisions that led to President
Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican militants, a move
that has created problems for her campaign for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said she heard of the conditional commutation
only after the president announced it a month ago, and learned from
her campaign press secretary Saturday that the White House on
Friday had given the terrorists a week to meet Clinton's demands.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made her remarks at the first full-fledged news
conference she has held since announcing in June that she was
considering a race for U.S. the Senate. She met with reporters in
the orchestra room of the high school here, in a 32-minute session
that was dominated by questions about Clinton's offer of clemency
to 16 members of the FALN.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of statements by Mrs. Clinton on the clemency issue,
she has come under attack both by Puerto Rican leaders in New York
and groups that opposed the release of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the news conference Mrs. Clinton said she stood by
her statement of last Saturday, when she said that the militants
had been given enough time to meet the conditions set in Clinton's
offer, which required that they renounce violence. At that time,
she called on the White House to rescind the offer immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton, who is known as a quick learner and for her
command of policy, said she was not familiar enough with the
details of the FALN case to offer an opinion on whether her husband
should have offered the clemency in the first place. The FALN, the
initials for the Spanish name of the Armed Forces of National
Liberation, is a terrorist group that advocates independence for
Puerto Rico and that had been linked to 130 bombings in the 1970s
and '80s. None of the 16 offered clemency were convicted of crimes
that resulted in injuries or deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton did not suggest that any steps should now be taken
to revoke the commutations that have been granted to 12 of the
imprisoned FALN members who met Clinton's demands.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she would not share with the public the
details of her conversation with her husband on the matter.
``There's one thing I'm not going to talk about and that's my
private conversations with the president,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the first lady then said that when she sat down with Clinton
at Camp David on Saturday to alert him that her campaign was
putting out a statement, the president made no mention of a letter
the White House had sent the night before setting the one-week
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The juxtaposition of events _ Clinton setting a deadline of
Friday, and Mrs. Clinton saying that the White House should act
immediately _ seemed to undercut Mrs. Clinton's attempts to deal
with the issue. Several of her supporters said that had she known
about the deadline, she probably would not have intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said the first that she learned of the White House
deadline was after she had issued her statement, when a reporter
called her press secretary, Howard Wolfson, to inquire about it,
and Wolfson then called her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are funny ways of finding things out,'' Mrs. Clinton
said. Asked if she believed that her husband knew about the
deadline when she spoke to him that morning, Mrs. Clinton responded
with a slip of a smile: ``I think that that's a fair bet. Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16 who were offered clemency had gained support from a
number of New York's Hispanic leaders, and such figures as former
President Jimmy Carter and Cardinal John O'Connor. In the days
since Mrs. Clinton demanded that the offer be renounced, 12 of the
prisoners, acting under the pressure of deadline set by Clinton,
met his demands for clemency. The first lady demurred when asked if
she thought those commutations should be rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand by what I said on Saturday,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican who is
likely to oppose Mrs. Clinton in next year's Senate race, called
upon the president to withdraw the offer, as survivors of FALN
attacks held news conferences to denounce the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, at City Hall, poked fun at the first lady for what
even Democrats have come to see as a clumsy attempt at separating
herself from her husband. When a reporter started a question by
saying that Mrs. Clinton stands by her statement on the subject,
Giuliani cut him off. ``Stands by her husband?'' the mayor asked
mischievously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this is on the terrorist thing. OK, all right, you know I
get confused. Sometimes it's stand by him, sometimes it's stand
against him. It's getting confusing now.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NOT TOO NICE TO WIN ANOTHER OPEN TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They say that Lindsay Davenport didn't have a mean
bone in her body; she was too nice to be a champion. Davenport was
not nice Wednesday. She cornered Mary Pierce and then snatched
victory by forcing Pierce to beat herself. On the day that Serena
Williams cruised past Monica Seles, this would be the best women's
match so far in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, the defending champion, conceded that her 6-2, 3-6,
7-5 victory was not so much a case of her winning but of Pierce's
losing. For two and a half sets, Pierce and Davenport fought a
tremendous battle.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the first set easily, Davenport suddenly lost her
form; she reverted to being the tall bashful player whose
confidence was like the tide: sometimes high, sometimes low.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had me playing off my back foot,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   She dropped the second set and was playing weakly going into the
third and final set. Davenport trailed, 5-3, and faced double match
point. From somewhere deep inside, Davenport made a great shot,
deep down the middle past a lunging Pierce. Pierce then
double-faulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I knew it was 5-4,'' Davenport said, still
amazed at how the events unfolded. ``Everything moved so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The final puzzle for Davenport: how could she break Pierce? For
long stretches of the match Pierce was serving strongly, not like
the fragile, frightened player who once lost winnable games, but
like a player who had her game and her emotions under control.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Davenport pulled off the tennis equivalent of Ali's
rope-a-dope: she decided to let Pierce break herself. She made a
great shot to save match point. Pierce double-faulted, then missed
wide. Two unforced errors _ a backhand long and a forehand in the
net _ then cost Pierce the game and tied the set at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was contending with a surging Davenport, as well as
nature. It was raining lightly and, with visions of Mary Joe
Fernandez lying on the court two days earlier, Davenport motioned
to the officials. ``It's too wet,'' she said. The umpire agreed and
suspended play.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce fumed, walked off and slammed her racquet on the court as
she sat and crossed her legs. Then she put her head in her hands
like someone who had just been told her house had burned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could tell myself was that I should have been home,''
Davenport said. ``When the rain came, I should have been on my way
to Manhattan packing my clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she sent Pierce packing.
</P>
<P>
   During the delay, Davenport's coach, Robert Van't Hof, reminded
her that she couldn't revert to being the shy, retiring player she
was before winning her first Open. She had to take this match; she
couldn't keep waiting for Pierce to self-destruct. Davenport had to
make Pierce self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he didn't like to see me get dictated to all over
the court, and she was doing that,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of truth, Pierce finally obliged. With the game on
the line and in her hand, she double-faulted on match point.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a sad way to way to end it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the 23-year-old Davenport learned a lesson that the
24-year-old Pierce had not and possibly will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' she said, ``I felt so much better about playing tight
matches than I did two or three years ago. I learned not to try to
hit the ball harder or go for winners when I was down. Just go for
deep shots down the middle. I was enjoying the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, for her part, admitted that she caved in to her own
desire to achieve something that has eluded her for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you want something so badly that you put extra
pressure on yourself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davenport went on about how sweet it was to shed old
labels, to force critics to look at her in a new light, to use the
Open as a launching pad for bigger and better conquests. But
Wednesday she said defending her championship was far more
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about how I handled myself today,'' she said.
``I've had a good time defending my title, whether it ends here
Friday or Saturday. Pulling out a match like this makes this title
even more special.''
</P>
<P>
   They say Lindsay Davenport is too nice to sustain her
championship. Wednesday, thanks to a shower, she proved she was
tough enough. &QL;

EDITORIAL: LENIENCY AND SILENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 9:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's offer of clemency to 16 Puerto Rican
nationalists has been accepted by 12 members of the group. Yet the
furor over Clinton's action will not go away. Republicans are
clamoring in protest, and Hillary Rodham Clinton has broken with
her husband rather than be seen as soft on terrorism. One reason
for the controversy is Clinton's silence. Although normally
loquacious in defending his positions, he has not yet explained why
he wants to shorten the sentences of members of organizations
espousing violence and allegedly involved in at least 130 bombings
during the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, an American president has an absolute power to
pardon. But that does not relieve him of the obligation to defend
any and every decision to intervene in the criminal justice system.
This president's rare use of the pardoning power makes it all the
more important for him to reveal his reasoning. Of more than 3,000
applications for clemency filed since 1993, he has granted only 3.
The suspicion is rampant that his motivation was a political effort
to please the Puerto Rican community that is crucial to Mrs.
Clinton's hopes in the coming Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, the memories of the violence of a generation
ago are still fresh. The Armed Forces of National Liberation _
commonly known by its Spanish initials, FALN _ waged what it felt
was a war of liberation involving reprehensible attacks like the
one on Fraunces Tavern near Wall Street, which killed 4 people and
injured more than 60.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is a basis for clemency in these particular
cases. The 16 were convicted of such crimes as seditious
conspiracy, possession of unregistered firearms and interstate
transportation of a stolen vehicle. However, none of their actions
have been linked to any incidents of violence. The sentences for
these crimes, as long as 90 years in some cases, are out of
proportion to what would be meted out in cases not involving
association with radical groups. A chorus of church leaders,
including Cardinal John O'Connor, along with former President Jimmy
Carter, has joined with Congress members representing Hispanic
communities in asking for clemency for the 16 men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has pointed out that some other FALN members who
asked for clemency were not granted it because of their more direct
association with the bombings. Nevertheless, various federal law
enforcement agencies have opposed leniency. That disclosure led to
demands in Congress for the records on the case, which the White
House is resisting. Clinton should release the records, even as he
shares his views with the public. In response, any inquiry must be
conducted swiftly and in a bipartisan spirit.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the United States must be vigilant against
terrorism all around the world, the administration cannot afford
mixed signals about its tolerance of violence. At the same time,
justice demands that sentences fit the crime as proved in a court
of law. The long sentences in the case of the men in this case
resulted, at least in part, from their declining even to contest
the charges. The cause of justice and mercy may well be served with
shortened terms. But the president needs to address the legitimate
concerns that politics, rather than principle, may have played an
undue role in his thinking. &QL;

 &HT;    Braves slip past Cardinals to complete sweep
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves have brought the Cardinals little but
frustration this season, so why should Wednesday night have been
any different?
</P>
<P>
   Five times this season the Cardinals had suffered losses in the
Braves' final at-bat. Oddly, Wednesday night's Braves win _ 5-4 to
complete a three-game sweep _ was pretty well decided in the sixth
inning when rookie pitcher Rick Ankiel got wild, walked four and
gave up three runs to snap a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   But the frustrating thing was that the Cardinals were finally
scoring on Kevin Millwood _ something they couldn't do in 10
innings on Aug. 28 _ and they got a hit from Mark McGwire, who
ended an 0-for-20 spell with a single in the third. But it was all
ultimately for naught, despite Craig Paquette's two-run homer in
the eighth off Russ Springer that accounted for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel walked Andruw Jones, Jose Hernandez and Brian Hunter to
set up a bases-loaded situation for Tuesday night's hero Howard
Battle, who came through with patience this time, drawing a
run-scoring walk. He was followed by a two-run Gerald Williams
single to all but seal Ankiel's first major-league loss in the
Cardinals' seventh defeat in eight games against the Braves this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves kept their 3 1/2 game lead on the Mets, who beat the
Giants 7-5 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel, the 20-year-old phenom of the striped red-and-white
socks and nasty repertoire, was making his fourth big-league start.
His first three lessons were mainly in futility as he left with a
lead or a tie each time and came away without a decision in three
Cardinals losses.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones, who added to Ankiel's woes with a 12th-inning
home run in a 4-3 win over the Cardinals Aug. 29, hurt him a little
more directly this time with his 39th home run of the season to
start the Braves' scoring in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Jones his 12th homer from the right side in 124 at
bats this season. He'd had 12 in 678 career at-bats from the right
before this season.
</P>
<P>
   So Millwood wasn't the near-perfect pitcher he's been lately,
and had his major-league-leading .202 opponents batting average
take a bit of a hit. But that still left him room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood gave up seven hits in six innings _ the same number
he'd allowed in his previous two starts _ but allowed only two
runs, which he has done in each of his last six starts.

9-9-99: A LUCKY DAY, OR ONE TO DREAD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thursday could be your lucky day. It's the ninth day
of the ninth month of the ninety-ninth year; the ninth inning of a
star-crossed century and, for many astrologers, an auspicious day
for new beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   A day to play the lottery? Nein. The numbers 9-9-99 sold out
just hours after they went on sale last Thursday, according to the
New York State Lottery. (Hey, there are nines still available in
New Jersey.)
</P>
<P>
   But before you pour your savings into the Dow, soothsayers with
one eye on the devil warn that Thursday might be better spent in a
well-stocked bunker. Note what happens to those nines when they are
turned upside down and you'll understand the apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Software savants call the date ``the dreaded nines,'' a Y2K-like
event that could gum up some operations, especially programs
created before the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're a woman at the end of your third trimester or a
cat on its ninth life, you probably have little affinity for the
number nine. The ancient Greeks had 9 muses, there are 99 names for
God in Islam and many real estate leases run for 99 years, but all
in all, the number cannot be pigeonholed.
</P>
<P>
   It's no lucky eight, nowhere near as sinful as seven and far
from a perfect 10, yet it is hard to find consensus on whether nine
is a figure to be cherished or banished.
</P>
<P>
   For the Japanese, nine is something of a headache. Because it's
pronounced like the word for pain, it is a number you won't find
anywhere in Japanese hospitals. But to confuse matters more, a
string of nines is a good thing, and on Thursday, a group of 99
Japanese tourists are celebrating the day by arriving here on a
package tour that costs 99,999 yen, about $909.
</P>
<P>
   To the Chinese, nine is the ultimate number, a masculine figure
and metaphor for the emperor. It is also triple the number three,
which is the No. 1 number in Chinese culture. Traditional
architecture frequently includes a parade of nine columns, nine
courtyards and nine bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zuchowski, a Wiccan priest who practices numerology at
Enchantments, a purveyor of pagan goods on, yes, Ninth Street in
Manhattan, explains that every number has negative and positive
aspects. In general, though, nine tends toward altruism, unlike
one, which can be egotistical and unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a good day to go forward, to start something
new,'' he said. But even if your stars are well aligned on
Thursday, he had this advice for anyone with an urge for wanton
investing: ``Consult a good broker.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathematicians don't get very excited about nine. Sure, it is
the final single digit, and who can forget its starring role in
``casting out nines,'' that trick for checking multiplication. But
Anthony V. Phillips, chairman of the mathematics department at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook, struggled to find some
greater meaning. ``I guess there is something cute about nine,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Jacob Hill, the third-generation owner of Nine
Ninety Nine Kosher Provisions on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Hill
was born on May 9, and the birth dates of his three children all
end in nine. ``I guess we have a thing for nine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It started with Hill's grandfather, Elja, who in the 1930s asked
the Department of Agriculture if he could be the nation's 999th
licensed meat processor. ``In those days, the USDA was very nice
and they cooperated with him,'' Hill said. ``He could have been the
1,000th, but for some reason he wanted 999.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Moses Tendler, a professor of Talmudic law at Yeshiva
University, explains that although omens and portents have no place
in Jewish theology, many Jews subscribe to gematria, a
numerological tradition that assigns a number to every letter of
the Hebrew alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the ninth letter, tet, is the first letter for
the word tov, or good. Many religious Jews consider 18 the finest
of all numbers, and charitable donations are often given in sums of
18, which is the numerical equivalent of chai, or life. Not to
mention nine plus nine.
</P>

   ``Of course, Jews are not permitted to involve themselves in
such nonsense,'' he said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the world, the sequence of numbers is purely
arbitrary. Hamid Dabashi, a professor of Iranian studies at
Columbia University, pointed out that most of the Asian and Islamic
worlds do not use the Gregorian calendar. ``There are 20 different
kinds of calendars being used today in the world,'' he said. ``So
for them, this hoopla over nines is another form of cultural
imperialism.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Still, some people can't help themselves. Leo Icarangal and
Catherine Banting are getting married this afternoon in Queens.
``We got a lot of grief from people because it's a Thursday, but I
think everyone is enjoying the theme of nine,'' said Icarangal, 29,
a computer specialist.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the gimmick, he said, a silver nine will be stuck
beneath a chair at every table. ``You know how at weddings, whoever
has the most chutzpah takes home the flower arrangement?'' he
asked. ``Well, at our wedding, the person sitting on the nine gets
the centerpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lest the optimists rule the day, some astrologers say that Satan
may use the day's batch of upturned sixes to make trouble. Tom
Chase, a New Age writer and theorist, said today could be a tease
of more seriously apocalyptic events forecast for early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have some small power glitches, some Chernobyls
going off in Russia, but it shouldn't be too bad,'' said Chase, who
stockpiled flashlights, food and water just in case.
</P>
<P>
   But other evidence suggests that the number nine is largely
benign. A well-tailored person dresses to the nines, cloud nine is
evidently a good place to be, and a stitch in time saves nine. So
at the risk of provoking Satan's ire (and the reader's patience),
it seems appropriate to end this treatise at word 999.

SHAREHOLDERS QUESTION BLOCK'S PLANNED PURCHASE OF OLDE FINANCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Shareholders' questions about H&AMP;R Block
Inc.'s planned takeover of the nation's fourth-largest discount
brokerage chain dominated the Kansas City firm's annual meeting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for Block shares fell 18 percent in two days last week on
the New York Stock Exchange after the Kansas City firm announced
plans to buy Olde Financial Corp. for $850 million.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Bloch, Block's chairman and co-founder, and Frank L.
Salizzoni, the company's chief executive, described the acquisition
as key to Block's plans to provide a wider range of year-round
financial services to middle America.
</P>
<P>
   Block's traditional tax preparation services, which last year
handled a record 18 percent of the federal and state income tax
returns Americans filed, fills only part of what Bloch described as
a large void in service to millions of mainstream Americans and
small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a company and as shareholders, I believe we can take a
measure of pride in our increasing ability to serve as a trusted
adviser _ to help families build equity in their homes, save for
their children's education and create a more secure retirement,''
Bloch said.
</P>
<P>
   Salizzoni told shareholders that acquiring privately held Olde
Financial would significantly accelerate Block's efforts to expand
its network and offer a wider range of financial products and
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``And more importantly to our shareholders, we expect the Olde
acquisition to contribute to earnings immediately,'' Salizzoni
said.
</P>
<P>
   One major shareholder, Howard Berghoef of Harris &AMP; Associates LP
in Chicago, seemed unconvinced, however. Harris is a mutual fund
company that owns about 9 percent of Block's shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market took $1 billion off your capitalization two days
after you spent $850 million,'' said Berghoef, referring to the
steep drop in the aggregate value of Block shares last week.
</P>
<P>
   Berghoef said he thought Block could use the money it is
spending on Olde Financial more constructively by buying back Block
shares to increase their value.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a terrific company, probably worth close to 75
(dollars a share), not 46 (where it currently is trading),''
Berghoef told Salizzoni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why spend $850 million for a brokerage company you know very
little about?'' Berghoef said.
</P>
<P>
   Salizzoni said Block's shares had hit similar air pockets before
and recovered _ most noticeably when troubles at the company's
former CompuServe Corp. subsidiary cut Block prices by almost half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is in place,'' Salizzoni said. ``We believe it
will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Block closed Wednesday at 45 15//16, down 7//16.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Block also announced the appointment of Mark A.
Ernst as president, succeeding Salizzoni.
</P>
<P>
   Salizzoni, who originally planned to serve temporarily as
Block's president when he took the job in 1996, will remain as
chief executive. However, Ernst, 41, now appears to be Salizzoni's
most logical successor to that job. Salizzoni is a retired airline
president and longtime Block director.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders also overwhelmingly approved two proposals to
increase the number of Block shares that can be used as performance
incentives for seasonal employees and for company executives.

INJURED FARMER EXPECTS TO SEE LIMITED PLAYING TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Injured receiver Danny Farmer has made significant
progress this week and is expected to play Saturday at Ohio State.
How much _ and how well _ remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game and my ankle's ready,'' said Farmer, who
sprained his left ankle during a scrimmage Aug. 21. ``I've been
listening to it and I've been careful.''
</P>
<P>
   A preseason All-American, Farmer suffered a high sprain (above
the ankle bone), which takes longer to heal than conventional low
sprains. He spent one week on crutches and another wearing a
protective boot.
</P>
<P>
   Although it might have seemed excessive _ after all, he walked
off the field immediately after the injury _ he now believes the
crutches and boot were essential to his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Officially he's listed as probable, and if a setback occurs
today or Friday, he won't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trainers did a great job,'' he said. ``Now, I could go in
and not be able to play. Or I could go in and feel 100 percent.
We'll have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaches will avoid using Farmer for pass patterns that put
unnecessary strain on his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try to script some things that he can run and feel good
about,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``He won't play the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Redshirt update: Six freshmen played against Boise State:
tight end Mike Seidman, offensive tackle Bryce Bohlander,
cornerback Ricky Manning, linebackers Asi Faoa and Marcus Reese and
punter/kicker Nathan Fikse.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves just 10 freshmen with a chance to redshirt. The
other members of UCLA's 18-man recruiting class are quarterback
J.P. Losman, who transferred, and cornerback DeShaun McCullough,
who has not enrolled for academic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Toledo also hopes to redshirt sophomore receiver Jon
Dubravac, who did not play against Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Signs of life: After a lackluster training camp, the 11
suspended players are practicing with increased enthusiasm as their
return to action approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been much more intense, maybe because I told them I
wasn't real happy with how they were working,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee the suspended players will start upon their
return next week. If the replacements play well at Ohio State,
Toledo said, they'll have a chance to start against Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Holding on: Four players from last year's team are on NFL
rosters: quarterback Cade McNown (Chicago), safety Larry Atkins
(Kansas City), offensive lineman Kris Farris (Pittsburgh, injured
reserve) and tight end Ryan Neufeld (Dallas, practice squad).
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sailer (San Francisco), Craig Walendy (San Francisco),
Mike Grieb (San Francisco), Brendon Ayanbadejo (Atlanta) and Andy
Meyers (Buffalo) have been cut.
</P>
<P>
   __ Parking scandal update: UCLA's police department concluded
its investigation into the disabled-parking scandal and forwarded
the information to city attorney Brian Williams on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we're evaluating the cases and no charges have
been filed,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams declined to name the players involved. However, the
UCLA police were known to be investigating current players Keith
Brown and Eric Whitfield, along with former players McNown, Atkins
and Skip Hicks. McNown has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   __ Brothers Bruin: The Bruins are recruiting three players'
younger brothers. Cornerback Lovell Houston's brother, Marcus, is
one of the top tailbacks in the nation. Defensive tackle Ken
Kocher's brother, Matt, is a 275-pound run stopper. And quarterback
Cory Paus' brother, Casey, is a 6-4, strong-armed passer entering
his junior year.

LENON HOYTE, 94, WHO OFFERED HER LOVE OF DOLLS TO THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lenon Hoyte, better known as Aunt Len, who shared her
dream of a doll museum with Harlem children and collectors from
around the world for two decades, died Aug. 1 at a hospital in New
York. She was 94.
</P>
<P>
   A public school art teacher, she founded Aunt Len's Doll and Toy
Museum, one of the most extensive private collections of dolls and
related toys in the United States, and long one of New York City's
choice specialty museums. She closed the museum in the early 1990s
when she was no longer able to care for it.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Hoyte, the dolls were her ``babies,'' to be loved and
shown off, whether they were the rarest antiques or battered
castoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, Ms. Hoyte and her husband bought the three-story
brownstone at 6 Hamilton Terrace between Convent and St. Nicholas
Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   At one time the house was home to 6,000 dolls.
</P>
<P>
   There were a dozen versions of Shirley Temple; there was Barbie,
and Betsy Wetsy, presidents and their wives, and refined French
dolls with bodies and faces made of bisque, the unglazed ceramic
ware used to make fine dolls in the 19th century and before.
</P>
<P>
   And always, her collection included black dolls, which are now
highly sought by collectors, because so few were made before the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   One rarity, described in the sale catalog as ``a black Bru
pressed-bisque-head bebe doll,'' was valued at $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   There were a pair of papier-mache dolls, named Lillian and Leo,
made by Leo Moss, a black handyman who lived in Atlanta in the 19th
century. Both Lillian and Leo have tears running down their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   The story has it that after the dollmaker parted from his wife
and children he became so sad that he made only crying dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The collection also included accessories like doll houses, doll
clothing and costumes, tin toys and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors had to squeeze their way sideways or hunch down as they
progressed through the narrow passageways of the public spaces on
the ground floor and in the basement of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The museum had a modest entrance fee, never exceeding $2 for
adults and 50 cents for children.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors would encounter all manner of mannequins, ranging from
thumb-size to two or three feet tall. Not all of the collectibles
were old. One of Ms. Hoyte's favorites _ a baby doll with wide eyes
and long eyelashes _ was carved in mahogany in 1977 by a California
artist, Patty Hale.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ed Koch presented Ms. Hoyte with the Mayoral Award of
Honor for Art and Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Her genteel house and museum was broken into by thieves in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine dolls, including a two-foot-tall English king,
considered priceless by knowledgeable collectors, were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoyte was disconsolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People any more don't let you live,'' she said then. ``You
struggle to keep something up for joy and beauty, and you find
yourself having to watch for thieves. It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon after, four of the stolen dolls _ including those
representing George and Martha Washington, Abraham Lincoln and
Benjamin Franklin _ turned up, disjointed but repairable, in Ms.
Hoyte's front room. ``I don't ask questions about how,'' she said.
``I'm just happy to have them back.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 700 of the finest antique dolls were auctioned at
Sotheby's. Thousands more had been sold previously to dealers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lenon Holder Hoyte was born in New York City on July 4, 1905,
the first of five children of Moses and Rose Holder. She attended
public school in New York City and studied art at the College of
the City of New York, Columbia University and with private
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   She taught art at Junior High School 149 in the Bronx and
retired after 41 years. ``When they started killing teachers, I got
out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her passion for collecting dolls dated to 1962, when she was
asked to organize a doll show to raise money for Harlem Hospital.
After that, she began acquiring dolls from flea markets, garage
sales and antiques shops that she visited throughout the United
States, Europe and the Caribbean. Her collection was officially
opened as a museum in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoyte continued to produce doll shows, and donated the
proceeds to St. Philips Episcopal Church, where she had been a
lifelong member.
</P>
<P>
   She spent many of her retirement years traveling to doll shows
and picking up dolls and doll accouterments for her collection.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoyte's husband, Lewis Hoyte, died about 30 years ago. She
is survived by her brother, Dr. Oliver Holder, of Sag Harbor, two
nieces and three nephews.

KRAJICEK'S BIG SERVE NOT ENOUGH AGAINST KAFELNIKOV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ Richard Krajicek, a darkhorse as the
No. 12 seed, showed why he was included on Yevgeny Kafelnikov's
short list of men who could win the U.S. Open. He unleashed 48 aces
in his quarterfinals match Wednesday night, a record for a tennis
tournament of any time.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek, however, did not win. He was beaten by another man on
Kafelnikov's list. Namely, Kafelnikov himself.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3 seed survived the barrage of aces to prevail, 7-6
(7-0), 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the best matches I've played in my career,''
Kafelnikov said. ``And one of those days I was fortunate enough to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov moved into the semifinals against the winner of the
late match between Andre Agassi _ the third man on the list _ and
Nicolas Escude, and kept alive his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do it because I want to be No. 1 at the end of the
year,'' Kafelnikov said. ``It's a simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   With top-ranked Pete Sampras out for the tournament and
sidelined at least a month because of a back injury, winning the
Open would make it happen. It can only happen, though, because he
repelled Krajicek's charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing good tennis,'' Krajicek said. ``I was serving
big.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he was. The 48 aces were a record for a Grand Slam or ATP
Tour-level event, two more than the previous mark set by Goran
Ivanisevic against Magnus Norman in the second round at Wimbledon
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Ivanisevic lost that match, and so did Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was Kafelnikov's play in the tiebreakers. He
dominated the first one, winning all seven points, and controlled
the second one to take a commanding lead.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek rallied, though, breaking Kafelnikov twice in the third
and fourth set while holding his without much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to feel a little bit tired,'' Kafelnikov said.
``That's why the next two sets went pretty easy. When I was fresh I
was able to read his serve perfectly. Then he started to play
unbelievably. He was serving 130 miles per hour, 135 after 21/2
hours of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   As the match headed for the fifth set Kafelnikov knew he had
just one chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like there wasn't going to be many opportunities to
break Richard's serve,'' he said. ``I was hoping I could hold on
until the tiebreaker and take my chances there.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players held serve six times to force the tiebreaker. Once
there, Krajicek's potent serves let him down. He missed a couple of
first serves and Kafelnikov, whose service return rivals Agassi's
for the best in the game, hit a couple of returns for winners.
</P>
<P>
   He took a 6-2 lead then, after Krajicek saved three match
points, ironically won it with an ace, his 10th of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek had the record, but Kafelnikov moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather hit as many as he hit and be in the semis,''
Krajicek said.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov is glad to be there, and hoping to play Agassi, the
other man with a chance to finish the year No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are going to go crazy,'' Kafelnikov said. ``Having
the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds in the semifinal, it's going to be
wonderful because the match is going to be important for both of
us.''

   NETHERLANDS: KEY JUDGE QUITS WAR PANEL
</P>
<P>
   One of the most senior judges of the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, Antonio Cassese, will resign in February, the third key
figure to quit the United Nations court in recent months. Cassese,
an Italian, who has served on the court since its creation in 1993,
said he would go back to being a law professor at Florence
University, nearly two years before the end of his term. Gabrielle
Kirk McDonald, the tribunal president, will leave in November and

   TURKEY: QUAKE DEATH TOLL
</P>
<P>
   The death toll in last month's earthquake has reached 15,303,

   GERMANY: SPOOFING SCHREODER
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has appeared on German television
as a kinky hermaphrodite complete with pierced breasts, a dog
collar and a loony grin _ and he is not pleased. The Munich-based
RTL-2 network faces possible legal action from Schroeder after
airing an ``interview'' with a leather-clad Schroeder lookalike
puppet on an erotic show called ``Peep.'' Schroeder said the show,
about his sexual preferences, was ``worse than overstepping the
boundaries of taste.''
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: HISTORIC PROTEST
</P>
<P>
   Parliament held its first session in the renovated Reichstag in
Berlin, and weathered its first protest. Doctors built a wall of
ice 20 feet long by 10 feet high outside the building to protest
government health care changes, which they say could usher in a new
ice age for the health service, threatening 19,000 jobs this year.
</P>
<P>
   SWITZERLAND: IMAGE MAKEOVER
</P>
<P>
   The government wants to make a major effort to improve
Switzerland's image abroad, especially in the United States. The
Foreign Ministry is asking lawmakers to approve a $31 million
program to promote the country's humanitarian work, its cultural
diversity and democratic traditions. ``Switzerland's image abroad
has suffered quite a bit recently,'' said Foreign Minister Joseph
Deiss.
</P>
<P>
   SWITZERLAND: MILOSEVIC MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Two months after Switzerland agreed to freeze any assets
belonging to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the government
said no firm evidence of any Swiss bank accounts had turned up.
Acting on a request from the International War Crimes Tribunal in
The Hague, Swiss authorities had promised to block bank accounts or
other assets belonging to Milosevic, four Serbian leaders indicted
for war crimes and 300 other senior Yugoslav officials.

   SPAIN: PINOCHET INVITED TO COURT
</P>
<P>
   Judge Baltasar Garzon, who is seeking the extradition from
Britain of Gen. Augusto Pinochet to answer charges of human rights
abuses, has given the former Chilean dictator until Sept. 27 to
voluntarily appear in Madrid court. The move comes in response to a
motion by Pinochet, who is under house arrest outside London, to
defend himself in Spain _ and gain access to court papers _ while
fighting extradition in Britain, where the next hearing is set for
Sept. 27.

<P>
   The government said it is considering moving Gen. Lino Oviedo,
the former Parguayan army chief who fled his country and lives
outside Buenos Aires as a political exile, to a ranch on an

<P>
   Canadian Mounted Police divers started searching a high-altitude
British Columbia lake where Michel Trudeau, a son of former
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, drowned Nov. 23. The
23-year-old was traversing a steep snow slope on skis when an
avalanche swept him and a friend into the waters of Lake Kokanee.
The friend managed to get out, but Michel was last seen struggling
in the water. Two days after he disappeared, ice sealed the lake.
The ice melted only two weeks ago.

NO EASY WAY TO DEAL WITH OFFICE JERKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Whenever, wherever workplace training sessions are
held, one of the biggest draws is a seminar called ``How to Deal
with Difficult People.''
</P>
<P>
   Front-line workers and top management alike crowd the room,
desperate for quick fixes to their daily vexes. Most leave
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't with the trainer. And there usually is nothing
wrong with the audio or visuals. The problem is the message, which
always is the same:
</P>
<P>
   (ital)You can't change the other person. You can only change
your response to that person.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Dandy. Just dandy.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost see the little thought balloons wafting above
participants' heads. Wait a minute here. (ital)I'm(end ital) not
the problem. (ital)He's(end ital) the complainer. (ital)She's(end
ital) the conniver. I need to know how to deal with (ital)them(end
ital).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the attendees dare to say as much out loud. They argue
that it's in their co-worker's self-centered, obnoxious nature to
argue; if they could just get the arguer to stop arguing, work
would be Eden.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the trainers, nodding sympathetically at the speaker,
try to stuff their own thought balloons back in their heads before
everyone can read them. (ital)Look in the mirror, buddy(end ital),
you just know they're thinking.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's harsh. Credit is due the workers who go to these
seminars. At least they're looking for cures while the boors and
bemoaners are ulcerating the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there is no finger-snap solution to interpersonal
relationship or communication problems. There's only conflict
management and self-control.
</P>
<P>
   When somebody at work acts like a jerk, instinct says we'll
react in one of three ways: We'll lash back, give in or flee. If
any of these instincts is acted out without thinking it through
first, the consequence is escalation of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, everyone grows up emotionally, too. But the
work world is populated with folk who lug all kinds of familial and
psychological baggage. In the vernacular, (ital)I don't know where
you're coming from, man.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The best, if not the only, way to deal with co-workers who seem
difficult is to act like a VCR: Pause, rewind, replay.
</P>
<P>
   The trainers' advice: State _ calmly _ what you think the
``difficult person'' said or did. Ask if your perception was his or
her intent. Don't yell, swear, argue, belittle or say, ``Yes,
but...''
</P>
<P>
   Ask for his or her suggestions or solutions. In the words of one
trainer, ``flatter their emotional child.''
</P>
<P>
   First, though, we have to manage our own childlike reactions. We
have to control the (ital)Oh, yeah?(end ital) and the
(ital)nyah-nyah(end ital) responses.
</P>
<P>
   We have to slow down, listen and ask questions. Sometimes,
trainers say, it requires playing dumb like a fox: ``I'm not sure I
understand what's bothering you,'' or ``Did you mean to insult
me?''
</P>
<P>
   And _ this is the hardest of all _ we need to avoid assuming we
know it all and they don't know grits from granola. We can't assume
we're interpreting them correctly. It's a good bet their emotional
child has taken over, and everyone needs a time out before mature
discussion can occur.

DAVENPORT OVERCOMES PIERCE, FACES SERENA WILLIAMS IN SEMIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ The difference between Lindsay
Davenport and Mary Pierce is inches and miles: inches in physical
talent, and miles in temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce almost pulled off one of the biggest surprises of the
U.S. Open on Wednesday, missing a line by inches on match point
against the defending champion and second seed. Instead, Davenport
moved on when Pierce double-faulted with a second serve that was a
long.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport prevailed, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5, at Arthur Ashe Stadium to
move into the semifinals, where she will meet Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams advanced to the final four of a Grand Slam event for
the first time in her career with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 winner over
Monica Seles, and kept alive father Richard Williams' prediction of
a final between Serena and sister Venus, who plays Martina Hingis
in the other semifinal Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always a goal, and it's really coming true,'' Serena
Williams said. ``I'm very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams looked like she might be in trouble after losing the
first set but cruised in the final two in stark contrast to
Davenport, who won the first set and then struggled late.
</P>
<P>
   ``To pull it out like this is really exciting,'' Davenport said.
``I'm getting closer to defending. A little stumble today, but I
got through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport didn't stumble at all in her first four matches,
dropping just 10 games. Match No. 5 looked like it would be just as
routine when she broke Pierce twice to win the first set in 28
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then Pierce began playing some of the best tennis of her career,
smacking winners and forcing Davenport into mistakes. Pierce won
the second set, then broke in the seventh game of the third set to
close in on the upset.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce always has had the talent to beat the best players in the
world. Her serves are hard to handle and her groundstrokes are as
powerful as anyone's on tour.
</P>
<P>
   That talent translated to a 1995 Australian Open championship,
and runner-up finishes at the 1994 French and '97 Australian Opens.
It's also made her a fixture in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't, however, translated to much success against the best
players in the world. Before Wednesday she was a combined 8-22
against Hingis, Davenport, Venus Williams and Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the talent came a reputation for tightening up in big
games, on big points.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce came within inches of shedding that reputation when, on
match point, she ripped a cross-court backhand.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce thought it was on the line, and raised a fist in triumph.
The linesperson thought otherwise, and called it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' Pierce said. ``But it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't because Pierce hit it too hard and too close to the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little bit nervous and a little tight,'' she said. ``I
went for that shot, which I really didn't need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport went on to break when Pierce plunked a forehand into
the net, and then play was suspended because of a light rain.
Pierce had a little more than an hour to think about what might
have been.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport held when play resumed, and broke to win the match
when Pierce hit that second serve well over the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in that position before,'' Pierce said. ``You just
sometimes want it so bad, you put a little bit extra pressure on
yourself instead of just playing the points like any other point.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport also admitted to being nervous, but she's learned to
deal with it. That's why she won the Open last year and Wimbledon
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so much better about playing tight matches now than I
did two or three years ago,'' Davenport said. ``You hit the ball
hard, but don't aim for the lines. You don't go for a winner
return, but go deep and down the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   She did that against Pierce, and moved into the semifinals.
Pierce missed by inches, and remains miles away. nn

MENARD METHODICALLY EXPANDING EMPIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Menard doesn't go to the races brandishing a
spit-and-polish nickname, like Roger Penske's ``The Captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Menard doesn't cart around 67 Indy-car victories, like legendary
Texan A.J. Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike fellow race car-owners Paul Newman and David Letterman,
Menard is neither an actor nor a comedian.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to contend for an oval-track Indy-car
championship _ not to mention replace a leaky shower head or
rebuild a deck _ John Menard probably is your best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Menard unquestionably is the lowest profile high-roller in
Indy-car racing, only because that's how he wants it. Pep Boys Indy
Racing League points-leader Greg Ray knew that much about Menard
last summer, when the Texan and crew chief/engineer Thomas Knapp
launched a campaign that eventually saw them replace Tony Stewart
and Larry Curry at Team Menard.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the IRL's original poster boy, and sidekick Curry
helped deliver the 1996-97 IRL driver and entrant championships to
Menard, a self-made millionaire, courtesy of a chain of lumber/home
improvement stores based in Eau Claire, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep expanding all the time,'' said Menard, whose business
empire consists of 144 stores in a nine-state area of the upper
Midwest. ``We're on a very methodical expansion plan. We'll
probably expand like a paint spill. We have to be very cautious in
our expansion, but we'll probably be national one day.''
</P>
<P>
   While the employees at Menard's continue to fight the battle on
the home front, his latest IRL team is closing in on a second
championship. Ray, of Plano, has won three of the past four races
to forge a 44-point lead over Scott Goodyear with events at Las
Vegas Motor Speedway and Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth
remaining. Ray's most recent victory, in the Colorado 200 at Pikes
Peak International Raceway on Aug. 29, was a league-record seventh
for Team Menard.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we're leading the championship and won three of the
last four races, it's almost like you're talking about somebody
else,'' said Ray, who began his stint at Team Menard inauspiciously
with three consecutive 21st-place finishes. ``John has put together
a great team. Team Menard has a great heritage. A lot of people
questioned just how competitive and `together' we would be early
on. I already had high expectations as a driver. To have such a
strong team around me has made things really pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Knapp, of course, spent 1997 and 1998 as a single-car
team that ran as long and hard as its cubic dollars allowed. Elite
Team Menard stood at the opposite end of the IRL spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a place I wanted to be from Day One,'' said Ray, a
perfectionist who began talking with fellow-perfectionist Menard
after the 1998 Indianapolis 500. They eventually entered into a
``long-term'' contract last fall. While the 1999 IRL championship
remains the immediate target, Menard acknowledged there are other
opportunities to explore. The rival Championship Auto Racing Teams
FedEx Series and even NASCAR Winston Cup might be future good fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm partners in a CART team, and I wish that team was doing as
well as my IRL team,'' Menard said of his venture with driver Robby
Gordon. Menard also has announced plans to enter the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series with driver Bryan Refner next year, as a
prelude to running Winston Cup. Perhaps with Ray behind the wheel?
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg and I want to be competitive in anything we do,'' Menard
said. ``The thought of us going down to a Winston Cup race and not
doing well isn't very appealing to me and Greg. We're going to have
to weigh everything we do very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this will be a methodical expansion. Like a
paint spill.
SPOTLIGHT ON... Goodyear's IRL teams seek blistering cure The short
history of the Pep Boys Indy Racing League at Texas Motor Speedway
has been notable for blistering speeds and, sometimes, blistering
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers with the Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. are attempting to
correct the latter problem for its clients before the season-ending
Lone Star 500 on Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Blistering conditions during the IRL events here last September
and in June prompted another round of tire tests at the 1.5-mile
quad-oval yesterday and today. Scott Goodyear won the Longhorn 500
night race in Fort Worth on June 12, but a number of championship
contenders were unable to run flat-out.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt Racing teammates Kenny Brack and Billy Boat were
forced to pit less than 20 laps into the June race because of
blistering right rear tires. The same fate also sidetracked Scott
Sharp and pole-sitter Mark Dismore of Kelley Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last race here, we had a good tire, but I think it was too
soft,'' said Boat, winner of the IRL night event here in June 1998.
``They've \RGoodyear\S brought us a tougher compound. What we're
trying to do is two things _ first, make sure that it's durable,
and we've gone a little conservative so we don't have any problems
with the tire. And then we'll start to work back and try to regain
some grip and build speed back into the tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary objective is to make sure we have a tire we're not
going to have any problems with.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said his strategy was rendered useless by the blistering
he encountered in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't race,'' Sharp said. ``We were conservatively
leading the race, running 213s and 212s, came in for a pit stop 26
or 27 laps into the race and realized the car had blistered tires.
We went back out on a new set of tires and blistered them in about
15 laps. At that point, we ran a conservative pace, 205 or 206 the
rest of the race, because we didn't want to take any chances of
putting it into the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack, who won the 1998 IRL championship on Goodyear Racing
Eagles, noted that the tire manufacturer has made a ``positive
gain'' during the past two races at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``September last year, the tires blew up on us,'' Brack said,
``and now they're only blistered. So, they're going in the right
direction. But for sure, we cannot afford to have a race like that
again here.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS New car blues NASCAR Winston Cup team-owner Felix
Sabates recently told ``National Speed Sport News'' that a
wind-tunnel test of the 2000 model Chevrolet Monte Carlo indicated
it was a piece of junk. Or words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, crew chief Ryan Pemberton said the new Ford Taurus 2k
is ``a truly good car,'' but not without its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem we have with it is it has a little more
drag than we need,'' said Pemberton, crew chief for the No. 2
Miller Lite Fords driven by Rusty Wallace. ``On speedways like
Daytona and Talladega, that's the biggest problem we've got.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford is a little bit behind on the introduction of the car _
probably two months behind for sure. We'll start working on it hot
and heavy when we get pieces and parts from NASCAR.'' Montoya the
`rainmeister' Rookie Juan Montoya bagged a maximum of 22 points at
rainy Vancouver, B.C., last weekend to widen his lead in the
Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series. Montoya, driver of the
No. 4 Target Honda-Reynard, will carry a 23-point advantage over
Dario Franchitti into Round 17 at beautiful and challenging Laguna
Seca (Calif.) Raceway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya's three victories from the pole are the most since Alex
Zanardi _ the driver he replaced at Target Chip Ganassi Racing _
also won three times from the pole in his rookie season in 1996. A
memorable move As reported last week, the NHRA has moved the
Castrol Nationals at the Texas Motorplex in Ennis to Memorial Day
weekend (May 25-28) beginning next season.
</P>
<P>
   Motorplex owner Billy Meyer wants to make the move permanent,
and allow the NHRA to showcase its product on the already busy
weekend featuring the Indy Racing League's Indianapolis 500 and
NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600.
</P>
<P>
   The NHRA's 2000 schedule will grow from 22 to 23 national events
with the inaugural Las Vegas Nationals at Bruton Smith's Las Vegas
Motor Speedway. Both the Motorplex and Houston Raceway Park in
Baytown again will play host to two events for the fourth
consecutive year. But there will be a three-race gap between the
O'Reilly Nationals at HRP on April 13-16 and the repositioned
Castrol Nationals at Ennis in May. Last laps NASCAR Winston Cup
points-leader Dale Jarrett will carry a 168-point lead over Mark
Martin into Richmond, Va., on Saturday night _ a loss of 146 points
during the past two races.
</P>
<P>
   Indy 500 veteran Willy T. Ribbs was among several IRL drivers
testing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway last week. Ribbs, the only
African-American to qualify for the Indy 500, drove 20 laps for PDM
Racing but did not attempt to begin his IRL rookie test.
</P>
<P>
   Former NHRA Top Fuel champion Kenny Bernstein failed to qualify
for the most prestigious race of the season, the U.S. Nationals, at
Indianapolis Raceway Park last weekend. It was the first DNQ for
Bernstein's Budweiser King Dragster since February 1998 at Firebird
International Raceway in Phoenix. And it marked the first time
Bernstein did not compete in the U.S. Nationals since 1980.
\Nsubheds:Bliss job hunting Mike Bliss, a veteran in the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series, is a candidate for the No. 30 Jimmy Dean
Pontiac Grand Prix formerly driven by Derrike Cope.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss has discussed the job with crew chief and friend Barry
Dodson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say a whole lot,'' said Bliss, driver of the No. 99
Exide Batteries Ford fielded by Jack Roush. ``I don't know exactly
what I'm doing next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss scored his first victory of the season, and seventh of his
five-year truck series career, on the road course at Heartland Park
Topeka, Kan., on Aug. 28. Last words ``There are times I get sick
of being politically correct. I got into Winston Cup because I
wanted to be a race car driver. If I wanted to be a politician, I
would be in Washington.'' _ Tony Stewart, NASCAR Winston Cup rookie
star

HEARING-IMPAIRED LINEMAN'S MESSAGE COMES THROUGH LOUD AND CLEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ The ominous nightmare of the man holding a gun
in his face came often to the young boy in those days. Sometimes
reality was even more terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' urged Eric Thunander, now a freshman
linebacker at Oklahoma who has already worked his way onto the
two-deep chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're 7 years old and your second father gets mad at you
because you didn't hear him _ because I don't hear a lot of things
all the time _ and he tries to get your attention by sticking a gun
into your face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always thinking, `What happens if that gun goes off?' I
wouldn't be here if it had. So I live every day to its fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   Life may yet throw curves at Eric Thunander. But the guess is
that he will meet them straight on. Obstacles are nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Thunander emerged on the other side of the physical and
emotional abuse inflicted by two of his mother's three husbands to
become an outstanding athlete and a member of his high school's
National Honor Society. He also has overcome a congenital birth
defect that left him with less than 17 percent hearing _ in his
good ear _ to become a counselor and role model for other
hearing-impaired and emotionally disturbed youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see kids who come from normal families who complain about
how hard it is in life,'' Thunander said. ``Their lives have never
even come close to mine because my life has never even come close
to being normal. I would do anything to turn back time and wish I
had had a normal life and not to have had to live through all the
hardships growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I grew up too long in fear. Now, I don't fear anything.
There's nothing else for me to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after he moved to Norman this summer from
his hometown of Lee's Summit, Mo., and before he reported for
Sooners football practice in August, Thunander already had visited
the nearby Oklahoma School for the Deaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted those kids to know that they can do anything they
want to do because I've made it,'' said Thunander, whose speech,
though paced, is surprisingly crisp for one who was
hearing-impaired at birth. ``And I want to be the proof _ because
sometimes you have to see it to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not help everybody. But I want to give the drive and
determination to believe they can do whatever they put their mind
to to at least one person. And I've told our coaches that whenever
there is a community service thing that involves kids, I want to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Thunander's visit to the school didn't surprise
Tony Willis, a former speech pathologist and special education
teacher in language arts with the Lee's Summit school district who
first began working with Eric when he was a moody, underachieving
student in the sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric has probably moved further than any student I have ever
worked with,'' Willis said. ``I will say I'm a little nervous about
this college experience. But I believe it is going to be very good
for him. I just hope he continues to use all the skills he has,
because he's very capable, a very intelligent young man. Sometimes
I forget Eric is deaf because he is so articulate.'' \Nsubheds:No
limits to potential Thunander represents more than just a nice
story on the perimeter of the Sooners football program. Though his
character and determination were factors, OU recruited the
6-foot-2, 225-pound linebacker because he was a player. Thunander,
who also ran on his high school's 1,600-meter relay team that set a
state record, has a slot on all the OU special teams and is listed
No. 2 at outside linebacker for OU's opener Saturday against
Indiana State.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the talent to be an All-American before it's all said
and done,'' said co-defensive coordinator Brent Venables, who left
a job at Kansas State to join new OU coach Bob Stoops' staff. ``And
I say that having worked with two All-Americans (Jeff Kelly, Mark
Simoneau) the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   On the field, Thunander does not wear his twin hearing aids. He
communicates by reading lips or through hand signals. Members of
the secondary will occasionally move him one way or the other if he
doesn't immediately pick up an adjustment after the offense has
broken the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't notice the limitation of his hearing at all,''
Stoops said. ``Eric is extremely bright learning what he's supposed
to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his hearing aids, Thunander sits in the middle of his
classrooms. Though he can't hear high-pitched sounds very clearly,
he likes music. Metallica is his favorite group.
</P>
<P>
   Venables said he believes Thunander has a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy athletically is the real deal,'' Venables said.
``He's one of the top guys I have. He'll be a great player because
of how driven he is. You might find someone who is as driven as
this guy, but you won't find anyone who is more driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Venables and others marvel at Thunander's work ethic. He moved
to Norman on June 18 and paid for his own living expenses. He got a
job at a local bank. After hours, he worked out with his new
teammates, then went home armed with videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already earned the respect of his teammates,'' Venables
said. ``Whatever's in the dictionary under role model, Eric's
picture is probably right next to it. And I say that very
sincerely.''
</P>
<P>
   Long days are nothing new. While in high school, after either
football or track practice, Thunander worked at a grocery store _
frequently until midnight or later _ to help buy food and pay
family bills. Then, he studied and caught a few hours sleep before
starting over again.
</P>
<P>
   Athletics became a release, an escape. At first, however,
football was more a way to strike back at life's hand than
something he did for the pure enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger, I'd take my aggressions out on the
football field,'' Thunander said. ``That was my way of (hitting
back) for a while, until about my junior year, when I started
playing for fun.'' \Nsubheds:Finding refuge Thunander finally broke
away from his family when he was a sophomore in high school. He
first lived with his head football coach, then in a foster home
during his junior and senior years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a point where I wanted to get control over my own
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was always depressed. I took a lot of abuse from my
mother's second husband. He was a drug dealer and a gun dealer. I
thought that stuff was normal _ because I was always around it _
but now I know it's wrong. I also know it's wrong to beat a kid,
because I've taken a lot of beatings.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric said he never hit back because he was afraid he'd be kicked
out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother's third husband wasn't as bad,'' he said. ``He would
hit me occasionally for something I did. Most families would just
send their kids to their room.''
</P>
<P>
   Thunander found the support and the positive male role models in
three people _ Willis, high school football coach Mike Spiegel and
in Dick Mathews, his girlfriend's father. Thunander is still in
contact with all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to me growing up was having these people who cared,''
he said. ``There were times when I needed help, and they were there
for me. My mother hardly ever was.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never showed up for the football games. She never came to
any of my track meets. I won all these awards. I was inducted into
the National Honor Society and she wasn't there. It used to hurt a
lot. But these other people started being there, and that was the
greatest feeling in the world _ just to have someone there for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition to a world of kindness didn't always come easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My coach helped me so much,'' Thunander said. ``But one time
when was I (living with Spiegel's family), I did something wrong
and he was coming at me to talk to me (face to face so Eric could
read his lips). I put my hands up because I thought he was going to
hit me. Because that's what I was used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathews hired Eric to work at his electrical contracting firm
after the grocery offered him only a 15-cent-an-hour raise.
Thunander says their relationship is much like father and son, as
are the bonds between him and Willis and Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is a great kid,'' Mathews said. ``He's come a million
miles from where he was when we first met him, but that's a
situation we don't look back at.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the strides, the attitude change, the looking forward
to life and putting the past behind is tremendous to see. If over
the next four years he can accomplish what he has the past four
years _ getting over the steppingstones he's gotten over _ Eric
will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Thunander says he no longer communicates with his mother. But he
understands she has found help for her depression and that a
younger brother and sister have moved back in with her after
spending some time in a group home.
</P>
<P>
   Eric shares his troubled past with surprising candor. But he
says that finally being able to talk about his problems helped him
overcome them. He advises other youngsters who have suffered from
some kind of childhood abuse to do the same, however hard it might
be initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would advise them to talk to someone about it,'' Thunander
said. ``To never hide their feelings. You'll eat yourself up if you
hide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a lot of things (that happened) were my fault and
they never were. Because I was able to go to the people I've talked
about, it made me feel better about myself because they were
supportive and they wanted to help me in any way they could.''
</P>
<P>
   Thunander is determined to repay the favor in kind, and in
kindness. nn

INJURIES LEAVE TEXAS TECH'S OFFENSE IN DISARRAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, the continued success of a Texas Tech football program
that has won at least six games per year for the past six seasons
swings precariously in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   That can be the only conclusion to draw from yesterday's medical
updates that foreshadow rough sledding ahead for the Red Raiders'
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Ricky Williams, the team's Heisman Trophy candidate, is
out for Saturday's game at Louisiana-Lafayette. A magnetic
resonance imaging test showed a severe sprain to the anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee. Further tests have been ordered
for later this week, after the swelling subsides, to determine
when, or if, Williams can return.
</P>
<P>
   Williams already is listed as doubtful for Tech's Sept. 18 game
against North Texas, with a best-case scenario for his return
likely to be the team's Big 12 opener against Texas A&AMP;M on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see this happen for Ricky, and I hate it for our
team,'' Tech coach Spike Dykes said. ``This is a big blow to our
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   And the blows keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Sammy Morris, a standout blocker who doubles as the
team's best pass receiver, is doubtful for Saturday because of a
bone bruise in his right shoulder. Right guard Jason May (sprained
knee) won't play Saturday and right tackle Matt Heider (hamstring)
is doubtful. That's four offensive starters, all expected to be out
this week with tenuous timetables for their respective returns.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news on the Tech injury front is that none of the
three players who underwent MRIs after getting hurt in Monday's
31-13 loss to Arizona State _ Williams, Morris and May _ have been
scheduled for season-ending surgery. None have been ruled out for
longer than this week, although Tech officials concede they may be
looking at a long-term absence from Williams if additional tests
are not more encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, in turn, does not sound like someone who expects
immediate playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens, I'm still thankful for the chance to
come back,'' said Morris, a senior who missed the 1997 and 1998
seasons because of academic ineligibility. ``I hope to be back as
soon as I can. But my shoulder hurts real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   How much will the Raiders miss Williams, who rushed for 1,582
yards last season, and Morris, who has career averages of 7.4 yards
per carry and 18.1 yards per catch?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're about 85 or 90 percent of our offense,'' quarterback
Rob Peters said. ``We need to have those guys out there. They're
huge keys for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mix in the loss of two starting offensive linemen, said Peters,
and, ``That's going to make it tough on us. I hope those guys mend
and get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Until they do, the Tech ground game rests in the hands of
tailbacks Rickey Hunter, James Easterling and Shaud Williams. They
have combined for 472 rushing yards in Division I-A, with 336 of
that from Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Easterling, a Crowley High School graduate, was listed No. 1 on
yesterday's depth chart but coaches said all three will probably
play. Shaud Williams, an incoming freshmen, led Tech rushers
against Arizona State with five carries for 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need our No. 1 guys back, but it's not bleak behind them,''
Peters said. ``Shaud Williams can play at this level, no question.
I think we've got the people who can fill some holes.''
</P>
<P>
   For the short term, that may be true. But if the injuries to
Tech's starting running backs linger into October, look for the Red
Raiders' record to take a beating once they begin facing Big 12
teams on a weekly basis.
spotlight
Duane A. Laverty After seeing the success the walk-on program had
at Nebraska when he was an assistant, Kevin Steele hopes to do the
same at Baylor.
Baylor trying to build top walk-on program
Having cut his coaching teeth on the staff at Nebraska, where the
Cornhuskers traditionally have more walk-ons than scholarship
players suited for practices, Baylor coach Kevin Steele has sought
to emulate that model in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   He has aggressively spread the word that extra bodies are
welcome at practice, above the NCAA-mandated limit of 85
scholarship players. Steele said the response, thus far, has been
``beyond my expectations, considering this is a private school.''
</P>
<P>
   As allowed under NCAA rules, Steele welcomed 20 walk-ons during
two-a-days. When classes began in August, 32 more volunteers
arrived, giving the Bears 137 players for daily workouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest boost to building the Bears' walk-on efforts may
have come in last week's 30-29 loss to Boston College. The Bears'
first touchdown under Steele was scored by wide receiver Lanny
O'Steen, a former walk-on from Keller who was put on scholarship in
August. O'Steen, a redshirt freshman, recovered a fumble in the end
zone after teammate Melvin Barnett lost the handle near the Eagles'
goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to building a non-scholarship program is making sure
that, if one of those guys does contribute, you'd better give that
guy a scholarship,'' Steele said. ``With Lanny, we were already
lacking depth at wide receiver and we had two scholarships
available. When we sorted things out at the end of two-a-days, he
was still in the mix. We decided we'd have a hard time recruiting
another wide receiver to do as well as he was doing as a freshman
next year. So, he earned a scholarship. And that sent the message
that, if you're a walk-on and you play your way into the mix, we'll
reward you.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele said fullback Chris Crosby, a freshman from Bellevue,
Wash., has caught his eye since joining the squad after the start
of classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From his first day of practice, he's been blocking folks
better than most guys we've got out there,'' Steele said.
QUICK HITS \Nsubheds:Gimme four Texas wide receiver Montrell
Flowers displayed what will become his signature touchdown salute _
a high four, rather than a high five _ after grabbing a 54-yard
scoring strike in last week's 69-17 rout of Stanford. For the
speedy sophomore from Dallas, four fingers held aloft in the end
zone represents a tribute to his grandfather, Robert Flowers, who
died on Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Before his death, Robert Flowers asked Montrell to flash four
digits after touchdowns as a show of solidarity between the player,
his maternal grandparents and his mother, who raised Montrell as a
single parent with help from her parents, Robert and Frances
Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a victory, that we bonded together,''
Flowers said of his end-zone salute. ``It symbolizes, `I made it.'
'' \Nsubheds:Late-arrving Raiders Suffering multiple injuries to
key players, not to mention a 31-13 loss to Arizona State, will not
cause Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes to adjust his longstanding
policy of traveling on game day _ when feasible _ for night games
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in five days, the Red Raiders' travel plans
include a morning flight on game day for Saturday's 7 p.m. contest
at Louisiana-Lafayette. After the contest, the team will fly back
to Lubbock in order to allow players to sleep in their own beds
that night.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes' theory is to minimize disruption in established routines
and to eliminate potential distractions involved with travel
logistics. The practice is unique, but there is no arguing with the
results. Tech is 7-1 when traveling on game days, with the lone
loss on Monday night to Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Under Dykes, Tech has enjoyed triumphant, late-night return
flights from venues such as Texas (1997), Baylor (1997), Oklahoma
State (1989) and New Mexico (1995, 1990).
</P>
<P>
   But the longest game-day flight the team has taken was Monday
night to Arizona State, where players struggled to adapt in the
105-degree heat. Several players, including defensive end Devin
Lemons, had stomach troubles or suffered from dehydration during
the game. Tech prepares to embark on its second-longest, game-day
flight under Dykes, to hot, humid Louisiana, where the Raiders will
be without star tailback Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that \Rlate arrival in Arizona\S was any factor
in the outcome,'' Dykes said. ``I think we lack a little
conditioning and we probably played a few guys too long. Getting
there a day ahead of time wouldn't have made any difference. I like
what we're doing and it's been good for us.'' \Nsubheds:Early
believers Oklahoma has not enjoyed a winning season since 1993. The
Sooners will be playing for their fourth coach in six years when
they open Saturday night at home against Indiana State. Yet, the
team still received 14 votes this week in The Associated Press' Top
25 poll.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the phenomenon, first-year coach Bob Stoops
said: ``I can't. It may be related to having a new coaching staff
in place. I don't know. Hopefully, by the end of the year, we can
live up to that and pick up some more votes. I'd like to be a team
that's in \Rthe Top 25\S at the end of the season.''

STARS COACH HITCHCOCK SHEDS A PAINFUL LIFE WITH POUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ This was how Stars' coach Ken Hitchcock rewarded
himself for winning the Stanley Cup: Pain.
</P>
<P>
   Lots and lots of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after that fateful night of June 19 in
Buffalo, when the Stars brought the Cup home to Texas, Hitchcock
secretly checked himself into Baylor Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   He used an assumed name because this was a private battle, one
that needed no headlines, no film at 11, no nightly updates on
``Sports Center.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the surgery that was performed on July 2, wasn't
something Hitchcock even felt comfortable talking about publicly
because, for the most part, his war against obesity has been fought
behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It is an intensely personal struggle, fought hand-to-mouth,
every day, every hour, every minute. You win a battle here, lose
one there, hoping to survive and fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   Always, the unforgiving, merciless scales are there to report
how the conflict is progressing.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock ``is'' winning the war. Since topping out at almost
500 pounds five years ago, he has lost more than 200 pounds. That's
what necessitated the first surgical procedure he has ever
undergone just under 10 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a complicated 91/2 hour operation, doctors made two separate
incisions, each completely encircling Hitchcock's abdomen, and
removed 30 pounds of dead skin and tissue. They also discovered and
repaired a hernia no one knew was even there.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's attitude was positive: He approached the surgery and
the six weeks of pain-filled recovery that followed as a reward,
not so much for winning the Cup, but for the major progress he has
made over the past five years. From almost eating himself to death,
he has become husband, father and one of the premier coaches in the
NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd made a lifestyle change and I really felt like I'd earned
the right to have this take place,'' said Hitchcock, 47. ``I'd
reached a plateau physically and I needed to take the next step.
This was the next natural step. It was something that had to be
done, physically.''
</P>
<P>
   He sat at an outdoor cafe, enjoying the cool mountain air just
before dark the second day into camp, wearing a gray sweatshirt and
loose-fitting athletic shorts. He'd just finished a long walk, his
second of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning here at 5:30 he joins half a dozen other Stars
coaches and front-office officials for a 25-minute walk to a local
fitness center. They work out for an hour, walk back and, after
showers, reconvene for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you'd have had to be where Hitchcock was 200 pounds ago to
understand just how good it makes him feel to be able to do this
and so many other things he didn't think he'd ever do again in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things that you think about at the end of the day,''
Hitchcock said, ``and you say to yourself, `Jeez, I did this
today.' When you're a confident individual, you seem to make a lot
of right decisions at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for Hitchcock, never at a loss for words, it is difficult
explaining how much better he feels, both physically and
emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some scary times afterward for me,'' Hitchcock
admitted. ``It was a hard fight, because you're dealing with
discomfort every minute, every second of every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a process of going through it. It's something I feel I
could do again. I feel mentally stronger. I feel like, `Man, I went
through a lot.' I can deal with a lot now.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing the dead weight has given Hitchcock the energy to
increase his workouts and he's started to lose pounds again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this burning desire to be a healthy person,'' he said.
``I don't eat carelessly (he ordered a turkey-vegetable wrap for
dinner that night). I have my cravings, like anybody else, but I've
learned how to live, I've learned to change my eating habits, I
train and work out. From a physical and overall health perspective,
this was really important.''
</P>
<P>
   More important even, than winning a Stanley Cup. For Hitchcock,
it was never about the hardware anyway. It was always about the
quest to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything away from what we accomplished,
because it's a great accomplishment, but my thrill comes from
watching people come together,'' he said. ``I've got rings and
trophies and I don't know what drawer they're in. They're not
hanging on walls. That's not who I am. I love watching, developing
and helping people come together. It doesn't matter what level,
that's the fuel. If your team is bareass naked _ no politics, no
hidden agendas, no defense mechanisms up _ you can perform at a
very high level. That's what pushes my buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   At heart, Hitchcock is a teacher. Next to his family, it's what
he loves most in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult time I'll have is when someone tells me,
`Hitch, you can't teach any more.' The wins, the losses, the
awards, the Stanley Cup, that's all window dressing. The day
somebody tells me I can't do that anymore will be a very tough day
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock had an emotionally tough day two years ago in the
playoffs. When Edmonton coach Ron Lowe told his players, ``The Fat
Man wants us, he's got us!'' Hitchcock never blinked, but he nearly
bled to death inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're unbelievable at masking that stuff, but that cut
big-time deep,'' Hitchcock said. ``When you're walking down the
road and somebody whispers something, you pretend you don't hear
it, but you hear it. You learn to block it out instead of using it
to motivate yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's comment, though, cut Hitchcock like none other ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing because it drew other people into the
fight,'' Hitchcock said. ``All of a sudden the fans are in the
fight, the media's in the fight, and (Lowe) has to defend himself
and it's all because of how I look physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe later apologized ``in his own way'' but Hitchcock always
blamed himself more than the man who had made the insensitive
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back on it, I'm more disappointed in my
stubbornness in not addressing the (obesity) situation earlier,''
Hitchcock said. ``I should never have put myself in that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the life I have now and if I hadn't done something
to change, I would have thrown it all away. I wouldn't have an
opportunity to sit here in Vail. I wouldn't have had a chance to go
to Dallas. I wouldn't have my family. Some days I just shake my
head and say, `You stupid ass.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Hitchcock has made so much progress in his journey back
from obesity, he now serves as a benchmark for others fighting the
same battle. He gets 10 to 15 phone calls a year from people
needing help. He tries to share his own experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back and the lesson that I've learned is, when you have
to make a change, you have to make that change 100 percent or it
never works,'' he said. ``You can't play catchup. You can't tell
yourself, `Oh, I ate five hamburgers today, but I'll catch up
tomorrow.' It won't work. You get in and you stick with it and go
the best route you can and never allow yourself to play catchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you understand that you're in a daily battle and
you're prepared to live in that daily battle, you're fine. But if
you think you're not in it, and you're on the outside and you say,
`I don't have that problem and I don't have to worry about it,'
you're just hiding your head in the sand. Eventually you're going
to gain all the weight back.''
</P>
<P>
   Like alcoholics, Hitchcock said, people with eating disorders
have to learn to like themselves again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that I'm important,'' Hitchcock said. ``I'm
important to me. I've got a family and I've got to take care of
them. I've got obligations there. I can't afford not to be good to
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goals are small ones and for some people they might be
humorous, but they're mine. I've started to lift weights and to be
able to do that and structure my body back is a goal. I want to be
able to run, to jog. I can run a hundred yards maybe. But to be
able to jog around the track a few times, that's going to be
tremendous. That's a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Hitchcock understands that he hasn't won the war and
probably never will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never going to be over,'' he said. ``It's always going to
be a part of my life, part of my legacy, part of who I am and who I
was. But the nicest part about it now is that people are judging me
on the job that I do as a husband, as a father, as a hockey coach
and as a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's pretty cool.'' nn

KARALAHTI CAN'T CROSS FINNISH LINE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When Jere Karalahti signed with the Los
Angeles Kings in July, it gave the 24-year-old Finnish defenseman
two months to prepare for his first NHL training camp, and two
months to prepare for his move to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With a 1996 arrest for heroin possession on his record, it was
clear from the day Karalahti signed that special efforts would be
required to enable him to enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But as training camp's fourth day concluded Wednesday, Karalahti
remained in Finland, unable to join his new team because of
difficulty obtaining a work visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new,'' said Don Baizley, Karalahti's agent.
``The expectation is we'll hear by the end of the week. Obviously,
we're hoping and expecting things will be resolved favorably by
that time. But we won't know until the end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings general manager Dave Taylor sounded a bit annoyed by the
situation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we'd like to have him,'' Taylor said of the 1993
sixth-round draft choice. ``I think (Karalahti) understood back in
July (when he signed) what was required. Unfortunately, it's
dragged on, but we have to deal with it. With his history, we were
aware there could be some complications. ... If you have a prior
record, as he does, my understanding is you need a waiver. He
doesn't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have gone to great lengths to add Karalahti to their
roster because he has been considered in recent years one of the
best players in the world not playing in the NHL. After his arrest,
Karalahti reportedly underwent eight months of drug therapy, and
tests since his arrest have shown him to be heroin free.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are protected in the event Karalahti is unable to
enter the United States. His one-year, $700,000 contract contains a
$200,000 reporting bonus, the other $500,000 to be paid for
playing. Taylor said that assuming Karalahti ultimately is able to
join the Kings, he does not anticipate difficulty when Karalahti
has to make trips with the team across the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more a U.S. issue,'' Taylor said. ``He is working for a
U.S. club, and will be paid in U.S. dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   __ First scrimmage: After three days of drills, the Kings held
their first scrimmage Wednesday, with Team B defeating Team A, 5-4.
Goal scorers for Team B were Aki Berg, Bryan Smolinski, Steve
McKenna, Glen Murray and Donald MacLean. Scoring for Team A were
Ziggy Palffy, Luc Robitaille, Len Barrie and Kevin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Andy Murray, who watched from the stands at Iceoplex, said
he liked what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenged a couple of players pretty assertively (before
the game) because I wasn't happy with them,'' Murray said without
naming names. ``It's nice to see you can challenge them and they
raise the level of their play.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: All-Star defenseman Mattias Norstrom remains
unsigned and is at not camp. Taylor said he and agent Don Meehan
have been speaking every day. ``We've had discussions and are going
to continue to work at it,'' Taylor said. ``But we don't have a
deal yet.'' ... Right wing Scott Thomas, destined for a
minor-league assignment, suffered a right knee injury during the
scrimmage. The extent was not disclosed. ... Murray said he plans
to trim his roster Sunday. ... The Kings open exhibition play
Saturday in Las Vegas against Phoenix and Tuesday at the Forum
against Colorado, both games at 7:30 p.m., both televised by Fox
Sports West.

TEXAS MOTOR SPEEDWAY ADDS WEEKEND ON NEW COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A fourth weekend of racing, featuring exotic
prototype and production-based sports cars of the American Le Mans
Series, has been booked for a road course to be constructed at
Texas Motor Speedway for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The ALMS-sanctioned Grand Prix of Texas is scheduled for Sept.
2, the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, on a road course that will be
carved through the east side of the track's sprawling infield. Like
the Daytona International Speedway, the road-course at TMS also
will incorporate portions of the 1.5-mile quad-oval and its
24-degree banked turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most asked question we get here is, `When are you going to
build a road course?' '' said Eddie Gossage, executive vice
president and general manager of TMS. ``There's a lot of
road-racing fans here and I answer e-mails every day about a road
course. We've decided to go ahead and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ALMS road race _ which Gossage plans to run primarily at
night _ will be the only single-day, stand-alone package on the
2000 TMS calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennzoil World of Outlaws, NASCAR Busch Grand National and
NASCAR Winston Cup Series are scheduled to open the season March
30-April 2. The renamed DIRECTV 500 Winston Cup race is set for
April 2, and will be preceded by the Texas 300 Busch GN race on
April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Outlaws' inaugural Spring Sprint Classic is scheduled for
March 30-31 on a four-tenths-mile dirt track that will be
constructed north of the speedway's offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Pep Boys Indy Racing League and NASCAR's Craftsman Truck
Series will compete on the 1.5-mile speedway June 8-10. The trucks
will run the Pronto Auto Parts 400 on June 9 under the lights, with
the IRL's Longhorn 500 night race scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Outlaws, Craftsman Truck series and IRL will be showcased
during the final race weekend Oct. 12-15. The Outlaws will compete
in the Texas World Finals Oct. 12 and 14. NASCAR's trucks will run
in the Bluebonnet 300 on Oct. 13 and the IRL's Lone Star 500 is
booked for Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said TMS' season-ticket package will cover the same six
races as in 1999 _ the NASCAR Winston Cup/Busch events and the two
IRL and Craftsman Truck races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Season-ticket holders don't have to buy tickets to the
American Le Mans Series, don't have to buy tickets to the World of
Outlaws,'' Gossage said during a news conference at The Speedway
Club. Season-ticket packages go on sale today at 9 a.m. at the
speedway, which continues to diversify its racing menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have events,'' said Gossage, who has signed a
three-year contract with the ALMS. ``We are first and foremost an
oval track that runs Winston Cup and Indy-cars. We don't want to
lose that focus, but we want to be able to offer a little bit of
everything to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said the design and length of the road-course, and the
distance of the ALMS race that will be run upon it, has yet to be
decided. Most events in the fledgling ALMS series are contested in
three hours or less. nn

BAYLOR TO BEAR DOWN ON RUSHING DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Baylor's defensive difficulties against the run
have ceased to be news.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears surrendered 275 rushing yards a game in 1997. They
improved an average of 61 yards last season, but ranked 98th in
Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new coaching staff in town. But has anything changed?
</P>
<P>
   Not measured by the 350 rushing yards the Bears surrendered in a
30-29 overtime loss to Boston College on Saturday. The Bears in]
hadn't given up that much since being for 410 yards by Nebraska in
'97.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed?'' Baylor defensive tackle Dwight Johnson
asked. ``After our first loss, we're not down. We're really
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   A new coaching staff does a lot for attitude, and perhaps
Johnson's outlook is testament to that factor. But new coach Kevin
Steele maintains there is nothing wrong with Baylor's defense that
smarts can't fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play better run defense,'' Steele said. ``The
positive thing is (against Boston College) it was not the calls,
not the plan. We just needed to see things full speed. We need to
eliminate the mental errors and the alignment mistakes, which we
can do. When I first came off the field, I thought we were
manhandled a little more than we had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele will be looking for improvement in Saturday's home opener
against Nevada-Las Vegas, though Wednesday's suspension of senior
defensive end Charles Foster robs the Bears of front-line depth.
Help may be on the way, however. Senior defensive tackle James
Calvin is expected to return to the lineup for the Big 12
Conference opener against Oklahoma on Sept. 18. He underwent
arthroscopic knee surgery three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of urgency after the last snap of the
(Boston College) game,'' Baylor defensive coordinator Andrea
``Brick'' Haley said. ``I do see us being a pretty good defense.
The kids believe in what we're doing; they understand what's going
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not backing down from anyone, not changing anything. We
have a plan, and we're going to work it. This is a great league for
running backs. We need to make it a great league for Baylor's
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley said he takes blame for Boston College's inflated rushing
total, chalking it up to halftime adjustments he made that weren't
carried out. Boston College gained 142 yards rushing in the first
half and 208 in the second half. And Haley points out that 350
yards rushing often means a 50-point game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about all this is all the things we saw are
correctable, and that's a positive,'' Haley said. ``We've got them
playing hard. The key is to get them playing smart.''
